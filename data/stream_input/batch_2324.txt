B002TVQ4HG|2.0|Before watching this movie I had such high expectations that this would be a good psychological thriller.  I was very disappointed.  This movie is more creepy then psychological, its not even good for a slasher movie.  The only reason it got 2 stars instead of the 1 it deserves is that I found the star very interesting, but not interesting enough to keep me interested in this movie, did not even finish it.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|I am a Huge fan of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings Books...This movie did not disappoint me!!!
B00APUQT7I|1.0|I ordered this movie because of the pirates on the cover and thought my 4 yr old son 6 yr old daughter would like it. I knew it wasn't going to be fantastic since the best part of ice age movies is the cute nut chasing character. It was so boring and my whole family lost interest in 10 minutes.
B009X011UQ|4.0|This cover is just what I wanted--lightweight.  Doesn't fit quite as snug as I thought it would, but sufficient.  Stand up back works well.  Charging while using can be a problem, but doable.  Seems to protect quite well.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I would always recommend reading a Danielle Steel book.  She is one of the best authors.<br />Read this book on my kindle - loved it.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|No strings attached won't blow you away, but was an enjoyable romantic comedy. My girlfriend got into it and was certainly a fan.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We LOVE LOVE LOVED this movie!! We rented it on amazon and must have watched  it 6 times. My 4yr old son was acting out parts and 6 yr old girl was too. I didn't get tired of it and was sad when our rental was up. Ill be buying at the store today! It was a true original.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|It's Fabulous!  Loved the movie and love the music!  I can hardly wait to get the movie when it ships!
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|This movie had me dying laughing. Its a must see and you can watch it more than once and still laugh. Its worth buying.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Pretty funny and may even be considered good for what is intended – give you laughs and some thinking, I suppose
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love it!!<br />I saw it in the theaters, and the 3d bluray is just as amazing. I would recommend this to everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the NIV version and this app very easy find the versus I want and go to them.  It has been a blessing to be able to look up God's word easily where ever I may be.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is spectacular! i heart how the hair looks so realistic. you can create so many hairstyles! this is a fun, creative game that is great whenever.  i love, love, love! all i have to say is awesome. totally awesome.  well, see ya! : )
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun,  but there are some technical problems.  Sometimes when I try to load a game,  it just goes back to the menu.)
B005K17RU0|4.0|This App allows the user to install a Home-Screen Widget that is good but it could be better. When trying to check the 5-day forecast you have to sort through multiple screens, it would be much better if the user could set some defaults for the information you want to view. I do like the ease of viewing through use of appropriate colors and backgrounds.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book.  It is such a wonderful story of orphans from two generations and how their friendship made a difference in each of their lives.  I enjoyed learning more about what it must have been like for the children on the orphan trains at time in history.  This is the first book I have read by this author but it sure won't be my last.
B003VANOFY|1.0|The headset itself, when it is working, is actually really good. The problem is that the drivers have a conflict with USB 3 motherboards, which is a lot of motherboards and logitech doesn't seem to be able to fix it.  That or they just don't care!<br /><br />Sometimes you turn your computer on and the headset wireless dongle picks up and all is mostly well. I'll explain the mostly well in a moment.  Other times you turn on your computer and the wireless connector isn't recognised.  I have found that plugging the dongle into other ports and restarting the computer sometimes has the system suddenly recognise the headset again and you can use it - mostly...  Other times I have just had to re-install the software to get the system to recognise the USB wireless dongle...<br /><br />When the headset is usable it sounds great and works a charm while it's working.  But it has a tendency to simply drop out and turn itself off (some people on the Logitech forums are complaining that there is a time-out that activates but I can't confirm that that is a problem with the Headphones turning off.)  So in the middle of a game suddenly your headset isn't working...  after a lot of messing around and reading forums I found that an older set of drivers is better, but not 100%.<br /><br />In general - Don't buy this headset if you have USB 3 on your motherboard as the fix logitech suggests doesn't always work - (moving the usb port as far away as you can from the USB 3 port didn't help me.)<br /><br />Don't buy this Headset if you have other wireless devices in the 2.4mhz range...  My phones are in the 5 mhz range and are ok  but is seems that my wireless modem might be the reason the wireless dongle just drops out so often.  Also if you have a motherboard that uses Realtek audio then that MIGHT be part of the conflict as I have noticed a lot of people on the forums that are having problems are using realtek onboard audio...  I'm going to try a sound card so I can get away from the onboard audio and see if that helps.<br /><br />While it's a great quality headset when it's working the problems are so annoying i wish i'd never brought it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i love this game and yes it is true that it is very addicting and it is also true that if you dont have this game then you are missing out so get it i love how it never getta boring and keeps you going
B004K58GSO|5.0|Quality of the video was good, classic movie I could watch over and over. I highly recommend this movie for western movie fans.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|crude humor, but nonetheless FUNNY&#62;&#62;FUNNY&#62;&#62;&#62;FUNNY&#62;you got to see it. but keep it in mind VERY CRUDE HUMOR. Do not watch it with kids
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie was inspirational. My youngest loved the animals, especially the tiger. My oldest didn't like the movie. He thought it was weird.
B005PM3YII|5.0|A stunning read with life like characters.  Definitely worthwhile and especially the memorable conclusion to the trilogy. I loved it.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|One must plow through this story to get to the meat. Jane Austen would have moved on at a better pace, me thinks!
1878424319|4.0|This is was simple read in a few hours but the informtion impacted me greatly!!! After all don't take anything personally! This I will live by for a very long time to come
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I bought this cd for my son as a surprise gift and he was thrilled! Packing, shipping, everything was spot one!! Thank you!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|After 'Final Empire' I couldn't wait to read Book 2 and was most definitely not disappointed.  The characters are so likeable.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is a delightful,happy,sad ,intriging and imaginative story. Characters are well developed and suprising. It captures the reader from the beginning to the very last page. I recommend it for everyone.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|to get the whole harry potter movie collection in one, and on blu ray for that matter, was incredible. great quality and the shipping process was fine. thanks.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|As soon as I got it I used on my Ipad and it was MARVELOUS, it´s like having a virtual sharpie. It also worked with my Sony Ericsson smartphone.<br />Cosmonaut is the perfect thing to transform your ipad to a sketch board in an easy way.<br />I absolutely love it<br /><br />and the packaging is very beautiful.
B004N622EY|5.0|I chose this book because I read Brandon Sanderson's Wheel of Time book 13 and was most impressed.  His characters have substance and he isn't afraid to kill them off, which adds shock value.  A really good read from start to finish.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Wow! I know this is an old group, but they have put out a great album! I look forward to more music videos from these guys! Some of my favorite singers (like MC) have been disappointing lately, but these guys were a great find!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is good for logical thinking in a fun colorful way.  Encourages connecting the dots in the most direct route possible so you conflict with other lines.  Good for thinking skills
B0089LOKHG|3.0|It felt like it was rushed, to fit the \\"trilogy\\". I was a litte disappointed especially since the first book was so awesome. I feel lile this story would have done better flowing naturally instead of having to fit into a specific number. Still a good read and ending for the characters
B008CP6RWU|4.0|My son borrowed from the library and then asked me to buy it. He loved it! The music was very nice too. :)
0307744434|5.0|My pulse significantly increased as I was getting more anxious and nervous while reading the final couple of chapters, as I was getting close to the end,I really wished it lasts forever . Post The Night circus depression struck me as soon as I turned the last page.<br /><br />The Night circus is the best Novel I have ever read, it is addictive ,mystical ,enchanting and pushes your Imagination beyond its limit,it simply engulf you between its folds and sometimes it takes a moment from you after you stop reading it, to register which world is true, and which world you really wish to live in!,,<br /><br />Few types of readers will give it a 5 stars rating, fortunately,I belong to those readers , call them truth seekers, deep thinkers, beyonders or whatever you call them.<br /><br />The story end is satisfactory for readers who think it is concerned about Celia and Marco, and who are interested in the circus itself as the reveurs ,and for those who like the competition ,, and for the type of readers that is not interested in any,, their interest is far beyond those things, their interest in in the core of the theme of the book, in what is written between the lines ,in parts between the chapters,..few will relate.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I would recomend this to any Garbage fans out there.  This latest CD is the best they ever had done.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|A great book that helps you recover from the stressors of living to enjoying life. This book will make you reflect and appreciate what truly is important.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Yes, Cyndi Lauper pun intended. Through my first 20 or so listen through this cd, both Lauper and Madonna frequently came to mind. Just finished watching Tegan & Sara perform &#34;time after time&#34; on utube. Brilliant performance and as they state in the post interview, &#34;heartthrob&#34; was indeed influenced by Cyndi Lauper among many others. I believe &#34;heartthrob&#34; puts a nice refreshing touch on the80's influences it borrows from. As many reviewers have stated, every song on here has the potential to be a huge hit! I have been a Tegan and Sara fan since the early days and yes this album is a complete departure from previous efforts. However who wants to hear the same thing over and over again? Seems unreasonable to think that bands ought to simply replicate previous efforts. I love this album and believe former fans and new listeners will find this album a perfect pop master piece!
030758836X|4.0|Read this book for book club.  What a twist it has.  Leaves you wondering about all the planning & future that they have together.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|This 3-disc deluxe edition is packed with videos from 2 concerts, radio performances, and music video. In addition it is so nice to have their amazing Live at the Moore concert on CD as well as DVD. Audio and video quality are awesome across all 3 discs. Great value! Great tribute to Baker and Layne. Love it!!!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is their best album ever! I'm a long time, huge fan (30 yrs), I've listened to all their songs thousands of times and I've always felt nostalgic about BC, MFTM and Violator, but clearly DM competes head to head with any of these. The more I keep listening to it, the more I think this is THE ONE.I'm glad they god rid of the guitars, there wasn't such a good experiment imo. The sound is what any real fan has been expecting from them since about 1998 (if not, 1990), LOL and then some: it will \\"penetrate your soul and bleed into your dreams\\", take you out of this world, where you'll start dreaming and wishing, then will bring you back and leave you floored, breathless, addicted and mesmerized. All songs are EXCEPTIONAL, no fillers, skippers, guitars... as I said, this is the real thing... but if I must make a top 10 it would be this:<br />1. Long Time Lie<br />2. Secret To The End<br />3. Should Be Higher<br />4. Welcome To My World<br />5. Heaven<br />6. Broken<br />7. Always<br />8. All That's Mine<br />9. Soothe My Soul<br />10.Slow<br />I hope the magic will keep on coming, they didn't mean the name of the last song and this isn't \\"the final chapter in the contract\\". Thank you Dave, thank you Martin, thank you Andy!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is really fun and I find myself playing for hours at a time! Very addicting I recomend it to kids and adults of all ages
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wow. That's all I can think after I finished this book. Wow. To say that this book is a masterpiece is falling miles short of what it really is. There are no words in english, spanish, french or any other language to describe this book. I'm not going to tell you &#34;You HAVE to read it!!!!&#34; That's something you have to decide for yourself. If you do decide to read it, I can guarantee you you've never read a book like this before and will never again.
B005FPT51K|4.0|I bought this camera because of the IPhone app and the almost 360 degree rotation. I love the camera except that I could not figure out how to access it from outside my home wifi. I plugged away trying different port forwarding and finally got it and it is great. It should not be so hard to get the info you need but despite all the hassle, I really love the camera.
B008CX2A2I|1.0|Although both the receiver and my iPhone recognize each other through the adapter, i can't get any sound. I got on Onkyo's site and blog and tried their suggestions to no avail. So I'm not impressed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The most action packed and thrilling season yet! Tons of twists and turns that keep you guessing week to week. Can't wait for season 4!
0061900656|5.0|Attractive pictures and focus on what my son's role will be in the birth of his little sibling. We don't know the gender, so we needed a gender-neutral book. This keeps him engaged and interested and is pleasant enough to read.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I'm glad to have access to Adobe Reader on my Kindle Fire...it makes several things easier.  Glad it's available to me now.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Was surprised at how well written and detailed the story is.  Will definitely read more from this author.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|A few laughs, a few good points about turning 40. Worth the rental once you've seen everything else, not much more.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|I saw the paid version of this and didn't want to buy anything. My friend showed me the free version and I was both disappointed and amazed<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />* If you have an invaluable item like dirt or wood, you can easily turn it into 5 stacks . of diamond<br />*You can see how many mobs of which kind are in your world. Very useful for mob hunting<br />*Can change location (x,y,z)<br />*You can change the gamemode and time of day<br />*Super easy to use for pocket edition. It connects automatically without any logins, internet, or crashing.<br /><br />Bad<br /><br />*When I downloaded it the first time, I got a error message that said , Unable to install, app has been corrupted. Wtf??<br />*Cant spawn any mobs. It should allow us to spawn at least chickens or zombies.<br /><br />Altogether, its a pretty cool app. I reccomend it to those who cant find a single diamond even if they stay up late trying.<br /><br />My hopes for the future are that they would add texture packs and skins. Its a great app though. no regrets installing it!!!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Awesome game, only it would be nice if you didn't have to get so many points to upgrade stuff. Really fun otherwise!
B00B99LIZ2|3.0|they should have cast Malin Ackerman instead of Kate Hudson.. I  love kate Hudson, but Malin would have been perfect.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Wow!!!! I thought that this was just a simple courtroom drama. The acting by Edward Norton was phenomenal as Aaron/Roy and the storyline itself was exceptional!! 5 well-deserved stars for this movie!
B00985E3UG|5.0|I had read a long review, including excerpts, of this book, so I figured it would be good.  It is even better than I thought.  It also has some useful tips to help get out of the traps.  A must read for all US citizens.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I couldn't stop talking about this amazing film after I saw it. It will leave you both smiling and heartbroken and wanting to embrace life!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|My grandson loves it!  I gave it a try and like it too.  Can be challenging!  I recommend to any age.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved the tension and excitement of this book.  The characters at all interesting and entertaining, so much that you care about them.  Abby and Travis are hot together!
B004LZFWJO|2.0|I want my money back.....This game has no challenge and gets very boring very fast. Got it for my son to compare to Candy Crush but there is no similarity at all. It is a game made for toddlers literatly.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book came to me highly recommended by my spouse and her best friend & her husband. So I had high expectations about all the 80's nostalgia. It didn't disappoint or distract from the storyline. I found the reading to be fun and entertaining.
0887431453|5.0|I have used these books with all 3 of my children and I have really loved them.  The books have changed throughout the years, but I have liked the changes.  The reason I like them is that the amount of writing is just right.  Kids can learn their colors, numbers and letters before they can write them.  I like that the book contains little writing and instead focuses on circling and a little bit of coloring.  I also like how the book is organized.  I pull one sheet from each color every time my son sits down to do the school work.  I also love the bright colors and pictures.  If a child does not know what a picture is than it is a good time to tell them what new things are.  My 3 yr old son begs to do school work.<br /><br />I started these books with all 3 of my kids at 3yrs old.  My 3 yr old son (who is almost 4) is now about 1/2 way through the kindergarten book.  All of my children seemed to have similiar pacing.  The transition between preschool and kind books are perfect.  As he has been able to do it all without struggling and little help (except reading the directions and covering new concepts).  I think the ages are not quite right though, but that does not really matter to me.  It is really geared for 3 to 4 yr olds and the kinder book should be finished before starting kindergarten as our kindergarten expects you to know everything in it.  After the kindergarten book there is a big gap which i am not sure how to fill (they need a transition between the Kinder and 1st grade book) as my son understands the concepts of reading and can sound out very simple words.  He is still a long way from reading fluently.  My other son is doing well in 1st grade and is just now finishing the 1st grade book.  The have made the kinder and preschool books more user friendly and actually easier, but along the way they jumped too much from one age level to the next.<br /><br />The preschool book is good for 3-4 yr olds<br />The kindergarten book is good for 4-5 yr olds<br />**School zone needs to make a book here!<br />The 1st grade book is good for 6-7 yr olds
1400067820|3.0|I like NN Talebs books, but this one was a slight disappointment. It was repetitive and rambling, and a drag to read due to the lack of proper editing. The ideas in it are good, as you would expect. But it proved far more of a drag to read because the author thought editors are fools (he states this in his books, sort of), with the result that his book is less readable then it would have be otherwise. Excessive macho posturing by the author gets on ones nerves after a while. Worth reading though
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was an amazing book I've ever read in my whole entire life it was amazing,good,and funny at the same time good job
B00BD4K4L2|5.0|Everyone knows that Live After Death is the go-to live release from Iron Maiden - but when I'm done with that setlist, I always fire up this beast of a live album.  This new version has the added benefit of remastering, and a slathering of encore tracks (typical Maiden encore songs, but enjoyable nonetheless).  Easily the second-best live album from this awesome band - nothing else would come close until Rock in Rio in 2000.  For those who have never sampled this disc, do it now!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I've been a huge Buffy fan for a long time now and can't believe it took me so long to finally watch Firefly. I figured it was just a one-season run, so why bother? Well, of course, I was wrong and was very pleased to see the Serenity full-length film after watching the series.<br /><br />I loved the extremely-improved CGI and general look of the film as compared to the TV series. Overall, I think it was a great idea to have made this film to follow up what was obviously another series cut down before it could really take off.<br /><br />If you have watched anything in Whedonverse before and have not seen this yet...get thee to a computer or DVD!
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a great set, however the company who sold it to me, stole money from me.. I wouldn't buy from them. But the DVD set is awesome and a lot of fun, and it has footage never seen anywhere else but on this set. If you love the Beatles then this is a must have for your collection!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great fun read.  Lot's of twists/turns.  Ending left me more than a tad disappointed.  Until then it was a fun roller-coaster ride but the ending fell flat.
0307744434|5.0|I loved The Night Circus! It had a little bit of everything in it and I would easily recommend this to anyone.
B006LRUVUA|2.0|I have used this product before and was pretty happy with it, but when I got it for my kindle I never could get in to use it.  It kept asking for some code that I didn't get.  Looked like I would have to pay for it to get the code, so I wasn't able to use it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want this app so bad but my parents are all like for seven dollars? no way! But anyway, this is a really good app so...... get it!
B0002EXH4K|5.0|If you're into American Metal, then Megadeth and in particular Countdown to Extinction is the album for you. Megadeth at their best
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Granddaughter like this very much she asked for it for her birthday.  She is very happy. To receive. It tor her birthday
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is hilarious! What a fun book to read. I could hardly put it down. I want to go back and read her first two.
B00633W614|5.0|I thought the character developement was fabulous.  I did not want the story to end.  Very well written.  the author just drew you into the story
B0002XDODU|5.0|If you are a Metal Head or if just love great, hard driving music along with some interesting ballads, then Reise, Reise is for you
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use and the hints are great. .The constant advertisements every time you start a new game is a little annoying.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I was so engrossed in the story, I rode pass my stop on the subway train.  Now thats SPELL BINDING!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Amazing start of a series at a pretty fair price. A must-have for any Walking Dead fan, and a good place to start for anyone trying to get into the show.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Another great album by the artists of Industrial Metal. Includes the, in my opinion, the great hits, Ich Will and Feuer Frei
B005MLOOJA|5.0|My recorder is supposed to be able to record 2-shows while  I watch something else but it does not.  Will only record one show from DirectV so I miss a lot of shows and have been very pleased to view them on Amazon Prime Video...
B000002W9Q|5.0|GREAT soundtrack, all the songs from the movie. Great to listen to as you are driving along and for anyone else that would like to hear it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|works very well, actually preferred it on my phone at first, but it runs smoothly and looks great on the bigger screen of my kindle.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Hard to follow. Audio not consistent - had to keep adjusting volume thru movie to hear properly. Odd musical type scenes without being a musical.  Costumes were amazing- fun to watch from that regard.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I love that this soundtrack  is THE music from the movie.  So often it's the radio version of the same songs, or over-edited, but this is (almost) the exact music from the movie! (Just redone in the studio).  LOVE IT!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|These gals are so funny, and the friendship is great to see, and if you're lucky<br />to have! I'd recommend this to anyone!
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I recently started getting into The Walking Dead, and before jumping on the bandwagon i wanted to familiarize myself with the series as a whole. the comics were a great place to start, and they are the real deal indeed. the only thing i was kind of confused about was that i thought there was more with the purchase, but i still came away satisfied with what i had gotten. pretty good deal overall.
B000Q66JXA|3.0|It's probably a little late to review this movie but let's do it anyway.<br /><br />The movie is at times laughable and not in a good way.  The script and direction is disjointed, the acting reaches great heights and serious lows, and the set design is very often rendered like something from the 1950's (meaning absolutely no insult to such masterpieces as \\"Forbidden Planet\\").  Yet I liked it.  Excalibur is not a definitive rendition of the Arthurian legend, but does incorporate important elements at least some that are often missing from other movies.
B004C3DLJ8|3.0|Every bit as good as the first two movies.  A little sad in a couple of points, but entertaining throughout.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Wonderful collection of music, and the brothers are great together.<br />The music is classic, and one to have in anyones collection. I would recommend<br />this to anyone. Thank you.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Surprising outcome to a delightful story with some surprisingly dark secrets uncovered.  Good reading.  Good characters. good people.  Simple reading.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This isn't the easiest book to read but the information is eye opening. The truth of wheat is revealed and all the additional healthy eating information is like an extra bonus. I will look at wheat products differently for the rest of my life and I look forward to maintaining a new, healthy, wheat free lifestyle.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My wife and our nieces thoroughly enjoyed the movie and watched it several times.  It is a keeper as I'm certain they will watch it again.
B0042816YK|5.0|Must see! This is a wonderful story, one that just about anyone going<br />through challenging times can relate to. Easy to warm up to !!!!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The film is fantastic; everything a fanboy would expect. Sadly, the ONLY option to purchase the Blu-ray comes combo'd with a DVD, which I do not need. I don't appreciate the extra cost of a format I do not need.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This movie is so inspirational! Anyone that enjoys action movies packed with suspense will like this movie. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Great game but no jetpack is more powerful then the others but I like it .very fun to play,you can play it 100 times and not get bored.it. never the same
B00197YZ7M|5.0|This is a great story, has everything in it, relates to many who have ever<br />experienced real love. Great movie, I'd recommend this to anyone.<br />Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood  are great as well.!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Plain and simple, it's Star Wars. Could we have been given Han shooting first? Sure, but it's still one of the best sci-fi stories ever. Four through six make this set worth purchasing. One through three completes the story. The extra discs filled with an abundance of behind the scenes documentaries are an SW nerds dream.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I hadn't listened to Boz Scaggs in quite a while, but this album has brought me right back to him.  Very easy to listen to and very enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play. It is good for all ages, and for passing time. I love it!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Love this movie, I'd recommend this to anyone. Easy to follow, and very<br />cute. All characters are great. Must see.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a nice break from the more conventional end of the world books. It feels very real and well thought out. This book immerses you in a world that makes you feel the plight of the inhabitants of the survivors living in the silos. Despite the setting being that of a confined area, there is never a stale or boring moment in this story. Howey has a true gift for writing and no one should miss this epic story.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This is an awesome, awesome movie! The Story, the acting, the stunt work... Everything. A complete package that is worth seeing.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The game is fun and all, just wish your dino pets were up close in your face. I love looking at a T-Rex in my face.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Watch this with family, and really enjoyed this movie.<br />It is true story, and overcomes anxiety. Great. I'd recommend this to anyone.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Some movies are for entertainment and some for analysis.  This movie is both.  If you are a history major, pay close attension to details as even history book writers could miss a bunch.  Who is the true son and who is the Hagar child? You can be totally loyal and honest and still loose your head.  They didn't cut any corners on cast or props.  Only their accountant experiences true Excedren Headaches.  The headsman must put Alcohol in the Grass as the horses really get a work out. Today's congress would say the need Claymore control.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|This is an essential part of any music library.  What an incredible work of art.  I'm mesmerized every time I listen.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Toy Story is for everyone! Love this movie, great characters, and just<br />fun to watch with family. Thank you ! Must have for anyone.
B009OA57MI|5.0|its really fun but they need more airplanes to fly .  its great if you like to fly airplanes .
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great book. Gives you alot to think about regarding your genetics and how far you would go to protect your family. The ending was the best!
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|A great collection to have for those Columbo fans.<br />Has all the nice series that makes a great box collection.<br />Thanks again!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic book! I hated to put down. This book was so beautifully written that I felt that I knew the characters personally and worried for them. Thank you and  I look forward to immersing myself into the next one!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I was thrilled to know that I could order this from Amazon. I did not have time to watch the series during the week so I watch it on the weekends. Also watching it without commercial interruptions made it for more pleasant viewing.
B004H83IG4|4.0|Ryan Gosling is easy on the eyes! Really enjoy seeing him in<br />just about anything. The movie is good Thank you.
B004HAEGP4|1.0|They went overboard on this episode. Right from the start it was simply over the top, and borderline funny. Milla still kicks but, but the rest of the movie just wasn't impressive.
B000002BHE|5.0|This cd had a song called fly on it. I had it played at my mother in laws memorial service. It is such a heartfelt song. I still tear up Everytime I hear it but they are happy tears. It is the releasing of someone's soul. This would be beautiful for a child's service as well. Even though you are grieving, it gives you a sense of peace concerning your loved  ones passing. I guess you can tell this was my favorite but all of her songs are great.
B007XELMO4|5.0|I bought the Cotton Carrier Strap Shot after reading several reviews from various websites.  I was looking for a way to carry my DSLR (Nikon D5200) while hiking - I want to have my camera available and within easy access while I am on the trail.  And, I don't want my camera hanging around my neck or in a case slung over my shoulder.  I'll admit I was a bit skeptical about how well the Strap Shot would work, but after considering all the options I decided to give it a try.  I tested it out on an 11 mile hike on some very rugged terrain - lots of boulder/rock scrambling and steep ascents.  The Strap Shot did a great job for me.  I had my camera within easy access the entire day - simply rotate it 90 degrees and it is free from the Strap Shot.  The Strap Shot held my camera securely in place - even while leaping from boulder to boulder (it does swing a bit from side to side, but nothing that would cause it to come unattached from the carrier on my backback strap).  I don't use the &#34;safety strap&#34; or whatever Cotton calls it - instead, I just use my camera strap around my neck, it hang loose as the weight of camera is held by the Strap Shot.  Worth noting, the Strap Shot attached to your backpack strap via a velcro closure and then the weight of the camera is held by a strap that connects to the buckle or d-ring near the shoulder strap of your backpack.  If your pack doesn't have this buckle or d-ring, then you probably cannot connect it to your back.  I am using a Gregory Z30 backpack.  I used the Strap Shot with a Nikon D5200 and an Nikon 18-100mm lens.  I did not notice any weight difference having my camera attached via the Strap Shot.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I loved this movie I'm a big Denzel fan and he did an awesome job with this character. It was a great mix of drama an edge of your seat action.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I enjoy the game even though at times it seems to stop you from getting all needed objects in puzzles.
B002U3CB5M|5.0|From the first chapter, I was hooked. Great development of characters woven into a story of love, intrigue, goodness and evil. I galloped through it to get the who dunnit.  Now I will re read it to enjot the intricacy of the characters and the richness of the language.  I have recommended this to many people.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Fast, easy to use and always with me. Love the study plans, daily reminders and devotionals.  You can go from the NIV to the KJV with just one click with all translations available.  This is the Bible I use at home, on the road and at Church.  In the past there were a few glitches opening the app, but for the past several months- perfect!  Great app!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This film really sneaks up on you, in a good way! As the story developed, I think I was just as surprised as its main character. It's worth watching several times to catch all the nuances in relationships and symbolism. Death is treated with an openness and dignity that I haven't experienced in my own life. The film provides a wonderful opportunity to discuss many spiritual topics.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great storyline and production. The season goes by too quickly. I can't wait for season III to come out on dvd.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Jonny Miller is so great, in this role.  The writing is exceptional.  I enjoy the relationship between Sherlock and Watson.  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The movie &#34;It's a wonder life&#34; has always been one of our favorites.  We have the VHS, black and white version, but seeing it in color was fantastic!  They did such a excellent job with the color -- you would think that it was originally done in color.  The story is so uplifting for us today. It has such a good motive - helping and caring about people.  It has all the elements of a great movie, that will remain a great classic.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Accu just got updated, I am loving the new interface. Check it out you will love it. I paid for this app over a year ago now I can say no regrets.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I love this calendar! I wish I knew how to back it up but even if I never learn, it still love it!
0439023491|5.0|Read this one so fast, I couln't wait for the next in the series.  Suzanne Collins writes very interesting material.
B0052FYPJK|4.0|I liked the book even though it wasnput together from all of his memoirs. Dam shame this man is gone he did Alot for the marital arts community's
B00BF11STU|2.0|Having heard all the hype over 0D30, I wondered why this movie had not won more Academy awards than just one...a tie at that for best sound editing. After watching, I now no why. Given the storyline, this movie had a epic opportunity and delivered well short of even &#34;worth seeing&#34; IMO. I am such a fan of this type of movie but it underdelivered in most areas. I believe the hype generated was more politically motivated than based on watchability.  The Academy often nominates questionable movies...this is one. Not worth the hype.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|This series was recommended to be by someone in B&N that I had just met. I'm so glad that I remembered the name and bought it. They are hard books to put down, as she writes very well and her characters are well developed. You can't help but love Bones and Cat, or can't help but sympathize with their relationship struggles. It was hard not to be triumphant when something awesome happened, or to not bite your nails when there was a suspensful scene. Can't wait to get through reading the rest of the series! Hope you enjoy it as much as I thouroughly have. :)
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! Grabbed my attention from the get go and held it all the way through. Not something that I would normally read but I am definitely glad that I listened to others and read this book!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Easy and inexpensive stand for the kindle fire. Works great, nice strong plastic. protects it and is practical. Great item!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I had never watched the show unitl recently and now I am hooked. Very deep in all of the goings on through out the show.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie for all family members.  Our 4 year old grand daughter found it as entertaining and funny as all three of the adults watching the movie!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Nicely written with real understanding of the characters at a deep level.  I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the life and lifestyle of the main character. Felt real empathy for him and was rooting for a happy ending for him
B0089XH38M|4.0|This product offer real protection for my cell phone, is very easy to use and recommend to all my friends
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written and spectacularly shot. It was truly a treat to watch. We were quite sorry when we had finished watching the season.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Well done but it jumps around a lot. Read the book in a Reading class and it was sometimes hard to keep up with.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Such a page turner! This was my first time reading a book by David Baldacci and I am a fan! I read this for my book club and we will be reading another one of his novels for our book discussion next month!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|it came on time and met all my expectations. i am very happy with this purchase.i recommend it to every one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book I couldn't put it down!! I loved it! I can't wait for the movies.More please it left me wanting more
0765334798|4.0|I'm not going to give you a \\"book report\\" review, I hate those. But I will say this: The Star Trek nerd in me loved the satire. The wannabe writer in me LOVED the kick in the pants that Scalzi delivers to lazy writers. And I especially loved the three Coda's, showing that it IS possible to write in First, Second, and Third person viewpoints successfully - all in one book.<br /><br />I couldn't tell you what any of the characters looked like, but that didn't matter. Scalzi breaks a lot of the rules in this book, too. (i.e. names: Dahl and Duvall, Hansen and Henson, all major characters, all speaking together a lot of the time, and it's not very often that he describes anyone.) But it works. I loved the story, I couldn't put it down. Was a great read, and very much worth the $$.<br /><br />I would say that this book is not just satire about science fiction films/books. I'd say it's also a writer's instruction manual.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|For the first day it was fine but then on multiplayer it can't find my FULL wifi connection so it makes me mad
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app sucks don't get it the first day I got it it frozeup it sucks they should pay us to get it and it still wouldn't be worth it just don't get it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|simple to use and has plenty of great features. I trust this app to get me out of bed each morning.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app because it tells me how much battery I have left without having to settings and device and then see my remaining! And when I have it charging it will tell me! :)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|nice to know heaven is real.  The Dr explained a lot of his medical experiences also but the story is good.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|We love the Star Wars movies and the Original Trilogy in BluRay was a must for our collection.  Enjoy watching it very much.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I really loved this movie! It was cute, had action-y scenes, a moral message and the music is amazing! The ending was especially adorable. On the downside the menu is a bit wonky since there were no words to tell you what was what; images were the only identifier for the options. The game was pretty boring but at least it had a game and special features unlike the DVDs I’ve gotten in Walmart. But other than that I don’t really have any complaints. It made a great gift. After we figured out the menu, we watched the movie and both immediately loved it. We’re both biased because we love Daft Punk but objectionaly it is still a pretty good movie
B008602KQI|4.0|Close enough to the book to keep it right.  Jennifer Lawrence was a great pick for Katniss.  Recommended for fans of the literary series.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I love this game, fun, but it can become difficult the further you get.  I would say if you like a chalange,  buy it.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I listen to this album at least once a week, it's fun and easy to listen too. It gets me all jazzed up while at work or while at the gym.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I Just returned from a trip to Havana and was told about this film.  It  is a wonderful documentary of the music of Cuba.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album is awesome, great sound for everyday listening. I recommend this album to everyone. Can't wait for the next one.
1400069807|5.0|I had no idea just how invasive the big food companies have gone to get us hooked into eating their fake foods.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah Jones voice is soo soothing and blissful. This new album is one of my current favorites. It's a little more fun and sexy.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I'd been eager to see this film and attempted to rent it as a download. This was allowed but only in \\"Standard\\" resolution. I could neither buy nor rent this film in HD unless I had a device on Amazon's approved list, such as their own Kindle Fire or an Xbox 360. They prohibit the use of their downloader or Cloud Player for HD. Thus I had to download the film though other sources. It is, of course, both silly and impractical to acquire any movie in physical form. Not anymore. And if a person born shortly after World War II feels this way, then this is hardly a minority view.<br /><br />As for the film itself, as others have ably noted, it is glorious. Were it not for the unnecessary error in the Connecticut vote and a few self indulgent deifying shots of Lincoln - such as the one by the window while he holds his youngest son - I would have found this a near perfect work. The screenplay, its language, its ability to evoke an era, reveal a human being of singular gifts at a crucial moment in time, left me in drop-jaw awe.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Love his album, nice and fun to listen to. Listened to is a couple of time while on vacation. Thanks for making great music!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you love the first then you will love this one. Twice as fun and three times as addicting. I cant get enough of this. I love the mine cart and the zip lines
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Like usual Muse has a great sound. Love his album, nice and fun to listen to. Listened to is a couple of time while on vacation. Thanks for making great music!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This might just be one of my new favorite baseball movies. A good story about dysfunctional families, love and, above all, baseball.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Interesting Album, it reminds me alot of Mars Volta for the strange openings for the songs. Love the flow of the album, it makes you chill out after a rough day.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have read a number of these recent Navy Seal books and have found many of them very poorly written.  No Easy Day is not one of those.  It is well written, factually reported and a good read.  I would explicitly recommend.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Whole album is great, so great that I purchased the most recent one after getting this one. Fun and lively beats.
0345528581|5.0|I have used the exercises in this book while traveling for many years.  It is an excellent beginning for utilizing your own body weight as resistance.  Mark Lauren does a phenonmenal job in K.I.S.S.
B002WPVNOS|5.0|OneRepublic you have stunned me again with another great album. Every song is great and can be listened to over and over without getting burned out. Can't wait to hear what's next.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I grew up loving Stephen King. I do and will always have a huge amount of respect for King, a guy who grew up poor and turned himself into one of the best selling authors in modern history. In the last ten years or so, I've gotten a bit away from his books. I'd try one every once in a while and come away mostly disappointed. It seemed to me that this author for whom I had so much respect had gotten away from what I always liked about him. That doesn't mean those books were bad - I'm sure they weren't - only that they didn't work for me. 11/22/63 changed that, and made me more willing to try the next. It's a very welcome return to form.
B006YGE4Z6|5.0|It would be the ultimate arrogance to presume to critique one of Ernest Hemingway's early masterworks, so I will not. THE SUN ALSO RISES is a necessary 'read' as an introduction to understanding the modern novel as much as it is for its literary and entertainment value. This novel 'turned the corner'so to speak, from the flowery, dense-packed novels of the late Victorian period with their reams of description, to the new 'lean' writing that Papa Hemingway introduced.<br /><br />His apprenticeship as a newspaper reporter, reporting from Italy during<br />WW I, and his later work with the Toronto Star becomes evident in his 'reportage' style of literary writing. Every sentence crackles, ensuring that what might otherwise be a rather linear story in fact carries the reader along as it delves into the intricacies, lives, loves and characters of the group of expats searching for their destinies in France and Spain during the 1920's. The novel is best read twice, the first for its entertainment qualities, then, after a passage of time, a second time to answer the question: What is the author seeking to do here? Of course, the bullfight scenes and commentaries are classical. This book is a 'must' for every aspiring creative writer.
B004J64QR4|5.0|exception performance  the movie was as bad as everyother musical put to film except westside story.  this is the best concert of les miserables
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Just watch it. You'll like it. Funny, witty, sarcastic science fiction all rolled into one show. Acting and stories are super great!
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Well, what can I say?  I'm old, and I'm a parent of a 13 year old girl and a 15 year old boy.  I loved Disney cartoons back in the day.  I also had my kids watch them as they got old enough to (whatever the parent feels, but I waited a bit).  I understand that kids focus on the slap stick and the gags and such.  However, there is absolutely no doubt that the amount of smack talk, brattiness, smack talk, disrespectful attitude, etc, is rampant in the \\"new\\" films of today.  Fine, I understand that people say Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes were some of the most violent cartoons ever, agreed, but it is STILL different!  SO, I guess kids can get some fun off of these, but I would wait until they were older as the negative outweighs the positive messages of the film.  Hey, this is just because I care man.  cheers.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Nothing great, a lot of political undertones.  Should have known that before I saw it so no one to blame but myself.  Can't see why people think it's such a great movie though.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I love this movie!<br />I watch it all the time for a good laugh, great music and a beautiful story line.<br />I recommend this movie to everyone.
B007HO392S|4.0|I bought this because I enjoy Carrie Underwood's music and style, in particular the title song and two black cadillacs.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My dad is a huge Star Trek fan and I knew this was the perfect gift to buy him for Christmas!<br />He watched it all in one day.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book!!!!!!!! It was great I can't wait to see it in theater. A l s o  I t was wonderful
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Improved graphics make the game more realistic. They were the best added touch, they prove to be both fun and exciting. Thanks for the wonderful game.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. Jamie McGuire has transformed a bad boy into a unfreakinbelieveable man. His life is far from perfect but he has great intentions and when he falls in love, he gives his whole heart. I'm so jealous of Abby in this book. Who wouldn't want a Travis Maddox in their life?<br />This book is most definitely on my top ten list.
0670827592|5.0|Kids love that fact that this is told by the wolf.  It was a fun read a loud!  The children all wanted to give the wolf a cup of sugar.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Excellent start to the series, slow to kick off, but once it does, it stands on its own two feet as an excellent fantasy book
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This game i thought would be really fun but is was not even a tiny bit good. I tried going on it and the screen went all black and crashed on me. I never really got to play&nbsp;the game because it kept on crashing. I don't recommend this app.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best book ever!!!!! I can't wait to see the movie, hope is as good as the books. Christian Grey is amazing!
B005J9ZFQG|1.0|I bought this thinking it was a comedy, with red Skeleton in it. I thought his head was white, cause he just saw a ghost !!!
1610660242|5.0|Excellent read that was also an easy read. This book was actually recommended to me by my manager and ironically I know managers that don't subscribe to this theory. It's a very good philosophy that I agree with.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun easy game with great play and quick speed.  I really enjoy the achievements portion as it gives me a &#34;reason&#34; to keep playing.  Otherwise, this acts as an easy time filler.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I haven't seen the other Oscar nominated films &#34;Argo&#34; competed against, but this film struck me as a safe, predictable, &#34;you know how it is going to end&#34;  feel good film. I found the plot predictable and not very exciting but it was interesting to see how the government used Hollywood as a means to extract the Americans stuck in the Canadian ambassador's home.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I've been a big fan of Logitech products in the past but my enthusiasm is fading. I purchased the G930 headset and was surprised how flimsy it was. I have been cautious when handling it and how I store it. The right side plastic piece that supports earphone to head support broke causing the earphone to drop and dangle away. I emailed Logitech and included picture of problem with headset asking for help to repair their EXPENSE product. I received a generic reply that led to no help at all. I Googled this problem and found that this is a common problem with the Logitech G930. I am very disappointed with Logitech and will look elsewhere for my PC peripheral products. BTW, the broken G930 makes a great paper weight for those of you who are in the same situation as I.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I saw the original theater production in the 1990s, so I have to admit I am biased as I don't think any film version can stand up to the theatrical production.  However, this film does an honorable job. The opening scene is jaw-dropping. The singing performances are inconsistent (some actors are better than others) but it didn't detract from the overall emotional impact of the film. (At least for myself.)
B0095P31L6|1.0|This is supposed to be a kids movie?  Amazon, is there a way I can give it zero stars instead?
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|Romantic comedies aren't a film genre I am usually attracted to, but this one was ok. The chemistry between the main characters is  great and they are both charming but the film dragged along in some parts for myself. Not a waste of time.
0618680004|5.0|The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins<br /><br /> \\"The God Delusion\\" is the book that raised consciousness about the \\"God\\" question.  It takes a critical look at the belief of God and espouses a superior way of viewing the world. This book has inspired countless other books of this ilk and in many respects provided the inspiration for many people to \\"come out\\".  The book holds up quite well after a third reading, biologist, best-selling author and icon of the atheist movement, Richard Dawkins takes the reader on a journey into the most fascinating topic of them all, religion.  This captivating 464-page book is composed of the following ten chapters:  1. A Deeply Religious Non-Believer, 2. The God Hypothesis, 3. Arguments for God's Existence, 4. Why There Are Almost Certainly No God, 5. The Roots of Religion, 6. The Roots of Morality: Why are we Good?, 7. The `Good' Book and the Changing Moral Zeitgeist, 8. What's Wrong with Religion? Why be so Hostile? 9. Childhood, Abuse and the Escape from Religion, and 10. A Much Needed Gap?<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. An influential book that inspired an intellectual movement.<br />2. The most interesting topic, religion, in the hands of a great, passionate thinker.<br />3. A thought-provoking book written with panache.<br />4. A book that focuses on raising consciousness on the \\"God\\" question, mission accomplished.<br />5. This book is a quote fest, \\"When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called Religion.\\"<br />6. A look at the many views of `God', \\"Of course, like any other word, the word `God' can be given any meaning we like. If you want to say that `God' is energy,' then you can find God in a lump of coal.\\"<br />7. The author does a wonderful job of defining important terms.<br />8. Debunking misconceptions.  Take Einstein for instance, \\"I am a deeply religious nonbeliever.\\"<br />9. The author does a wonderful job of supporting his arguments with case studies and sound logic.<br />10. The religious views of the Founding Fathers in perspective. Interesting stuff!<br />11. The spectrum of religious belief.<br />12. A look at prayer, \\"to pray: to ask that the laws of the universe be annulled in behalf of a single petitioner, confessed unworthy.\\"  The prayer case study.<br />13. A couple of chapters are dedicated to the most popular arguments for God's existence.<br />14. Natural selection as a conscious raiser. \\"Natural selection not only explains the whole of life; it also raises our consciousness to the power of science to explain how organized complexity can emerge from simple beginnings without any deliberate guidance.\\"<br />15. Ideas of where religion came from.  Many interesting ideas on why people are vulnerable to the charms of religion.  Dawkins' specific hypothesis relates to the indoctrination of children. A partial list of religious memes.<br />16. The roots of morality.  The four good Darwinian reasons for individuals to be moral.<br />17. A great chapter on why people who claim to derive their morals from scripture do not really do so in practice.  Biblical examples that illustrate that, \\"we don't get our morals from scripture.\\" Dawkins takes off his gloves.<br />18. Debunking the notion that atheism is behind bad behaviour. \\"What matters is not whether Hitler and Stalin were atheists but whether atheism systematically influences people to do bad things. There is not the smallest evidence that it does.\\"<br />19. The effects of religion, \\"one of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.\\"  \\"As a scientist, I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise.  It teaches us not to change our minds, and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known. It subverts science and saps the intellect.\\"<br />20. The dangers of indoctrination of children into religion. \\"Children should be taught not so much what to think as how to think.\\"<br />21. I enjoyed reading the list of Bible-inspired phrases.<br />22. Debunks the notion of the necessity for a god. \\"Religion's power to console doesn't make it true\\".<br />23. An excellent appendix that provides resources for people trying to escape from religion.<br />24. Books cited.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No links for Kindle.<br />2. Dawkins is unable to answer some questions in which I believe there are plausible answers.  To the question of why religion has flourished in America, I would contend that the separation of Church and State has in combination with financial benefits (tax-free) and the open-market system has contributed greatly.<br /><br />In summary, I read this book years ago when it first came out and I must say it inspired me.  I always felt that for the truth to have any value it would have to correspond to reality but never really had the courage to espouse my views openly.  Thanks to people like the late Hitchens, Dawkins and Harris I was able to not only obtain the courage but the clarity of thought to be comfortable enough to be comfortable in my own skin.

I enjoyed reading the list of Bible-inspired phrases.<br />22. Debunks the notion of the necessity for a god. \\"Religion's power to console doesn't make it true\\".<br />23. An excellent appendix that provides resources for people trying to escape from religion.<br />24. Books cited.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No links for Kindle.<br />2. Dawkins is unable to answer some questions in which I believe there are plausible answers.  To the question of why religion has flourished in America, I would contend that the separation of Church and State has in combination with financial benefits (tax-free) and the open-market system has contributed greatly.<br /><br />In summary, I read this book years ago when it first came out and I must say it inspired me.  I always felt that for the truth to have any value it would have to correspond to reality but never really had the courage to espouse my views openly.

B000IDGDPA|5.0|This was the first movie I watch after getting a Kindle.  I enjoyed it very much as Helen Hunt is a favorite of mine and I'd like anything she was in.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|wasn’t too impressed. not a waste of time, but no were near a Pixar movie. fits with the rest of Adam Sandler’s family friendly movies. good if it’s free, but wouldn’t pay more than $3 to see this.
B000002KLG|5.0|Saw him in concert years ago. Had this album, vinyl, wanted to hear it in the car. brings back memories.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I need some hot sauce. Man I got some turkey wings and Canaveral and no hot sauce. Its rain I'm sad all j have is subway surfers and not sauce. Some time the screen freezes
B00BUL0XYG|4.0|I really appreciate a lot of the newer, more experimental songs, but feel that the more conventional rock tunes weren't catchy enough to justify their lack of creativity.
B009NH6JRE|3.0|I have been an avid fan of Walking Dead!! I was fixated on the first 2 seasons. The suspense was like hardly anything before.  Who will get bit, what will the group decide, how will they cope, all great!  My criticism of season 3, AHH! They have turned this great show into a \\"Soap opera\\".  Who hates who, who is talking about who, etc.  Gov, Rick, Andrea.  At \\"the meeting\\" Rick should have just pulled the 357 gun and killed the Gov, end of negotiations.  The personal back-story each of the people worked when it was \\"about surviving\\" Zombies.  But now it is just almost regular life, in the Prison, or Woodbury.  It IS the potential Zombie attacks that continually keep coming that makes you sit on the edge of your seat.  Go around a door, turn a corner, you can get bit. Who will live and who will die. How will they handle things? The buzz after each show was, Well what would you have done if????  This whole season 3 of Governor, Andrea, Rick stuff, has turned into another type of boring show.  How much can you discuss is the governor crazy or not.  He is a lunatic with heads in fish tanks in a room, talking normally to his dressed up zombie daughter.  Andrea's time ran out and her death is about time. She would only hook up with weirdoes, Shane and the Governor.  After her sister died she never came around. I watch the show now only hoping it will go back to the suspense of first 2 years.  How to survive CONSTANT ATTACKS and how do people cope with themselves and each other in this zombie world of death.  They are the prey.  The show still has great potential if they would get back to the initial winning formula. No one confronts each other anymore.  That was also the intensity before, Shane confronting people, people challenging each other about decisions. Do this, or why do that?  The Emotional intensity was great. Now most everyone is passive/quiet.  The sisters rarely even talk. The younger sister only takes care of the baby.  Last show she finlaly stabbed a zombie.Step up learn to shoot guns like the target training before on the ranch, or get bit?? Mishone could teach Carl how to use a sword, or elarn martial arts. The idea of the baby crying and waking up the dead has totally gone away as an issue.  We hear nothing about the baby needing food.  Baby just gets held. Sure, BS.  Where is the tension if the baby is crying and it is a threat? Glen seems to only \\"React\\". Glen, get some stones, stand up. The end of this season is also weird.  They are acting as if the Gov will just fade away. If he is true to form, he wants Mishone dead! \\"I will be back\\"!  So now with Woodbury people it is communal living in the prison?  Boring, HUM?  The Zombies make this show?  The show is:  \\"The Walking Dead\\"??? No zombies, no comic book. Get back to 5 plus stars!As tight as this group is now, what is miisng is them never having a discussion about now what?  It is as if they still are in shock that life has changed. I do not know if anyone has noticed that but there is no seasons in this show. It never rains,or gets cold. It is even rarely dark. Remember the intensity of the end of season: Them coming from the ranch, standing in the street in the dark arguing over what to do? Great stuff. Lastly they never talk about how to kill them better, They never burn them?
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|Need I say more?<br />fun and challenging. One of the best platformer games on Android! I highly recommend! Don't sleep on this
B004DNWPY4|2.0|Not really.  I mean, if this is your first book, then yeah, shocker but I was expecting more.  oh well.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|... Wanna tell you his music was great, still is actually... but couldn't stand the boy for all the weird s*** he's done
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I thought the premire episode of Castle Season 5 was very,very good. It had some funny moments in beginning of episode and very dramtic rest of the show. Stana's performance as usual was terrific. Stana is a very good dramatic actress. Nathan Fillion was as  usual great as well. Rest of Castle cast was good as well.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|If music is in your soul, Sound City will be absolutely fantastic to watch and an emotional experience. I could go on and on telling you how great this DVD is, but I have to go order Sound City Real to Real 606.
B004QSQMKE|1.0|They say there are 2 versions on the disc but they're lying<br />There's only one version and it's the crap director's version with<br />lame extras and terrible edits and craptacular music<br /><br />AVOID go get the theatrical from somewhere else
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I loved this video and I'm glad to have this in my permanent collection so I can watch it anytime..
B004VMUS9G|5.0|On a trip to Germany and I had to figure out a,way to wake up for a pre-paid tour.  This,was easy to use and worked perfectly.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy mahjong games and this version for the Kindle Tablet is easy and fun to play whenever I have the chance to kill time without straining the brain.
B007EE5820|4.0|Great insight into Arnold's background, determination and dedication has got him where he is today. An easy read with some pictures also.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book loved every minute of it couldn't put it down. Definitely recommend anyone to read. From the start I was hooked brings you into their lives.
B00005AQF7|5.0|If you want to know what it is like living in the hood or the ghetto, you will find some great writing here put to song and music. It can be raw so you must be prepared for it. It is a great storyline of Hip Hop.
B000002H2H|5.0|What else can be said?  Ride The Lightning (1984) by Metallica is thrash/speed metal at its best.  This is Metallica's second album that came after the success of Kill 'Em All (1983).  This album is loaded with classics such as \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", \\"Ride The Lightning\\", \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", and \\"Fade To Black\\".<br /><br />If you like old school Metallica before they started to mellow out in the 1990s, then this album is for you.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I have been using the free version for quite a while now. I paid for the full version to support the developer because they have released a very nice application. I find that it is the most comfortable to use as I can customize it to my preferences. The ability to control brightness by sliding a finger is one of the most useful features for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the stupidest book I have ever read.  You gotta be kidding me!  Really America?!  Is this what we're being reduced to?  The writing is very sophomoric...I'm sure my daughter could have written a better piece of literature.  It's so repetitive and just not a worthy way to spend time.  At times, I would have rather stuck pins in my eyes than read another page.  I think I only made it through the 4th chapter...didn't even get into the &#34;good stuff&#34; just because it was so painfully stupid.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Lots of fun, my kids have a blast playing and the controls are very simple. i am very happy with this purchase.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Best show I think that's ever been on TV.  Great sci-Fi, but it's way more than that. Unparalleled acting, writing, and chemistry!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|What more can I say? Her voice is mesmorizing! I love the convenience of buying the whole mp3 album from the convenience of home!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I find this very challenging. I like the complexity (spelling?) this game offers.  Am an old lady, trying to keep my mind sharp.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|there no word.<br />Love it love it love it love it love it !!!!!<br />I would suggest fro all the family
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I like how the author was given free reign to write about Steve Jobs in a manner that would accurately portray him. This is a great insight into the life of a man who has given the world so much. People may not like the way Steve Jobs got it done but they sure do like his products.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|i saw the movie at the theater and i would like to by for me and my son.<br />I would suggest because it' s really fun
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|Wow, I was amazed at how good this album was. Both discs were amazing, although I liked the second disc better. It has a mix of both, a bit of rock, a bit of prog, a bit of everything to say the least. Ted Leonard fit in real well in the band, his voice was awesome. A lot of tracks here were amazing, most of them I'd have to say were from the second disc. Great musicianship as always, great lyrics and play. Hopefully they release another album with Leonard, he was missed in the prog world with his voice since Enchant stopped playing in 2003. Again, great album and great cover too.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In was an easy read and a great reminder of how we need to acknowledge differences to achieve equality. Feminism--the movement for equal rights for women--has gotten us far but we are not there. As one colleague said, it was great to have the research and the stories and ideas for change in one place. Men and women will find pearls in this read...and it is an easy read.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|this s a good family movie. the 3d makes it even more fun.  it was a great price as well
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I saw this movie and loved every minute of it. I'm a great fan of Lord of the Rings and this goes right long with it. I recommend any fans to get it  for future viewing. Again and Again.
0062238868|5.0|kept my interest all the way through.  Really get to feel what it would be like to be in his shoes.
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|poor and very robotic. plus difficult to adjust pitch, vol and speed.  I needed a text to speech app to help me cover so many books during and give eyesight a break. I ll keep searching. my advice : make it User friendly and manly voice,  not chirpy and irritating.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was glued to this game for about three hours. After that, I kind of got a little bored. gr8 :-D
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|a great family movie with lessons of doing what's right even when it hurts.  Very creative and imaginative.  my kids liked it very much.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This was actually pretty good.  But, I am getting confused on how old Harry is and where he is in his career.  Connelly seems to have lost track of the timeline.  Again, though, it was good.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is an enjoyable Reacher story.  The action is good.  This is genre literature and Child does it well in this volume.  He is not pretending to be a Murakami and this is no 1Q84, but if you like a quick enjoyable read without too much thinking, this is just the book.  There are a few annoyances, but they can be overlooked.  I notice in Reacher books that every few pages in some stories, Child has Reacher drinking black strong coffee, and &#34;keep it coming&#34;.  It is amazing how much time is spent by Child in having coffee --- he must think it is a character trait he wants to emphasize for the big American, and to show he is not a Brit like Child drinking tea, but man does he overdo it.  Anyway, recommend the book.  You can make it a drinking game everytime Reacher has coffee.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I Have Tried Many Different Flashlights And This One Is The Best One By Far. I Will Be Uninstalling The Others. Hopefully This One Won't Stop Working Like The Others Did In A Few Weeks. Not Sure Why My Phone Is Making The First Letter Of Every Word Capitalized. Droid RAZR.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Highly engaging and entertaining novel. Unreal, fun read. This is the type of novel you read as your fun read of the month. It takes you away from reality.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i enjoy this game just think that the rewards are a little small. it is also a little slow paced.
B007SRZULW|5.0|This Cambridge Edition version of P&P is easy to read. While I really enjoyed the BBC TV series on DVD better than the book, it still held my interest in the story as originally told. Only downside was the DailyDeal seller who sold it to me-took weeks and weeks on end to get it.
0374275637|5.0|Everyone should read this to learn about all the ways our opinions and choices are driven by influencesway beyond our conscious knowledge.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|incredible performance by Daniel D Lewis, Sally Fields, and Tommy Lee Jones! Outstanding movie...highly recommend!!! Top movie..Spielburg does it again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! so fun and engaging, and it makes it seem like you actually have a horse to love and take care of
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Refreshing my first reading, waiting for the movie.  The good, the bad and the ugly,all in one installment. Loved it
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I first bought the book because of the film. I haven't seen the film yet but I wanted to and thought \\"why not read the book first?\\". As the story unfolded I grew to really like the characters. The quirky and a bit insane narrator, reading classical literature to impress his ex. Being an undergrad lit student, I thought it was fun to see a different point of view on classic tales. I also found myself rooting for the main hero in his quest for self improvement and his football obsession was interesting (if a little over done. I mean, seriously? What's with the men constantly doing the EAGLES thing...? And his dad was really strange.).<br /><br />I read the book all in one go, in one day, and I'm happy I read it. It may not be the most sophisticated read but it's very enjoyable...<br /><br />...and sometimes it's really nice to see the silver linings.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put it down, although I know it is just a wild story.  Julliet is a woman I could of been (maybe not). Silos are in my past, being born in Iowa.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter and she loves it. We have other angery bird apps but this is her favorite.
B005K17RU0|4.0|was very useful. I couldn't find some locations though. Amelia Island  or Fernandina Beach ( used Jacksonville). Williams, Az. (Grand Canyon)not found.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I got this to give my daughter something to do at the doctor's office and we LOVE it!  There is so much thinking involved in playing this game, we often play together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its challenging yet fun when u think your gonna loose but u don't I fall asleep<br />Playing this game its awesome I want to thank the maker for the greatest game of all thanks
B00AFZ86BA|4.0|Package arrived as described, new and sealed and in a timely.  Listened to all the CD's to ensure there were no damages.  I am very pleased with it.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This was a suggested gift and has been enjoyed by the person who received it. I now know where to buy future gifts. It's easy to order and the shipping has exceeded my expectations.
B00BVVA138|4.0|With a new release from a long-standing band, it's tempting to compare it to the band's previous albums. A better comparison is to \\"Hymn of a Broken Man\\" from Times of Grace, a side project from two years ago by two current KSE members. That album had a few heavy moments but tended to be more contemplative, with a theme of optimism and struggling through adversity (making it rather more cheerful than the usual metal.)<br />\\"Disarm the Descent\\" seems to marry that uplifting idea with the more fast-paced, brutal sounds KSE is known for. The results are solid, even when they aren't spectacular. This is their first album since switching lead singers, and Jesse more than holds his own. And everyone else is in fine form as well. But putting it all together, there's too many songs that, for me, lack a certain killer instinct - KSE has done fast and intense, and they've done slow and extra-heavy, but too often the songs here stay between the two extremes. So everything is good but too many songs fail to leave a lasting impression, some of it blends together to be a bit samey, and a lot of songs start out great but fade towards the end.<br />That being said, the positive themes mean you can't help but feel good when listening to this album. And when everything does come together - good intensity and some extra guitar riffage/solos - the results are great. My highlights are \\"In Due Time\\", \\"Turning Point\\", and \\"Time Will Not Remain.\\" Despite withholding a star from my overall rating, I'd highly recommend it - it's a solid album overall, and there's likely to be at least one or two songs that'll really speak to you and resonate as much as anything else you've ever heard.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Arrived in good condition.  Movie is a classic.  Maybe not a classic in the classic sense, but a classic none the less.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I wish I had read this book in my thirties.  At 52 I can look back and<br />see how many things Ms. Sandberg had pertained to myself and<br />many of my female colleages.<br />Dr. Cassandra Massey
B0015DROBO|5.0|Well written, interesting characters, gripping story. Didn't know much about Swedish history & culture, so the window in is fascinating.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A must read for young working women.  Insightful points with countless studies and proof points to back up her claims
B00BEBJEY2|5.0|I must admit I'm a Mogwai fan.  Having every cd that I have had a chance to get my hands on.  I believe that this group is the most daring and inovating band on the current scene.  That being said I also believe that Les Revenants is softer and more delightful than any of the preivous cd's put out by these young Scots.  It starts slowly and picks up a nice pace midway through the recording without being morose or dark.  With only one cut set to lyrics (What are they doing in heaven today?) a very Pink Floyd sounding cut, the rest of the cuts take you on a dream like journey through the final notes.  Mogwai has created music on this cd wich will slow your world down and make you realize that even contemporary atrists do not need words to relate their feelings to their audience.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the story line.  The historical setting and the characters positive qualities.  It is nice to see how other people live.  All of the side stories are well developed and acted out.  I feel like they are real people that I would like to know.
1741791529|5.0|This is a must have if you travel through Iran. Lots of history, culture, politics - all covered.  Lonely Planet books are generally the best to purchase for trips outside the much traipsed Europe.  We've purchased them for all of our travels to countries that the U.S. deems \\"problematic.\\"  The coverage of important events is stellar and we in the U.S. rarely, if ever, get this important information.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love love love these books...wish there were more.. cant wait for a movie...ted reminds me of my little boy..... love this
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This is a really interesting first person account of someone who witnessed the holocaust and lived in Nazi Germany. A great read for anyone interested in the period.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is pretty addictive.  I spend a lot of time playing it.  Our 5 year old twin grandkids love it also.
B00AKGG5VC|5.0|It is one of my best vinyls. The quality of the LP is marvelous, and the hardcover bribgs the lyrics and some extra information. The entire purchase was way above my expectations.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Tell me about it!!! I can't wait to see the whole thing!!<br />So far it is great, I am a level 11 in it.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|I very good product for a little price in comparisson with other rock vinyls. Is the best purchase that someone can aqquire in order to wait for the presumable next Led Zeppelin tour.
B00846REIS|5.0|Omg...this book is a perfect description of love. All of it's ups and downs...and how much work it takes from both parties to make it work...the sex scenes are definitely an added bonus..
1588167461|4.0|This gave me a solid foundation for style. Of course no man will admit he doesn't know style but this definitely will get you on your way. Additionally, it was a fun read with the comedic injects of the author. Definitely recommend.
0061537969|5.0|I am pretty sure this is my new favorite book. I rented it from the library and the whole time I was reading it I was mad that I didn't own it. So I bought it too.
B001EC2IXK|4.0|one of Newman's best performances as far as i'm concerned.  there are many quotable lines from this flick. the supporting cast is also very good.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Generation Green Bottle Cutter did everything it was advertised to do.  The directions were simple and easy to follow.  My order arrived very quickly and I was able to start my project the next weekend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like the best game ever! It is even better than the original Temple Run! This game has a big tunnel in it that makes this game harder. If you have played Temple Run.....try Temple Run 2!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game awesome. One problem I was on level 15 had a rainbow dragon life was good UNtil  the game freezes. Turn off your kindle you can't u can't do any thing but I update its all good hint breed a blue fire and a crystal dragon= rainbow
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great start to what appears a great series.  Excellent delivery and playback on my computer.  It will take awhile to download on DSL but is worth the wait.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|My kids LOVED this movie.  We really like the Big Bang Theory, so it was extra nice that \\"Penny\\" was in it.  A few other voices seemed really familiar and we looked them up after the show.  The jelly beans had us laughing like crazy.  It was a lot of fun, lot of giggles, lots of heart.  It held my kids' attention.  I think they watched it 2.5 times in the time we had it rented. Definite Easter favorite!
1451695195|4.0|I gave this book a four star rating because it does clearly prove that their is life after death, however the primary focus of the book is solid clinical proof which leaves the thrilling personal experience as secondary.<br /><br />If you are still trying to decide whether or not life exists after death, and you want scientific proof, beyond all doubt, this book is for you.<br /><br />This particular experience is primarily practical and scientific, it wasn't expressed as an earthmoving emotional event.<br />The author is not attempting to do so.  I believe he is speaking largely to his peers who have been trained to think critically.
B0077190MO|5.0|My husband and I just finished watching season 1, 2, and 3.  I can't wait for the next season.  I love the characters and their individual story lines.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|It seemed to me that I had a difficult time following the characters and long before the movie ended, I began to be sleepy.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun & easy but frustrated when there are so many pop ups while playing this game.  I'm thinking of uninstalling it because of all the pop ups ONLY while playing this game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is really good because I got a new phone and then I got this app on my kindle fire and then put a alarm on my phone the next morning I almost got late for the bus but my app on my kindle fire saved me from my doom so that's how it helps me so much.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love certain types of TV programs..My lady told me about seeing this ON DEMAND and said I would like it...Looked around and found that AMAZON Video had it and was priced right..Have just started watching it and it is an great, most interesting, show..I feel like all the episodes will be wonderful....Thanks Amazon Video...Good job..
B003JTHXN6|5.0|The book has two main elements to it beyond the story: 1. It presents an approach to strategy and tackling new business opportunities which I have found helpful in my work, 2. It discusses corporate culture and developing a meaningful one in depth - there are great ideas but I found it less relevant to me. Overall I found it was a great read and would love to read more books that are similar.
B008M34INW|4.0|I didn't know what to make of a movie set almost entirely in a mexican prison.  It was a bit like the Mel Gibson in Payback.  My wife and I enjoyed it.
B00940XIGU|5.0|I didn't know if i would like the whole album but I did. Great for dancing and work outs. I love David Guetta's songs when i'm at the gym
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love all the snooze and alarm options. so customizable. great app. I have used it for over a year with zero problems.
B00003CXSP|5.0|As julliane moore picks up the role that jodie foster originally portrayed, she fits into the expectations quite well and stays loyal and true to the character
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have discovered this program as I was looking for a way to making my job in writing easier and I must say that I am very pleased. I can now work ok my computer either locally or by the net as well as on my Kindle tablet. I am totally satisfied!!!
B0064UPU4G|5.0|If you are a fan of Daft Punk, or even just this genre of music; you should get this album.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book...There are no more excuses, START TODAY!!!  ANYONE CAN LIVE THE LIFE OF THEIR DREAMS, START THEIR OWN BUSINESS, BE THE MASTER OF THEIR UNIVERSE!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was so intrigued by this book. I said to myself I must read this book more then once which I did. The second time I read the book was even better then these first. I contemplated how John Green writes and creates such an incredible story. I just wanted to say thanks and amazing book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It really is like having the weather channel at your fingertips.  With one click, I can see how to prepare everyone for the day wherever they are.  This is one of my favorite apps!!!!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was excited to watch this and was unfortunately disappointed. Knocked up was WAY better. The story line was good, but poorly executed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  I love reading the verse of the day and developing reading plans that I can tailor to my interests and studies.  Being able to compare versions is awesome.  My daughter introduced me to this.  She wanted it on her ipad but it wasn't free.  I'm so glad I chose this app.  This is another tool that the Lord uses to speak to me and my family.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Moonrise Kingdom was touted as very funny, chocked full of laughts. I did not find that to be the case, and was very disappointed.<br />I'm even sorry that I spent my time watching it.
B00A4VGUIG|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!! I was a little worried about how much money it cost because there was only 1 review. BUT it is worth the money. The only problem I found in this game is if you don't save the game you lose what you have done in the game.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|Quite intertaining. Enjoyed the story line and glad I watched this film. There was more sexual content than I expeced from these two older stars, but it fit right in with the story. Would recommend this move to older aduls who are maybe a little stuck in their old habits, instead of growing in their marriage relationship.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app. I've had many apps before this one and always found myself seeking another. This one has tons of options that make waking up almost pleasant!  The alarm options are wind we truly and soothe you awake.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Waited a long time to see this movie, and it was all that I had hoped it would be. Much more can be said abut Lincoln, but what is told here is an excellent review. Might even watch it again.<br /><br />In my field of reference, the only 2012 movie that was any better, was Argo.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|what a great movie! Everyone in the family from my 3 year old grandson to myself enjoyed the heartwarming story line and the beautiful cinematography.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Farewell Tour #1--what a concept!  Like fine wines, somethings do  get BETTER with time--this is not always true with aging muscians and their music however this is not the case!  Even the once wild, perpetually  inebriated Joe Walsh could not have predicted he and his bandmates would endure creative differences, multiple separations, limited solo successes to unite again.....here is &#34;America's Band&#34; back together and BETTER THAN EVER!!!!  Witness the four guitarists, sitting side by side, singing in perfect harmony and playing almost ALL of their treasured hits before a mixed audience of fans (age wise) backed up by some of the most accomplished studio band members and orchestra instrumentalists.  Glen Frey and Don Henley, the two most creative minds of the Eagles, have been the song writing machine of the group; they have set aside their tempestous relationship and have seemingly become respectful and friendly to each other; Timothy Schmit, the only longhaired-remnant of the group, still plays perfect  Bass accompanyment with the Angelic voice and pitch-perfect harmony ; Joe Walsh, the former founder of the Jame's Gang (&#34;Walk Away&#34;) and lead guitarist shows that sobriety and dedication is the perfect ingredient to the group's current and future success.  Here are 30 incredible songs performed with musical perfection (the audio is unbelievable as is the video) from America's most popular supergroup--who amongst us has not sang &#34; Hotel California, Heartache Tonite&#34; in the shower or marvelled at the serene melody of the hauntingly beautiful &#34;Wasted Time&#34; or the Eagles's tribute to chosen loneliness &#34;Desperado&#34;?  If you must have but ONE Eagles video concert, MAKE THIS THE ONE!  Joe Walsh said during this performance, &#34;we'll be here, doin' this as long as you want us to&#34;....well Joe, I do!!!!!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game, but it's not the best. It's hard to level up, there's not a good way to produce diamonds, and I can't seem to get any friends in the friends menu. It could be easier to unlock the rooms too. I usually like games that take time and patience to complete, but this takes a little too much patience. Oh, and the energy generates too slowly as well, and its too expensive to keep buying it.<br />I'm not trying to stop people from getting this game, I'm just warning them of a few things that might cause frustration later on.
B000002KLP|5.0|Iam an old fan of Prince and the Minneapolis crew. I play this CD any many other Prince CDs all the time.Great songs
B004SDEP38|2.0|YOU CAN NOT DRAW PICTURES TO GO WITH STORIES WAY WAY WAT TO COMPLICATED. NOT FOR ME OR ANY ONE UNDER 18 TEEN I COULD NOT EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TYPE ON IT OR EVEN LESS VIEW DOCUMENTS
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This is a great Western set inside of a Kung Fu movie.  RZA plays an incredible role and the story is actually awesome!!  The other actors/actresses are incredible also.  The ONLY problem with this movie is that it should have been a PART One and PART Two like Kill Bill.  They really had to take a lot of the story out of it.  It is still very easy to follow and understand but it leaves you wanting MORE!!!  Although watch the movie until the very end of the credits, they are definitely setting it up for a sequel.  This will be one of those movies that most will not see for one or more reasons but when they happen to catch it for 15 minutes somewhere- They will go out and buy it the next day.<br /><br />For any Tarrantino fan, western fan, karate fan, action junkie, etc-  This is a great movie!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I DONT KNOW WHAT IT DOES ALL I KNOW IS MY DAD TOLD ME TO GET IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE INTERNET

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Can not believe the strength of this girl considering all that she had to endure.  I could not put the book down.  This book brought tears to my eyes from beginning to end.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I'm a moderate sci-fi fan (love Orson Scott Card, Hugh Howey), and this was my intro to Arthur C. Clarke.  I couldn't put this book down!  It was a beautifully imagined and engaging story of humanity's twilight years and of the Earth's place in the universe(s).  Based on Childhood's End, I can't wait to read the rest of Clarke's work.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is really good if u like the dragon slayer game u will like this if u didn't like the dragon game this game is still pretty awsome and u get people to help u fight

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband and I rarely watch TV but we buy DVDs of high-quality television series.... and Downton Abbey one of our favorites (along with the Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett).
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is a fantastic writer.  I feel like I'm living the adventure right along with Claire and Jamie.  This is a fast paced, exciting adventure.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Do not let the length of this book intimidate you.  You will fly through it.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Love this CD.  We play it all the time.  It reminds us of the past, when we were young when we play it!  Wonderful music!
B008YF5DQO|5.0|Unlike the biographer who wrote the biography of Warren Buffett, &#34;Snowball&#34;, Alice Schroeder - that I thought could have used a lot more editing, Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs (nearly as lengthy a book) was far better written. As such, the entire story was engaging and informative. Whether you are a Jobs fan or hate him, the story is an excellent one about an American icon.
1468179993|5.0|TED talks are great! TED talks are inspiring! TED talks are typically 18 minutes or less. I am a 35 minute preacher in a 20 minute church, you see the challenge. I thought the solution might be to simply speak faster, but people suggested I slow down. I was tempted to say, \\"Listen faster.\\"<br /><br />Then I heard of TED talks and became a fan of watching them, learning from them. TED stands for Technology Entertainment, Design. Even more it is a collection on their web page of outstanding communicators. When I saw Jeremey Dononvan's book, How to Deliver a TED Talk: Secrets of the World's Most Inspiring Presentations, I knew it was a book I needed to read.<br /><br />Like a TED talk, Jeremey cuts to the chase. His writing is focused, on topic, and directed to his readers. What I thought about TED talks (think Steve Jobs, think incredible visual presentations), missed the thrust of what they are ultimately all about. One type of TED talks are those with amazing jobs (pun intended). But there is a second type, ordinary people. I had thought TED talks would teach me how t use technology better to avoid death by PowerPoint to leveraging visuals in communicating. Turns out not all TED talks are visual displays, of the top ten watched TED talks four have no slides.<br /><br />The inspiring idea is what matters. Developing that idea to a catchphrase and staying focused from introduction through the talk to conclusion is the thrust of the book. Like a TED talk, Jeremy keeps the book moving. It's a quick read. Even more it has some great examples and excerpts from actual TED talks. Since reading the book it has been good to go and watch online and see how what I read works in the actual presentation.<br /><br />I give How to Deliver a TED Talk, 5 out of 5 stars. I not only learned much about making presentations, I enjoyed what I read, even more importantly I am applying what I read. Still have to hit the 20 minute mark in weekend messages, but I appreciate the tips to leverage the world's greatest message in a way that gets me out of the way so that lives can be inspired and transformed. As Chapter 14 says, \\"Stop reading and start speaking.\\"ge the world's greatest message in a way that gets me out of the way so that lives can be inspired and transformed.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Poignant, well-written, exhaustively researched, personable characters.  Highly recommend.  . . . . . . . . . . . .
B008K4JDLA|5.0|Another great work from Mr. Anderson. I totally recommend it to everybody interest on the relation between people, society and technology.
B000FA675C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book when it was first published and had to include it to my online library as well.<br /><br />Very interesting story and thought provoking.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|This is my second replacement set for my old Sony MDR-V6s; the cups are slightly smaller than the previous set, but they went on easier. They're comfortable and work as advertised. Like getting new headphones.
B0026977EK|2.0|I guess a typical Woody Allen flick, but for my money it was pointless. The movie ended really the way it started, and it seemed to me the characters didn't learn much from their relationships and experiences. It has a depressing feeling to it.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I use Avast on my computer as well. Easy install, cleaned up a problem with some spam that showed up.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book like all of Nicholas Sparks books, takes your breath away at the end. It has you heart feeling every emotion. It is a new favortie of mine.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I enjoy the show and like to see it again and again. I intend to get each season as it becomes available
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking Up Married, was a good book about love. I liked how he was looking for love but found it and like how it felt.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have read several Nicholas Sparks books and this one was entertaining but certainly not one of his better books. Sparks has the capability of using a far more sophisticated story plot and development of characters. The part in the story where Jo is revealed to be the lead's alter ego is the only worthwhile development to the otherwise seen it before-seen better love story.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|I bought this on Kindle because it was very cheap - when I received it I was thrilled to bits - it is really an excellent vegetarian cook book with lots of good ideas.  Ottolenghi does have great recipes - I have another book of his and have already used the recipes with great success.  I am sure that Plenty will give me lots of new ideas for the future!  It is a delight.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can I say about &#34;Downton Abbey?&#34;  I am one of the millions of addicted fans. Broad, sweeping historical fiction has always been my favorite, both to watch and to read. The precise detail of these British productions is breathtaking (I would be willing to bet they even have the correct money in their pockets!), and Julian Fellowes has created characters one can care about. If you like this genre, you'll love &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34;
B00BF11STU|1.0|I am deeply disturbed by torture in this movie. It is put out as a form of entertainment, zoomed in in detail and depicted as normal. What has America come to? This is a country that was a beacon for human rights and freedom. This is a country that is fair and upholds rule of law. It is disturbing to depict America so above international law, and use such cruel ways to get intelligence. Such arrogance would make more people hate America.<br /><br />The whole movie is slow and boring, and it seems the only action is in torture scene. Something is deeply wrong here. Should this be called a torture movie?<br /><br />How on the earth does this movie get Oscar nomination? I came to watch it because I trust Oscar's reputation. Should trust them again?
B00000FCBC|5.0|I like about 3 songs on the CD.  It is pretty heavy for me, but I actually bought the CD for my husband who loves it.

B000002IAZ|5.0|After hearing a song I liked on Pandora, I looked to see who the band was and found out it was Buffalo Springfield.  I had always heard the song, but could never think of the name etc.  So I bought this CD and I love it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|\\"I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn't something about you at all. It was just you.\\"<br /><br />Ok it's official, I will NEVER get tired of this book!! No matter how many times I read it, it never gets old, if it's possible I think I love it even more with each & every reread. Seriously, I am totally completely 100% irrevocably in absolute love with Travis Maddox & each and every one of his flaws & insecurities. And even though he sometimes broke my heart, I wouldn't trade him in for the world. Yes, I still wanna shake the hell outta Abby sometimes, she's so damn frustrating, but he loves her sooooo<br /><br />\\"I can't figure you out. You're the first girl that's ever been disgusted with me before sex. You don't get all flustered when you talk to me, and you don't try to get my attention.\\"<br />\\"It's not a ploy. I just don't like you.\\"<br />\\"You wouldn't be here if you didn't like me.\\"<br />\\"I didn't say you're a bad person. I just don't like being a foregone conclusion for the sole reason of having a vagina.\\"<br />\\"Oh my God! You're killing me! That's it. We have to be friends. I won't take no for an answer.\\"<br />\\"I don't mind being friends, but that doesn't mean you have to try to get in my panties every five seconds.\\"<br />\\"You're not sleeping with me. I get it. You have my word. I won't even think about your panties...unless you want me to.\\"<br />\\"And that won't happen, so we can be friends.\\"<br />\\"Never say never.\\"<br /><br />Abby & America (Mare) are freshman at Eastern, \\"Transplants\\" from Wichita. Abby is desperate to separate herself from her parents & their screwed up ways. Mare has been her best friend for years, so she follows to help keep Abby out of trouble.  Abby meets Travis (Mare's boyfriend Shepley's cousin & roommate) at one of his fights & it doesn't take long for her to realize she should avoid him at all costs. He's everything she wants to avoid- campus manwhore, fighter in an underground fight club called 'The Circle', tattooed, unpredictable & hot tempered. But Travis becomes unavoidable, mainly because he just won't leave her alone. He's drawn to her right from the start, but she makes it clear she won't become one of \\"his sluts\\". So they become friends instead. And when Abby loses a bet causing her to move in with Travis, they become much closer & the friendship lines start to blur no matter how hard she tries to fight it.<br /><br />\\"To being the only girl a guy with no standards doesn't want to sleep with.\\"<br />\\"Are you serious? First of all...I have standards. I've never been with an ugly woman. Ever. Second of all, I wanted to sleep with you. I thought about throwing you over my couch fifty different ways, but I haven't because I don't see you that way anymore. It's not that I'm not attracted to you, I just think you're better than that.\\"<br />\\"You think I'm too good for you.\\"<br />\\"I can't think of a single guy I know that's good enough for you.\\"<br /><br />Their entire relationship is unstable & volatile.<br /> When things are going well, it's beautiful & perfect.<br /><br />\\"I know we're f***ed up, all right? I'm impulsive, and hot-tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else. You act like you hate me one minute, and then you need me the next. I never get anything right, and I don't deserve you...but I f***ing love you, Abby. I love you more than I've loved anyone or anything, ever. When you're around, I don't need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one-night stands...all I need is you. You're all I think about. You're all I dream about. You're all I want.\\"<br /><br />But when things are bad, they are a complete disaster.<br /><br />\\"You're going to break his heart, Abby. You're going to break his heart! The one girl he trusts enough to fall for, and you're going to nail him to the wall!\\"<br /><br />\\"I wish you and Travis would just get your s**t together! You're a goddamn tornado! When you're happy, it's love and peace and butterflies. When you're pi**ed, you take the whole f***ing world down with you!\\"<br /><br />Lots of fighting, making up, drama, jealousy, possessiveness, heartbreak & tears.<br /><br />\\"A toast!\\"<br />\\"To douchebags!\\"  he said, gesturing to Brad.<br />\\"And to girls that break you heart,\\" he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. \\"And to the absolute f***ing horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her.\\"<br /><br />But underneath it all, they do desperately love & need each other.

B0060MYK7G|3.0|I have watched the first season and was looking forward to the second...Preordered.  Have had to return the set TWICE because,<br />as others have commented, there are Flashing White Lines on the disc and I am disappointed that I have not been able to watch<br />this wonderfully photographed movie. No guarantee that I won't be sent a THIRD DEFECTIVE DISK. What has happened to Customer \\"Service\\"?  Amazon's communication system is lacking and I am sent to the UPS facility to return yet another one.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I was not that familiar with the movie.  I assumed there would be a lot of civil war scenes, but the movie was focused on the politics of the day, particularly the 13th amendment.  Very interesting with a lot of parallels to today's political environment.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe, you make my life so much easier!  I can now get my patterns, documents, and EVERYTHING in a sharp, clear, printable layout.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I am not a fan of Woody Allen as an actor, but always admired his creativity. This film is a perfect example of that. He wrote and directed the movie and it is absolutely fascinating if you're interested in the arts and times of the 1920s. The protagonist (played by Owen Wilson), a successful Hollywood screen writer working on his first novel, is visiting Paris with his fiancee and her parents. One night his fiancee goes dancing with a couple they knew from back in California, but he doesn't want to go and chooses to walk back to the hotel alone. He gets lost in the streets of Paris. As the clock strikes midnight, a 1920's car drives up, stops, the people in the car convince him to join them, he gets in, and is driven into the past - the era that he feels is the Golden Age (the 1920s in Paris). He returns to the same place night after night and each night is driven back to the past where he meets the notables who lived during that time - artist, authors, sculptors, like Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Man Ray, Cole Porter, etc. Gertrude Stein critiques his novel; he is part of the inner circle. He meets a beautiful woman, a fashion designer, who has had affairs with Modigliani and other famous artists, presently with Picasso, and he falls in love with her. I won't go on because to do so I'd have to divulge how it all ends and I definitely do not want to do that. If you know anything about the arts of the 1920s, every time the protagonist meets someone else my guess is that you'll say &#34;Oh, my God&#34; more than once because the actors portraying those characters are so spot-on with their characterizations - at least from what I have read about them. The Hemingway character, for instance, is exactly what I imagine Ernest Hemingway would have been like at the time his first novel was published. So, if you're interested in seeing the notables from the past brought to life in the present, this is the movie for you.

0062238868|5.0|Good book very easy to read. Gives you an account of what really goes on with ROE's during war times.
B005HSL626|5.0|Always have loved games like this not too much to it but enough to always keep it interesting. Me and my kids have tournaments to see who has to do certain chores on the weekends so it has other purposes rather than just wasting time here and there...

B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter loves the TV show and this is as close as she is gonna get to play with the real &#34;My Little Ponies&#34; so she likes it we play it together once a day for 15 minutes then she is out of energy for the day and we move on to something else but she enjoys the time spent on it and likes to be in charge of some of her favorite cartoon characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and free keeps me entertained and very easy to play. Too p s I'm just doing this for the gems
B00BC5I6Q2|1.0|Nothing remotely groundbreaking or terribly piquant about this show. The smashing-the-fourth-wall narration is heavy-handed and quickly grows tedious. You've seen these characters before on better shows, albeit better fleshed out. It's a chore to sit through this muck. A root canal at a waste-water treatment plant would be more enjoyable than this mirthless dirge. There's no reason for this show to exist. None.<br /><br />Avoid.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is the best. I love  it its really cool. if you didn't play it your missing out on a lot of whonget the demo its free

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Raises the bar for dramatic television. Incredibly fast paced with great actors and memorable characters that makes all other television shows look dull.
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|I love the history in the story and Jane Austen gives you that. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are a great pair. I wish they didn't give a pass to Lidia and Mr. Wickham. I really didn't like them, otherwiese the story was great. The movie was also great.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like this app because it helps create noise to block out the outside noises.  It does what it says. It has a fair amount different sounds to choose from.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Love Jeremy Irons? As anticipated, he dominates the stunning second season of 'The Borgias--The Original Crime Family.' After watching Season 2 without pause, I wanted to see where in Season 1 the seeds of Season 2's operatic story line and character development had been planted. After watching Season 1 for the second time, I decided that this historic series, unlike its contemporary kin ('Sopranos,' 'Dexter'), was conceived as a single narrative arc from the outset of writing and pre-production. Nothing seems accidental, contrived, or 'over-the-shark.' In other words, I can't wait for Season 3. Five stars!
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|At first this game was difficult for me.  I don't know if it was a problem with my phone or me....but I kept trying and I finally got the hang of it.  I find it really entertaining.  I think this is a great app for people who want to be entertained.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I prefer the original temple run.  I get a little distracted by the background and I just don't like it as much.  Someone else might like it more, but it's not for me.
B009AMANBA|4.0|A wise Oscar prognosticator once said that you can't truly predict the Oscars unless you actually see the films nominated.  I don't always agree with this, but I understand that seeing a film can help you understand why the vote is going to swing a certain way.  I think that `Lincoln' is proof of that.  Up until Oscar night I was holding my breath for a Oscar shock to happen and the envelope to read Hugh Jackman's name, and I held out hope that that could happen.  Had I seen `Lincoln' prior to the Oscar ceremony, I wouldn't have had such hope.  No, Daniel Day-Lewis's steamroll through the critics' awards and Oscar precursors was a bizarre thing for me.  I just didn't understand why he was going to win his third Oscar so soon for playing such a seemingly un-baity character.<br /><br />I get it now.<br /><br />I'm not saying that I agree with the win.  In fact, I consider what Joaquin Phoenix did to be a greater triumph and he was the truly deserved winner, but despite all my preconceived reservations about the film and the actor (Day-Lewis can be far too mannered for my taste, and I find his depiction as the `god of acting' to be complete hyperbole) I was kind of blown away.  I didn't love the movie (a tad too stagey and Spielberg's impulse to go for the preachy was too present in some scenes) but I really liked it, and what Daniel Day-Lewis does was outstanding.  He pulled himself back, he took a deep breath, and he carried this film from start to finish.  I completely understand why he won, and it isn't a win I can fault.  He was a total force of nature, but not in the overbearing way, and he was so well rounded (the bits of humor were fantastically played).<br /><br />Sadly, for me, when Day-Lewis is not on the screen the film doesn't exactly motivate my attention.  I found Kushner's writing to be free-flowing, which was nice, but this was basically a collection of conversations and not all of them were particularly inspired, more like fundamental.  While I liked the spiced personality that was created in Lincoln (he felt like such a real person, which I was afraid was going to get clouded under the political eyes of Spielberg), but I'll admit that some of the humor sprinkled in key scenes felt out of place and unnecessary (Spader's reaction to seeing Lincoln felt out of place).<br /><br />The rest of the cast was well formed but I was not as enamored with them as so many others were.  They felt secondary, very secondary.  Whenever Day-Lewis was on the screen, this was very much HIS movie, and when he wasn't there I was waiting for him to come back.<br /><br />The format for the film itself worked for the most part.  The opening battle sequence was superbly staged, the development of the relationship between Lincoln and his wife (and especially with regard to their eldest son) was surprisingly deep despite being far from the center of attention, and the verbal spattering all over the courtroom scenes, while at times a tad overdone and repetitive, add life to certain characters (I'm still not sure what all that hype was over Jones' performance here, but he was a hoot juggling some of his lines).<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a good film.  It was both better and worse than I anticipated.  It was presented to me as a masterpiece, and so in that respect this really is highly flawed and doesn't live up, but in the back of my mind I was prepared to find this to be a total bore and was prepared for the worst with Spielberg's heavy handed direction, so in that respect I was pretty happy since I was never bored and Spielberg held back in many key scenes (although those bookends were atrociously overstated in the `Lincoln is a saint' department).the spiced personality that was created in Lincoln (he felt like such a real person, which I was afraid was going to get clouded under the political eyes of Spielberg), but I'll admit that some of the humor sprinkled in key scenes felt out of place and unnecessary (Spader's reaction to seeing Lincoln felt out of place).<br /><br />The rest of the cast was well formed but I was not as enamored with them as so many others were.

B007L5GDGW|4.0|This is a fun game, but it's not quite what I was looking for.  I get frustrated easily and this game really pushes my buttons.  I'm not sure if my settings were too sensitive or what.  Someone else might like it.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Having been a Boz Scaggs fan for years, and the name of the cd &#34;Memphis&#34; was my reason for purchasing this cd.  I'm so glad I did...love every minute of it!  My favorite song is &#34;Cadillac Walk&#34;!  Boz Scaggs is still bringing the great music!

B00B23Z2IE|5.0|I found out about Bradley in early January '13 through his backing band, The Menahan Street Band. Bradley was playing a few songs live with Menahan on a radio show in Seattle I think. A picture of him singing was on the thumbnail of a recommended video on Youtube and my eye was immediately drawn to his sorrow filled face. I thought the thumbnail looked weird because it was a high quality picture of someone looking straight out of the 60s. I'm glad I clicked on this randomly recommended video.<br /><br />Bradley was performing \\"How long\\" and damn that song was heavy. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. In 2013. Classic oldies soul. Bradley has the perfect mix of mellow grooves and the soul of Otis with the voice and catchy beats of James Brown. Immediately after I saw this live performance, I did a little research on him about his life and musical career and found out that he's signed to Daptone, a secret gem of a label which I honestly feel like I have unearthed. It looked like there was about 10-15 artists/groups, including Bradley and Menahan Street Band, signed to that label which include sounds of soul, funk, r&b, or a combination of the aforementioned.<br /><br />It's ridiculous how good this cd is (as well as his previous cd \\"No time for dreaming\\" if you haven't heard that yet). The cd starts off with a couple of upbeat jams and then slows down to a mellow groove with an acoustic tune following that with the classic vibe of a Four Tops or Temptations jam with lead and background chorus vocals. At track five, the cd picks up again with something like a Jackson 5 bass line and background vocal following. The cycle repeats with a couple more catchy upbeat jams, another slower jam, and at one point throws the song \\"Confusion\\" in with what sounds almost like a faster modern soul-reggae fusion dub influenced by Brown's \\"Payback\\" with echoing vocals and a phase shifted bass line. When I say the cycle repeats, I don't mean that negatively, only that it's more of his awesome soul, but in the same patterns or conventions of a typical pop/soul record which start with a few dance songs, a slow jam, a couple more dance songs, another slow jam, and a few more upbeat songs to close it out. As per usual with soul/r&b, most of the songs deal with love: the desire of it, longing for someone, being a victim, the blues, etc.<br /><br />As straightforward as his previous cd was, I think there is a little bit more experimentation with Menahan. My favorite part of soul has to be the bass lines and for the most part, this position in bands (as well as the other members usually) was dominated by African Americans. It's amazing that Menahan are a bunch of white dudes from New York and play this music so well. Everyone stands out in their own way and sounds very tight. It's clear these guys know a thing or two about rhythm. And they definitely wear their influences on their sleeves. Besides Brown and Redding, I definitely get a Booker T. vibe from the person on keys. So awesome.<br /><br />I don't think there is anything bad that anyone can say about such a record. Bradley has amazing range, Menahan has such a tight rhythm and groove, and the songs are hot fire. As a musician, oldies has got to be the most influential on my musical tastes and it is amazing one can still find such soulful and heartfelt music amidst all the crap that's on the radio and tv and sells out stadiums nowadays.s awesome soul, but in the same patterns or conventions of a typical pop/soul record which start with a few dance songs, a slow jam, a couple more dance songs, another slow jam, and a few more upbeat songs to close it out.

B004ULEEY8|4.0|The action kept me at the edge of my seat. Good CG, believable props, and a good plot. Only complaint is that there was a lot of propaganda but it can easily be overlooked.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|The New Kids On The Block return to their roots on this one, favoring the love ballads that made them famous.  I love it!  Survive You has a hidden track called Let's Go Out With A Bang.  The itunes version has a fun bonus song called Block Party.  The Target CD doesn't have Block Party, but has two other tracks not found on i-tunes: She's a Killer and With Me.  No matter where you get it, his album rocks!<br /><br />Their last album was full of youthful, sexy music.  This one's more on the romantic side.  If you loved I'll Be Loving You Forever and Please Don't Go Girl...this album is full of that kind of love songs.  Whisper is my favorite!  If you loved Hanging Tough and The Right Stuff...Block Party, Remix and Crash are for you.  They are really fun songs.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I love collecting disney movies, especially blu ray collector editions that also come with a dvd & a digital copy.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a really good series of movies. Each one has something to offer the acting is great and so are the storylines. This series is worth the money.  You don't have to be young to enjoy these.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I have seen Argo, Silver Linings playbook, and Zero dark thirty. By no means was Argo the best of these three movies, and everyone i know that has seen all three agrees with me.<br />Argo is a good, entertaining movie, but nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing that puts you on the edge of your seat, or dredges up any emotions really.<br />Zero dark thirty on the other hand, was intense and dramatic from start to finish, with an Oscar worthy performance from the lead.<br />Just goes to show you that the oscars are a joke, hollywood basically voted for itself in this one, because the movie was about how hollywood people helped the CIA get their people out of Iran. Self appreciation at its worst.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|I love Robert Pattinson ,saying that I can't tell you how disappointed I was after watching this movie. I fast forwarded through the end, it was that bad. The story was boring and the acting just so so . I would not waste my money on this one
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Excellent series. So glad I purchased it. My husband and I watched one episode every night. Can't wait for the next season!
B001453LSI|5.0|Listen to Melody speak from her heart to yours. She takes hold of you and won't let go. Haunting lyrics and sound. So powerfully gentle.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent novel capturing the incredibly difficult lives of those with mental health issues in a world that really does not provide adequate understanding and support.  A far superior story to that told in the highly successful film.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I love this movie. Its rare when I'm so emotionally involved with a movie. Had me crying which is embarrassing. I understand the movie is not for everyone due to the singing but its a great musical.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Once you start reading,  it's hard to put the book down.  Always wondering what's around the next corner.  It's very well written with an awesome story line.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I bought this book for book club. I read half in a weekend and cannot wait to finish.. Great book club book !
1476734941|4.0|So good, so far. Everything is working as written! I am surprised how I can fast and not feel like I'm starving.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|By far one of the best renditions of Les Miserables that I have seen. Very powerful and heart felt performances by Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway. Beautifully casted beautifully acted!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|i believe it was just alittle slow to start off..but end result worth the watch. I would not watch it again, but a good one time movie.
1400067820|4.0|Taleb's latest book is a unique synthesis of finance, economics, biology, philosophy, history, anthropology and political science. He creates and defines a \\"holy grail\\" which he names antifragile. Taleb describes a fragile world for which the optimum behavior embraces volatility, ignores Gaussian and Poisson distributions and uses an optimization curve that can best be described as a barbell.<br /><br />To give a prospective reader a flavor of the scope, substance,vocabulary and neologisms in this book, I've created a list of subtitles. Be warned that this book is high brow at times. Taleb probably ignored any recommendation by his editor to use words that would be understood by an average high school senior. Furthermore, if you are an investor, reading this book will not improve the return of your portfolio because very few investments are antifragile. In fact, you may sell you portfolio of stocks, bonds, ETF's, and mutual funds, move to a small country or city-state and become a farmer, landlord or restaurateur.<br /><br />This is a partial list of possible subtitles and I may add more as this book bounces around in my brain:<br /><br />\\"The History and Philosophy of Financial Options\\"<br />\\"The Barbell World of Nassim Taleb\\"<br />\\"Understanding Options Can Make You Happy\\"<br />\\"Thales of Miletus (624BCE-546BCE), the first options trader\\"<br />\\"Evolution Is Mostly About Options\\"<br />\\"Why Did Humpty Dumpty Sit On A High Wall?\\"<br />\\"A Skeptic's Critique Of Liberal Political Ideology\\"<br />\\"An Idiot's Guide to a f****d-up Financial World\\"<br />\\"Options Analysis in Literature and History\\"<br />\\"Wealth Creation Through Serial Non-fatal Mistakes\\"<br />\\"Epistemology, Fideism and Failures of Central Planning by Neomaniacs\\"<br />\\"Why Entrepreneurs Don't Need to Spell The Word BLUE\\"<br />\\"Superfragilistic and Antifragile: A Mary Poppins' Guide To Better Living\\"<br />\\"Understanding Naive Rationalism, Skeptical Empiricism and the Federal Reserve\\"<br />\\"Iatrogenics and Epiphenomena for Dummies\\"<br /><br />I have one minor criticism of Taleb's work. Taleb advocates thinking about systems in terms of nonlinear concave and convex outcome functions. He fails to consider discontinuities which appear regularly in nature. As a heart beats faster, cardiac output rises on a concave curve. Finally, the heart goes into ventricular fibrillation and cardiac output abruptly falls to zero. Other discontinuities occur when water boils and ice melts.<br /><br />If Plato were alive, he would add antifragility to his list of virtues which already include truth, beauty and goodness. He might also persuade Taleb to leave New York University, move to Athens and teach at his school.<br /><br />I'm not certain this is Taleb's best book, but it is definitely a worthwhile read for anyone who is willing to engage the erudite mind of Nassim Taleb.
B0041T4ML4|2.0|I have never struggled to read a book as much as I did this one.  It was filled with unlikable characters who did things that you didn't care about.  At first I thought it was clever how the author alluded to things that you didn't know about - but then when it became clear that you were never going to understand the world that the book was placed in, it became so much harder to read.  There wasn't enough context for me to truly immerse myself in the book.  Also, again, it's the George RR Martin school of &#34;if you like this character, he's going to die.  Everyone else is a bunch of traitorous jerks&#34;.  I couldn't take it.  I finished the book with relief that it was over.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Perfect combo of castaway and science.  If you don't like science don't read this. If you don't have a good sense of humor don't read this. If you like exciting fiction DO read this.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I can't think of another album that has come out within the last ten years that I enjoyed every single song.  This is truly a great album that deserves all the hype that surrounds it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is one of the best series for television that I've seen.  Intelligently written with good acting and direction for the most part.  TV worth your time.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|But it really stands the test of time.  I just watched it again with my daughter and we were both able to enjoy it.  The story is unique, the songs memorable, and there's a nice moral at the end of it.  A very classic movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What's not to love about TWD?!  I started watching this show because a friend recommended it.  I was skeptical because I typically don't like a lot of gore, but this is different.  This is just ghoulish, good fun!  Favorite character?  Daryl.  You know why.
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|I bought this for my 4 year old son and he loves the movie on the amazon kindle fire hd 8.9.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have always enjoyed mystery novels and the inclusion of historical details made this even more interesting. I'll definitely be continuing to read the Robert Langdon series.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|We use te app. all the time, at home and away. It has never let us down and kept us from some bad places that would have disipointed. My husband insisted we eat at a resturant even after it had bad reviews so I went but he was shown the light....TripAdvisor users were telling the truth! He is now a firm believer as well! Thanks you TripAdvisor users!
1780721676|5.0|The book is fantastic.  Lots of medical proofs, but not a lot of medical jargon.  I've been on a diabetic doctor's dietitian's 1600 calorie diet for 5 years and only lost 7 lbs.  Since I've started the Fast Diet 20 days ago, with my doctor's approval, I've lost 9lbs.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Like I have said before The show is top notch and the books are just as good if not better
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was extremely slow and difficult for me to get into at first. Half way through the book that all changed, totally sucking me in! I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a book you literally never want to put down, or end for that matter.
B002361MLA|5.0|I will read this book over and over again until I have mastered the ability to reach consciousness in the true sense of the word!
B008P9M614|5.0|Great tv show, what else is there to say? I bought this on sale at 84$, great deal for the complete series.
1451695195|1.0|The book talks a lot about the Drs reputation, credentials, him being adopted, family relations, etc., totally unneeded topics in the context of a near death experience (NDE).  I am open to reading/learning more about NDE, I do not believe that the Dr here describes a credible story, I think he wrote the book to make money.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. I kept waiting for some suspense. Over half way through it I didn't know much more than when I started.I almost gave up
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Was this written by Rice? I made it through five chapter?<br />The first sentance must be an entry for \\"worst ever beginnings\\"  \\"high in the low in the South of the West\\" or whatever, I mean,  come on. I tried this book on the Kindle reccomendation and have never seen it got so wrong.<br />The writing was ok at times, the plot appeared purile.  Example (spoiler alert) I think it was in one chapter? Our hero meets the kings magician, meets a giant mythical creature, gains magical powers with no warning and defeats said mythical creature. I expect writing like this from first timers not a supposedly experienced writer or was it written by a child accaintence?<br />Definitly try before you buy.<br />Sorry Morgan  but you can do much better.
B0019NG73G|4.0|Nice special edition. Worth a watch. Starts a bit slow but picks up. As long as a mini-series. The associated movie Gods and Generals is good too.
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|Much debate has stirred over whether or not William Duvall made for a decent new front man for Alice In Chains since the death of Layne Staley. Listening to this album from the perspective of a fan, I can say that they both have their good and bad qualities to them. But I am not here to discuss the difference between the two singers, I am here to say that this is a great album. Period. I have not found a single bad song here. Its style is very distinctively Alice In Chains, and Jerry Cantrell's songwriting is just as strong as in previous albums. William Duvall, despite being the new front man, only gets a couple of songs that will display him as such. This isn't necessarily a complaint, but I would like for Duvall to make a bit more of a presence in future works since I think he has a lot to offer.<br /><br />So for those looking to get into this band, I would actually start with one of the earlier albums (Facelift being my personal recommendation), and then go ahead and get into this. Beyond that, I say this is worth a purchase.
0393343405|4.0|Well presented and written...interesting, informative, but frightening.  I recommend it particularly to small business owners and those who have only a passing knowledge of our stock market.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was a great testimony, but he never truly explains in this book what happened to him and what he saw,  As a pastor and hospice grief and spiritual adviser I was looking for more proof to share the book,  I did in fact though recommend it to my nurse fields because they would understand the content of language he uses. It was a great testimony to one who never believed. Does he have a sequel? I would read that.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Movies lately just can't compare to The Walking Dead. The characters, the story . . . there is Time in a series to develop them completely unlike in movies. Other TV series are using the same format to excellent effect. Damn, I never thought I'd say the best entertainment would be made originally for television . . .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game but hate the adds they come up often... gets really anoying after a while ... would be nice if new upgrades were available
B0086700CM|4.0|my granddaughter loves it. She's 6. It seems to have less violence than some of the other games, so more acceptable to our family.
B00A4EDAN6|3.0|not the music though, the music was great but the production.<br />the vinyl sleeve is creased, the record skips and loops but after a few brush it got better but the loop it permanent.<br />the upper part is a bit torn.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Don't listen to the TV reviews; read the book. Lean In is to today's women in business what Betty Friedan's book was to women at home in the 70s.  Sandberg describes both the institutional sexism that still exists and the damaging effects of stereotyping on women themselves.  Much as the media wants you to think this is a successful woman blaming other women for their lack of success, it is really an attack on the maleness of corporations and the persistence of stereotypes of what women should be.  What I saw in AT&T in the 70s (and wrote about in Women, Power and AT&T: Winning Rights in the Workplace) still exists - just at a higher level.  We have miles to go before we declare the corporate landscape equal for women, especially at the executive level.  Sandberg tells it like it is, even for her, and gives women pointers on how to deal with it.  Really the change is not needed in women but in the institution and the behavior of men.  Women, however, do need to be aware of what is happening, and that is where this book excels.<br /><br />I admire Sandberg for telling the truth about life in the corporate world and for fighting to change it.  In the 70s we too had circles - consciousness raising we called it - even inside the corporation.  Women do need to be aware of their environment and of how they are perceived.  Awareness leads to behavior that both improves your chances of survival/success and opens the way for others to succeed.<br /><br />Hopefully, the Lean In effort will inspire a revolution in business that will finally get us to equal opportunity.

Your rating is so low because you aren't giving us these little may make us want to buy it!! For an example, there's a compass. It will locate your respawning place. If the shore is it then how would you get back to your house? Think about this please while making verison 1.21.20.

B007IK44CK|4.0|I've seen all the Mission Impossible movies and I always think that with the next release, the quality will fade like so many &#34;series&#34; movies. This movie however is not like that. Cruise brings a good story to the screen and even though there are a couple of slow spots the movie keeps you interested and I found myself saying out loud, &#34;this was a really good movie&#34; when it was over. I don't often do that.<br /><br />It's a good action movie, not dominated by CGI, no mooshie sex, just a good action movie. I liked it and hope you do too.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Everything is as it was described. Currently watching my Blue Ray discs now and love them. The package was in perfect shape upon arrival!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought one of these for my brother who said it was fantastic, worked incredible. Sharpens like bigger tools. Very functional.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I have loved this musical for years!!  I am sorry there wasn't time for the &#34;Harvest Moon&#34; song.  But it was still good
0446580848|1.0|IF I wanted to read a travelogue about Yemen, I'd look in the travel section. If I wanted non-stop wise cracks, I'd read P.J.O'Rourke. If I wanted one dimensional villians, I'd read Dan Brown or watch an old Bond movie. It boggles the mind that this book took two years to write and does little more than continue the slow spiral in DeMille quality since 'The Gatehouse'. What happened? I mean, I get that Corey, Brenner and Sutter are essentially the same character, but was that any reason to ruin Benner, the most likeable of the trio, by marginalizing him to a smitten puppy sidekick? Sure, NDM has written some stuff I don't like (Spencerville and Talbot Odyssey), but can this really be the same guy that gave us The Gold Coast, Charm School, The General's Daughter, The Lion's Game and other great works of fiction? It's like Hendix coming back to life and covering Bay City Roller's songs.<br />Now I'm hearing we have to stomach YET ANOTHER shrill Corey story to make it four crummy serials in a row?<br />I learned my lesson now. No more NDM's as they are released. If I fall for this game again, it'll be at the used book store. If the next is like The Panther, I doubt I'll have to wait long.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Very good writer, story very riveting, cannot put down easily.  Will read other books by this author.  Recommend this to those who like detective, spy thrillers, it will keep you reading.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a huge James Bond fan, especially with Daniel Craig as Bond. He does a fantastic job as always, and the storyline was really great. It was even better once I realized the guy who plays Voldemort is in it. It was a sad ending, but it was a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Daniel Craig, James Bond, or just a good action movie.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Again story was hard to interrupt.  Very well written and would recommend this book also and will find other titles to read by this author.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Love the movie and the delivery was so quick, I let my son watch it the day it arrived.  Liam Neeson is great and the story itself is very poignant.  Thank you
030758836X|3.0|I really wanted to love this book but I really couldn't.  The ending sucks big-time.  It was long and pretty drawn out.  It is sad what marriage can come down to.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|My older kids like this movie but my younger ones had never seen it until Easter Sunday and now it is one their favorites
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagen is a genius and this album didn't disappoint. First, the CD arrived in perfect condition. There are so few tracks but each of them great. How can Fagen manage to continue making music that sounds so new yet feels so old at the same time? He's a master!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because I love horses but it is a real operttunity to learn how to treat a horse properly!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This movie is a challenge to several stereotypes. Touching and heartwarming it is about two unusual men who come together and develop an unique friendship. One a black immigrant with a criminal history and the other, a wealthy quadriplegic. Good flick!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A must have as a follow up for Seasons I and II.  Again, the acting is wonderful, casting perfect, clothing just amazing.  All in all a wonderful series and well worth the watch.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|I got this for my 2 1/2 year daughter. We put the decals on her wall together and she loves it. Just got it so not sure yet about how long the decal to remain sticking on her wall. Nice product, worth the price.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Beautiful scenery, great acting, great costumes all go to make for a great series.  Well worth watching for everyone.  It's a hit.
B00BP4SJKI|4.0|Clearly this movie has the stereotypes of its time but, it is still a great story that kids and adults can enjoy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am really not a huge fan of the whole post-apocalyptic genre but this book was really, really excellent!  Thank you Hugh for the ride. I look forward to reading much more about this world. Wow. I think I drove my daughter crazy raving about how freaking good this book is! I highly recommend it.
0307346617|5.0|Received it yesterday and could not put it down so far a pretty good read if you into zombie based genres and definitely worth the chance as I been a fan of Max Brooks for a long time own most his books still by far my fave is the Survival Guide and so far this one is impressing me :)
0061673730|5.0|Philosophy. Art. Motorcycle. Such a good book. I learned that I am a motorcycle rider. Instead of a car rider.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|(*SWOON*) TRAVIS FREAKING MADDOX! (*SIGH*)<br />This is absolutely one of my all time favorite books. I've read this book twice already and cannot get enough of it. Travis and Abby are two of my all time favorite people. They are amazing together. Their connection is beyond anything I could ever envision.  I loved Abby's laid back attitude and her fight. She was very strong and determined.  I loved Travis' love for Abby. There were a couple of times (One imp-articular) that all I wanted to do was slam my kindle in his face. I was so disappointed in him although I guess technically he didn't do anything wrong...but morally...yeah he effed up big time.  Travis was sexy as hell...a fighter through and through. Fights hard...Loves Harder.  Everything he does...he does with an intense passion. I loved his attitude and personality.  Everyone in the book was amazing. Just writing this review makes me want to read it again.  I can't wait to read Walking Disaster.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app I have. Use it all the time and you can download many versions. Sometimes they will have additional ones for free if you have an email on file with them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i love this show.  It is very entertaining with its expansive story line.  I'm hooked and can't wait to see more!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Loved Harry potter books w my children, but couldn't get thru this.  Too many characters, boring storyline, rarely quit books, but I had to quit this one. Sorry JK.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I have watched this dvd several times and have  been been thoroughly entertained every time.  Stevie has matured into a multi talented top notch performer.  There are few artists out there today who have reached this caliber of performance.  Stevie is the bomb!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I like the results of adobe reader but I have had some problems with it and the firefox plugin failing occasionally.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|He requested this item for Christmas and he uses it frequently.  He's very happy with this product.  I'm sure I'll be purchasing more Smith's products in the future for him.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love this game!  It is challenging and has wonderful graphics. I find myself trying to better my scores whenever I find a few spare minutes during the day.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this game is great till you get to the end you either have to work hard or buy the gems to finish which I would never do. Also this game is not up to date at all, the one on the apple market has more options and the google play market has even more so why cant this one be up to date?
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Not only a story that should be read by everyone, but one so incredibly well written that you cannot put it down once you start.  One note: bring tissues.....
B001N1DPDE|4.0|The BK2 is built like a tank a meant to last in a true survival situation. The blade is a quarter inch thick. This is a hefty slab of steel that can be used for all kinds of tasks. It's not well suited for finer delicate cutting, for that you should have a secondary smaller blade knife and then you would be covered in any situation.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Not a movie buff, myself ... a topic will bring me to rarely see a dramatization of real events or public figures in film. I actually loved this movie for its glossy overdramatization in grand Hollywood style. This is truly an adaptation and not reflective of all the facts but that's expected. Yet, it was fun and so \\"Hollywood\\" in a charmingly formulaic way. How to turn a hostage crisis into a feel good flick -- only Hollywood and especially Ben Affeck can do so well! Being a patriot I tend to appreciate any interpretation of history long needing to be revealed. I would have given 10 stars if available for the bonus mini-documentary of interviews with the real players in this rescue mission -- and also the credits that closed the film beautifully with a dedication to Tony Mendez's deceased son, IAN who passed away in 2010 of cancer. Enveloping in now: a quote from a Washington Post article including an interview with Tony Mendez (the real operative.) Here's a quote from the man himself! ...\\"Oh, absolutely, it brought back the emotions,\\" said Tony Mendez, a retired disguise specialist in the CIA's office of technical service. \\"I went to screenings in [Los Angeles] and Toronto, and it was just like being there again. Both times. \\"There's nothing so final as `Wheels up.' [On missions], we always were waiting for that wheels-up feeling before we broke out the Bloody Marys.\\" ... This is a compilation/composite of the real people and actual events but it speaks of truth.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Surprisingly entertaining for Mom and Dad.  Both my 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter really enjoyed it.  A well thought out and great movie.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This dude sounds sooo much like the late great Michael Jackson. All three disc are one point. If your looking for real r&b I highly recommend coping this. Nuff said!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I am not a young teen, I won't say my age but I will say this this book is for all ages. If you like DRAMA, suspension, love and vampires you will enjoy this book and SERIES.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I purchased this game to use in my Kindle Fire HD. At the end I got for free because somehow it was covered once I purchased the kindle. My two sons (9 and 17) love this game. You need to tilt the kindle to make the action figure go the direction you want, very innovative and intuitive. I works perfectly in the my Kindle.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Wished I hadnt purchased on my kindle. One of those books you display in your home library you know! I am so looking forward to part II and cannot wait till it comes out on film. Yayyy
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's hard not to like a Grisham tale.  This one has an unusual number of fun twists and turns. I'm glad I got this one.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I have not yet read one of Sophia Kinsella books that have not by far amazed me with how crazy funny she must be. Its the perfect romance comedy every single time
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Having worked on several committees, boards, and councils I agree totally with the premise of this book.  Introverts are the true leaders of the world focused on solutions rather than self promotion.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Life slows down, danger seems less imminent, which gives the cast time to explore the good and evil in each character. I learned to love my favorite characters more and validate why I hate certain others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didnt think it was going to be as good as it turned out to be, it was a nice surprise.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I only began watching Big Bang Theory this year and instantly fell in love with the humor and characters. It is awesome to have this first season downloaded on my iPad amazon player so with the push of a button I can instantly be transported to my happy place no matter where I am, wifi or no wifi.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|The sound quality of this mic is very good, pics up light buzzing in the background but nothing editing software cant remove. The clip that is suppose to hold the mic onto someone is a joke though, does not attach to the mic at all so you end up having to fashion it to the person yourself. Last thing I would say is there is no directions. Someone buying a mic can look at that statement and say really? Why do you need that but for a beginner it can be annoying opening this up and finding nothing.<br /><br />While there is some negatives for the price this is a great mic and for interviews does a excellent job. Would definitely recommend if you are about to do an interview and need a cost effective mic.
B004TI5N38|1.0|So boring that I couldn't' even finish it. Yes it reads just like a Reacher book. That wouldn't be bad if it was an interesting read. But it's so bad that I couldn't even finish it. I'll stick to his other series.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|watching it once was enough for me. gave it away
B003ELMR9E|5.0|SPOILERS:<br /><br />A great thriller from Christopher Nolan, \\"Insomnia\\" focuses on a corrupt police officer Will Dormer(Al Pacino) called in to assist pursuing a killer (Robin Williams)in a small Alaska town. When Dormer shoots his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) by accident during the pursuit, he frantically tries to cover it up as a younger, local police officer (Hilary Swank)begins to piece together what happened. Dormer isn't really sure after being sleep deprived if he did it by accident or on purpose.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Although \\"Insomnia\\" wasn't written by Nolan (like most of his films), it fits the type of morally complex thrillers that Nolan has directed since the beginning of his career. Al Pacino gives a great performance as Dormer the L.A. cop troubled by what he's done and what waits him back home. Williams gives a chilling performance in what amounts to a supporting role in the film. The film was adapted from a script written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaer and the American version keeps what worked so well in the original 1997 film but also allows Nolan and Pacino to bring their own personalities to the project.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer looks exceptionally good with nice detail, depth and accurate colors. There are some minor problems with edge enhancement and ringing that crop up from time to time but, on the whole, this is an extremely satisfying presentation of the film.<br /><br />The audio is a stand out as well with a strong 5.1 DTS mix. The long silences, atmospheric effects, dialogue and  David Julyan's outstanding moody score all benefit from the presentation here.<br /><br />There are also subtitles English,French, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German.<br /><br />We get a terrific commentary track from the director with an unusual presentation on Blu-ray which I don't want to spoil particularly if you're a fan of Nolan's work.<br /><br />We also get scene specific commentary from Swank and the writer of the American version of the film Hilary Seitz along with Wally Pfister (who the film), the film editor and production designer. Each provides some unique and intersting comments that nicely compliment the film. This scene specific commentary runs just under 45 minutes.<br /><br />We also get four featurettes on the production of the film that, while short, are informative but they are presented in SD (and are ported over from the DVD).<br /><br />There's also a single deleted scene and a stills gallery presented in HD.<br /><br />\\"Insomnia\\" is an exceptional thriller with a strong performances by Pacino and Williams, as well as, terrific direction by Nolan.<br /><br />Highly recommended.k and the writer of the American version of the film Hilary Seitz along with Wally Pfister (who the film), the film editor and production designer.

B00C4Q4Q4O|5.0|I just love this show !!  Finally a good show with Vikings.  I hope it stays on a long time and is not cancelled like other good shows have been in the past.  The acting is super and I love Regnars kick ass wife she can cook and kill at the same time. Casting did a great job with the actors and thankfully they do not have a lame script to follow.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|We bought it for our grandson to watch when he come to our house and he was very happy with it.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|These books are a little simple minded, even for the target audience. That being said not nearly as terrible as those vampire abominations being published.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Dark in terms of color and in terms of subject. I liked it and it is well worth watching multiple times to pick up nuisances I missed in previous viewings.
034544678X|5.0|This was one of the first books I read on training dogs. What I learned in the first chapter (getting a dog to safety/chasing) is one of the best pieces of advice to date. I can't tell you how many times I've stopped and helped strangers capture their loose dogs running in the street. I wish I had this book w/ my previous dog. There is soooo much common sense here that she shows us, for ex., how we might think some things are hard to teach and break the bad behaviors that we have created unknowingly. Our dog, Khloe a Cane Corso, was unintentionally trained to bark & bark & bark & wouldn't leave our bed if we so much as whispered \\"who's here?\\" due to how we used that just to get her out of our bed, until she figured it out....This gave us great insight to what we WERE training vs what we WANTED to train her to do. I still go back to this book as a refresher.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Wow.  Just wow.  The Phoenix project really puts IT and DevOps into perspective.  A great, fresh view that really helps awaken massively good ideas.<br /><br />I've already been recommending The Phoenix Project to many people in the IT field - and so many of them can't put it down.<br /><br />Just amazing.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I found it very funny and loved most of this book's features. If you have ever had a cat, you could clearly relate to this and laugh your a** off. If you have not owned a cat, you might still find it funny weither you like cats or not!
0061703087|3.0|Let me start by saying that Michael Crichton is a genius when it comes to research. In saying that, I mean that he obviously does a TON of it before he writes on a subject...which is good. There is nothing more frustrating than to read a book that obviously doesn't care that is making up technology to justify it's premise. Where Crichton bothers me is that he feels the need to share ALL of his research with you, even when it doesn't move the story along. Several points along the way, he will go into extreme detail about tangent science and biology right in the middle of the action. Some explanation is good. Too much of it lags the storyline. He also writes out full source code (twice) that is gibberish to most readers and that apparently doesn't even mean anything to the storyline or to the main character. While I'm sure the code is accurately written, only code writes will care. I would have been satisfied with \\"As I looked through the code, I couldn't find anything that would cause the anomaly.\\" All in all, it's a fun read and you can get immersed in the story pretty easily...just watch out for plot holes and technobabble.<br /><br />**(SPOILERS BELOW)**<br /><br />I felt like the characters were believable enough until people started dying. Life and death situations are interrupted with phone calls from home dealing with arguing kids. It also seemed as though the main character was more worked up over helping peripheral characters try to survive than his own wife. As much as Crichton poured into science and biology on this work, you felt as though he didn't spend much on emotion and humanity. You never even cared when someone on the team died. The long buildup of the main character's love for his wife throughout the beginning fades into a rushed, \\"Too bad. At least we got the bad guys!\\" at the end. Great research and premise...low humanity and relatability.
B005K17RU0|1.0|what a lousy update. what was a great weather app is now easily the worst app. I hope you hi design team was sacked and sent to work in the salt mines.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|I can only say I will be watching this cinema extravaganza again at least a large number of times. I know I missed a number of scenes that were beyond detail description. It was amazing & the storyline was so full of twists & turns I can't begin to believe I have seen it thoroughly enough to put it away.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved the book, all the imagery from the zoo, India, the Ocean, Richard Parker, even the algae island.  It's as if I heard the waves lapping in my own ears!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was just so happy reading this book. Loved the 80's pop culture references, and enjoyed the character development. I recommend this to all scifi fans.

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I keep reading because I keep hoping for more.  For me it is a slow read.  I am still reading it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was well written and a pleasant read.  The plot is steady throughout, although it is quite predictable.  I would consider this a textbook romance story.  Two strangers think they have something in common, get married on a whim, then keep trying to break up but they fall in love anyway.  One nice feature is getting the points of view from both main characters throughout the story.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the way the author captured the dialogue beyween the characters. The story showed friendship, joy and the horrors of an Irish orphanage. But it was also humorous. Chapter 28 made me laugh out loud. If I'm having a bad day I just go back to that chapter and laugh all over again.
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? It is part of the suite of must see 80's movie. I love Molly Ringwald.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We saw this in the theater and it became the must own movie in our house! No children under 20 live here so if you love animation and twists and turns in the storyline, you'll love this movie. It may rate as the Indiana Jones of animated movies!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I love using this paste. It never hurts to use the better paste for a dollar when you are replacing the cooling fan on a laptop. For the extra buck you get a much better head dispersion and I am sure it will help make the cpu last longer.
B004V9MU86|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It took me a little while to warm to the theme but it was worth persevering.. Overall it gave a great insight into the characters who suffered through living through the Nazi regime of WW2 . The author has a different style of writing but he is successful with his particular way of writing. I ordered another book by this author as I thought he wrote a good story which held my interest throughout.
B003FK8V7G|5.0|The great thing about Gaslight Anthem records is that they grow on you.<br /><br />The '59 Sound is a tough album to top, and like a number of other listeners my initial reaction to American Slang was lukewarm.  Sure, it's good, but...it's just not The '59 Sound!  I wanted that record all over again.  But that's how it works: bands grow and stretch out, their sound changes, and sometimes you get a different record than the last.  But as I said, Gaslight songs grow on you.  That's how '59 hooked me in the first place, and over time I've developed a significant appreciation for American Slang, too.  It sees the band growing and trying new things musically, but it still retains some of the character and imagery that made The '59 Sound so appealing.<br /><br />I've been listening to the newest record, Handwritten for awhile now, and while some of the songs from it have gotten stuck in my head, I've come to the conclusion that, in my personal opinion, American Slang is The Gaslight Anthem's most mature album.  Not my favorite, mind you; that is and probably always will be The '59 Sound.  But American Slang takes some of the best cues from '59 and takes them further, experimenting and playing with new ideas while retaining that essence that made the previous album such a hit.  It's well worth taking the time to let American Slang grow on you.

B009LL4LMM|4.0|It's kind of goofy at first, but it becomes more challenging as you go-as is the case with most games. The game's story line is really ridiculous. You are trying to bounce the  jelly fish to safety,collecting feathers as you go, because this jelly fish decided he wanted to fly.  Right. Anyways, if you enjoy trajectory games, games that incorporate strategy, this game is really fun. Just ignore the stupid plot. lol. Since when have Jelly fish been able to rationalize anything, let alone decide they want wings? It's a lot like Angry Birds, in this user's opinion.

B0014D6PCO|3.0|Fair acting, fair special effects, not too great over all.  For a batman movie it was pretty good, but judging it against other movies in the genre it is just fair.<br /><br />Streaming it over Amazon Prime Video was great.  I am very glad i did not pay theater prices for it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great read!  I used to read books over and over. I havent done that in a very long time.  I think I will read this book again!!
B004NS710C|5.0|He must have watched this movie 20+ times before I got the DVD.  It's one of his favorites.  Lots of action, of course and a good cast.  He definitely loves it.
B004PGO25O|5.0|A great butt-kicker of a book, no matter what you're trying to accomplish! Right up there with &#34;War of Art&#34;.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|And somewhat depressing.  But a decent portrayal of what might happen should we ever be faced with a global epidemic like this.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Enya is like no other artist out there. This album skims off the cream of a long time favorite group.<br />A few of these tunes I already have but that's ok.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I ordered the items as used. The boxes were packeted well and all arrived in good condition.  Have not watched all the dvds yet, but so far all work fine.  One season looked like it was brand new.  I would order from this seller again.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Being quite the romantic, this whole series of books took me to another world everytime I picked one up to read. I finally had to give up sleeping to finish book 4. I love the detailed descriptions and the ending was just right. I was happy and sad when it ended and I miss the characters.
1476733953|4.0|Bought on impulse, read no reviews, and was pleasantly surprised and thrilled by this new author and his beguilingly dystopic world.<br />About halfway through, I sat bolt upright and thought to myself, \\"It's the City of Ember - for grownups!\\"  There are major differences, but enough similarities that I smiled at the thought.<br />One reason, perhaps, to compare this to such a popular children's book, is that although the story is intricate and satisfying, there really isn't too much \\"adult\\" content - no sex or violence to speak of, and although other reviewers may disapprove (I purposely STILL haven't read any reviews yet until mine's written), I found that kind of refreshing.<br />I know I'm going to sound like an old person when I say this, so you'll have to take my word for it that I'm not, but in an age when most authors and filmmakers feel they have to ramp up the brutality to shocking levels, this book delivers a gentle, plot- and character-driven, classic science-fiction scenario.<br />I, for one, enjoyed it very much (finished it in a day, much to my disappointment; I was hoping to buy myself at least a couple days' reading), and I'm looking forward to seeing what Howey comes up with next.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This is an excellent book. I loved everything about it. The characters, the storyline. Gripping through out and til the very end.<br />This is perfect Lehane style. The movie was also good actually. Lehanes, Mystic River is awesome also.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I like Mahjong and I like free that is why I downloaded this app. However, free is not everything. This app froze my Kindle Fire everytime I went to make a move. I tried to report the issue and it would keep freezing up. I uninstalled this app and everything else works fine on my Kindle Fire. Would I recommend this app NO!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|this was and is a awesome movie, I wished they continued the show after the last season though.. but all in all every season was 5 stars!
B001GH63IE|5.0|I have about 4 of Engima's albums this is one of my favorites. The price was good as well. All the songs are great! If you like Engima's music you have to get this album it is so different and enjoyable.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have never watched the tv show which i have heard great reviews about but the book is awesome. The way the characters develop is outstanding and i like the fact that nobody is purely evil or good but, all just people striving to live. Great book. A lil longer than i was use to but definitely worth the read.
098357670X|5.0|Book of excellent quality, both material and content. I recommend to anyone who likes to draw cartoons and enjoy. I am very satisfied with the product.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Great music! A unique and sweeter-voiced combination of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen (and a little of the Beatles.) Brilliant writer and amazing album.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|Rafa is a great tennis player even and a person as well. It's nice to know something from his life, to get to know the long and tough way how he get where he's now.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Outstanding musician and great songwriter. Am in love with his music. He is varied, wise, unique - and eminently listenable-to!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy to use! Yet very entertaining. I would tell others about this game. My grandchildren like to help me play. They are 3 &amp; 2 lol
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is very close to the book except for the too-modern ending.  The casting is perfect, the English settings are lovely.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The Adventures of Doctor Who are wonderful.  The are exciting and thrilling Scifi.  The story lines are as good as it gets.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this series to everyone. Its a great 3 book set and ends in a good place which is nice they all don't Now a days.
0345803485|5.0|This book was great. I love reading ficition and have ordered many books from Amazon over the years. This book was truly a great read. Not to mention the service and quality of the book were great. For anyone looking for a page turner this is a great read. You can really feel Chrisitains character in this book.<br /><br />I received this book in a timely manner and the book was in perfect condition. I will always order book from Amazon.
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock is a really great modern interpretation of Arthur Conan Doyle's books.  Incorporating new technology and modern life into the stories while still maintaining a believable plotline.  Good job BBC.
B005ERWYH6|5.0|Adele is amazing. I enjoy her voice no matter which song is playing. I have she a very long time at the top.
B003TTKB5I|4.0|It was good. Only a few minor problems overall. It was enjoyable but sometimes had some playback problems when watching.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I was always wanting to see this move. I heard guys at work talking about the underground part. I bought it, I of my favorites.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I really liked this movie. It was different, fun, and eccentric. I loved how it was shot also. The colors were great. The acting was superb! What a great cast, all the way down to the little boys. Definitely a must watch!
B002436WFI|3.0|When I seen the trailer of this move on other moves. I thought that it would be really good. Little did I now the best parts was on the trailer.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Very funny and smart movie! Loved all the wild west references, very well executed. Just not entirely sure why the bats blew up upon crashing... Like they were fighter jets or something!
0790740443|3.0|When I read about this move I like Kurt Russell. So, i took a chance on it. It was okay. Wouldn't watch again
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Great movie. Though there were some historical inaccuracies. Beautifully shot and terrific acting. I highly recommend you rent this.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because there were some streaming issues however...
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I hear the songs on the radio and her voice, and the way she tell a story is amazing. I am a big fan.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This is a good movie. It provides insight into that time that was a new experience for me and informational. Audio was hard to understand at times, but maybe it's my old ears.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I would watch is every time I could find on tv. I thought as much as I like it why not buy the disk.
1451629184|5.0|The Jaycee Dugard story is one of the most sad stories you will ever read about a school girl who had her life stolen by a monster. Read this book. It's difficult but she needs to be heard. The world needs to know about her suffering.
0007271239|5.0|This is a great read. It's one of my favorites this year. It's a heart-warming story with some laughs, some tears, with racing as an interesting metaphor for life. Read it!
B00005YUFK|5.0|I feel for all you folks who are left to listen to this only on cd, or, please whomever help us, mp3. I actually first heard Masekela on Paul Simon's (now a long time ago) Graceland DVD. I was introduced to Hope on the 45rpm 200gram vinyl edition. It is, by far, perhaps even with such as Brubeck's Time Out, one of the most treasured in my collection. Masekela is a brilliant artist.
B000065V42|5.0|My 8 year old grandson had a ball watching this movie, they just don't make them like they use to!
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I seen this a few times through the years and it is very good, but I didn't buy it from Amazon. I don't know why they are asking for my opinion.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This is a really good movie and enjoyed it.<br />I have to write 10 more words and don't what more I can say.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a great app that it's fun, time consuming, and easy to play and understand. I love this app.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is a really good movie and enjoyed it.<br />I have to write 10 more words and don't what more I can say.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|One of the most absorbing books I have read in awhile, a fascinating insight into the unfolding of world advents that lead to the First World War , easy to read with a great story line, I thoroughly recommend.
B004EPZ070|5.0|OMG! I love this movie! I have watched it at least a dozen times and will continue to watch it over and over. People don't like it because of the cheating and insecurities in the characters roles. This movie is how life really is. Very good movie.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I felt this was a good movie. There were a couple of parts I will have to rewatch again as they were a bit confusing to me and didn't make sense. But that was me. Overall I felt it was an enjoyable movie. Anyone who liked the original Star Trek, it's fun to see how it all began in this movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|kept me on the edge of my seat ...after each episode wanting MORE..MORE ! Love all the actors ..they are all Oscar winners !! HOW DO YOU SAY ADDICTED ???? SONS OF ANARCHY that's how. Kurt Sutter is amazing .Please don't stop !!!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I really got hooked into this series by the 2nd season. I personally find it very entertaining and look forward to the rest of the series.
B003M70O5O|5.0|FELL UPON THIS SHOW DURING SEASON 5 AS I WAS FLIPPING THROUGH CHANNELS ...LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT!!!!! HAD TO GO BACK AND WATCH FROM SEASON 1 THANKS TO YOU AMAZON !!!!! KEEP IT COMING KURT AND FX !!!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I had heard good reviews from my friends about this show so I decided to watch it. I wish Alfredo had a bigger role, and Sherlock can be an ass, but it's good. I also think that Joan and Sherlock need more character development, but the show is headed in the right direction. Good job.
0385349831|5.0|There is always a book, or an author, that changes your life. Even though sometimes it might be just a little bit, it just changes you. That happened to me a long time ago with The Alchemist, and since then, I've been a huge fan of Paulo Coelho's books. I have been expected his new book for a long time, and I have to say that it didn't disappointed me. \\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" is brilliant, because it exposes in a simple but yet deep way some of the most interesting questions ever. Indeed, the book is structured through questions, and that makes it simple but great. It is so basic, but so profound at the same time, that I think that I will read it again! As usual, Paulo Coelho writes (with majesty) about some of the most important values, such as love, change or faith.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The story was great. It was not what I expected. This was a pleasant surprise. Kept me wondering. A must see.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|i see this being my daughter's new best friend! it is so perfect for little ones to hold onto but also soothe themselves with... genius idea!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book!  I could not put it down.  Great storyline and characters.  I'm usually good at figuring out how a story will turn out but in this case the ending surprised me.  It's very well written and the author sure knows how to keep the reader guessing.  I highly recommend it.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Really easy to use and very good sound. I use it mostly through my stereo<br />but have also used it with the USB in to the computer. Either way, it works great.<br />At times it seems to get a little rumble when turned up...but that my be that<br />it's too close the the amplifier. I works for 78's by using Audacity to record at 33 or 45 and then changing the speed to 78. Kind of a round about way to get there but it does work.
030759565X|5.0|I work in a library and very rarely buy books. I ordered this the day I brought it home. Could've been the lucious photos.The recipes and instructions are exceptionly clear and easy to follow. And the author's voice is so companionable and chatty that you feel she's sitting at your counter as you cook. Her smittenkitchen.com blog is worth following.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|It was just as expected. The book is an account of Feynman's memories, ranging from his childhood, into his physics to his personal life. The personal tone behind every line of the book is what brought excitement and hours of entertaining reading until the end of it.<br />For me it is the best biography (although not the most complete) of Feynman the kid, the man, the physicist, etc...
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|i have been hearing only one song by this artist and I wanted to hear more.  I love the instrumentation and the rhythm.  Great collection.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|It was good read. Enjoyed movie more though book was more detailed. A little too detailed and a little boring
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book was an excellent example of the common man seeking out the meaning of life.  Harold is every man and easy to identify with in some ways although he has suffered a loss that not everyone can relate to.  Harold is attempting to rise above it all and realise what the important things are in life.  It is a heart warming tale!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Love the littlest pet shop. The animals are so cute. And it's a good way to relax, playing with the puppies.
B0010KHOS0|5.0|I wasn't raised with country music because I am of Spanish origin, but because of my personal musical diversity I bought this movie that did very well for Joaquin and Reese.<br /><br />What a great movie!! and this sentence is an understatement. One thing I just know as a professional musician even though I am clean and always took the art form very seriously, is that in music, no matter what musical style you play, there is always drugs knocking down our door.<br /><br />Drugs killed Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Parker, Whitney Houston and many other great musical legends. Fortunately for Johnny Cash with the angelic help of June Carter he got over it.<br /><br />To anyone that reads this so they can understand musicians a bit more because musicians are very unique beings - very sensitive as we transform our feelings into MUSIC. Unfortunately, the music business is very hostile and cruel. Sometimes the demons from our childhood hunts us down and lead to our own self destruction like happened to Johnny Cash because of his father.<br /><br />It is a common saying in MUSIC that the roads of excess lead to the Palace Of Wisdom. I don't know about that. One thing all music styles have in common is the drugs are always there whether you want to or not. If you are strong enough you can still be successful no matter what and discard them.<br /><br />I'm very thankful to Hollywood and John Cash Jr for bringing us the story of his father just like Clint Eastwood filmed BIRD so many years ago here for posterity.<br /><br />There are so many music stories like this one yet to be filmed that should be told for future generations.<br /><br />Johnny Cash was a door to door salesman and thanks to Sam Phillips form SUN RECORDS got a record deal and then he moved up the ladder and became thanks to his talent over time - JOHNNY CASH.<br /><br />One thing I noticed that happened to Johnny Cash, just like Richard Nixon, is that the demons from his childhood chased him through his career and in Richard Nixon's case to the White House.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film by one of the greatest musicians of our time and it made me a Johnny Cash fan. I have to buy the cd LIVE AT FOLSOM PRISON that is one of the most important recordings of our time.<br /><br />Last but not least, thank you JOAQUIN PHOENIX and REESE WHITHERSPOON. They possibly did the best performance of their respective careers in this movie.<br /><br />RATING 20<br /><br />RAY ST JOHNn Richard Nixon's case to the White House.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film by one of the greatest musicians of our time and it made me a Johnny Cash fan.

B003XQM2YU|4.0|We enjoyed this flick.  It wasn't spectacular, but was a good twist on the story and fun to watch.  I recommend it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love shopping on ebay. Having the ebay app just makes it so very easy to shop as well as sell.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Love this show when I was in my teens but didn't know where to watch the reruns so I got the DVD. I think the price is cheap considering it's the whole series! Got a note in the box that says some of the music were not included in the DVD due to licensing reasons but I didn't mind at all. It was still pretty enjoyable to watch..
B005TKD512|2.0|To much self evident explanations, it became boring at some point, although there are some good ideas. But you have to be very patient and pass the very simple and fatiguing parts.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|The transfer on this dvd is much better than the transfer on the original issue dvd.  It looks and sounds much better (in my opinion).  I haven't checked out the special features because I don't normally watch them.<br /><br />Great movie, great price, if you like this movie buy this version...it's definitely \\"economically viable\\".
B00992CF6W|4.0|Woud like to have a few more details in the game play.<br />Hints, clues, guidelines..might be nice.<br />In the game. not elsewhere.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My only question is when is R.R. Martin going to put out his next book. A song of Fire and Ice (book 5) tied the series together for me.

B00BI73CVI|3.0|Very disappointed in sound track. Not Michael Crawford or Broadway quality singing in the main characters-Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy.  This story is well crafted and held my interest through all three books.  I would recommend it.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My four year old granddaughter LOVES it.  After I loaded it, I read a review that said it was worthless, but so far it is a hit in our family.

B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This book reads more like a novel but goes through all of the ITIL steps without the reader even recognizing it. In fact, I noticed how much the book and processes matched to my experiences in the IT field over the past 15 years.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book. It would make a great movie as would all John Grisham's books.i recommend this book . I could not put it down.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|5 stars because I did not want it to end..Now I am looking forward to seeing the movie to compare.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't get enough of Downton Abbey. I'm so glad I started watching it. I'm the type of person that gets hooked and this hooked me.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great read...I was really getting into the book when the flight attendant made me turn it off to take off.....I sat very impatiently until I could turn it back on.
B003MC5N28|3.0|It was a very good story line and always kept you wondering. I'm still unsure if I'm going to read the rest of the series.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I like having a place where I can store all my photo's and Amazon's cloud drive doesn't disappoint! The generous 5 GB of free storage is great too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an amazing show from start to finish. They throw many unexpected things at you. Can't wait for Season 4 to start.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book! GREAT story with many twists and turns. Great writing and easy to read. Can't wait to read more by Colleen Hoover!
B008D30K7E|4.0|Well written, easy to read, with unexpected twists. Gives a different view of major global events of the past century, which I found  entertaining and quite ironic. The Hundred-Year-Old-Man is definitely an anti-hero.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I was so excited when my copy of  Breaking Dawn part 1 (Extended Edition) DVD  in the mail that I watch straight away and LOVED IT EVEN MORE
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Giving it one star is almost a gift. If I could, I would give it 1/4 of a star or even no star at all! I have been waiting for this review request to arrive so I could take the time and write exactly how much I hated this. Yeah,...I'm not happy with it (or did the title of this review give it away?).<br /><br />I have no idea why I purchased this book. Maybe it was temporary insanity coupled with a twitchy finger. I guess since I was &#34;in between&#34; books and wanted something to tide me over until a new release came out from an author I recognized. It showed up on my Amazon recommended reading list  and I figured &#34;Why not?&#34;. Wow,.....I truly wished I had &#34;tried this book out&#34; before I bought it. Then I'm pretty sure I would have never pushed the &#34;buy now&#34; button. If I had bought this in hard copy from a &#34;brick and mortar&#34; store I would be tempted to try to return it for a refund. Heck, even of they didn't take it back I could at least have the brief pleasure of burning it in my fireplace.<br /><br />In my honest opinion this book was childishly predictable and utterly a waste of time. The characters were 2 dimensional and no time was given for their development. The whole pace of the book felt rushed and incredibly juvenile. It's absolutely AWFUL.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Interesting game but needs some extra games inside of this one.  Nice art rendering.  Otherwise well done but a tad boring.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Chbosky really captures the emotions of a teenager without it feeling like it was written by a teenager. So easy to read and even better watching the movie afterwards!
B000050XEI|5.0|Good price and arrived on time . We play this CD all day a never tire of it . We will buy more of her albums.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|I recently caught up on Merlin through Netflix and became pretty obsessed with the show. Luckily for me I was going to London over winter so I would be able to watch the fifth season as it played in the UK instead of having to wait in the states.<br /><br />What I ended up seeing broke my heart. Merlin is a great show, especially the early seasons. This season though was not worth my time. As happy as I am that Gwen and Arthur tied the knot and are happy, I was very sad by the hurried way the producers decided to wrap up the THOUSANDS of loose ends that have come to pass as the show went on. First of all, Merlin should have revealed his magic to Arthur AGES ago. The fact that producers waited until the last possible minute for that to happen was horrible. There should have been more of a result. Arthur, although pigheaded and annoying at times, loves Merlin and he should have come out with it ages ago. The choices made by the writers and producers boggle my mind. I don't understand why they would choose to honor the original legend in some ways and then subvert them in other horrible ways.<br /><br />The rushed conclusion was very sad to me as a loyal viewer. The way Mordred changed was horrifying but also predictable. I know the point is that we can't escape our fate but the problem is that Merlin could have and acted stupidly. So much of this was his fault that I could barely stomach the ending. I liked the perceived bit of hope at the end but it was so frustrating and I felt could have been wrapped up better.<br /><br />I just wish that the ending had been more gratifying instead of hurried. There was no reason they needed to drag out everything to the very end. Also...there was no glorious Camelot. There were three years of fake peace. The promised ending that I wanted was not granted. I love the characters and will always treasure them and there were some parts I enjoyed of the last season but all in all the end is a disappointing and almost lame finish for characters I viewed as friends and smarter than they turned out to be.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and he has another winner in The Fifth Witness.  I look forward to the next novel featuring Mickey Haller.  The behind-the-scenes look at the legal world is fascinating.  I can't wait to see what happens next in Mickey's personal life - much as I have enjoyed following the author's other main character in the Harry Bosch novels.
B009AMAGQM|2.0|I was really excited to see this movie. I wanted to se it at midnight which wasn't an available option where I live so I waited until it came out and when I finally saw it I was very disappointed. I want to preface this review by saying that the casting was phenomenal. The main actors were perfect. I can tell they are going to do amazing things in the future and the fact that the main girl is actually Australian threw me for a loop. Her southern accent was fantastic and she plaid an American southerner very well. The actor that played Ethan was similarly wonderful. The two had great chemistry and I thought the casting was wonderful. The other characters as well were perfect and played right into what I imagined they would be. Jeremy Irons as Macon was inspired and watching him play off the incredible Viola Davis was a lot of fun. Emma Thompson clearly had a lot of fun with her character. Also, I love Emmy Rossum and her interpretation of Riley I thought was better than that in the books.<br /><br />Now for the bad...<br /><br />I was pretty shocked and dismayed by some of the changes they made in the movie that go beyond creative differences and turn it into a completely different story. I will admit that the book at times was hard to get through and had windy story lines that needed a little big of \\"Hollywood-izing.\\" However, that does not mean you can just completely rewrite the plot and create gaping holes. The differences between the movie and the book has been fairly covered in the reviews but my biggest problem is with the changes on the integrity of the book. I agree with a lot of the changes that they made ie Ama being the caretaker and the librarian and even the cute ending with Ethan and Link in their civil war costumes. However, the changing Ethan's memory thing, while living up to the theme of sacrifice, does nothing in the fim but convolute it and make room for gaping holes. Furthermore, the death of the main evil character was astounding to me. I double checked and the actors are signed on for any potential (although probably never going to happen) sequels to the film. They are contracted for more films but I don't see what these films could possibly be about considering they changed the film to effectively make any later films obsolete if they are to be based on the books.<br /><br />And then the ending, having Ethan drive off and them remember seems so shallow and fake. The movie is trying to make a deep point and comes off as lame and confusing. I wanted the big pay off. I wanted the couple that could get through anything. Instead I got a character who wanted to take the cowards way out. Furthermore, how powerful is Lena? She would have had to change EVERYONE's memory...not just Ethans. And clearly Ama does still remember. i was just so confused.<br /><br />I would see the movie again and even buy it but thats because I love the characters and I love the book. However I woudl probably skip over the frightful ending which ruins the integrity of the film itself and the book.
B0082JYEEO|5.0|I have been meaning to buy one of her albums for a while, I adore Regina Spektor. When I first heard this, I was instantly in love! Every song has a distinct sound and her lyrics go from quirky and strange (in a good way!) to deep and powerful. I think the standout track for me has to be Rowboats. I disagree with the notion that she sounds \\"mainstream\\" or like a sellout. I really would like to see these other washed up pop stars write lyrics like she does. On their own. Definitely plan on buying her other albums!

030746363X|5.0|Unique concepts, easy to read, seems that the concepts expressed by the author work in many of the people I know
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds. Angry Birds Rio is a refreshing break from the omnipresent green pigs. The music is fun too.
0345803485|5.0|I AM in LOVE with this book i got it yesterday after waiting almost 2 and a half weeks I usally get my stuff in 5 days but I can understand since it is coming across the world (I am deployed) This is just what i needed to get my spirts brighter the images how she paints the scenes I know why there is so much stuff going around about this book. It is alll true every woman should take a weekend to get lost in this wonderland Great for Deployments away from my husband :)<br /><br />I can not say enough good things just bought the other two books and the journal They cant get here fast enough
B000002J1U|4.0|It would be an over-simplification to say that this is Led Zeppelin with light and shade. Yes, we do get some acoustic numbers but this is as much about the band experimenting as anything. Deep Purple also had an overlooked album in Fireball around this time and I really enjoy both of them for the same reasons. I often wondered whether they over-reacted with IV after copping criticism for lll, it being more commercial. This is a wonderful diversion and keen fans need it. One-album fans will get Mothership anyway.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I loved it because you could actually play bingo and also because you could choose however many cards you want and also because it has a lottery
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Others have covered the details. This album is simply a joy to listen to. No hits, but a strong song cycle and despite some reviewers I can't find a weak passage on the album. Selling England By The Pound has great individual songs, whereas Lamb is the archtypal seventies album designed to be listened from start to finish. For me it's the band's finest work, and you'd never know they were fracturing at the time. I would argue that neither Gabriel nor the rest of the band ever released a cohesive work like this again, although they both did some great things. Strangely, what irritates me is that the remaining three members of the band don't really rate this album as high as many fans. On the reissue interviews they talk about its faults, but I wonder if the behind-the-scenes tension has coloured their view of it. Is this a lesson in how to make a classic album without thinking that you can/have?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 because you feel like your actually running and sliding and dodging logs too I loved it
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have enjoyed all 5 books in this series a great deal.  I am generally not big on fiction but I could not resist reading the entire series after watching the first season on video (starting with book 1).  The quality of the writing is fantastic and the plethora of characters and plots keep you on your toes.  I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys epic tales, i.e., Ken Follett's, Pillars of the Earth, etc.  You will not be disappointed.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. So much better than the hunger games or twilight. I totally recommend it to young adults everywhere.
B009YQJ322|5.0|the violence goes right to the heart of megacity 1, seems like a pretty sad world but probably very real to many people today
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just obtained the Bible app this past Sunday (Easter) and have not used it too much yet, but I am definitely very pleased with it. I installed it on my Kindle Fire. I like the ability to search the entire Bible to find the book, chapter and verse you are looking for. I also like the ability to compare many different versions of the Bible, and to make your own notes. I can see myself using it a great deal from now on.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I've had the pleasure of attending every single All Starr Band tour since 1989, seeing each line up, hearing the great songs, and have collected every CD and DVD release from them. Further, I was privileged to have attended this very show at the Ryman in July of 2012.<br /><br />That said, I can tell you this might well be the best band he's ever taken out. Sure, some of the earlier casts may have had more \\"marquee\\" names, and arguably even stronger catalogs to draw upon for the set list. But as a BAND - musicians playing cohesively and creatively - this group was the strongest. With prior ensembles that have had some of the great guitar players of the classic rock era (Randy Bachman, Nils Lofgren, Joe Walsh, Dave Edmunds, Peter Frampton, Rick Derringer and many others), Steve Lukather standing right up there and even surpassing them really says something. His playing - especially on the Santana songs sung by Gregg Rolie - is awe inspiring. Cross coverage on the vocal spots, most notably by Mark Rivera, further underscores how tight and polished these guys were. The mid-show guest appearance of Joe Walsh (\\"All Starr Band, Class of '89 ... and '93\\" - sic, it was '92) is an added treat.<br /><br />Of the several dozen shows I've seen by the various Ringo/ASB lineups over the years, this one was in the top two or three (right up there with another birthday show - his 70th, when Sir Paul joined in the proceedings).<br /><br />Absolutely the finest DVD (so far) from Ringo's travelling roadshow.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This film is focused on a difficult subject.  Nonetheless it is executed perfectly on many levels.  It provides insights about life and living applicable to most of us who live with far better circumstances than does the protagonist.  It is the type of movie that you just sit there at the end with the credits rolling, thinking about what you just saw.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am an avid follower of the Harry Bosch series.  This is one of the best I have read.  I missed a few appointments because I couldn't put the book down.  It made sense all the way through and the plot kept me hooked.  Great story.  Great writing.  Thanks.
006224454X|3.0|It was just ok. Way too long developing the story. I was saying, ok I get it, now please make something happen, please have the characters do something other than what they've been doing for the last 60% of the book. It was a bold concept but stumbled at the ending.
B004RZGUBM|1.0|There was no complete table of contents rendering it virtually impossible to locate any individual novel of Dickens. The book was not readable and I would  question other volumes from this this publisher offered by Amazon.com.
B00000DLVA|5.0|This CD is amazing. I highly recommend it to everybody. The music, the lyrics, and the melodies are elevating. Moving.<br />I have known of this band for 20 years, and I am very happy I finally found this product.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game. Great graphics. I just hate when things are forced ie: a facebook login and in-app purchases. They prohibit me from truly enjoying and getting addicted to playing (at that time I would be more likely to connect my facebook or purchase gold bars). But whatevs. Cool for the time being.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|It is a shame not to be able to find this type of music on the radio stations. Love this band. Can't get enough of it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great sequel to the first book, which left me wanting more. I also purchased the final book, hope its as interesting
B007B5EDEG|3.0|I am slowly ploughing through this book. The author appears confused about the audience, it's hard to work out who he was targeting, the writing is fairly basic, but the language and story line is so crass in places, that you wouldn't want your teenage children reading it. I will get to the end, but it is a struggle and I wouldn't buy any further books of this author.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was surprised by the ending.  I was happy to see they are going to rebel against the &#34;status quo&#34;.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I purchased the purple and it is very attractive.  The feature that turns the kindle off when you close the cover is awesome.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their unit safe.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|works as well as adobe photoshop on my phone. more convient on the kindle though. works great for its purposes.
1616550414|5.0|Great book. They could make a sequel to cover the other games more in-depth. i would by that one too.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Warwick Davis' commentary was fascinating. I enjoyed the movie but the commentary added much.  The supplier was great about promptness of delivery. Well worth the time and money.
B0087EACJK|1.0|When I swiped left and it jumped right, I knew I wouldn't have fun \\"playing\\" this game. After restarting the level, trying to jump right made him twitch on the screen like someone being electrocuted. At that point, I knew I would be uninstalling this crAPP.<br />It made my \\"remove from cloud\\" list.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Phantom Orion's \\" Baring Drive \\" track provides a free spinning  tip that also provides 7 minutes of spinning.  I got this because I heard that it is a balanced stamina type.  Unlike other stamina types.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Seeing the movie, I felt compelled to read the books as well, hoping to find more information and complexity. Those, I did not find, as the books are pretty straightforward, rather poor in background information and details, yet they are so well written and the action is so fast-paced, that I could not put them down easily. In my opinion, a must read for teenagers and adults alike, a series which is sure to entertain and captivate you, undoubtedly to become a classic of its genre.
B005IXSN4E|5.0|What more can be said? This album is perfect in every way, from start to finish. If you disagree, then you're lame and I'd rather not talk to you.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I personally thought this was the finest of the three men in black movies. Very much enjoy the concept of time travel and also storyline that they came up with.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|I've always hated Leo Di, but he is a class above in this film. I avoided watching it this long because of him, but now that I've given it a chance, I have to say this movie is absolutely phenomenal! Still in awe at how good it is and I watched it three days ago! Give it a shot, you'll see what I mean.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|After seeing this wonderful movie in theater, I knew that I had to have the DVD in my collection.  It is a gem which I will view many times.

B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie has now become an all time favorite for my son & I.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen it since it arrived, but I can tell you that we've watched it together at least 3 times and I've seen it by myself at least twice!!  Way to go on this one.  I wouldn't recommend it for tiny people....maybe kids 6-10.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of my favorite books, by far. Definitely recommend this to anybody interested in history. I could reread this book multiple times.
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|This album contains some rock that reminds me of the 80's Asia supergroup and then towards the end of the album a kinder, gentler Asia with more of a modern sound.  This album contains themed songs, but not some of the big, worldly themes, more on a personal struggle or meaning level.  I love hearing how Asia has changed their style but not the sound of John Wetton's voice.  If you are an Asia fan, this is one of the albums utilizing the original line up and I think it pays off.  I was torn betwen rating this a Like (4 stars) and a love it (5 stars).  If there were a 4.5 star setting, that is where I would place it.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Using this along with the DSS amp for the PS3! Perfect sound! Can hear enemies meters away from me perfectly and can pin point targets like an absolute beast! It's so good that I'm being called a wallhacker and whatnot! Thanks! :D
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game I play it with my daughter every day .she loves it too.we love the animals too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Everyone in my book club loved the book and found it hard to put down.  Can't wait for the next one!
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|No offense intended, but British guys ALWAYS make the best bad guys.  I don't feel like it was a big character stretch for Chris Pine to take on Jack Frost either.  You'll find other reviews that go through the storyline and discuss the premises behind the movie, but if you watched the trailer, found yourself intrigued by it, snickered inwardly, then you'll enjoy the movie.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable is awesome - it saves my usb port for data transfer and charges a bit faster than the usb cable that came with this device.<br /><br />I would love it if this cable were able to transmit data AND charge the device.  Thanks!
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|I found myself disengaging after about 30min to go and work on the computer, only half watching it until about 20min from the end.  Probably better off just going back and reading the book.
006114665X|5.0|Heavy-duty book filled with facts previously unknown. History lovers will find this fascinating, if slow, reading. Great reference book too.
B000FC1KBG|2.0|i was hoping to read about EASY schedule & hoping there would be an outline/sample to follow & give more details about the whole eat, play, sleep routine... i was disappointed with this book...
0385344333|2.0|\\"A Wanted Man\\" is a rare mediocre entry into the Jack Reacher saga.<br /><br />The set up is promising. Reacher, trying to get to Virginia, hitches a ride in the middle of nowhere. In classic form, he gets in the wrong car at the wrong time . . . for the bad guys.<br /><br />\\"AWM\\" reads like a Kindle short story that got extended into a full-length novel. While offering clever twists and reversals and reveals, \\"AWM\\" wears out its welcome with poorly-realized bad guys (at the end - the initial setup in the car features great potential for mayhem and nastiness), a bizarre setting for the climactic scene, and not one but two women who are Reacher Girls. (Reacher Girls, invariably too good to be true, are a version  Bond Girls.  They are tough, gorgeous and don't use much makeup or jewelry to enhance, smart, and focused on the task at hand.  Usually she gets into bed with Reacher - but only once.  It helps the story when there's only one in the book - here there are two.)<br /><br />If the book had stopped with the scenario of Reacher in the car with three people, then the book could have been terrific.  But the ending is so far removed from that promising start that I just couldn't care.<br /><br />If you're a Reacher fan, go ahead and read it, but it's hardly an essential addition to the series.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter got fed up and quit playing it because the game requires you to buy stuff (with real $$) to do much of anything. I got rid of it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|A friend pushed me to play this game. Glad I did. Hours of fun. Hooking it up to Facebook was a snap.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game for my grade-schooler. The animation is great, very realistic and there seems to be lots of options for kids to explore when they play this game.  It does freeze up once in a while on my Kindle.
055358894X|5.0|To me this book was like Ocean's Eleven: Won't win any Oscars, but still one of my favorite out there. Nobody is going to mention this book next to titans like the Wheel of Time Series or LOTR, but it has got some of my favorite characters and is an enjoyable read. The characters are well developed, with back stories and personable traits, but Lynch isn't scared to twist the plot or put down the hero hard like some cliche' novels might. I could write an extensive review, over-analyzing characters and giving you rhetorical analysis of the plot, but I feel that would defeat the feel of this book: lighthearted, entertaining, and engrossing. It's something that reminds you why you love reading and will keep you up late flipping the pages.<br /><br />Call me a sucker for plots like this, but if you liked movies like The Italian Job or any of the Ocean's Crew escapades, I have the feeling you'll love this book as well- In my mind well worth the five stars and 7 bucks.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Enjoyable movie.  Will look  forward to viewing more now that I know how easy it was to find them there.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|This series is really the best out of all Stargate's series. It's very easy to watch through them all and still want more! I'm currently re-watching it for the fourth time and couldn't enjoy it more! Syfy shouldn't have stopped so soon with it!
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This was a good read.  It gives alot of different perspective and things you already know but need that little reminder, now and then.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was a very very good book never saw what was coming have read it twice would read it a third time

B004EAFQG0|5.0|What I enjoy about Catfish is that as the story begins to unfold you have certain expectations about what your feeling towards the characters will be. Both the film and my opinion of it change in such a dramatic way. A definite must see!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|So relatable -<br />Will see it many more times! It is fun to watch the comedy in my own life played out in a movie
0066620996|5.0|Easy to read and full of hood ideas and real world examples of success in Corporate America. I would recommend highly
1451695195|4.0|Although there are lots of medical terminologies that might require some research on the part of the reader, accepting them as correct because of the author's medical background is easy, and I found the book fascinating and comforting.  I would have liked more descriptions of Heaven, as comprehended by the author, but am satisfied that his story is true.  As an 86 year old man, my interest in the after-life is growing; this book became a large part of my faith in after-life existing, a very comforting feeling.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is a great movie and really makes you appreciate what people in the military sacrifice every day for our freedom
B009NT0I06|5.0|Well my daughter already loved Taylor Swift Soo much, and she has also loved vinyl records for a long time. When I saw this I just new I had to get it! When it came in and I showed it to her, she actually started crying! :)
B00BYOEMTQ|1.0|did not enjoy almost 4 hours long - I guess if you are a Hobbit fan you would like it but with so many component of the story it became difficult to follow for a non Hobbit person.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie depicts a great part of American history. Everyone should watch this movie. Superb cast. It is an outstanding flick!
B003B02O7I|3.0|This book had a lot of detail of characters that I think was unnecessary at the beginning.  Then the ending, I thought should have given more on the main character as to what happened next.  Otherwise good reading
B008MM9630|1.0|I downloaded this for my daughter and managed it for her while she was at school. I got so addicted,I had to buy a kindle myself just to play. After funding my fairyfarm account for crystals at over $100 to buy dragons at a discount in the special offers box it immediately disappeared and only came back after a level up. It never showed the dragons for sale again, only creatures that were never needed for the quests. After 2 weeks of of daily emails to support group of fairyfarm still no response. Amazon can't fix it, since this problem can only be fixed by fairyfarm developers. It's a really good game, just don't waste your money on it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you haven't read this trilogy, then do not hesitate to get all three books and enjoy. They are compelling, witty, dramatic and...sensual. The characters are very well defined and real. You'll love this story!
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|This is one of A-Ha's best.  It's proof that their break-up was premature.  The title track in particular is just beautiful.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the King that the Hand is busy. Gotta say that quote just once. This is a great show, but not as good as the books of course. They do most of the characters honor (except Qhorin Halfhand, who they just butchered) and the environments are just eye candy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|To strange for me, story just did not hold my interest nor did I like the ending. To much hype about the book
0345803493|4.0|I wasn't a fan of the first book, but am so glad I gave the second a chance. In Fifty Shades Darker, Christian (our fantasy man, the sex god, the physically flawless human being with athletic ability, musical prowess, an amazing family, a scattering of houses all across the nation, some helicopters and private jets--and of course, pilot licenses for both vehicles--AND a gajillion dollars) agrees to vanilla, agrees to sacrificing himself for Anastasia as much as it pains him, because that is the depth of his love for her. The emotions in this installment of the Fifty Shades series are mind-blowing and the implications of what Christian is giving up just to keep Ana around, devastating. I found this book so much more enjoyable than the first, and actually--dare I say it.... liked it.<br /><br />Mr. Grey's dangerous past and lingering associations haunt his current relationship with Ana, indicating their love may be geting more dangerous--darker--than ever. As he becomes more and more dependent on her in a way he's never felt with anyone else, he realizes he must exorcise the demons of his past in order to achieve a fulfilling, worthy future with the lovely (okay, not so lovely) Miss Steele... even if it damn near kills him.<br /><br />This book is richer in both content and in emotional resonance. It consumed me, and once I really got into it, I couldn't put it down! Things actually happen, things other than the same love scene over and over again. Well, maybe that's a bit of a stretch. The BDSM is once again a huge letdown, but you heard me complain enough about that in my first review, so I'll restrain myself on that matter. The sex scenes are still repetitive--in fact, they're identical, just with different locations (table, bed, helicopter) and different occasions (birthday, Monday, Tuesday...). So, sadly no improvement whatsoever there.<br /><br />But where I did see improvement, was in the two main characters and the relationship between them. There's actually growth among them; the previously boring, innocent Ana finds a way to surprise even herself, while mercurial (quote, unquote) Christian learns to trust, as much as it hurts him. The exquisite unraveling of Christian's agonizing childhood and the psychoanalysis on how it's made him they way he is today... this... THIS will break your heart. Ana only wants to kiss those scars that are so deeply embedded into Christian's flesh but even she may not have that power. The way he gives himself to her so wholly because of how much he loves her, is what made me cave.<br /><br />Now, as much as I was engrossed in the stirring conflict of emotions, this book is far, far from perfect. I fell a little in love with Christian through his weak, needy portrayal, but I can't say this very confidently, because there are bigger, better things that made me want to puke on him, instead. Even Anastasia recognizes he has more money than he has sense; throughout the entire book, he is terrifyingly bipolar, a control freak, and demonstrates multiple personalities--in other words, pretty freakin' scary. He suffocates Ana in affection and \\"compassion\\" to compensate for his behavior, but what the eff? You can't swear at a girl, and then buy her a car and stick your tongue in her love hole (my new favorite PG word for snatch) to make it up to her! It doesn't work that way, Mr. Grey, you prick! But alas, apparently it does work that way--the horrendous result of both James's unbelievable portrayal of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, and of Ana's idiocy.<br /><br />Brace yourself for a fangirly (or anti-fangirly) rant: ANA EFFIN' STEELE, the incriminating reason why Anaïs Nin is tossing around in her grave at night! I'll give you this: I do respect her a bit more after reading Fifty Shades Darker. Not when she returns to Christian obviously, but because she has her moments where she just plain kicks butt: hater butt, Christian butt, filthy perverted boss butt--all sorts of good butt! She actually stands up for herself (for once!); I was proud of her for her assertiveness. But aside from her glittering moments, I wanted to spank the crap out of her. I don't know if James has deliberately created the most dislikable female character on the planet, but she's done a great job at it. Also, I noticed Ana orgasms pretty much at the slightest breeze. Christian looks at her love hole and she orgasms. Christian says her name and she orgasms. Christian touches her shoulder and she orgasms. Ana is a dolt and I don't know what Christian sees in her; it pained ME to have to read this whole book from her perspective.<br /><br />Oh, and they've known each other for a good five weeks and they're saying vows? What the actual eff, this was probably my biggest problem with their relationship. No one can commit or develop proper feelings that quickly, especially if they're doe-eyed and virginal like Anastasia, or fifty shades of effed up like Christian. Sigh... James fails in the realistic factor again. (But then again, Christian buys Ana multiple designer cars, a bunch of houses, ancient wine, antiques, and is solving world hunger and is a doting boyfriend. We never guaranteed this book would be realistic).<br /><br />I also find it ver strange they call each other by their last names: Mr. Grey this, Miss Steele that--are they from the 19th century? Well, Ana could be, given her lack of any sort of worldly experience (i.e. relationships, sexuality, email).<br /><br />Okay, my rant's over, I promise. So. Aside from the outraged ramble you've read above, this book had many redeeming qualities that made me enjoy it. As flawed as the main relationship is, you can tell Christian really does love Ana; it's just that he keeps pulling her into unbearable situations, forcing her to face things she shouldn't have to. Ana is smart enough (just barely) to realize this, but not strong enough to resist it--which keeps her from leaving the toxic, all-consuming relationship. They are both enshrouded by doubt that they are wrong for each other and that they don't deserve each other... and they're absolutely right, except that they have one thing in common: unbridled love. And this is what will keep them together.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker ends breathlessly and on a lingering note. I SO want to read Book 3. Let's keep our fingers crossed it doesn't disappoint!<br /><br />Pros: Much much MUCH better than the first one // Deep emotions // Character development (it took 1000+ pages, but James still did it!) // Darker, more alluring, and more thrilling // There's actually a plot // Suspenseful because of life-or-death situation both Ana and Christian are thrown in // Romance is actually palatable<br /><br />Cons: Placid sex scenes // Awkward big words thrown in elementary writing // Stiff dialogue // Exasperating narrator... Ana is a moron in every which way // Sorry, but Christian Grey is still a weird prick // Unrealistic. Duh.<br /><br />Love: \\"What I feel for you frightens me.\\"<br /><br />Verdict: I know we've got some Fifty Shades of Grey haters out there; I know this because I was one of them. Hear me out though: Fifty Shades Darker was so much better... I actually loved it! Eventful and engrossing, there's actually a developed plot, and visible character dynamism in this one. Even if you were discouraged by the first book, I think you should give the sequel a chance, because I'm so, so glad that I did. James has made so much improvement, I can't emphasize enough. The raw, heartbreaking emotions actually allowed me to overlook the stiff dialogue, unsuccessful eroticism, and awkward diction/imagery/writing style (or lack thereof); so even if the predecessor wasn't worth finishing, I guarantee this one definitely is.<br /><br />8 out of 10 hearts (4 stars): An engaging read; highly recommended.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by Edenfantasys in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you!).ly stands up for herself (for once!); I was proud of her for her assertiveness.

Well, Ana could be, given her lack of any sort of worldly experience (i.e. relationships, sexuality, email).<br /><br />Okay, my rant's over, I promise. So. Aside from the outraged ramble you've read above, this book had many redeeming qualities that made me enjoy it. As flawed as the main relationship is, you can tell Christian really does love Ana; it's just that he keeps pulling her into unbearable situations, forcing her to face things she shouldn't have to. Ana is smart enough (just barely) to realize this, but not strong enough to resist it--which keeps her from leaving the toxic, all-consuming relationship. They are both enshrouded by doubt that they are wrong for each other and that they don't deserve each other... and they're absolutely right, except that they have one thing in common: unbridled love. And this is what will keep them together.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker ends breathlessly and on a lingering note. I SO want to read Book 3. Let's keep our fingers crossed it doesn't disappoint!<br /><br />Pros: Much much MUCH better than the first one // Deep emotions // Character development (it took 1000+ pages, but James still did it!) // Darker, more alluring, and more thrilling // There's actually a plot // Suspenseful because of life-or-death situation both Ana and Christian are thrown in // Romance is actually palatable<br /><br />Cons: Placid sex scenes // Awkward big words thrown in elementary writing // Stiff dialogue // Exasperating narrator... Ana is a moron in every which way // Sorry, but Christian Grey is still a weird prick // Unrealistic. Duh.<br /><br />Love: \\"What I feel for you frightens me.\\"<br /><br />Verdict: I know we've got some Fifty Shades of Grey haters out there; I know this because I was one of them. Hear me out though: Fifty Shades Darker was so much better... I actually loved it! Eventful and engrossing, there's actually a developed plot, and visible character dynamism in this one. Even if you were discouraged by the first book, I think you should give the sequel a chance, because I'm so, so glad that I did. James has made so much improvement, I can't emphasize enough. The raw, heartbreaking emotions actually allowed me to overlook the stiff dialogue, unsuccessful eroticism, and awkward diction/imagery/writing style (or lack thereof); so even if the predecessor wasn't worth finishing, I guarantee this one definitely is.<br /><br />8 out of 10 hearts (4 stars): An engaging read; highly recommended.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by Edenfantasys in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you!).
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I bought this movie after taking my 4 year old granddaughter to the movies to see it. It was that good. I could sit through it over and over. Very funny and cute.
B00A93ENX8|2.0|The bottom line for this SACD in my system is I like the CD version much better.  The SACD has no impact (thin) compared to the CD without any significant gain in detail or resolution.  With SACD limping along one would hope they would release SACDs that would really satisfy the base of folks supporting the format not make them feel like they were ripped off.  I wish I waited to read more reviews, don't waste your money.
034580404X|5.0|great love story - couldn't stop reading it. keeps you going till you read all 3. cant' stop at just one book
B000001EGA|3.0|As my title suggests, this album is nowhere near as important or interesting as others either earlier or later than this release.<br />\\"Someone Saved My Life...\\" sure enough is classic in it's beauty and scope, yet the rest of the album to me seems like it was done by numbers. Sorry fellow fans. I have all of his 70's output and would class this one as the \\"dud\\".
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use, can use audio and visual at the same time and can stop and go without losing place.

B001S49AQW|4.0|I love Georgette Heyer. Clean romance, witty, absurd situations. This is one of my favorites as the main characters keep me laughing at all their little scrapes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season three finale of The Walking Dead.... If  you have watched any of this season, you know.... AWESOME... Enough said!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love her music. The CD is amazing and has quite a different feel to it. It's outside of the mainstream music but still has great uptempo to it.
1451695195|5.0|Was a wonderful book, Loved it.  Enlightening, interesting and thought provoking.<br />Open your mind and you will find another world
B00AJER3SE|5.0|Great to see this again after so long. Holds up even though the effects are outdated. Schwarzenegger at his best.
B0019OP0GU|1.0|Can't rate it as it had not yet arrived by April 1st when I had to go home again.  My Easter surprise was spoiled and I am very disappointed.
0446615641|5.0|i have not read it but i have read other &#34;camel&#34; club books-love baldacci's work all of his books are page turners.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book, the premise is remarkably clever.  Even though I felt the ending coming, I wished that it were different.  Can't help it, I love a good, happy and is well with the world ending!
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|This movie left me feeling cheated and wishing I had done anything rather than watch it. What a creep this girl is.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I found the story somewhat incomplete and felt myself having to suspend belive more than I'd like.  The writing was not fantastic, but the story itself was riveting.  This really had potential, but in the end  I felt let down.
B00448SE4S|1.0|Couldn't stay awake to watch it and wasn't worth trying to.  It was a great sedative. I would have wanted my hour and a half back if I had managed to watch the whole thing.
B00BF123WG|2.0|We couldn't wait to watch this movie, but were very disappointed. It takes FOREVER for the story to unfold and when the mission finally begins it doesn't take very long and the movie was over.  The movie Seal Team 6 was much better because it features actual news footage of the events leading up to and after the mission.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Generic. Not much to report. Wait until it is available for free on TV or at least discounted as a DVD.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Had to keep reading.  Pendergast never has boring time.  Next book is waiting to be read.  Love how his charaters continue.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I am a fan of Keira and Judd, but this movie was very disappointing.  Right from the start it was way too artsy for my taste.  Formatted like a play, with walls, stage settings and unnecessary extras sliding about.  Pride and Prejudice should have been left as it was.  This version did not hit the mark.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|We are the only ones that can make these decissions for our self.  Having worked in health care I so often saw how much suffering is done when &#34;loved ones think they know best&#34; for the ill person.  Just an excellent book.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie was better than I expected it to be. Many people had said it was too gory to watch, but it wasn't as gory as they made it out to be. Unrealistic but action packed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  The cast is amazing, I am right there.  Its elegant and the English countryside gentry is so proper.
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|Absolutely awful.  Senseless nudity, though Helen is in great shape for her age. Helen Hunt is a wonderful actress and this movie did not do her justice. I spent the whole movie thinking the lead actor was Matthew Broderick having a bad hair day.  Seemed it was supposed to be deep and thought provoking, but missed the mark for me. Tacky to the nth degree. I want my hour and a half back!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Love, love, love Teagan and Sara! Definitely have not heard anything that they have that I don't like a lot !! Beautiful voices!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game ... because you get to ride the bores and you get to jump on the trans and they put all your coins together
B005OP7162|5.0|I don't know why everyone isn't watching this show.  Since episode one I have pretty much been hooked.  Just when I think the writer's won't be able to think of anything else, they come out with another huge twist that shocks you.  Emily Van Camp is amazing, as is the rest of the cast.
B009AMANH4|5.0|As you watch this movie you feel like you are with Abe Lincoln.  It is a great movie from beginning to end!
B0016BWACI|5.0|I love buying movies I grew up watching on Blu-Ray simply because I get to notice things I never did before.  This one is up to the standard I've come to expect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG I will let you guys know that by mistake I deleted this game.I don't have a Facebook to save my data on  so ALL of it was deleted and I have to do everything over again.The needed improvement is either have them sign in under Facebook or have them sign up.

B005CRY2O6|2.0|I am not a vegetarian and somehow failed to comprehend from the description that this was a vegetarian cookbook!  Oh, we'll, at least I can use some of the recipes when my vegetarian daughter comes for dinner - if I can even begin to have the multitude of ingredients called for.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I work with children who have emotional and/or behavior issues. This book rings very true ... the child's point of view as he survives (with his mother), and then learns to live in the real world--wow! Impressive!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game! WAY cooler graphics &amp; obstacles!!! The save me takes the cake hands down! No question! I'm addicted all over again!!!
B007CKNX28|4.0|Saw him on TV, ACL I do believe. Love the dual lineup making equal parts of this CD. Very pleased that I bought it.

B0041D843M|5.0|Who knew, except maybe we always suspected these results!  Life changing for my family and the way we eat! I just wish everyone could know this information!

B00B4VXQC8|2.0|First off, give the politics a rest Jon.  Obama is a disaster and if you haven't figured that out after 5 years, God help you.  It's painful to see/hear because Jon wants to be this Springsteen-type that throws out all this social commentary...even if it's clueless commentary.  Jon does a lot of good things...outside of his crazy politics, I like the guy, at least from the public persona we get.  Bon Jovi has been my favorite band since the 80s.  I'm a middle class guy in my 30s, a professional with a family, so I'm not sporting a mullet and still working on my '85 Camaro, but good grief, how sweet would it be to see this band ROCK again?  \\"New Jersey\\" is my favorite BJ album...it's just killer from start to finish.  All the comments about the lack of soaring solos from Richie and the lack of a real power ballad are dead on.  Maybe that's just the world Jon lives in now...he's \\"inspired\\" by political fundraisers in the Hamptons for left wing causes and candidates.  It's kind of sad to see such a great band squander what made them great to begin with.  Maybe grow the hair back out...just a little bit...and maybe, just maybe, give us one more great rock album with a sure fire Top 10 power ballad hit thrown in there?  One can dream.  BJ is still super successful and the tours are massive successes...but they couldn't fill up a Dairy Queen if they played nothing but material from their last few albums.  They had the crossover hit \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\"...but outside of a decent song here or there, they haven't had anything memorable since \\"Crush\\" came out.  Have a Nice Day was ok...but everything since is dollar store bargain bin worthy.  But when you're still making millions on tour, I doubt they really care too much...even if their new stuff is when people take their bathroom breaks or check their iPhones to see what else Obama has done to send the country down the toilet.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read most of his other books and they always have a way of bringing tears to my eyes (literally!). It is that moving. Thought-provoking with a simple message. But I liked how he told the story and how easy it was to identify with the two characters. Not going to reveal any spoilers here but I recommend it to everyone because I am very sure everyone can relate to the themes in this story. I don't have the habit of reading a book in one sitting (I usually fall asleep in between) but this was one book that I did just that.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is pretty cool. I liked it. I would reccomend if to ppl who like to play solitare. It was easy to do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great second book. Forward momentum of a great story! I recommend this book and think Collins does a stellar job.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Amazing book must read you will not be able to put it down it is so good!<br /> Captivating and real

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Good game, game does take awhile to upgrade though. Even though it's free your better to spend a little money to get things going a little faster. But it nice to see your park grow.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I enjoy reading with the many of the characters living on in another adventure. Tom Clancy does a great job describing things, so it is very easy to picture while reading. He adds enough suspence to keep you from putting the story aside. Story plot is very possible today, and to some degree is happening now. Great read.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a great way for anyone who is on a journey to understand the reasoning behind why the make the choices they do in life and how to change those choices. It makes you understand yourself and love who you are and who you are going to be. It's a must read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS AWESOME. I MADE A HUGE HOTEL OUT OF WOOL AND IT EVEN HAS A SNIPING TOWER WITH A HOT TUB
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These were all  great books with a great story line, well worth reading!  They are hard to put down once you start.
1608955702|4.0|As stated in the title, this book is dedicated to the role of the direction and quality of light in portrait photography. It spends very little time on the quantity of light or the technical aspects of adding off camera flash. It is well written and engaging. I'm glad I read this book.
B004FPZ2KY|5.0|The birth of the romance novels can in my opinion be credited to Jane Austen. Lizzy and Mr. Darcy a love story for the ages.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My Wife and I are not really into the Zombie craze, we really don't watch anything Zombie related.  She started watching Walking Dead on Netflix, and we both loved the show, we watched both Season 1 and 2 on Netflix, but we wanted more.  We checked out Amazon and they had Season 3, which we ended up starting right in the middle of it.  We watched all of season 3 and caught up before the last 3 episodes aired.  The show is great and it brought us some more time to spend together, who knew that a show about Zombies could bring us closer together.
B00003CX95|5.0|One of my favorite movies! It is a portrayal of my family history and I even have ancestors name for William Wallace. Some of the farther back ones fought with him.
0307960471|5.0|I love Jo Nesbo books and I can find them on Amazon and order them before they are released.<br />It is a great mystery and i loved it.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Excellent.
0525953728|3.0|The content of the book is good but the writing is very bad.  I would not recomend this book. ok
B007REV4T8|5.0|Action packed, funny, progressive and fresh James Bond movie. Highly Recommended, great performances by all the actors, good story, i got this as a gift for my lady, and she loved it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a fun game but when you need to get get gems to upgrade things it takes forever. There is a trade where you can trade gems for coins but there isn't one where you can trade coins for gems. I would love it if you put that in.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia Keys releases another great album, I bought it for the lady in my life I love. She really loved it, and i did too. I recommend it to all interested<br /><br />and a shoutout to all guitarists out there, FIRE WE MAKE. dat solo tho.<br /><br />be sure to look in the booklet at the collaborators in the creation of the song, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|So after reading all the negative reviews i didnt expect much at all. I figured what the heck, for a dollar i might as well check it out.<br />  DO NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY, and you will be entertained. However i will say, if you have anything better to do, i would hold off on watching this until youre real bored.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Nice mix of songs - great lyrics as expected from Bon Jovi.  Highly recommend.  Another hit from Bon Jovi.  Buy it!!!!
B0063M22QO|3.0|Liked the regular Mahjong better.  This one is too easy....I have not really played this one enough to make anymore judgement
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Well acted and chillingly realistic scenario, this is an amazingly accurate portrayal of how the Democrats in American government usurp power and authority, stepping on whoever they need to in their never ending quest to glorify themselves, and openly deny reality, even in the face of concrete proof, if it doesn't serve their agenda. The special effects were near flawless, and the abundant use of news clips of actual politicians and news reporters added to the realistic feel.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works great, I needed a new cable for my kindle and they sent me this for free under warranty! Thanks amazon!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Love this new series, it is refreshing to see a new series that does not involve so called reality TV.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|I bought it for my oldest great-granddaughter (now 20) because she was revisiting childhood.  Love this movie.<br /><br />The dvd was shipped promptly and received in perfect condition.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I have been a fan from the start.  Comparing it to Sounds of the Universe, this album is lacking a lot.  But Depeche is still one of my favorite bands so it's hard not to appreciate it.  I am looking forward to classic songs and not so much the new ones on their tour this late summer.  I suggest you see them before their time is done.  I feel like this may be the last album.
B008NW67E0|5.0|After hearing a few of their songs on the radio I thought I'd pick up the album, and after a first listen I was blown away! What raw talent, and beautiful music! Sigh No More is awesome as well!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great story. Couldn't stop reading it because I wanted to know what would happen next. I was not satisfied with the ending. I wanted sweet revenge! Good read though!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a tablet and a notebook and I use kindle on both of them.<br />I read as much as I can.
B009M4KTEM|4.0|Over the years, more and more live recordings of Jerry Garcia keep on popping up, this is great, I don´t know where all these historical recordings have been hibernating, but I am certainly glad that this catalog is being issued. This is a 3 CD set, but the best one is the first one; you can appreciate the improvising power of Jerry's guitar on it.<br />Aside from Grateful Dead, almost since the beginning of the group, Jerry developed his Jerry Garcia Band JGB) with other excellent musicians. The remarkable thing is that none of the JGB records sounds as if it were the Dead, he accomplished an own style and blended masterfully rock, country and blues. This CD set indicates &#34;Volume One&#34;, I can´t wait that they continue to dig into the vaults and soon we may see Volume 2, 3 and so on?
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|if you like Andrea Bocelli -  you will love this cd as much as I do!  The guest singers he has on this cd with him are excellent as well
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I have become a fan of Kate Morton. Every family has secrets and she works with this theme extremely well. Story is well developed, lots of detail and is thorough to the end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much. It was the perfect read and I'm  So happy that I chose this book to read. I will probably end up reading it many more times. Very well written book!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|If you want a thoroughly engaging read and enjoy family stories and their secrets, you will love this. This is worth the time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has got to be the best way to see a series season.  Can't wait for next season to finish.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Love her work. Enough said. (Nothing is what you expect in a Kate Morton book. There are enough twists and turns to keep you reading!)
B000X2H8G4|5.0|my mom is 84 years old and has had trouble with her $800 hearing aid every 3 months since she got it..i got so frustrated trying to carry on a conversation with her..i came across this amplifier,read the reviews,and decided to get it/lo and behold my mom can hear..we talked in normal volume..i turned my back and talked and she heard every word/think of it..a $30 device that out performs an $800 specifically engineered hearing aid...mom said she goes outside to listen to the squirrels and birds..makes me feel good to see her like that and communicating again
1611761069|5.0|Kay Is back to the great formula of Marino ,Lucy & Benton.  The last few books didn't have the spark of this awesome s foursome but it's roaring back.  Kay finally seems at home in her Boston office & home!  So glad to have her back!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie and wanted to see it.  It is a great movie and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  Had trouble with the sound not being loud enough running it through our laptop.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield was and still is my favorite show.  I'll even take it over The Soprano's, and The Walking Dead.  Game of Throwns  comes close as far as plot twists.  But The Shield is my all time favorite series.
B004GYY714|3.0|Tunein was easier to use than other programs but I found that the radio station I wanted had a feed problem or back up until next month sometime.
B000P0J09W|4.0|I loved watching this oldie but goodie.  I got it for my grandson and he thought it was awesome.  We had a great time watching it together.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a really good book, but I do not like the fact that... sorry for giving this away but Prim and Finick die. I would have changed that part but all in all it was very addicting to read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Good book for those interested in history made personal. Loved having characters made familiar to you to follow<br /><br />I have read many of Ken Follets books and have never been disappointed. Can't wait to read the next one
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Oh my gosh I think I might die!! It was so thrilling and romantic I just loved it to pieces! I can't wait for The House Of Hades!

B009FZHYKU|2.0|There was some lag/buffering throughout, and the video quality wasn't great, especially in full screen. Not really worth the money.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|Why is this Title Already at Walmart in New Hampshire on April 2nd and Everyone else is waiting till the 9th?

B00336Y7ZW|4.0|I liked the movie because it is heart warming.  I also love all things that feature dogs in a positive manner.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. The DVD had really nice features, such as the cast commentary, and gag reel.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Great cast of stars--Betty White is a hoot, as always.  Funny and feel good.  Gorgeous scenery.  Just nice to watch.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book will ring especially true to dog owners and lovers but a wonderful story for all.  A must read!
B007BVOEPI|3.0|I'm not really sure how to rate this movie.  The costumes and cinematography are exceptional.  The plot is interesting for the most part, although a little strange at times.  There are so many characters it's hard to keep track of who is what.  But the bottom line is that while I am no shrinking violet, it's just too dark, violent and bloody for me.  I also like to see people happy at least once in awhile.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Great quality and great movie. As usual, Robert Downey Jr is awesome!!! I watch this one just to find something new to admire and laugh about. Enjoy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great read. Very enjoyable but different in my opinion from other Nicholas Sparks novels. A little bit darker
B0064MGU98|4.0|This is a good story, even the ending had snap. Unfortunately it is about lawyers-- hence I gave it one star less,
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait to watch Season 3.  I only wish Amazon Prime would work with Apple TV's Airplay!  Is that in the works?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandson really enjoyed Temple Run so I downloaded Temple Run 2 for him. He is nine years old. His older brother showed it to him first on his IPod. i have a Kindle Fire and when he visits me he can play games. He is very good at playing Temple Run 2. This is a good game for all ages. Thank You
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Great music, and powerful vocals -- This is a great album, and we were very satisfied with the purchase.  Would buy again.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I'm still trying to decide if his huge indictment against wheat products is a bit radical.  He does a good job substantiating his points, but you know what they say about &#34;proving&#34; things with statistics.  I'm still looking for some professional collaboration on his rant against wheat in particular.  The rest is Adkins warmed over and is a viable approach to healthy eating.
B003274QH6|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched in my life.  If you like cliffhangers, character development, and high drama -- You will love &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;.  The Blue Ray looked great on our HDTV.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game for animal and horse lovers. The graphics are extremely good -- the horses are beautiful and move so gracefully. The repetitive nature of the mini-games can get tedious but the rewards (buying more horses, different rider &amp; horse gear &amp; eventually different stables) makes it worth it. I'm hooked!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Since the Rat Pack are gone, and Frank, Deano, and Sammy can no longer put out a Christmas album each year -- We had to look to Mr. Buble to fill the void this year.  We were certainly glad we did, and found ourselves impressed with his vocals as we played his CD during our Christmas party this year.  Great stuff!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An exciting story filled with vivid detail. Could hardly stand to put it down. A definite read. King does it again.
B009GX6600|5.0|I enjoy a well-written series peopled with individuals who have been developed and crafted to be real; with depth and with character.  None are perfect but all are good people, that is all one can ask of a person whether in real life or the people you invite into your home via the television.  It also builds upon itself and assumes an intelligent audience that may have seen earlier episodes and won't need the information hashed out repeatedly to make a point.
B00BAHKQW4|4.0|This takes me back - of course it isn't for today's gamer but just interesting to see how far we have come
B007STBUHI|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo18S3UV1ORKK7K]]This is a movie for you if you like sharks and you are brave enough!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very calming game and I love the sound track.  The game is engaging and captures the imagination
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I could not put this book down.  At times the novel became intense and I had to remove myself from reading more.  Loved the characters.  The slaves were so loyal to their owners until the turning point occurred.  The heroine in the book was Livonia.  Fell in love with her.  Disappointing ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good free calculator.  Works well and does not crash. Very simple and straight forward to use... just like standard calculator
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books in the series.  Fast moving and interesting.  Haven't seen the movie from the first book, but plan to.
B00005LOUP|4.0|This has jokes for the whole family to enjoy.Jim Carrey is fantastic in it and the makeup is well done
B00BWJARHO|3.0|They obviously did not take the time or care that they did with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The last ten minutes were the best part.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I appeciated the lighting quality and the subtitiles. I watched the first 7 years on TV.  I strongly recommend the series.  I avoided the series at first not understanding the story line or content.  However, the series has actually revived my life.  I laugh and cry every day when reflecting on the show.  Series 8 remains true to the strong writing and preserves the original theme and relationship of the 2 brothers.  God Bless everyone who has made this series available to us.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am usually not too impressed with romance novels but this one was much better than expected. There was mystery and more than just a gooey love story.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I previously had this app on my thunderbolt and loved it! Note I have a note 2 and it doesnt work for nothing! Wont even let me download and pay for a song. Screen just flashes registering your device real quick and then nothing.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Game is fun but just stops working an when doing cleaning that's a time limit its always interrupted by ads  an I have purchased gems an it never gives to me so I have spend over 10$ an never got my gems ...
1932100660|5.0|This book will forever change the way you view food.  It is full of research and explains all the findings in a way that is understandable to the non-scientist.  I wish I could have read this book years ago!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Super. I am glad to have full set. I read all the books and think they did a good job on the series.
B00003CXAA|5.0|&#34;The Godfather&#34; is a very well received movie for us. The original we saw when it first came out on our 1st anniversary. All three movies are excellent although to me the 3rd is a tragedy. We were very pleased with the condition of the DVDs. They will be a part of our library.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Series is very well done. beautiful to watch visaully and tight story-line. I am looking forward to a third season.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Im almost done with #3..Cant wait to see what happens nd hopefully there will be a movie down the road!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I can't get enough of Castle. Quickly becoming one of my favorite shows. Not only are Beckett and Castle back to flirt for another season, but the supporting cast make it all the more while to watch. Plots are unique and yet comic relief is interspersed at just the right moments. Excellent video quality as always and lack of commercials makes it well-worth watching via Amazon video than through some other channel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very realistic motion and  training for competitions. Great graphics and lots of fun items to dress up your horses. A few bugs to work out but I can`t quit playing with my horses!
0345803485|5.0|brand new. nice condition. shipped fast. I bought for my fiance and she read it not me so i dont know what else to say about it, its a book lol.
0670026638|5.0|I read the sample for Ozeki's book and was intrigued. And yet it did not feel quite right. So I waited and thought about Ruth Ozeki. She's a Zen Buddhist priest, a writer, film maker, and so on. But who is she really. In this book she writes of Nao and her family, as well as Ruth and Oliver (alter-egos of Ruth Ozeki and her husband?)<br /><br />So what was I to do? I then listened to a sample of \\"A Tale for the Time Being\\" on audible and found that it was narrated by Ruth Ozeki. And this was the real thing. Just reading the words on the page was not enough. The sound of Ozeki's voice brings the book to life in a deeper fashion. Please do yourself a favor and listen to the free sample of Ozeki's book on Audible. Then you'll get a much better feeling for this book.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I guess I had the wrong impression of this movie, I thought it was going to be a typical Denzel action/adventure type thing. I didn't know if was going to be a tale of one man's journey from severe addiction of multiple substances. It was pretty depressing and pretty scary if you thought your pilot was actually doing this amount of drugs and drinking.<br /><br />Denzel was his usual great self, but a lot of the other characters actions were either pretty unbelievable or downright ridiculous. The story would probably have made a better TV mini series, in the time of a standard movie, many of the relationships were rushed to the point of being difficult to believe.<br /><br />I would not have watched if I had known what it was about, and even as a story of one man's road to redemption it has a lot of issues. Maybe that was my real problem with it, the director and writer tried to tell too many stories in the time allowed.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Russian, English, German, American and some French cultures devided between the rich and the poor.  I would have preferred more action and less family discussions.  I may try the Book Two as a sample to determine if the action picks up...
B009ETEEAU|1.0|We got this camera for Christmas to use while skiing.  The video quality seems good, but that's the end of the positives. The mounting system is very shoddy, making it difficult to mount securely. It wobbles, making for shaky videos. The protective housing blocks the microphone, so it doesn't pick up any sound.  The battery is non-replaceable. The battery wears out quickly in the cold - it would be nice to be able to swap in another battery.  Biggest problem is build quality.  The camera itself is made of very light plastic and is light as a feather. The first three videos we took came out great.  Ever since then, it hasn't been able to focus. It hasn't been subject to any drops or hits. Its an \\"action\\" cam - it ought to be able to handle a little bit of abuse. Evidently, this does not.<br /><br />Seems like a good deal, but not when you only get three videos out of it before it breaks.  Big disappointment.
B008476HBM|4.0|I confess now that I did not enjoy Pride and Prejudice. The problem with loving a film is that the novel rarely will be loved as much, for usually the imagination is not able to create when the mind has already decided on perfection. I adore the film adaption of Pride and Prejudice starring Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. However, I still recommend reading the novel, for Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful depiction of the struggle for self in a less-than-perfect world.<br /> Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen chronicles the relationship between Fitzwilliam Darcy, a wealthy young man, and Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest daughter of a man of modest means. The five Bennett daughters are in desperate need for husbands, as their father's inheritance is entailed. When Mr. Bingley, a wealthy and charismatic young man, moves into their neighbor, he falls in love with Jane, the oldest daughter. He also brings with him his friend, Mr. Darcy, who behaves snobbish and offends Elizabeth at a local ball. Although they immediately dislike each other, they are forced to spend time together during a variety of circumstances, which changes their perception of each other, sometimes through direct confrontation.<br /> Pride and Prejudice is a hallmark novel. On the surface it is just another historic romance novel, but with uncovering it is revealed to be a true search for self-identity and understanding of other humans, in the dirtiness of their limited economic means and horrible manners. It is about the practical role of marriage in our society--what are the consequences of marrying for money? For social prestige? For love? It is a novel about relationships, between siblings, parents and children, friends, enemies, and new acquaintances.  It is a novel worth reading, but I recommend you do it before watching the film.
B00181MHQU|5.0|West Side Story is one of the most wonderful Musicals of all time.  Watch it for the music with the volume turned up.<br />.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|We could not open this app after we had downloaded it. The other Angry Birds worked, but this one would not open.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|The author tries to impress with words that most readers have to look up to understand. The book is, at best, just ok. One point that I would like to make is the author, when troubled, finds his solution to his ills by smoking weed. In both Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, he breaks out the weed when stressed.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I would recomend this app to people who dont pay attention to their battery life because it haz alarmz for certain percent of battery life.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|I had been on the fence about this punch for some time.  But when I came across a 50% off coupon I bought it at Michaels.  Sorry, Amazon...  BUT some of the punches aren't available in the stores, so I went back to Amazon and purchased a punch I really liked, so I'm good again, grin.<br /><br />For those of you who don't really know what you can do with these punches aside punching out doilies in all sizes, I invite you to visit my blog, [..] to see what I have done with this punch.  The possibilities really are, well, maybe not quite endless, but definitely several-fold.<br /><br />True, the instructions are a bit bare bones, but then again, the punch really is simple to use:<br />1.  open the punch by pulling it out of the plastic sleeve that covers the bottom.  See that cutting plate wedged inside?  Take it out, and put it in the machine's moving tray smooth side up.<br />2.  Decide upon what size circle you want to cut out.  Select that size at the rounded edge of the tool (see that lever that can move?  Say you want an 8\\" circle, so you slide it on 8), then also move the cartridge (punch) up to the 8\\" mark.  Do not go in between, it won't work.  You need to work with full inches only.<br />3.  Next, you find the center of a piece of paper larger than 8\\" diameter (can be an 8.5\\" x 11\\", that's fine) and put that center underneath the cross hairs of the \\"knob\\" on the left side of the punch, making sure that both of the \\"knob's\\" magnets connect with their counterparts underneath for a secure hold.  Then you place the punch head on top of the paper (which extends over the bottom cutting plate, okay?) and hear the magnets connect as you place it down.  Punch, lift off the punch, and rotate the paper with the knob one notch in either direction.  Replace the punch and punch down, lift off, turn, place punch, punch down, and so on.  It sounds a little labor extensive, and it takes quite a few punches to get around the entire paper, but before long you get the hang of it and then it goes easy.  If you find it hard to punch, lift off, replace the punch, and try again.  It may not have aligned perfectly before.<br /><br />In time, as your punch feels a bit \\"sticky\\", use wax or freezer paper and punch through that a few times.  That lubricates the punch and eliminates the \\"stickiness.  If you encounter areas that aren't punched cleanly, try punching through aluminum foil a few times to sharpen the punch again.<br /><br />If you still have trouble understanding how this punch works, please feel free to contact me via my blog and I will try to help you.  Note:  I am not affiliated with Martha Stewart in any way, not exactly a fan of her ever expanding \\"empire\\", but I do acknowledge when an item is well made and thought out.you find it hard to punch, lift off, replace the punch, and try again.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am a homeschooling mom, so I am very busy. I tried using My Daily Bread and some other devotionals, but it was difficult to put them down and come back to without losing my place. YouVersion Bible not only keeps my place, but the plans allow me to focus on topics of interest to myself. In fact, I even set plan for my teenage son for HIS devotional! I love this app and use it every single day.<br /><br />The sole problem is that one must go to the website to choose a plan, as that function doesn't work in the Kindle Fire app. this is such a minor issue that I still gave 5 ***** &lt;3<br /><br />Nice job plugging at every.single.commercial.break during The Bible lol
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I use Microsoft Hotmail (Outlook) for my email..... and this app lets me process my email just the same as if I was on my desktop PC.  Much better than going on line and going into hotmail.com that way.

B00BWGISB4|4.0|It's crazy how young and fresh AND mature and modern these guys sound.  Somehow, they evoke the adolescent/teenager in me and still make me feel like an adult ready to dance the night away.  I like the New Kids remix ;)  May you always be the new kids on the block!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This 30 Day Shred was really a great buy. The workouts are not too difficult and if you stick to it you will really start to see the results of your legs etc getting tighter and you tend to have more energy throughout the day.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|the cinematography, the cast, the story-everything I had hoped this picture would be; it fully lived up to the hype; Daniel Day-Lewis brings Father Abraham to life; and Sally Fields is compeling in her devotion and in her madness!
B000031XCR|5.0|Truly the Greatest Singer in the world!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I have been a fan of all the MIB movies. This one does not dissapoint. The stars are looking a little older. This may NOT be the best of the series. I still laughed  my way throught at all.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this story - and the way it is told through the series of letters. A very emotionally charged story - great characters! Excellent!
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|I bought this because I reallylike Denzel Washington but I have trouble watching a movie with an alcoholic as the main character. I will watch it again sometime. Maybe I'll like it better the next time.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the time intervals.  Almost as fun to play as Subway Surfer.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I have a different version of this movie that I dearly love, but I didn't realize this one was a musical. I cannot stand musicals where they sing the words. I bought it because I really like Anne Hathaway and she played the role very well. I was surprised the she has such a good singing voice. She was great and the music and songs were great but I just don't like idea of a singing movie. My fault!!!

B004IV32HU|3.0|Loved the performance by Martin Landau by far. Not my favorite Tim Burton film, but any excuse to see Johnny Depp is fine with me. It was a little too long for me.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I will check stars. I am unwilling to title my remarks and being forced to write an arbitrary number of words.
B003M6EAXM|4.0|Loved this series! looked forward to the last season.  Terrific! A little predictable...but still some great twists as only 24 can give you!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I absolutely can not believe what this man was able to accomplish while in the service.  The book is a very easy and quick read and the details he goes into are quite amazing.  I was amazed that unless you can get a witness to a kill, the shot was not taken.  Not to mention they always to had make sure it was done under proper ROE or else the threat of prosecution loomed.<br /><br />Great read and RIP.
B000FCKC4C|1.0|Just not a good story. No plot, no character development, and I disagreed with a lot on a philosophical level.
0465022227|5.0|this is a nice book that should be readed when you are going to apply phD. ha ha ha ha
B00BSW6F26|1.0|terrible game, had to go to the walkthrou on youtube every 5 min and it was a very short game, arggg, not worth your money. I don't know why game makers don't copy how good games work well. Like Enigmatis: The ghosts of Maple Creek, this was a fabulous game, with a great hint button for Everything and a map, easy to follow, wonderful.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|We really love this item. It was shipped quickly and was in perfect condition! The paint job is superbly done and he is very realistic looking!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I read the book as soon as it came out and I'm happy I did.  There are very few women at high levels in my field and it was inspiring to hear an honest account of work and life from a high ranking female executive.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't know what it was really about. I was expecting, and hoping for, an epic tale. This is not really what it was. The special effects were cool, but I found the storyline a bit boring.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|terrible game. if you can call it that. I am sorry that I bought it. Biiiiig waste of money.  ugh

B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is an entertaining visit to the strangest circus you will ever encounter. I think everyone loves a circus, especially when we see it through the eyes of a child. This story pulls the reader into the fantasy so well that it is easy to feel that childlike wonder again.
B0001HAISG|5.0|One of the best Peter Pan's I have seen. I will be showing this story to my grandchildren this summer and enjoying it again myself.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|A possible 'real life' situation that is handled with great spiritual integrity.  It reminds us that &#34;God is in control. Something I will share with others.  GREAT movie.
B00AEFY44Y|4.0|Story line, Actor, Music, quality of production. Resonants personally on many fronts. Would recommend to anyone appreciating Demi Moore and Patrick Swayzwe
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed Hunger Games and thought that Catching Fire could not be as good, but it pulled me in even more.  There are only a few series that have possibly captivated me as much - Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne trilogy, Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series to date and possibly Stieg Larson's Girl With trilogy, but I read Hunger Games after reading the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and now I will read Mockingjay before I can move on to anything else!
B000NIVJGI|4.0|Story line, Actor, Music, quality of production. Resonants personally on many fronts. Would recommend to anyone appreciating  Patrick Swayze and time period
0345803485|5.0|I CHOSE THAT RATING BECAUSE I LOVE THE BOOK AND IT WAS IN GREAT SHAPE.YES I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT ARE ALSO ENJOYING HE BOOK.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The Movie was interesting, its a good movie to keep for memories. Knowing that most of what you saw was true that to me is a winner.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|The name speak volumes. I find that everything she is going through is everything I dreaded in high school. It's funny but heart warming show.....

0345529057|4.0|All four books for $21.00; can't beat that.  Agreed the print is somewhat small but I have had no problem reading it.  I have only finished the first book but will definitely read the others.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have liked using this and I have used it each  day multiple times. It comes in handy for sure!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I saw this in the theater and knew I would own it when it came out on DVD!  I mixes humor with a lot of action.  Very good special effects!  Great actors!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book leaves you wanting the next to hurry. Can't wait for more!!! Let's hope that the next one comes sooner then the last two
B006M6NV0M|5.0|Lots and Lots of action, riddled with humor!!!  Be quick to catch the humor in between the action!  Great fight scenes!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple to use. Meets my needs 100 %. Going to tell me friends to try the app. I'm sure they will agree.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Cute game and easy to use. My kids and i love the java games. Recommend for any age because its very straight forward
B006LSZECO|1.0|The worst book I've read in the last 12 months. Make that the worst book<br />I have ever read.  Never take best seller list for granted.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's really much more than that... As a professional, it has finally allowed me to make a 100% switch from paper notes.  I can take/view my notes from my laptop or phone, add pictures, files, etc.  I have all notes that I've ever taken for a customer immediately available.<br /><br />For my personal notebooks, I have all of my photography notes, recipes, etc.  Much better than bookmarking articles or having to search all over again.  A must have app.
B003YWPN08|4.0|Lots of action.  A good explanation that you can extrapolate from the action.  Also, contrary to someone else, I liked the scenes of a frustrated Lt. Commander being driven around Washington as he pondered his next move.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|Tired of it. Don't care what happens to any of them. Scenes of elegance punctuated by humorless nastiness.  I like a good police procedural much better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the convenience of having it on my table and being able to pick up where I left off quickly. Much easier to carry around or tote around in a purse, briefcase, bag etc. Good app, enjoy using it.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|Very good B movie to watch on blue ray make it so much beter than VHS one I have. So I will buy again.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|playing on a Kindle fire the game will hesitate and stall for awhile which is very frustrating.  But the game is fun. I like that it gives you the option of turning the game board to move the shark or use your finger to control it on the touch screen. Diffinitly  worth the price, free.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|This man still rocks, he moves a lot slower but still puts out a great rock album, with some heavy guitar licks, he's growin old, but just won't fade away!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I really like the game overall but having to click four times to start a game is ridiculous when they are shoving other games down your throat. The newest iteration consists on an ad popping up just before you start the game to download another of their games. If not careful this takes you out of the game completely since it pops up where you would normally click to begin. For a paid app this definitely needs to keep the annoying ads away. I will rate higher if this happens.
B00B23O96A|5.0|A great new EC album,  old favorites done only the way Clapton can, his vocals get better with age and the accompanying musicians<br /> read like the whose who of musos
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I loved \\"Knocked Up\\" and the previews for \\"This is 40\\" were enticing.  The first half of this movie was actually pretty good.  The second half has a bunch of people sitting around a table having an endless, bizarre, fake and boring conversation that is 400 times worse than the worst neurotic Woody Allen movie dialog you could imagine.  Who cares!!!!!!  The female lead in this movie remains very attractive but her sexy character can't overcome the last half-hour of the movie, which was awful.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I found the story confusing and the book just ended -  Too many characters. No conclusions for many of the characters.
B009O07NMA|5.0|This cd is such a great one! These guys have got to be one of the best new bands out there right now! I highly recommend it!
B00000DCH9|5.0|I love Billy Joel. Could not get enough of him in my younger days. My favorite on here is the title song. But all of them are wonderful. He's quite talented!
B00AH69BPM|3.0|I heard the 20 second samples of the songs and thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't let down but I wasn't impressed either with the content. For a $3.00 gamble, I broke even.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This story was definitely not what I expected from King. But I absolutely LOVED it! The idea he had to travel to the past to change the future was interesting...mixed with the world famous and morbidly fascinating assassination of JFK made it great! Five gold stars and two thumbs up!
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|would highly recommend this album not only to black veil brides fans but music fans in general perfect album amazing vocal guitars drums complete sound BVB out did themselves with this album
6305047529|5.0|This is by far my favorite Danny Kaye movie ever!! He is so silly and quite the story teller. I even got my pre-teen daughter to like him with this movie!! He was a golden child on the silver screen!
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|great album any BVB fan would love this this is so amazing & unlike other bands they actually have a great and postive message for their fans
B00006RAKP|5.0|I never knew in my younger days just who Elton John was and how GOOD he was. I hear him all the time on the radio and absolutely LOVE his music!! This album has all the songs I love and sing along to! IT ROCKS!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was perfect for lazy days, an easy read. I'll definitely look into her other books. Only thing I didn't like is it kinda reminded me of a cheap version of 50 shades.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I didn't want the story to end! He is a fabulous writer with a twisted mind!! If you like Stephen King you'll like this book!
B007REV4YI|1.0|After Quantum Of solace, I remember seeing the trailers for this movie. And bought into the producers saying they were bringing Bond back, well............ they failed. I think daniel Craig could be a great Bond, if given the opportunity. Like Casino Royale, but here, There's the leaked agent list angle that gets forgotten halfway through the movie, to the villian who quite frankly isn't that scary. I don't care how brilliant you are, you can't concieve of every contengent of a plan. Why get caught when you can kill M in the courtroom, What makes  A Bond villian scary is they're not out to get M or Bond or MI6. They're out to take over the world, or a portion of it. And last but not least is Bond himself, it appears that Bond can lose his swagger just by being shot off a train. Bond has always been compared to the stranger, you don't want to know what his past his. He comes into to town, takes care of business, and leaves. Women want to be with him, men want to be him. Because doesn't lose his swagger, always in control. No one wants to know who he was before he joined MI6, that's the legend of James Bond. Sadly he is dead, and has been replaced by a mere shell of himself. We need the other James Bond back, also. The gunbarrel always, always opens to the movie, not end it. And Bring the james bond theme back.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I was sent a stream of emails to renew my AVAST license.  I did so.  Then found out because I did the renewal in March for a April expriration, I am now set to expire in MARCH 2014.  Screwed out of 6 weeks coverage!  I contacted them.  \\"YES, you are correct!\\"  But we can't do anything about it.  Sorry.  My last renewal for AVAST.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it, so different, a unique story, in an unusual style. I really enjoyed the way the cause of the main problem wasn't revealed until Pat figured it out.  Great in every way in my opinion.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Nice book. I hope i'd haver read it when I was younger. Nevertheless<br />I totally recomend to read it.<br /><br />Great book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great read, the story was very original. I gave it five stars even though it doesn't quite make it up there with some of the great other sci-fi classics.<br /><br />Couldn't figure out the sequel...
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Not as riviting as Ender's Game, maybe a bit sombre so it took me a while to get into it.  I still enjoy Ender anyway.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I have been reading science fiction for longtime. It is a good story quite interesting to follow.Anyone who likes hard scien ce fiction will like it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was one of the most amazing books I've read in a long time - the scientific aspects of surviving in space kept me rivited and were dumbed down nicely for someone like me who knows little about physics etc.  I also loved the engaging style of writing and the great sense of humour attributed to the hero - without these I would have been consumed by panic for our Martian.  Thanks Andy Weir!
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|Works with my IPad 4.  I cannot use my aftermarket wall plug with it, the cord requires the apple wall plug to charge my IPad-- this is no problem.  Great to be able use and to move around on the Ipad while it is charging.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Just love Adele,anything she sings is always very great. Will probably get more of her music at a later date.
B0091REZMW|3.0|glitches encountered were the hunter room with the constant requirement of golden bullets and the dressing room where time count down remained doubled after removal of a phenomenon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book draws you in from the start! The chemistry between sky and holder is infectious and every emotion they feel you feel! Beautiful, but heart breaking story with a less than predictable ending!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There isn't anything you can't find!  It is very easy to use and it is fast. It will read to you if you like
1416511156|5.0|Literate, intelligent, thought provoking. Mr Judd's books are a real discovery. His books are not set in a 1930s/1940s like Furst's. Judd is one ofvthose authors to treasure.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|My husband says this is one of the good cd's of the Batman CD's this is his second copy of this one the first one got hijacked by his nephew. So I replaced it there's was no way it was being returned by the nephew said dog chewed it up?
B000059MEL|3.0|This review is only for the vinyl record. The album itself is a classic and amazing (5 stars IMHO). However I had some issues with the vinyl. On opening the sealed cover and removing a disc, I noticed paper residue statically clinging to the surface. I gently cleaned this off and used a compressed air can to remove remaining dust. On playing Side A, the sound was amazing (I use a minimal AT-LP60USB). However, side B(Harder, Stronger, Faster) skipped very slightly twice, at the beginning of the song. On closer inspection I noticed a kind of sideways wobble (kind of spirally) when I looked at the edge of the disc. After testing out other records  (including from the same album), I realized that this disc was the only one with the issue. I had heard of rare off-center pressings that might cause this. I requested a replacement from amazon and returned the album to them. However the replacement album has the same issue. It is only the first disc that behaves like this. I know some people may simply suggest getting a better LP player with anti-skating and counterweights, but right now I don't want to do that. The player itself works well with all my other records and this is the only record with such a wobbly issue. I'm convinced that the issue is Daft punk's Discovery album's 1st disc is an off-center pressing. I'd like to know if anybody else has noticed this.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|The music award's put to much hype on this cd which led me to accept to much from Frank to many up's and down's also he seem's to be talking to someone while he's singing.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Steinbeck is a master of painting a setting. From the rivers of Salinas to the inside of a barn, Steinbeck's writing is as lifelike as a motion picture.<br />In this short, but rich story, George and Lennie epitomize what a filial and endearing friendship is. Like a man who loves his dog, there are also responsibilities that follow.<br />Simple yet lasting. A classic Steinbeck story for the likes of any reader.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I did not like the dictionary at all  because you really should be able to type in the words that you want to know
B007HC3LHS|4.0|As long as you like dark, twisted books, this one is for you!  I loved it. It was a page turner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice graphics and actions. It's easy to feel your horse and get to feel as if you're in the game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really live the game itself, but I really hate all off the advertisements it comes with. I love how you have to be responsible or your horse becomes unhealthy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this rating because I really liked this book. But you have to read all three in order to enjoy it.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A classic book for all to read. Arrives quickly and at a great price. Adults as well as kids love this story
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I thought it was pretty boring I just didn't like it.Sorry I bought it. Not enough action I thought it would be more exciting.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Great Jane Austin book. A classic. Great price and arrives quickly. You will love this book, so buy it and you will find out why
B0041OT9W6|5.0|great book, this is a classic historical account and is told perfectly through the eyes of a young girl. :)
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Little Women is a classic book to read. You won't go wrong if you purchase this book. Arrives quickly and at a great price
B004IDG97S|3.0|I always confuse this movie with Demolition Man, which is so much fun.  This one is pretty pale in comparison.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My grand daughter loves this game. it keeps her busy for hours while I clean house. You can't go wrong if you buy this game
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Having observed the feminist movement years ago, I thought this book was going to be a re-hash of the same territory.  It is not.  It takes a very objective look at women in the workplace today and gives pointers for women to follow to improve their roles.  Excellent book.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Another Dickens classic. Great book to read or read to someone. Arrives quickly and is a great  price. Also makes a great gift
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am not much of a book critique, but despite most of the positive comments, I really didn't like the book.<br /><br />The book follows a small town story.  Many characters pop up in the story.  The way story is told, is pretty slow.  When I first started to read, I thought of &#34;Freedom&#34; from Franzen.  But the sad problem was, it was not a compelling & gripping slow story.  It was plain boring.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|A classic favorite of mine. Emily Bronte at her best. great price and arrives quickly. Could read this book again
B006P3HXZG|5.0|Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss is awesome!  A great spin on a classic ferry tale!  And, I love cats, what more is there to say.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Got this game for the kindle for the grand kids. It is free so you can't beat the price. Great game for all ages
B00005QDW5|3.0|So far I have found that there are small bits of the guitar solos in Echoes and Shine On (Pt. 6) missing, it's very subtle but they needed to save time, I guess. It's well done in any case, but still..<br />The shorter songs are untouched, I'll update if I find anything else, I just got it yesterday...
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|i've been a nkotb fan since 1988. i love this cd. theres only 1 song it, i don't like. i can't wait to see it live. jordan sounds amazing in jealous. i love hearing jon sing lead in some of these songs, he has such a great voice. donnies whispering while rapping in miss u more just makes me melt, of course anything donnie does makes me melt. i still think the block was there best and face the music in my opinion was terrible except for one or two songs. but this cd is just awesome. these guys only get better with age. i'll be a nkotb fan (bh) for life.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I found this book a very easy read. It simplifies some of the key aspects of what we tend to oversee in our relationships. A must read for everyone,
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have been wanting to get a calculator that is easy to use with larger numbers so you don't keep missing the number (like on my cell phone calculator).  I saw that I could have a free download of this on my kindle and it works great.  The blocks are big with the numbers so you can freely put in numbers without messing it up.  Thankyou Amazon!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end, suspenseful, just as good as The DaVinci Code.
0525953728|5.0|I normally don't enjoy reading.  I think I've read 20 books from cover to cover in my 41 years of being alive...MAYBE.  I picked this up for a flight to the UK and read the entire 6 hours over.  The next two days, I spent every spare minute reading this book which was a fantastic.  If you don't like to read but want to read something and enjoy military history, this is your book.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This is one hilarious show!  So true and in many ways of the geek and nerd culture, but has is simple enough that everyone will enjoy this program.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game. It only needs more stuff like the stuff on the xbox version. I have that to its better but you cant play it on the go
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I found this game fun and interesting but, I don't how it is scored. It canbe very time consumming if you keep winning.If you use up the coins, you must wait until the coins build up. I need to say that it is just like the real game in the arcades except that you don't have to pay money to play it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a great set, the seller was fast and accurate.  I love the show and I am glad I got it for a great price
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It can be played by anyone.I would like even more levels. It can be very addictive and frustrating at the same time.
0767812387|5.0|I love Dance with Me and this was wonderful for me to have a copy at home to relive this movie
B00992CF6W|4.0|My first thought when the impulse to write a reivew for Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) struck me was to grind out something akin to a Wikipedia entry with my opinion tagged onto the end. That's impractical if not downright impossible, but it is an impulse that does make at least a bit of sense. Unfortunately, there's just very little in the way of documentation of the game from Mojang itself, forcing new players to go to commercial pseudo-Wikis, YouTube tutorials and so forth. And, needless to say, while some of these resources are quite good, some are, well not so good. Sometimes they're just not very well prepared, and sometimes they commingle information related to the PC and Xbox versions with the bits that related to MCPE.<br /><br />And as of roughly two weeks ago, that was me. As in completely clueless. I'd never played any of the versions of Minecraft on any of its available platforms prior to downloading MCPE, though I've since played about five minutes on my son's Xbox. So, while I started a review of a game I've come to truly enjoy with my biggest criticism, I must also immediately follow that issue up by saying that this problem can be overcome fairly quickly, and in no way constitutes a show-stopper when it comes to playing.<br /><br />And, yes, I did find matters VERY confusing at first. As in, within a few hours of starting I was drowned. On peaceful mode. By a sheep. (Amusing now, but I assure you the reader that I was not thinking happy thoughts when it happened. I had just made my first iron pick-axe, and that went down with me.) All I can say is, hang in there. And that if I could figure it out, you certainly can, too. Given my drowned by sheep start to the game, I think I can confidently state that I started from an ignorance as deep as the Marianas Trench.<br /><br />Indeed, now that I think I've grasped most of the mechanics...I must say it was kinda cool to figure out at least some of the stuff on my own. Maybe not so much while I was plodding around trying to figure out how to get wheat \\"seeds,\\" but certainly after the fact. And, maybe, someday Mojang will either provide some documentation or do something like sponsor their own Wiki related to MCPE. But if not, not. Heck, look at the game description provided by Amazon and then go look at the descriptions to any other game you can think of on the Amazon site. There's something to be said for minimalism.<br /><br />One curious issue I'm having with this review is now difficult it is for me to convey what I like about the game, and how easy it is for me to \\"pick nits,\\" with some of the game's minor features or problems. So maybe I'll edit this down the line when I figure out a way around that. Plus, with the 0.7.0 upgrade coming, perhaps some of what I'd really like to see (as in buckets and water, as in non-hacked) will show up.<br /><br />In sum: Amazing game. And likely to get better.g around trying to figure out how to get wheat \\"seeds,\\" but certainly after the fact.

B005Z28M58|5.0|I love Desperate Housewives and wanted to complete my DVD set so this was perfect!  no scratches, DVDs play fine.
B0000024YL|5.0|Love this album.  It's a classic and the songs never get old and I never get tired of hearing them.  I actually bought this CD to replace the other one I had that got worn out.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|I love Desperate Housewives and wanted to complete my DVD set so this was perfect!  no scratches, DVDs play fine.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|This movie was entertaining but at some points a little dull. A good rental, glad i didnt see it in theaters.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|I love Desperate Housewives and wanted to complete my DVD set so this was perfect!  no scratches, DVDs play fine.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I enjoyed the book and the movie was just as good. I would definitaly recomend watching this one. A little long but entertaining.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This has got to be the best keyboard for Android ever! Android 4.0 keyboards lack autocorrect and predictability...  This replaces that disfunction and even excels even further!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres, and Follett gives the details I love! From fashion to architecture, cultural cuisine to politics of the period, his writing style feeds my curiosity and fills in enough gaps to provide my senses (all five) a delightful journey. I read the whole trilogy in a week - not an easy accomplishment for my schedule.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|From start to finish I was sucked in. Loved the twists that threw me off when at times it got predictable. This is a great read! Hoping the movie will stay true to form.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can't put this book down.  Great twists and turns! Every chapter builds on with new ideas that you don't see coming. It's a real page-turner, especially for crime enthusiasts.
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|Im still reading it, .... It is ok, but not the best.<br />Not sure if I would recommend it to anyone.
141659521X|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my son so I can't really say much about this other than that.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded this book on the recommendation of a friend and am so glad I did. It is compelling and exciting and stressful and nail biting! It contains adventure and suspense. I really enjoyed it and look forward to more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought the book was very clever. I couldn't put it down! I look forward to reading more by the author.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Movie is absolutely fantastic, almost as good as the book. Five out of five stars, a definite must watch for everybody.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|This book has some great ideas on how to innovate with an entrepreneurial mindset. Enjoy it at the gym or with coffee.
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I really wanted to see this, but the service runs too slowly to be watched on any of the several different wifi spots I've tried. Pretty sad.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Cher was a smash. I would watch her read the telephone book. Cristina suprised me with her multi talented proformance as a singer, dancer, actress. 5 Stars
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, and the book was alright. I wasn't a huge fan of the writing style as it seemed very choppy a nd simple, but overall, I enjoyed the book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far real good see there ships be much more in store. music is a lil creepy tho lil. ht I'm really impressed wit the game
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Absolute classic rock! Smooth; masterful lyrics; perfect timing. Pink Floyd was very much ahead of thier time with this album. It still has punch for today!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|will keep you busy for hours on end.  the bad news is they only give you 20 games at first. the other 112 take forever to earn or cost real money.  lame
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is funny right from the start. It's full of witty humor, not just a bunch of sexual, profane garbage. Also, the singing is really fantastic. Unlike some might think, this movie isn't just some musical with a bunch of singing. It's got humor and a good plot line.
0152465073|5.0|Highly recommend this elegant translation of The Little Prince.<br />All families should have this tome on their bookshelves.  HIghly recommended.
B0015AARJI|5.0|No issues with the controller.  Dual shock works great.  Heavy feel, like the weight of this controller of standard non dualshock controllers

B000FC1QQU|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series by Alexander McCall Smith.  It gives a feel for the culture and is insightful concerning human nature.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  When you hate to get to the last page because you know you'll be finished, that means it's a good one!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This series is awesome!! Now owning the dvd, bluray, and having digital copies to go, I can watch it over and over again! Can't wait for the final books to be released and the HBO series to progress with them.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|It has several different slots so that you can adjust angle, I just wish that I could acheive a greater slants so that it is easier to read from a table top.
1449320104|5.0|I was really glad to see that Amazon would like me to rate this book. It is written exactly like I wanted it to be: concise, no redundant word, all the material and as much as possible important details. No silly stories, no feelings being expressed, nothing like these. If you're a non-beginner programmer and a busy person, you know what you want, and you expect a N-pages book to contains N-pages of knowledge (because you otherwise get quickly tired and start skipping pages), then that's the book for you. Don't you think that my high rating of the book is because of the similarity between the last names (which probably indicates a common medieval origin in Spain) -- every word is true!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I was one of the many young girls that was in love with these guys back in the 80s/90s. My father swore I would be embarrassed I ever thought they were great... guess what Dad - \\"my boys\\" still are great!<br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing them live back in 2008 and while I was excited that they were making new music again, I wasn't exactly in love with \\"The Block\\". It was too adult for me, and not something I was willing to play in the car or around the house with my kids around. I did and still play the old NKOTB stuff around and my kids like \\"Mom's old music\\".<br /><br />When I heard about \\"10\\" I held my breath, but then snippets started coming out and it brought me back. It really reminds me of the songs that I grew up loving, the songs that I would sing non-stop while dancing around.<br /><br />The \\"Boys\\" picked out winners this time. The songwritters/producers on this album know their stuff. The harmonies are great, I love the lyrics, the music. It's rare that I have an album where I love pretty much every song and even rarer that I go out to buy an album on it's release date. \\"10\\" lives up to everything that I expect from NKOTB. I've been listening to it many times since I bought it over at Target (2 bonus tracks). Yes, the \\"Boys\\" are now men and they have improved with the years. I look forward to hearing more. 10 is a perfect 10!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its very good &amp; challenging set of games.  its very enjoyable for the family. i like it. a lil bit
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really like the first book.  The second book was great and I could not wait to finish it.  The final book was a shocker.  Did not expect it to take the turn of events it took.  But the end finished for the best. Best book series I've read in a long time.
0316232955|5.0|This has become one of my favorite books ever ! Already being a huge Chris Colfer fan, SBL made me love him even more. I highly recommend those who haven't read it to read like RIGHT NOW !!!!!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Thought I had it all together at 68 yrs. old but saw Ruiz  on Super Soul Sunday and decided to read his book.  It's a life changer.  I guess there' s always something new to learn.  Changed my perspective on so many &#34;issues&#34; that life presents us with. I recommend out to anyone at any age - wish I had read it in my 20's!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have just started book three and I loved 1 &2.  I will be sad when I finish 3.  Hope she writes other books.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was totally absorbed in this book from the beginning to the very last sentence!  I recommended it to my daughters and my sister!
B003CRM6QO|4.0|Flash Gordon is a great comic strip character from the 1930's.  There were Flash Gordon comics, movie serials and merchandise. You have to look beyond the obvious attempt to make this movie &#34;campy&#34;.  By and large it is pretty bad from that viewpoint.  What carries the film for me is the soundtrack by Queen which is awesome and the acting of Max Von Sydow as the Emperor Ming.  Von Sydow is an under-appreciated talent. He carries the show with portrayal of &#34;Ming the Merciless&#34;.  Timothy Dalton needs to try and get this film off his resume.  Watch Flash Gordon for fun and don't expect too much.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This film was interesting, but about a half an hour too long. The build up just dragged the story out. I know they wanted to set up the story, but I found myself getting bored in the middle of the film. The best part is the last 15 or 20 minutes.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|Excalibur is a super film.  the acting is outstanding and the cinematography excellent.  Once again I have to credit the excellent use of music from Wagner as one of the highlights of the movie.  I highly recommend it.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I am a bit behind in my film viewing, but I must say that I found The King's Speech to be more enjoyable than I had imagined. The performances were outstanding. You cared about these characters and found yourself rooting for them. A great film.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Bad piggies brings out our Creativity.<br />Kids love it. I Haven't played it much but I like it too.<br /><br />-
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|This is a very amazing album by Woodkid. He first sold me when I heard iron back in 2009. Only issue I had was on one song I could barely hear him. But they way he stops singing to let you hear his melodies is just brilliant. You should give this album a chance if you bare reading this review. Even if you don't listen to this type of music, you will not be disappointed.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I watch quite a few films of this sort, and am usually disappointed. SINISTER uses the now well-trodden trope of a box of films found in the attic and actually manages to make this device seem new. Despite a few plot-perforations and other little things, this film is truly frightening. All I know is that SINISTER left me with some honest goosebumps as I walked through my darkened house after viewing it, afraid to look behind me.<br /><br />Very good acting and filming: Ethan Hawke and crew all give commendable performances here, and Fred Dalton Thompson plays a small but memorable role as \\"the Sheriff.\\" The Special Features, particularly the \\"Living in a House of Death\\" featurette about a real-life \\"murder house\\" in Iowa, are in many ways as good as the Main Feature.
