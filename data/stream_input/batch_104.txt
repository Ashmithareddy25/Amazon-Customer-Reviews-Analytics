B0014UCTBS|5|the quality of the shirt and the print is great. honestly I expected a smaller size, I ordered a L size but it seems almost an XL.   Lorenzo, Italy
B00CHNNQ9A|4|Keeps head warmer than no hat.
B00CZ9LI14|5|Fit my grandson perfectly & he adores the monkey face.  Colors on the shirt were exactly as they showed online.
B005HFLYGC|5|I bought this shirt for my husband who had one like it that he had for nearly 30 years. Its warm and well made. He didn't think he could ever replace his old shirt that was worn nearly out. I found this one and he is delighted. The size is roomy and fits over another shirt if desired.
B0081CMYBM|5|NICE LOOKING TANK TOPS<br />Just the tank top I was looking for AND I FOUND ON amazon..<br />Great tank top and very reasonable prices!
B00A8OVZZ2|3|Wasn't expecting them to be so shiney, but the work under a long sweater and boots.  Washed well and wouldn't recommnd putting in dryer.
B001FC1YF2|5|These, like most of the NYDJ line, are very flattering.  I wear a size 8 in many pants, but these are vanity sized, so I wear a 6. Check the NYDJ web site to find your size before you order.  I recently started wearing \\"better\\" jeans, rather than <$20 Lee, Levi, or Gloria Vanderbilt.  They really are more flattering.
B00505DWNM|3|purchase for a fried she look like a midget chubby batgirl shirt was tight,
B00PBU4DAC|5|Awesome
B006WWW9RM|5|Daugher loves her Hello Kitty night shirt-fits and look great. Design is really pretty and colorful. Can be tied to wear as shirt as well!
B000X2PAZA|5|Got this for my boyfriend and he LOVES it!!
B00OWFPKQI|5|I bought these beanies as a gift for on rod my daughters. They were not expected to ship for another three weeks, but I was pleasantly surprised to receive them well in time for the holidays! They are very thick and full, very worth what I paid for them! I would definitely shop with Luxury Divas again! Thank you!
B004EM0FC8|5|...for making it possible to wear all those shirts I have been unable to wear, and for NOT being trimmed in lace! Easy to use, adjustable, looks great...I got one black and one white and they both go with EVERYTHING.
B004M6UD46|5|Soft Leather Wallet with room to spare for credit cards, ID's and special items!<br /><br />Very Nice.<br /><br />I just hope it last  a very long time.
B002QUAASO|5|Nice Shirt !!
B00NUJEF6S|5|hi love the look of these earmuffs feel good look great on like these earmuffs
B005IUN1I0|3|works as needed, read the other review needs to be hand washed a few time then the package odor goes away.
B00FR6AYS0|1|This has to be made for a child. The hat doesn't even look the same as the picture. Definitely not made to an adults head size. Not even unisex... I mean a mans head will not fit this hat.  Dislike this purchase
B002OEBE46|3|My toddler wears a size 7 so I got a size 8. Too big is better than too small is my way of thinking. OMG these run very small! She can barely get these on! I decided not to return them though because she has a younger sister. But order 2 sizes up!
B00DOYE5TQ|5|Yes, T as in Terrific. I was hesitant to buy this dress online. I am either a Petite 4 or regular 4. Well, this is regular 4 and it is<br />a perfect fit. Love the color aubergine. I can wear it as is or with a silk blouse inside. Very happy with this purchase.
B00KHF1LYM|3|SO Disappointed, Although I ordered this larger than the size I thought I needed (XL) It was still too small. My baby sister is a Double 0 and it fit her perfect, This has to be a scam.... Theres no way what I ordered was anywhere close to being a medium let alone an Extra Large. Don't buy it...i'm putting it on ebay for the same price, i don't trust them to give me my $6 back.
B007P6SE0K|5|Well there isn't much to say about collar stays, but these work great and it's the only set I could find (at a reasonable price) that had only the two sizes I wanted! A few for my normal-length collars and a few for my short collars.
B000WW97YG|5|Thanks a lot, the price was great and it´s a top quality underwear, very comfortable, i got no problem with the shipment
B00EV1AFEK|3|I washed this product to specs and it shrunk HARD! I sent it back and they were very good about getting me a new one in a bigger size.
B009ZEY8QO|4|It runs a small.  My tall and svelte nephew nearly broke his neck when trying to &#34;ninja up&#34;.  But it's a cute concept and a fun shirt.
B00HJXLB6I|1|Way too small! I'm thin so I usually wear a medium in American shirts, but I get a large in long sleeve because I have long arms. I got an XXL and had to have help taking it off it was so tight. Not to mention the sleeves were too short. I gave it to my sister that wears a MEDIUM in long sleeves and it fit her perfectly. She's thin and has no breast. Whatever.
B008PDC1AG|5|Love them.  Ordered size small for my daughter.  Soft and washes beautifully.Would like more bamboo fabrics.  Well made in spite of CHINA manufacture.
B00C20E124|5|they arrived today and immediately tried them on, the material used is much comfortable to wear all the time, unlike the sport jocks. Will be buying more in the near future! :)
B003N9BTY6|4|First of all I got my shipment really quick. That was a plus considering that I ordered this bra along with a strapless for a wedding. The bra supports me really well. It also minimizes quite well. The only think that I don't like is there is not full coverage on the sides. Other than that its a great bra and quality is good considering the price.
B00EZMZOCI|4|I previously have not bought Lucky Brand because they are overpriced, but caught them on an Amazon deal and love them. I still won't pay for them at regular price, but I do like them. The denim is softer than other brands. The fit is okay and looks better than other straight leg jeans.
B00PRJ1OY0|2|This is a cute top but it is too short for the peplum style. It may be a good fit for a petite woman but if you are on the taller side skip this one. Otherwise it's a cute top.
B00MYCBD62|5|Fit well, made well, very comfortable, color very pretty, would buy again.
B00GUSNQM0|4|This sweatshirt is amazing! And, it arrived super fast. It's well made; not just some cheap feeling product. The only thing is I'm assuming this is a Adult Medium for a male vs. a female. It's pretty wide and large. I'm hoping it will shrink a little. Super nice sweatshirt and would order again.
B002VK6TLQ|5|LOVE IT....my Dad loves it. He gets so many compliments when he wears it. Makes a great conversation starter. I'll probably buy a few more to keep on hand when my Dad wears this one out!. :)
B004QJ0330|4|Make sure you use cold water setting, and do not dry in dryer as they shrink, I was going to purchase the white socks but I have not made up my mind since these shrink.
B00D8S6XJS|5|Great Fit!
B000BVXZ4Q|4|My daughter is typically a size 6 and I didn't want to go up to the next size but they were too small for her. The inside tag on the tights actually says 4-5.  They are really nice tights otherwise.
B0091MC4M0|5|Bought this for my niece and it suited very well.. Everyone is very happy with this dress.. the flower is an extra addition that goes well..
B00KI7E4KW|5|Awesome hat! Well made! Really cute!
B009HE0640|5|I love this scarf. i get a lot of compliments . Will buy more. It's light , but yet warm.
B005CSOILW|5|These are comfortable sweat pants. As advertised. I have no complaints. They are decent price. Fairly well made. What's to hate?
B003XKO1PO|4|I have been ordering Lee Slender Fist Jeans for years.  I wish they were in black.  Howervesr, these Classic Fist Marilyn Jeans in black are great.  I wish I would special order length.  I am 4'11\\" and even petites are too long.
B00DEMU7Z4|5|One of my favorite shows the picture of the cast is real nicely made had compliments of it.  And comfy.
B00PUAX232|5|My little monkey loves his monkey pjs.
B00GK1MJXY|4|Good shirt arrived guickly
B005Z2LS68|4|Warm and semi comfortable.
B004V3HO24|3|pants holder-upper. Good value. Manufactured by old world craftsmen using free range chickens fed with gluten free grains and stuff.
B001D77GII|5|bought this coat before the holidays as a gift for my daughter. Classic styling. Classy looking. Excellent fit. Plus DOTD pricing was exceptional. She loves this coat and is wearing frequently. Too bad I didn't buy one in my size.
B00IEBSUP4|5|This scarf is so nice for the price!  I bought it as a male favor at a bridal shower and he loves it!  It was exactly what I was looking for - fairly lightweight, soft and not too large.  Perfect shade of navy, too.
B00WTTOHRM|5|I have two of these now.  They are snugger through the midsesection than a lot of tanks which I think makes them more flattering.  Love  the asymmetry of the bottom hem. Very feminine.  Wash and dry very well.  No shrinkage or wrinkling.  Love!!
B0057XQK0Y|5|My daughter actually gave me my first Treble shirt for my birthday!<br />Ordered one or two more from you for myself and my granddaughter!!!
B00HR0YFGG|5|Well made and I like the style. Goes great with casual pants, jeans and shorts. I wish they had more styles like this.
B004COACCG|4|Great fit
B004ZZNYVI|4|Terry cloth is nice and soft.  Don't know how absorbent it will be over a wet swim suit yet but I think it will be okay.
B00NFOAPH6|5|I really like this product...exactly what I expected. The customer service was VERY good!!!  My order didn't ship correctly for whatever reason, I contacted them and they shipped another one to me very quickly and I got it right away. Great product and great customer service...I am very happy with this buy!  It looks exactly like it does in the picture.
B009A86PKW|5|These clothes are just great, is very nice, I really liked the fabric, is perfect. The colors also liked a lot. I am very pleased.
B009FOYDGO|5|Thick single piece of leather. Great feel while wearing. Not so stiff that it feels like it's cutting into you.
B00PL9GXCY|4|Bought this in a 4t for my daughter who just turned 3 years old. It's perfect for her right now. She is about 36lbs and is slightly taller than most 3 year olds. the material is very light and thin... Perfect for Florida weather.
B00C5H4HSW|5|Shorts fit very well and the fabric seems to be very low maintenance. We'll see how it does a couple of washes.
B00OOQBQ5E|4|i like it
B0098VKD54|4|Fine. A bit thin, but overall good. The heel sits perfectly and fit well under my boots. They do the job fine. Make my butt look awesome
B00011VJ80|4|Have used these on all my hikes I go on. Only 4 stars though because of the advertised odor control. After a 12 mile hike, feet and boots had a strong odor still, as did the socks. Socks were fairly damp as well. Overall though, the construction and material of the sock seem strong, and I'm looking forward to getting a lot of use out of them
B00MCWV8M8|3|Is so pretty, but to small
B00G49P9OI|5|Great shirt!
B00HRJU11K|5|Love the dress.
B00L6IXBYM|5|Exactly as shown.  Perfect purchase.  Thanks.
B00NNH9QCU|3|It's supposed to be a reversible beanie and on the reverseable side you can actually see the thread and stiching. It's not a huge deal but kinda annoying other than that it's perfect!
B005FYHTPA|5|nice
B003OUW9FC|1|This specific t-shirt is made out of the typical CHEAP cotton and the design is not even the same shown in the picture, is a LOT smaller. I returned the t-shirt because I didnt like the way the material felt/didnt like the texture. It felt itchy, cheap and the design so small.<br />I do not recomend buying this shirt here, instead check it out at you local Hot Topic or local mall instead.
B004H1FX64|5|My daughter loved it!
B00FT5PWBS|5|This shirt is awesome! Fits perfectly & looks great! The material is nice & soft & everywhere I've went people have complemented or asked where I got it.
B00FMMB0Z0|5|They are so comfortable I just love wearing them.  They make me look 10 lbs. lighter.
B005JD3TEC|5|Best socks in the world for adults and kids. Just find the right style. My grandson likes all of these I purchased for him. He is 10 and wears a size 4.5 to a 5 shoe; great fit.
B00DZODDPM|5|beautiful shirt wore well, well finished and comfortable recommend it to everyone and it met my expectations will be satisfied with the product, very good ...
B00NE3YJJI|5|Love this bra.  It is so comfortable. Great for wearing around the house and running errands.  Not enough support for working out.
B003E91JX6|5|My boyfriend was a HIT at the Halloween party! I have to admit I was a bit jealous when so many people asked for a picture with him (mostly) women. Great experience and lots of fun. He looked AWESOME!
B007RX4QIA|5|fits perfectly, and i got many compliments! head turning halloween costume.
B00I4E97AS|5|The Brixton fedora is amazing...perfect fit and amazing quality.  I still can't believe how light it feels.  I am very pleased with this purchase...can't wait to rock this  hat.
B00A78Y330|2|I got a shirt grey color not brown, and I was expecting a dress, not a shirt!!
B0018OY5X0|1|These jeans are not the same cut as the old 569's.Shame on you Levis. I guess us old geezers who have bought your jeans and shirts for years don't count anymore. What happened to you guys , you used to as reliable and American as apple pie. Anyhow if you are a old geezer like me . I am a 48yr old ,270lb , 6'2\\" male and  if you want a jean that is comfortable with room at the thigh and looks great with quality material, check out the Sean John \\"Hamilton\\" relaxed fit jean. It is the bomb. These Sean John jeans fit like the old 569's . Fair play Puffy , you came through for us with these jeans.
B00E0HWYLM|5|Bought these for my four year old grandson for Christmas.  His face lit up n he ran to hug n thank me!
B00TS89RMM|4|love the color
B00UNK3AOK|5|Arrived soon, perfect fit.
B00ICLFPZY|5|I really enjoy the product. It's really really soft and the quality of the stitches are very good. It's fun to sleep with this thing because it's comfortable since it's kind of loose and baggy. I'm 155 cm and maybe it would be better if I had bought an M sized one, because the leg parts are shorter for me than I had expected. But this is all my fault, nothing to blame the seller. My height was on the boundary of the S size, and I chose to have this one instead of an M one. Still I'm so happy with it because it's the most original pyjamas I've ever had. I'd recommend it to everyone who loves Totoro!
B0018OR4MO|5|good job! met my expectations,the ones set by the seller! i usually have to try on at the store, these levi's came to me exactly as described. what a relief. pants that fit and i did not have to go to the store.
B005GPHMK0|5|Excellent in all aspects - size, color and quality.
B00J0CJ16S|3|Predone scarfs just aren't my thing. It would fit better if I could tie it myself
B00HWFP2MM|5|I love the headband it fits perfect and I wore it yesterday for a soccer game that was 31 degrees and my ears stayed warm and it  also didn't fall off during the entire game. Also the shipping was fast it arrived on the fourth day.
B00KJ6TP92|5|Cute, cute jeans!  My 5 year old has a little belly and no hips.  The adjustable waist is wonderful!  I have not washed them yet so idk how they will wear as I bought them for next winter.
B00LFEJPE2|5|I initially bought the size 8 because I wear a size 6 in everything else, but found it to be too tight in the shoulders and upper arms.  Granted, I'm a fit person, but I'm no body builder, so I was surprised that it fit this way.  Sent back the 8 and got a 10--- love it!!  Warm, fashionable, and well made!
B00UTVV6A8|5|Too cute but the lights are super sensitive. I bought this for our 4 year old that is starting pre-school this year and even got his name embroidered on it - he LOVES it! We did have to adjust the straps and tie them up but I'm sure he will grow into it!
B002KZIWSU|3|I went by directions and still the fingers are too long.  Either your size chart is off or my husband has extremely short fingers.
B003YEFCKW|5|This was a heavier plastic than I anticipated (which pleased me) and matched exactly the original in my husband's wallet.  Quick shipping.  I couldn't have been more pleased!
B000N8RXWC|4|should have bought the 15 inch or longer ones
B00MZG4YIQ|4|Love the print, but had to shorten it about 18&#34; and I'm average height.
B00C6ENPQ4|5|I didn't really think I would like the glasses when I ordered them. I was wrong. The fit is good and the light is actually enough to read with! A pleasant surprise!
B00TUGVS8S|4|I like it, but it is too small and the color doesn't match my top.
B009A8B0L6|4|color is great and they fit well and not too awfully tight on the leg.  I think they'll last for a while and the way they are made gives me confidence that the toe won't blow out right away.
B00FDP4KD0|5|Very nice dress, super comfy. Comes up relatively high at the front so won't be suitable if you are tall!
B00KIF0NDQ|5|Love it my girls love it fit  well
B005GTQN2Y|5|Very Nice quality especially for the price. Washed multiple times with no issues. Will def order again as baby grows!
B00A8NOI1Q|5|Much softer material than in the past.  Very comfortable.
B0051CBDQW|3|Fast shipment. Fits great for me (5'4 and 125 lbs.) wish it had loops for the belt but other than that I love it. Material is super soft. Great buy for the cost.
B00PBUMEWG|5|Beautiful dress!!! Best than expected!
B00400S5W6|3|Any woman with a large bust knows that there are two different kinds of &#34;support&#34;- there is the lifting support that comes with a traditional bra and then there is the squish'em and hold'em support that comes with a sports bra. This tank is definitely of the Squish'em and Hold'em kind!<br /><br />I am a size 12 with 36F bust and I ordered a Size M in this tank after reading all of the reviews and looking at the sizing chart. The tank itself fits great and the bra band is perfect, but the way the bra is built supports more like a band than like two cups. Be aware that if you have a large cup size, some of your boobs will end up in your armpits! I am guessing that if you are up to a size D (maybe even a DD), this tank would be perfect to wear out and about with adequately upheld ladies. For my size chest, however, this will strictly be a wear-around-the-house cami. I should also point out that I really like the firm support during the day, but if you have very sensitive breasts while nursing, the tighter hold may be uncomfortable.<br /><br />Really, the only major advantage I see to this tank vs. the $30 Target ones is the thick straps that don't dig into your shoulders. I am not sure this alone justifies the cost, but it is certainly an advantage over cheaper tanks.<br /><br />Basically, if you have a very large chest, this tank will support you throughout the day but don't expect it to be flattering!
B00FD2MDAK|5|DUDE, ITS PUNISHER!
B00BRLFUE2|4|I genuinely adored this top, I love the lace and the boning and it fit well throughout. It's just a little too small at the bust, I was \\"busting\\" out. I'm normally a D and bought the large. I loved it though.<br />Let me preface this with, I wanted to wear it out, under a jacket or sweater.
B007N05ET2|5|This outfit is so cute.  It is well made and washed and dried well.  Our granddaughter has wore it several times and is always complimented.
B00PFKVSDS|1|Not as cute as the picture shows and the material looks like you killed an animal and put it on your head. The inside material is not what I expected. Would not recommend.
B00XBFI6U2|4|I'm 5'6&#34; 132 lb and I ordered a size S and it's still a bit big. I'll still wear it because it's not TOO big, just bigger than I expected.
B001QOTRR6|5|My fiance loved this hat and mentioned he likes the fact that it has an actual baseball cap bill not a truckers bill<br />and it came super early
B00STWH2UC|4|Love it
B007M8CN12|4|I wanted to purchase these glasses because I'm an avid fan of the cat-eye glasses look but my vision isn't bad enough that I need actual glasses. Most people can't tell these are fake until they ask to try them on and they realize that the lenses are plastic. However, the rhinestones in the picture are arranged in a circular pattern and one of mine is a little lop-sided. It's not very noticable but still something that caused me to rate it 4/5 instead of 5/5
B0064Y42X2|2|Too short in length, rise was too short and not a gusseted crotch (which is less comfortable in tight exercise wear, I would have expected more from danskin.  They used to make a poly spandex yoga pant that I have and love and they have holes in them but I have tried in vain to replace them.
B00B9TX49A|3|If you have a big butt, hips or thighs I'd recommend going up a size. I'm 5'5, petite, but have big but and big thighs with a small waist. The size 8 was extremely tight. When I asked to exchange for a bigger size amazon wouldn't let me. Said I had to return the product and then repurchase again. Other than that the pants are cute!
B00I0M7VZM|5|Biutifull!! Loved it!!!
B008CGQQXY|5|I spend a good deal of time in my home, and I feel that, when home, I might as well be as comfortable as possible. My old robe is 5-7 years old and no longer as cozy as it once was, and I received this as a gift for my birthday.<br /><br />I wear it over my comfy at-home clothing with the belt loose like a sort of indoor jacket. This robe is luxuriously soft, big and roomy, and snugly warm. I basically don't take it off if I'm in the house. Did I say it's warm? Because it's warm. Super glad I have this, and I'll be gladder still when the cold winter nights start rolling in.<br /><br />Great item, definitely worth the money. Already recommended this to a friend looking for an 'indoor jacket'
B002KJ8GW8|4|I needed a cute, classy costume for a party.  This costume, though sort of cheaply made (velcro back fastenings), fit the bill.  I received a lot of compliments on this costume.
B00BL8JB1Y|5|I absolutely love this purse.
B004TQJFE8|5|They fit great, and are defiantly made to last.  I have been threw many brands, and sizes of jeans over the year from both Wally world, and JCPenny, and they either rip along the seam/crotch, or wear out pretty fast. I cant tell you right now, I think I would have to TRY to rip these pants. I plan on ordering a few more pair in the next month and just tossing all my other pants out.
B009I58Y06|5|excellent!
B00HSNIY5U|5|Perfect for the tea party my girls and I were invited too!
B0054SNU50|5|Great product very warm, even with out having a zipper!  Color was perfect and fit was just right.  Would buy again!
B00N597W8Q|5|Great wallet and very flexible.
B000VYWJ5O|1|The picture looks great, but when you get the item in the mail it looks like someone threw some fabric together. I could have done better myself! Not worth the $15.00!
B00864NP1S|5|She loves it!  It's soft and warm like a ball of fur and it makes my happy, sleepy wife purr!  5 star rating!
B00K0U3N9A|3|Got it for my girlfriend. She has platinum hair so the color was spot on. She said it fitted well. I've never seen her wear it so I don't know what else to add other than maybe the end user should buy it?
B001I21FXA|5|Beautiful!
B00I6KUAVK|5|very comfortable!
B00IKUUHTG|1|Not true to size. You get what you pay for
B005KUG99Q|5|Bought it for a friends pajama themed birthday party and it was a hit! Very warm and fit well. Everything came as described in the ad. Definitely would recommend if you're in need of an adult onesie and like sock monkey.
B007947U8U|1|This product is only good for one wear.  The rubberized bottoms on the feet fall apart with the first wash.  The entire product begins to look like it was attacked and eaten by months after the second wash.  Not something I would ever buy again.
B009A4YIZA|1|It has strong rubber smell. Had to send it back the next day.<br />Also the small size was too big for me.
B00835QQRK|5|This was bought as a present for a friend who likes this style of belt.  She was happy with the quality of the webbing and with the variety of colors.
B0007YXVJQ|5|Great fit! Excellent quality!
B00N5FI4BY|1|i brae was fine but the bottom piece is too small not like it looks in the picture is more like a thong ..
B007P6TBY8|5|Great gloves for the price point, are comparable to those in the $100 range. Id recommend buying a size smaller than normal for a tight fit.
B00JAJDKL8|2|Great if you are a senior citizen. Don't recommend unless you like short baggy shorts
B00NP99MCU|3|I received this skirt before the estimated time...which was great. However, I ordered a 2x, due to the fact that I normally wear a size 18w. Well this 2x looked more like a 14. I tried it on and it hugs me tight....BUT I was able to fit it. I was planning on wearing it to a wedding, but I think the fit will make it a little too sexy for that type of event. I'll save it for a date with the hubby. So it didn't fulfill my expectations...but I'm not totally disappointed since I will be able to wear it for another occasion. In my opinion, it runs small for plus size.
B00DZG5O9S|2|small sized and poorly made. belt loop 1/2 sewed on. bought these over many years and these are nothing like what they used to be.
B00E06LPLI|2|The shirt I received was made my Victorious and is not fitted like in the picture. Cool shirt in the correct size but not tapered like shown in the picture.
B00M7471ZO|5|Great Product. Gets the job done and stops the friction.I feel so free wearing these instead of having to wear shorts under my skirts/dresses. The sizing is true to fit. It has stayed in place for me each time I wear them. The longest I have worn them for was probably 3-4 hours and they stayed in place.
B00VPTORXG|5|Love it! Perfect fitting and it's a beautiful dress, I'm happy with my purchase.
B00NIX4AMU|5|My husband LOVES this shirt he wears it EVERY GAME DAY .,,he was so happy and he gets a lot of fun comments on it too lol...
B00FAP4A7O|5|Excellent
B008MWJWRK|5|I ordered these for a hiking trip and loved them.  They are lightweight, dry quickly, and have just the right amount of stretch.  I am very big on sun protection and was thrilled these had UPF 50 as well.  I usually wear an 8 (5'3&#34;/135lb) and should have ordered a 6; I definitely put the drawstring to good use.  I personally would not wear these to work, but I think they are suitable for any outdoor activities and casual outings.
B00WV1X77O|1|No good!!<br />This dress looks like a cheap Halloween costume. Do not waste the $$
B009VMUJYK|5|I love my shirt it was what I expected.I would recommend it to anyone..
B00DYX69FA|2|It's cheaply made. And the thong came with it was totally too small. I felt disappointed!!
B00E9UTDH8|5|very comfortable and don't ride up
B004OWMPL2|5|I wish I had bought this years ago. I'm 5' 8&#34; and about 160 lbs. This item fits comfortably and looks nice enough to wear alone.  I wear it under my work shirts. It's not too long. It doesn't make me sweat but keeps me warm enough that I don['t complain. I'll by this item again.
B00EIQQU4W|4|This is the first time I have ordered a bathing suit online. I found the fit  true to size based on other clothing I have bought in this size. The flare was a bit much for my body type as I am smaller in the hip area so I will have it altered. I do think the design is very flattering but when swimming I anticipate the loose flare being a problem in the water (floating up). This is the only reason I didn't give this a 5 star. The straps are very comfortable. I paired my top with a swim skirt, very comfortable for walking around the pool or beach. Overall I liked it so much I plan on ordering another one!
B001L9AYU0|1|its quality is poor. Rubbish.
B000UZ5ZBY|4|It is hard to put the cig pack in the case and hard to get it out.  Otherwise it is great.
B00KBSA7VS|5|Purchased two, one for my hubby and one for a friend.  Every year I get them both a fun mechanic's shirt as a Christmas gift.  They both liked this one.
B00IDCPM5K|3|Didn't care for the quality or fit of this cap.
B00SCNCSO8|4|Somewhat small but it does its job!
B00JIUMA56|5|A Great piece.
B00EF427EE|5|This shirt was great! Arrived in like 3 days.  Perfect for my dads 80th surprise party!
B008RJSOJ0|4|The fit was more snug and belly flattening than expected which is good. Posture autoimproved with wear. My upper back was uncomfortable during extensive wear. Strong material in my opinion. I will be using this more than my Victorias Secret Spanx...Definitely better!
B00F7YD5K6|5|Great father's day present to my husband. It's a conversation starter everywhere he wears it and people always ask where we got it.
B00LTP38DG|4|somewhat smaller than expected. I am not a big guy at 190 lbs. and I though it was a little small. wished I would have gotten a XL.
B0076R6MFM|5|Favorite fleece ever.
B00L5OCF58|3|The costume was very large for me considering that I am 5'3&#34; and 124 lbs.  Still I should have known that!  I did need the costume for an event and the event worked out fine.
B00HUQYPLM|4|perfect
B00IMQ0OSM|5|LOVE THIS HAT!!!  Have had this hat in past & wore it for YEARS until it became my gardening hat b/c it just wasn't pretty enough to wear in public. Friends who come over while i'm gardening always remark about what a great hat still! I went to a store & bought matching red ribbons & sewed them on just 'cuz I don't want to worry about blowing off - no wind = tuck them up inside.  I'm a skin cancer lady so MUST have good coverage & this does it in style!
B00HO5M3MW|3|Fingertips work well.<br />Little too big for my hands; I got medium since they said medium for women, and my hands aren't small...<br />There's a hole in one of the fingers; first time I've worn them so I didn't do it.
B00MH6BI5Q|5|I love this shirt. It looks good on me. I have an apple figure with small hips and legs. It does a great job of hiding my middle. It is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. It is made well and washes with no problems, just throw it in with other like colors and dry in the dryer.
B00QIKWGF8|4|The dress fit as expected, I may have been able to get away with 1 size smaller since my waist is a little smaller but it fit in the hips fine. I got a lot of compliments on it.
B0030CTQZK|4|Just as I expected Beautiful
B00EWELHT8|3|Maybe it's just my monitor, but I thought this dress would be a berry color.  Instead, it is a deep burgundy, which does not do well with my skin tone.  Due to this, I sent it back.  However, the dress fit true-to-size and seemed to be made well.  I did like how the fabric draped.  It would work great for someone with a different complexion.
B00NOUY8Z6|5|Very cute hat and very comfortable too! Very pleased with my purchase. Thank you so much. Debra
B000UG8FW4|1|Very cheap. One time use.
B00DDU9OT2|5|Belt was very nice
B007SOMF90|4|A little smaller than I/we would have expected but my wife adjusted the straps all I can say is that she looks great when wearing it.
B001GXBQ2G|4|very fun for a costume or wig party, but is way to shiny to look real.  Very full and pretty.
B00AF93V48|5|Fun and comfy socks I hung these socks on the tree the 1st person to spit them.. go to keep them.. Fun
B00K40RQ0S|1|Not what I expected
B003H6DC9K|5|I do like this product but I'm thinking I should of bought a size down. Still like the product
B00NB1VC0W|3|Too small
B00FX9ZDOQ|5|Love this patch on my jacket. I love the color.
B0026P45TY|5|I have lost weight so I needed to see if a bra one size smaller would fit and it fits super! So glad I know what to wear now.<br />Thanks!  Comfortable straps and perfect fit for me.  But I've been a playtex fan for years.
B00IFZS0K4|5|loved it
B00KOKWPAE|4|hat is a little tight. I hope it will stretch
B00BC3DOSE|1|See through material, came with a hole on the side of the left leg.I didn't bother wearing them, just threw in the trash!!
B00MADWDEG|5|So cute on !! fits like a glove
B003H12ESA|5|Great item
B00MLYICNK|5|I got the costume really fast and for a great price! The costume is cute and it does fit but I'm 5'1&#34; and a c cup, the dress especially the top is a little tight (I got the large). I can't wait til Halloween to wear it!
B00EDR30R6|5|I have been using dress belts for 30+ years and I have finally found one that looks and wears perfectly.
B0081EMCHG|5|good！ Ilike it.
B00CFQZUZM|5|I give this 5 stars, I really liked this skirt. Fits just fine and the fabric looks expensive even thought it was super cheap. I would recomend this.
B00817DW8Q|1|I have been wearing these shirts for at least 10 years.  They are no longer the same shirt as far as color choice, fit, thickness of material and overall quality.  It is bad enough that I have to order these shirts with no choice of the color I receive, then out of the package of four, three have heavy stains which I presume is dye gone awry or whatever and three of the shirts have a longer shoulder seam on the right as opposed to the left.  These shirts are so paper thin, they wouldn't even make good paint rags.<br />Fruit of the Loom should be embarrassed to have their name on this garbage.
B0018OOUQ2|5|Very good it fits  I like
B00GU8907K|5|i like it
B00D2M3PBE|5|Granddaughter loves it.  It fits well and its nice quality. It was nce to be able to find it online.
B00AQMV68W|4|I ordered a Medium (Size 36/ 10) and it fits as expected based on what other reviewers said. I'm usually a 0, this fits like a 2. Nice wool material, fully lined. I removed the buttons which add nothing to the skirt IMO and I think it looks great. It fits lower on my hips than in the picture, if there had been a smaller size I would have gotten it and worn it as depicted. Over all, great quality for the price, very happy with the purchase.
B00HXK4DM6|5|My son (and his friends) loved these socks.
B00CQ0S30G|3|Too short for a tall teen
B00809HN80|4|i like these, a little corny,yes, but.... the quality is good.the legs could be longer.
B0085JHW1S|5|if so this is your answer! These booties are one of my favorite baby products. Babies can't get them off, unlike most baby socks that fall off and get lost. They are warm, cozy and perfect for new babies.
B0088MU7XM|4|Warm, waterproof, light. Very good finishing touch. Town or outdoor wear, to use to go to the office or your free time.
B0045S0H1K|4|This belt is very long, but otherwise looks great.
B002FHELT2|5|These are terrific, thick and soft. I love the feeling of thick socks and often have to layer two or even three  pairs of Hanes, especially when playing sports, but these are fine by themselves. Not just a great \\"value\\" product, these stack up well against $20/pair hiking socks.
B00EEDOW9E|5|Easy swap out, with the screwdriver too. Looks great
B00GG1JDT6|5|Love these shirts.  We have only good things to say about the product and the service.  We will definitely buy from you again.
B000A2KDLY|5|so good. i feel safe in these pants.  i could do a lot in these.  i'm glad i got them for working and going out to play.
B00HHOXQXU|3|I usually get a bigger size because I am tall and that's one way to make sure the sleeves are long enough.  I usually by a large or X-large.  I bought this in a 2 X.  The sleeves are a little tight.  The coat has a lot of zippers and snaps to enlarge it if necessary.  That being said, if you unsnap it you just have all these &#34;rivets&#34; all over the place, which is unattractive.  The first row of snaps are along the entire zipper of the coat. When unsnapped, you end up with 4 rows of open snaps, no way to conceal them and adds about 4 inches to the coat diameter.  The pockets are not as large as they look.  The side pockets are up a little high, just a little under your breast line, and above your waist line which makes them a little awkward to use.  There are 2 long zippers up the sides of the coat that may add another inch in diameter.  I don't know if the designer of this coat was shooting for a &#34;one size fits all and it's adjustable&#34; or what.  The one good thing to say about this coat is, it's warm.  I will not send it back, but I wouldn't buy another one.
B00DH06OI2|5|Most of products were as we expected except one was two small
B003AXXWFY|5|I love the Bali Cami, it has a very smooth fit and is very light weight, it does everything it says, makes your clothing fit smooth, I love it and I will be ordering another color I have black. my order arrived very quickly, I love Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001BH8YKO|4|The grip is good and i love the feel of it. the little bow things at the end of each clip makes putting it on difficult but oh well. Beware: will create a muffin top if you have love handles so choose underwear wisely
B00KVVUQI4|4|I love this dress!!! I followed the sizing recommendations from the other reviews and ordered the large (I usually wear size 6 dresses) and the fit was fabulous! I cannot wait to wear this out :)
B008ZYCZ1U|5|I love it!
B006Z8HO9G|5|Fit was good, will be wearing this weekend.
B004XFVFU2|5|Worked great for my low cut and backless dress. Great price too, less than half of most department store prices
B00KFEFFVU|2|It wasn't true to size was bummed out couldn't return
B0094VLJBK|4|verry sexy
B0087ZFOZQ|2|This top was a weird fit. I'm a smaller chested woman, I wear x small and size 0 and the x small was tight in the chest area but HUGE towards the bottom. I know that the top is kind of suppose to be that style but it's over the top big. Not flattering at all. Also some of the laser cut designs were not even punched out all of the way. I'm returning this fir sure.
B00IN4SCXM|5|Great bibs. Not incredibly thick but definitely soft and are nice to have. I hate bibs with the plastic backing and am happy these don't have that. Would by again.
B004QF0TFQ|5|Men's socks are more complex than particle physics. I say that because material, fit, durability, breathe-ability, sweat-resistance, dye-fastness, allergenic response (itchiness), and shape retention are just some of the things us guys would like to see actually rated before buying a pair of socks. Alas, the sole (!) means of truth about men's socks is a &#34;call to FEET&#34; (as opposed to a call for ARMS, that being a completely unrelated appendage)... meaning we have to wear and wash them to know how socks measure up.  I have good news. These Dickies are proving to be superior in at least several of these categories... and most notably in the area of shape retention, which is my number one complaint when new socks shrink into a pair of mittens after just one run through the washer and dryer. Remarkably, these Dickies have retained 95% of their original size and that is most likely a sign of durability, as well. Good luck.
B00928XTRC|1|WTH are you thinking, allowing this to be sold on your site? If this is OK with you, then there is something seriously wrong with you & I will take my business elsewhere.
B00NGZFZUQ|5|they love it - great scarf
B003KPBQYG|2|Too tight. Marks everything...can't wear them with pants....
B005CSOMO0|5|Perfect fit and comfortable product
B009FV9IQC|4|As far as the shirt it is beautiful but it does run small
B00009MQH0|5|These are the best shoes! So stylish and cute! I recommend for the office or a night out. Way to go Target for carring the Isaac Mizrahi line!
B009IUKRX8|4|It's a great hat, but very slouchy.  It keeps your head warm and looks awesome.  Makes me want to grow dreds.
B00PGLJ3FG|5|made well.
B00HZ8CNL4|2|Pretty but too big, I order a size M and it was like a xl, specialty on the  front, its like for a girl with big boobs!
B007VZ34BY|4|Dress is just like the picture, fitting was alright. Quality good overall except for the belt which was a little flimsy.
B000MUDTTW|5|This outfit is so cute! It's even cuter in person! My son will be dressed for style this summer season! Thanks again for the quick shipping!
B00IGVB0NQ|4|perfect fit
B00HQMGSG0|5|Good service Good product
B007BG9ZN4|4|It's a good shirt. Not great. I still enjoy wearing it around.
B00V597C9C|5|It did shrink, but ill chalk that up to my bad laundry skills.
B003XWZ8PE|3|This tie was a gift for a pediatrician who absolutely loved it. I however, was disappointed when it arrived made of polyester, since the original listing said it was silk.
B00LK515IU|5|I love my new socks! I live on an island with only a Walmart, Payless Shoes and Dollar Tree at which to shop. I needed purple and turquoise socks, and there were none to be found here, so I looked on amazon.com and found these. They are so comfortable! They don't slide down, are not too tight or loose, and feel so good on my feet. The only thing is, although it says they are cotton, they don't feel like cotton socks... but they fit better, so I'm very happy with my purchase! I can also use the black, green and pink socks I received. I was afraid I wouldn't get the colors shown, but I got exactly what it showed, what I ordered. The price is great, and shipped for free. A big 5 stars from this customer!
B00QT4CGPI|5|Very nice for the price. It's SO comfortable.
B00BUKBG1Q|5|This dress is perfect, and I got many compliments when I wore it to a wedding recently! I will definitely buy more from this seller.
B005FA03HA|5|Great scrub pants they fit great. Cherokee is a great brand and I am glad I ordered them. They scrub tops. I needed a new pair because the pair I have was getting old.
B0044A9MI8|5|I cannot say enough good things about these products.  I purchased and the fit was perfect.  I use them around the house and when working out.  I also wear then when I am doing water sports (we live near the ocean and in the winter the water temps are cooler).  They wash up very well in my front loader on the hand wash cycle.  I also hang dry them.<br /><br />You will love how your legs look and feel.
B00HBL4QFG|5|Love this dress!
B00IR8K5EI|5|We loved the suit but will have to buy in store so my husband can try it on.
B00J6OR6D0|5|good
B00DF1FLL4|5|Fit as expected
B00XQG5F6Y|2|This does not hold cards or things you need as expected.  I have to use an old wallet to help me until another one, for another manufacturer comes in.
B000JE7UCS|4|Bought this hat cause I needed some coverage from the sun. When it arrived I was a bit disappointed the brim wasn't as wide as I'd hoped. So the coverage isn't great just ok. It keeps my head cool. Also, make sure you order a size up cause they do run a bit small. Lastly, I was a bit disappointed this hat was made in China. Next time around I will find one made in the USA.
B002ZOYPMS|4|Solid, works like it advertises... should be found in every house in America where the pioneer spirit is alive.<br />Remember your 2nd Amendment Rights!
B0012QM8IS|4|This bra is SUPER comfortable, but is not going to offer lots of support.  And, the color is not the pretty pink in the picture, but more of a grayish brown.  But, it is super comfy and stretchy and I am ordering another one.
B00B28DEYI|5|This is a beautiful shirt, the eyes just pop out you.  I am very satisfied and my husband just loved it, it has already been washed several times
B00HHOXT0A|4|Cute on screen I am glad I ordered the xxlarge because it does run small
B0083QLQO2|5|As expected. Good size
B009FL21YI|4|The product was brand new, and just as specified. However, during this time period (I was buying several items for a trip I was planning) my card number was stolen and used for purchases I did not make. I am not saying this is the seller that committed this fraud, I'm just putting a warning out there.
B0051U182S|5|Carhartt Men's Artic Wool Heavy Boot Socks are a very good value. I've paid more for wool socks and I have gotten less. They are both warm and durable.
B007AD3G7O|5|good
B00BKRMUPA|5|This dress fit perfectly.  The sizing chart is very accurate when using this seller. It looks just as lovely as seen online.
B000Q7AKDO|5|We used this for a graduation event we made for a special child. It was clean, good quality, and we were able to add stencil art to it that was lovely! Glad I ordered it.
B00VAPGJ5Y|5|Good price for a set of 3 colors to fit many color palettes, also works with larger ties. Simple and classy.
B00KU8LUSI|4|Slim Fit
B00D27M100|4|I bough t this hat to go on my cruise  love it love it love it stylish I don't cruise to the end of August but I am expecting it to cover me Just as needed
B005HPQ5I4|5|This is a beautiful little outfit for baby. I purchased this for my new grand daughter and it was even prettier when I got it than it is in the pictures. Very detailed and soft.
B004S2OZHU|1|Not a good shoe for the medical professional with sensitive back and legs. The shoes are very hard, they squeak, and are not comfortable. They've left me in pain after a long shift and I am sending them back. Not reccomended.
B007JFO564|3|This dress is just okay. For the price it isn't bad, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best maternity dress like other reviews. I am 31 weeks, 5'5&#34; and 131 pounds and it fits fine, it's just really not that cute. The material is average and although I will wear it, it's definitely not dressy enough for a baby shower (in my opinion at least). The spaghetti straps look kinda cheaply made, I wish they would've had the right size for me in the halter top style, maybe I would've liked it more.
B00K2IR5Q2|5|Just got mines today and love them!! I am 5'7 and 160 pounds. Fits me perfect!! My husband loves them!
B00NUG8SH8|2|Its disappointing that I have to pay to return a jacket that is not true to size.
B00243FURE|5|This reversible belt was the correct size--I have about a 34-35 inch waist, and I ordered a 36 inch belt. It looks just fine for an casual but slightly dressy belt. So far so good.<br /><br />I just hope it holds up better than the Dockers belt and the Claiborne &#34;Concepts&#34; belt I had previously been wearing. The outer layer of the leather on the side I wore the most (brown) started peeling off of those belts (in the area near the holes) much sooner than had been my experience with belts in past years. That just shows that you can't always trust &#34;name&#34; brands for quality.
B001F5XCPY|5|After only a few early experiences of the \\"wandering hands\\" phenomenom of pregnancy, I decided to give people the hint from a safe distance. Found this shirt and thought it was too perfect, being this time of year and I love pumpkins anyway.<br /><br />I've only worn it twice so far, but it definitely gets attention - luckily not physical, but lots of compliments - especially from other pregnant women/moms!<br /><br />I love the wide cut of the neck and fit of it. Would definitely recommend :)
B00ULF0Y32|5|My daughter loves it.  It's a little big but plenty of room for her to grow into.
B00YI7H6L2|2|They fit perfectly and were really comfortable yet the pattern did not line up right. Not like in the picture where you think it will be mostly black on the left n right side of each leg and white mostly in the front and back of each leg. I was very disappointed, I can not wear those in public but they are so comfy I will keep them for laying around the house.
B003CT20WM|5|Item was exactly as described, excellent quality, after wearing it for over a month is in excellent shape. Would recommend it to friends.
B00D83TNRM|1|This top is so cheap looking I am scared it would go up in flames if an ash hits it!  Bad to the bone. Returned.
B0031ZTYWQ|4|This is definitely a good shirt, made of quality material. I bought the blue stripe, and I love the color. I was looking for iron free. This could probably be worn right from the dryer if you're banging around the house, but if it's off to the office, it will need to be touched up. I am right between medium and large, bought a medium. It fits nicely except the sleeves are about a half inch too short. Still, given the cut and the quality of the material, I would consider buying another.
B008QWK9BO|5|Fit perfectly. We hadn't purchased slacks from Amazon before but given this experience, we'll be doing a lot more of it in the future.
B00DP8E70S|5|Super cute skirt.  Nice quality and fits great.
B00F38XWXQ|5|I love this shirt! I can't wait to wear it when I go to the beach.<br />The shipping was fast considering it was international. It only took 10 days to get here. For me, at least.<br />At first I was confused about the size. 4-6 seemed like it would be big, that was my biggest concern. When I tried it on it fit perfectly, and I usually wear a small sized shirt. Plus there's extra room so it's not too snug. I wear a 34A bra, unfortunately, and I could totally wear a push up bra with this!<br />I totally would recommend this!
B0018OHOLA|5|Shrink to fit are kind of confusing.  I usually wear a 34x34 so I bought a 35x38 and I think it was a great fit.
B006ACC5CI|4|I'm going to embroider on these-I bought 3 pairs for gifts and the quality is good, they're just a little big
B00VUJ5T2O|4|This is a really cute top ; it wrinkles easily though coming directly out of dryer. Will probably hang to dry. Also I had to take up the arm shoulder straps just a bit and I'm a average size . I still really like this top though.
B004M6XUI2|4|I only have positive thoughts to say about the layout of this wallet. I've accidentally left these in my pants pockets during washing about 3 times and it's kinda messed up inside but that's my fault. One of the pockets on the right side came apart. Other than that it's doing well as far as durability.
B00ORQCTPC|5|Is beatiful!!
B006EVQGNO|4|My 5-month old son has moderate/severe eczema and likes to scratch/rub his face and head until he bleeds. Baby mittens never stay on so we had been using socks. Unfortunately, socks are rough enough that they will break his skin if he rubs hard and long enough. Finally, I decided to give these Guava Mitts a try. They stay on and are soft enough that they don't normally scratch his skin! I do wish that they fare better in the washer/dryer. The graphics are cute and I wish they sold Medium/Large sizes in more designs. With that said, the material of the graphic design is rougher than the material of the mitten. My son is capable of rubbing palm-side and backhand-side. I wish they sold a pair of mitten made of just the soft cotton. Overall, I would say Guava Mitts are a nice find.
B00M3ITXS2|1|Very poorly made. To return you have to pay for shipping .. my product had runs ..
B00Y6XQI1C|1|Very cheap fabric with a couple of small holes in it - glad I didn't pay much for it.
B00DP8BJE0|5|very nice suit well pleased
B00RKIYC9K|5|Nice quality, good size, and exactly what I was hoping for.
B00B2I97FI|3|OK jeans, not my favorite, but OK.
B00BGIQPSG|5|My great-grandson is Autistic and this was perfect for him and his sometimes roughness. It protects and easy for him to handle it.. Thank you.
B00551OP5A|4|Good support without underwire.  Worth the reasonable price.
B00IV3DGD6|2|Super thick material that is kind of uncomfortable to wear even after being washed. also is cut weird through the shoulders so I am constantly having adjust it through out the day. Not the happiest with this purchase
B004J18ANA|3|A bit small but overall still pretty good.
B0057L9L0C|5|A-Ok!
B003XU6FAI|4|But beautiful hat!!!
B00BLMLQT0|4|The material is beautiful....well made too. Dress fits well on the top from shoulders to waist but I find it at least 3 inches too long. I am 5 foot 3 inch and it hungs well over my knees. I may need to have it tailored but the zip behind will make this a challenge.
B0009NERIO|5|A good choice for comfort.  It has good padding on the bottom and the top which really helps with overall comfort.  Will definitely reorder when I need more socks.
B007BLNKY4|4|This polo is really a good bargain. Good looking, good feeling, and good price! I feel more confident about purchasing clothes online.
B0083QNR9O|3|I purchased this in the size 7 knowing it was for a 38D and I needed a 36DD. The cup size was a little small, as expected, but it worked. I also liked the idea of the clear halter strap and clear back strap. The adhesive was necessary to keep things in place as well. The halter strap broke during the wedding dance yet the adhesive and back strap keep things in place. I wish the strap hooks were a little more sturdy and less flimsy ...but all in all... this bra kept me in place in my dress.
B00ORGN5XW|1|The material is paper thin! If I ever wanted to wear it I would have to get a slip of layer it with another dress. Even if I wore a slip you could see every single detail. Maybe I'll wear it as a swimsuit cover because it's honestly not good for anything else.
B00L57OMY2|5|So cute. The girls love how soft they are.
B00LNRHNOU|2|This jumpsuit fits okay I guess. Its not as tight as I wanted it to be. So i'll have to adjust it. The material is a bit flimsy to me. It feels cheap. Looks like that of a leotard. And the straps at the back is neon yellow. I expected mustard. I ordered this as my birthday outfit. The only way ill rock this is if I put a blazer over. I'm a bit disappointed.
B00CHQ4H8G|4|it was a gift . . . she liked it !
B00GZS2SGK|3|warm but not really stylish.
B00KX2PNOS|2|The skirt of the dress is way too short. The material is thin and flimsy and sticks to everything with static.
B001FY1R8O|4|I really wasn't sure what to expect with these, but my daughter had been asking me for a pair for the longest time. They fit her very nicely, and she really loves them. She is 11 years old.
B00AQK0AAE|5|I wear a size 8 and I got a med, and it was perfect. I wear a lot of Lori logo pieces and it layers well with her clothes. It is also good to sleep in. I ordered two but going back for more. I did not like paying the shipping charges, I feel if u order more than one, they should have a one time shipping not shipping for each one, but I have not been able to find these out in retail. Oh also I am 5'5, if u are 5'2 or less I would not purchase unless u want to wear this as a dress, lol. Hope this helps.
B00CBESBLS|1|Although the styling was nice, the advertised size for US was way off.  I ordered this in a XL and it fit like a XS!
B004B1EMXK|3|It's OK though so I'll keep it. Was disappointed that the add wasn't accurate. But it's a basic black AC/DC shirt so it'll do.
B008JRIMUQ|5|The winter wasn't too bad this year so I didn't get to wear them as often as I would have liked. They are soft and stylish. Love the detailing. They fit like a glove...sorry, couldn't help myself.
B00AWB3JLE|2|Fit unusual. Would not have felt comfortable
B00ACIGNMY|4|I wasn't sure how different &#34;Full-Cut&#34; would be from the Hanes briefs I have bought in the past, but it's not a radical change. Just a bit more material making the waist band sit higher. I think it's a modest improvement in comfort and will probably help compensate for the inevitable shrinkage. The grays and black are a nice alternative to some of the glaring colors in other packages, although I wish they'd offer single color packages. Overall quality seems as good as in the past, and shrinkage after a few washings and dryings wasn't significant - the large remained a pretty accurate large (unlike the newer and disappointing Hanes t-shirts).
B00KD6XPY4|5|very good
B00A17K4K8|4|they fit well when I first receive them after washing they were a little bit small. will buy the next size larger next time
B005CCXPVM|4|My mother loved it and I am very glad, it fits a little oddly on her head,though, this is more cosutemy and should not be bought for people who do not like sequins.
B00M9G9SIS|5|Very Happy with the quality of the tie! Thank you
B00440CYD8|4|Seems to be very well made, but it lacks a carrying strap. If you carry this item, it has to be the only item in your hand. You can't carry it like a grocery bag, where the handle is in your hand and the bag dangles below, allowing you to carry more bags in the same hand.
B00CM9SG4E|5|I am not sure how to review a tshirt. But my daughter loves this shirt. The shirt is a heavy duty shirt that has not shrunk with any of the washings so far.
B00HQQUQGY|5|bought this jacket for my daughter for christmas and she love it!!!
B00BXEFC32|1|Florsheim is a name that has been around for years and was synonymous with affordable quality.  That has apparently changed.  Leather?  Perhaps some parts are leather, but the brown color was a coating and this belt literally started peeling within a few minutes of being worn.  The brown coating peeled/lifted and you could see the black undercoating.  Other reviewers mentioned concern for the sizing.  Ours was accurate - true to size.
B004T3KZCC|4|The boyfriend switched the chain out for a different one he had, but was very happy about the wallet.  It's sturdy and looks good.
B005WL4ZLM|4|I'm happy with these socks.  They are a bit tall for me, but are warm and comfy.  They suggest hand washing them, but they are going through the washer and dryer just fine for me. I would recommend them.
B00574M9AS|4|Like these for work socks with steeled toed boots, cushion on them is good. Hard to find in stores. I recommend!
B000X9XAE6|5|Obviously, you can't cram as much into a front wallet as a normal billfold, but this one makes great use of space.  It looks good, and the magnetic clip combines just the right balance between firmness and access.  I'm very happy with mine!
B000LUU5MM|4|These shorts are much better than others than I've tried. They're still not as durable as I'd like. They have a much more flattering look and are a better quality short than the Soffe Mesh. I'd definitely go with these again.
B00CQ8ZEPU|3|The product itself fit great and actually looked as it was suppose to, like thigh highs.. HOWEVER I have to return them because when I received this item and took it out of the package they had a light colored ring around each of the upper thighs, almost like they were sun-bleached where it had been folded. Very disappointed. :( Hoping I can get a new pair without any defects!
B007U3G1FI|4|I gave it four stars bc Im a size 9 and these were a little tight in the toes, overall worked perfect for my costume!
B002A4Z7LG|4|Just what i needed.  This really refreshed my glasses.  The brown is pretty dark and looks almost grey from a distance.
B00CXQ8KME|5|Loved the swim suit. It was in perfect condition. It looks and fits exactly the way they said it would.
B00FVTJXGC|3|It shrunk so much I felt choked when wearing it but on a positive note it was very warm and that I liked. Better order a larger size.
B00NHYOG2Y|4|Beautiful dress but size it too small.
B007ZZMZZ6|5|This is a wonderful product. It looks adorable, it fits perfectly and still gives her room to grow. It's comfortable and she said it doesn't feel itchy, which has been her complaint about all other swimsuits.
B001LK7DY4|3|The outfit pieces are very cute but runs very small. My daughter is 1 month, 19 inches and 7 3/4 pounds and the outfit pieces, especially the shirts, are barely fitting her. The label indicates 0-6 months. I do not foresee her wearing it at 3 months. Again cute but runs small.
B00IYFC4KC|4|Great socks
B00BZWX85G|5|This belt is the tits!
B00CP91CTC|5|Love it! Reppin Ford Racing from birth till death!
B003G42EHE|5|Lightweight, comfortable ,stylish and it breathes. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it .I would recommend it to anyone who lives in a hot climate.
B00L3XVTEY|2|When this shirt arrived, it was about a size 10.
B002KEXWU4|2|My wife is 5'11&#34; and these barely came up above her knee. We weren't terribly impressed so we tossed them.
B00642LYGC|5|They are so warm, cozy and comfortable and the bottom is nonslip with the word \\"Snoozies\\" written in rubber for extra stability.
B0052IRMGU|5|This was a great buy! They fit really well-- no imperfections at all! I want to buy another pair soon.
B00EQN9PS0|4|Overall, I like it a lot.<br /><br />SIZE & FIT. At 6 months and 74 centimeters, my baby typically wears 12-month clothes. I bought this romper size 80, and it's still too big for him now, but bigger is better, since it will last longer. It's more of a Carter-style slim fit than a Gymboree-style short-and-square fit, and should be great for a proportional baby, if you get the right size.<br /><br />LOOK. It *doesn't* look cheap. Sure, it still looks like a romper, not a suit, but it's a high-quality romper. The material is not too light and not too heavy, with a bit of glossy finish that makes black look proper deep black. I've only put it through a couple of washes so far, but it still looks brand-new. The print is well-made, and I was surprised how nicely all three colors came out in our holiday photos.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE. My only warning is about washing. I was glad I washed it separately both times, as the water ran black. Since it's not an everyday item, I don't mind a quick hand wash, but I won't put it together even with darker clothes, just in case.<br /><br />Maintenance aside, it'll make your baby boy both elegant and comfortable. I wouldn't subject my little one to a three-piece suit, no matter what the occasion is. This one will do great for an upcoming family wedding.
B00L406PJK|1|TOO SMALL!!
B000LXK4LG|5|Levi's 511 Slim Fit Black Stretch are my favorite jeans.  I own 7 pairs, wear them every day, and wash them after every wearing.  I wash my clothes on the delicate cycle and dry on medium heat.  My oldest pair of these jeans is a year and a half old.  They have faded from black to dark gray.  The fabric has lost a some of its stretch and is a bit tighter than before, but still comfortable.
B00JQPH0AS|5|These shorts are the best thing I purchased in 2014. The sweatpants material makes for a super comfortable around the house pair of shorts. The flag pattern also makes these a great talking piece at parties or BBQ's. The color will fade a little after washes, but it really adds to the character.
B00F0RBGF6|5|Precious outfit for my great grandson to have picture made for Christmas Cards announcing his birth and celebrating the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.
B00KAW3QC2|4|Fit just as expected. It's cold here right now but I'm sure I'll wear them all the time outside in the warmer weather.
B00CS7DVHW|5|Great sox to wear with my flipflops.  Nice quality and fit.  I've been wearing and washing them for a couple of weeks and they still look and feel nice.<br />I wear a women's size 6 shoe.
B00B44B86Q|5|I had seen someone wearing this so I went online and found it, and it fits like it should. True to size.
B00BWW07QM|5|Yery nice quality.
B004ISKHI0|4|Just what my husband wanted for summer. wrinkles a lot when washed, so I had to give it a quick swipe with an iron
B00025O4R8|4|The product came quickly and was as shown.  My sister loved it.  How ever the shipping was way to high.  It should have been shipped over night for what I paid.
B00BH2C68Y|5|Just got both of my belts to day I recommend buying the one that's 29$ nd 40$ be cuz ther are wat u c on the pic the buckle is hella nice nd the belt is real leather u can smell it nd fill how soft it is very satisfied
B008BF6MYO|3|They are ok, but no pockets! Like them otherwise!
B00GO4SEN6|5|The expectant mother and all guests loved it.
B00P371CPC|5|The color purple is not as seen here. It is more on the red side of purple and not the blue side. The sizes are asian and run much smaller than an American size chart. They list this so my missing it is my fault entirely.<br /><br />All that said, the company sent me a replacement as soon as I contacted them. The new one fits perfectly and they were kind enough to change the color to the red/black version for me. The whole experience was actually very good, and I love my new coat to wear to Ren. Fair.
B000VK3Z9W|1|Terrible fit! Returned it!
B002ETVM0M|5|Good poncho. Have not weathered a storm yet, but the feel of it is good will update when I weather 2 or 3 days outside at work. Walk on catwalks on rail cars or in intermodal yard so anyone with that experience or like it stay tuned or check back.
B00LITBWN6|2|Was really cool because my boyfriend loved the gift, however my necklace broke within a week. His is still in perfect condition.
B000VZPUUO|4|Shirt fits as advertised. Would have given it 5 stars, but when opening the package it had black residue on the collar. hope it comes out!
B004R9PFKK|2|I know some others love this dress and great for the price I guess, but it's way too small in the bust and I'm a 32A! The bottom was way too much fabric. I didn't return due to the price, but now I have a useless dress.
B003IC91N4|5|Loved it! I am small and the small size fit well. It was cute and the skirt was not too short (I am average height). The quality of the material was great for the price!
B0090BAAGO|5|These briefs fit great. They have nice support, they are soft and comfortable. They also look great under jeans! ;)
B000UVMYE4|5|Great costume.
B00LCDYVL8|5|Just the right size and the color is perfect.
B00KIKVBGY|1|Our baby just turned 12 months and it doesn't even fit her. Keep away from this item or buy it at least for 24 months if your baby is 6 months old.... a rip off.
B009T04RUG|5|Great quality.
B00PBLE8R4|5|Love this beanie. It's my favorite one. Fits slightly loose how I like it
B00LCICNOK|5|Beautiful colors and a nice comfy fit.
B000OTWWG2|4|This bra fit is perfect just as I expected. I have no complaint I am about to place a order for two more in different colors
B003NA8ST4|4|He loves the show and this shirt is his go to shirt for when he is home and want s to be comfy.  I ordered up a size to allow for shrinking and he will get plenty of wear from this.
B000Y8G1CE|3|I've worn this size and style before & I must have lost inches and they are now big.  They are durable and work for me.
B00AHOQFOO|5|Good choice!
B00HO5A90K|5|Super comfy, light, and soft!
B00BYOEIUY|5|Fits perfect and my boyfriend loves it! He's gotten a ton of compliments on it. Package arrived on time and was packaged nicely.
B00PRJ3OKC|5|Gorgeous dress ,very well made the lace and the details exactly like the picture ,delivered in 4 days chosing expedited shipping
B00NLQ8HI2|2|too large
B007NZTV28|2|my 2nd pair of NYDJ jeans. bought them to bring an extra pair for my stay in Europe. I get tired of my old jeans because they seem indestructible, they last forever.<br />I was horrified when i realized at the Kukenhof gardens that there were white long threads in the back of my left leg. i spent the whole day mortified that i probably looked like a disheveled American tourist.<br />The fabric didn't even stand a month of normal wear!
B00A0R0J72|1|do not order this suit if you are anything over a B cup. suit is very cute but the top is so small in the bust, makes you look like you  have no boobs
B001CVHV3U|2|I had high hopes for this but I had to send it back. It did not fit properly, especially the halter top. It has wiring in it that juts out. Pair that with the skirt and the look is terrible. The stone brooch fell apart. The idea is fantastic, though. Maybe go a size up. I'm a size 2-4 and the small was too tight.
B00EECW5GM|5|After 5 years, my old wallet finally gave way.  This was a gift to myself and I only wanted an English or American made product.  The wallet has plenty of sleeves for medical/bank/ID cards and the removable driving license/ID section is a good idea, though I suspect that anyone wanting to see your ID will actually want it taken out as the leather border covers quite a bit of the license/ID information.<br />Nice quality leather and well made.  Notes stay nice and flat so that your bills look decent when you come to art with them.  Good product for a good price.
B00EPJKSDG|3|Good product.
B000SP6UVK|4|Nice product
B00GNI9NFG|5|XOXOOXO HUFFFFF
B00H56Z0XE|4|keeps the ears warm
B00O4R78L4|5|I LOVE this sweater!  After wearing one time I wanted to get it in black too, but the seller is no longer carrying it. Bummer, but I did manage to get another one in gray. I do hope to get it in black as well if the seller offers it. Fabric is very soft; the ink color is very pretty. I think it fits true to size, the large is loose fitting & not tight, which is what I wanted.
B001OXN1SK|5|Just as described and wow they are warm!!!!!
B00MJABBNO|4|She loved it.
B00EDTN41Q|4|Great pants! I love these and this brand. I find that they are cheap, fit well and last for a long time.
B008TVCS02|5|I was worried that these were going to run small.  They are very roomy and comfy!  They are my favorite winter pajamas!
B00JLDXJ4Q|4|AMAZON QUIT MAKING US ENTER COMMENTS!!  **** THEY DID A GREAT JOB ***** , I DO NOT NEED TO COMMENT ON EVERY TANSACTION THOSE OF YOU THAT FEEL THE SAME START POSTING IT!!!!
B00ALNYZO8|5|This top is very very cute, even better than the picture. It has a great cut and fit,  What could be a downside for some is that it is  pretty sheer. Depending on your  style, you might need a cami. I wear it without but, again, it is sheer.  Also the sizing was a little off for me. The small was just a little small and the medium just a bit big.  I would say if you are a larger type small, go medium, and the same for large mediums maybe go large.  Not sure which I liked best, so I got one of both sizes.  Both are wearable.<br />Over all, this is a really cute, unique and attractive top.
B00J48WVMY|5|The costume is everything I thought it would be,  can't wait to wear it..  :)
B007M66ZO0|4|great fit nice top
B00EE9W0NS|5|Very flattering suit! I'm 5'7 and weigh 155 lbs.; size 14 fit very well. I usually prefer to order long-torso suits but this worked out really well for me
B007RMMZEI|5|Its a long beautiful kurti. I liked the red patches. I am happy with my purchase. With a red chudidaar, this looks perfect.
B00I04SXRU|5|Light and thin. Perfect under shirt for the summer
B00OHC0OEY|4|It's cute
B00F9ZZ9J8|5|I was searching for a blouse that looks like it was a two piece, when it actually was a one piece. I found this blouse and decided to try it out. I love it !! Fit was true to size and it is very classy.
B00PAPYB0A|4|One year Birthday gift.
B00DF0TA1W|5|Love these pajamas so soft and cozy bought two pair. Plan to buy more in the future, my little man looks so adorable in them. Would recommend.
B00E0L2CUQ|5|Love the color and the style. It fit my brother perfectly. could not choose a better pants. He loves it
B0046RTOO6|2|The wig did not really look like the picture - can't imagine how you could get it to look that nice. It was OK, but I didn't even end up wearing it.
B00KGXGI70|1|Not for any type water activity, when it got wet...it looked like I was wearing a diaper.
B00BGJ5TW8|2|My first negative review--I searched for this hat under women's fedora. The size was small/medium so I gave it a try. I figured I could add a strip to the inside and take it down to a size small to fit my smaller-than-average head. Wasn't I surprised when it was huge! My husband, who wears a men's medium, tried it on and it was too large for him too! When I shop online I need sufficient information and true sizing. A large men's hat should never be presented as a woman's small/medium! I'm very disappointed, to say the least. It's not worth the time to ship it back for a refund--so Salvation Army here we come!
B005GYGEWS|5|Good Job
B00H9F9K2S|5|Love this purchase.  Great seller.  Quick shipment.  Item was perfect.
B002RNJAYU|4|Excellent.  Hard to blow by mouth (made to be blown with a helium cylinder...pressure), very difficult because of the static between the layers.  It'll take you time but then it is great.  The opening is a little indentation in one of the corners, on one side. So you have to look at each corner one by one and flip it each time to find the little, round cut part, shaped like a nail.
B00J1C877Q|4|I really liked the product I received. It fit great (I ordered a size 12, I weigh 140 lb. height 5'3 and a 32 G bra size) and looked very nice. The fabric is somewhat thin, but not see through; even against a black bra or pink undies! I wouldn't buy this outfit if you're looking to hide tummy fat. I don't feel that it makes me look pudgy in anyway, but because of the thinner material I think it may show off excess weight. Overall this is a really great buy and I would do it over again if given the chance. Just make sure you order up on the size!
B00A144XVM|1|Wrong description on mesurament !!
B000J3AWUQ|5|my wife loves them and and is very happy with them and everyone of the panties in the package are a perfect fit and the shipping was so super fast shipping and i love the design and patterns on the panties and i highly recommend these to all my wife.s lady friends and anyone who needs and wants the perfect set of lady.s panties thank you so much-god bless.....
B00QU06F4Y|1|#BlackLivesMatter
B00NPG5VZU|5|My wife loved them.
B00RJKT820|4|Nice swim shorts for the price.
B0007UMA3S|1|received the wallet in two days as promised. Was pleased with the appearance but went downhill fast....zipper was stiff and hard to operate....interior lining started to rip after I placed only 4 credits cards in the too tight slots....returned it the next day....return process was fast and professional...am still a satisfied Amazon customer!!!
B0081STN4M|3|Fits small even if you get a size up especially in the junk. The mesh is more spaced out than shown but it still looks good. My bf is thin so the medium worked on him but if he was about 10 lbs heavier his thighs would be uncomfortable due to the thigh holes being small. Nothing left to the imagination but in a good way??? I suggest buying larger for sure though.
B00348OQZ0|5|Excellent quality and fits like glove
B00N9OPF3Q|5|Awesome little wallet. I hate big bulky wallets that don't fit in your pocket. I always carry my wallet in my front pocket with my phone. This fits perfect and still hold all my necessities. It has 7 pockets. 2 for visible cards and one for hidden pocket on each side. Then it has a Center pocket I use for cash.
B00E9403PA|5|Shirt looks great.  Good quality product.  The size of the shirt was as outlined in the fitting guide.  Highly recommended.
B00EDIMX6Y|5|Last year I forgot to take a hat to our trip to CO since it wasn't too cold yet. I forgot that we were going to Pikes Peak. Tried finding one like this in stores and had no luck. As soon as I saw this one I bought it. This would have been perfect. The lining is extra soft and warm. This is the hat to get if you need to stay warm outside for awhile.
B003IBPR4C|4|It was fitting ok, but my baby is 8 month old and I have ordered the 12-18 month size...<br />quality of the product is fairly good
B002J8RRWK|5|Great quality. Lovely details. A little heavy.
B00JXZ5GV6|2|Made of a thin, stretchy fabric that pulls unattractively, even though the blazer itself fits alright (I planned for it to run slightly small).
B003YJA03G|5|I am a lover of socks! I stand for 10 hours each day filling prescriptions. I really love the fit and feel of these socks.
B00CEF6UNA|5|Quality product.
B00H4PIZAQ|4|No tag to bother with, so i don't have to cut the tag off as the tag drive me nuts. Comfortable and well made
B00JB94HZK|5|very nice
B00O9R2EUE|4|It was great but I took long to ship.
B008BFJ6RE|5|Love, love, love these gloves. They are so much nicer than expected!  The colors are vibrant and the glove is lined for extra warmth. The price was great!
B0059DWKMO|5|I took this jacket in a trip through Asia.<br />I used it only in a couple of rainy days, and it worked perfectly, keeping me dry and comfortable.<br />Light weight, packable....what elese can I say?<br />I do recommend this product.
B00GTL7I5E|5|Bought this tie for my boyfriend. I really like it great quality!
B0041XOMKQ|1|I got this hat thinking it was embroidered and when it arrived only the mountains on the back were the front was like a felt material that was stitched on and it lookes tackier than the picture. I was not happy with the product received.
B00W03VGTO|5|Even cuter in person!
B00C9XQ1HM|5|bellisimo
B004VUBOO6|5|Shorts are well made and cool and comfortable for the summer. Good deal.
B009CEXT6M|1|I purchased these in two colors the above white and the khaki. The khaki have been worn and washed with no issue, I wore the white once and washed them and almost all of the dark tribal design washed off or faded away. Either way, I am very disappointed! these are not cheap boxer breifs and I expected them to make it through more than one wash!!!
B00BTMZKKI|5|We were having trouble just renting a vest and tie for my son.  Amazon provided the perfect alternative.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the color shown online was a very good representation of what it actually turned out to be.  Price was excellent and was actually cheaper than renting.
B000FK666C|5|A+ seller. My Granddaughter loved it.
B005C91HF6|5|Well made.  It is a slim fit so I bought one size up for my husband.  He really liked the fit and design- he loves RATM.
B0058ZQSQ2|5|It was exactly like I expected. Arrived on time and without problem. Right color and size. Fair price. I really glad
B000SKI752|3|They feel thinner and made with less quality materials than in the past. They'll do, but I'm looking for another brand/style of sock.
B00F0G2M1E|5|Product fit great, and arrived on time, just one day late, but it was also christmas time so that was fine.<br />I love the fit, and the quality.
B002ZG6X0I|5|Came across this bra by pure accident and this is the most comfortable I have found on the market.  I will be getting more!
B00144JSM2|5|Great for bridesmaids dresses. I wore it for my friend's wedding and it looked great!! Got lots of attention from the guys ;)
B0053XF8W4|3|Used once not very comfortable, keep rolling down, really didn't hold anything in, very bothersome when need to go to bathroom, since no hooks or closure where should be
B000SKLT5M|3|I have size 8 mens feet which make these come an inch over my ankles, which in turn defeats the purpose of them being 'no show'.<br /><br />I'll still use them, as they are nice socks.  But at the same time as this is the smallest size offered for men without going into women's sizes.
B005L3KIOY|1|Gloved arrived damaged, with a hole about the size of a dime on the back side of the thumb. Too bad because the gloves were comfortable otherwise, though on the large side. I have normal sized hands with maybe longish fingers, but the gloves were large over my palm and the fingers were almost too long to poke my fingertips out of. The velcro was poorly sewn on with just a few loose whip stitches holding it on the sides. Many of the yarn endings look unsecured as well, though I didn't pull at them to see how easily they'd unravel. VERY disappointed!
B001I8KW6A|5|I love this shirt and it is very comfortable to wear. The pockets are on the side but are deep and nothing falls out. I will buy from this company again.
B003TSDYNK|3|The color looks a lot more lovely in the photo than it does in reality - it's really a pepto-bismol pink.  That said, it's fairly well constructed, but lighter-weight than you might imagine from the photo & description.  The furry trim is of a higher quality than I expected, but the fabric is very lightweight rip-stop nylon with medium-weight fleece on the inside.  If it had cost more than $30, I would have been very disappointed, particularly by the color.
B000BU65MG|1|poor quality - sizing was on small side. x x x x x x x x x x x z
B005QBFJHC|4|The product is exactly as it looked on the site; however, they run extremely large.  I know they are supposed to fit loosely, however i purchased the small size for my daughter and it is definitely way too big.  She likes it nonetheless.
B00362MKPC|1|I ordered this wig for a gay pride festival. I want specifically a rainbow wig, which this product appeared to be. However, the product that I received is mostly brown, and a bit of orange and hot pink in the mohawk part. Not purple, blue, orange, yellow, and red as pictured like a rainbow should be, especially in the gay world. The picture on the package is the same as the picture with the listing, but again, not rainbow. Too bad I'd placed the order before I seen the reviews, or I would not have purchased this product. I have posted pictures on here of what I received.
B00BLZGHU0|4|Thank you It's nice
B004W4ZP50|4|Decent quality for an outstanding price! I'm not going to wear this shirt to a wedding or anything like that, but it works great for at the office. I may just order a couple more in different colors.
B0085TFOCM|2|I was so disappointed to try this dress on.  I ordered it for a specific event (an evening party).  It is made of very nice fabric, but it was cut like a cheerleader's dress.  The flare starts very high up on the waist, is very pronounced and that gave it a very inelegant silhouette.  I have no idea how it looks as sleek as it does in the picture.  It does not look like that on, at least not on me.  Perhaps it would look good on soneone with a short (or shorter) waist.  Given the price for this dress, I was very disappointed in the cut.  Sending it back.
B0046M8Q2W|4|I love this robe however I didn't receive the belt with it. I wear it anyways without it. I plan on buying the belt through their website if possible. Great feel and quality
B00F4ODNL0|4|I was a little scared when I opened the package. This thing looks TINY. Thought there is NO WAY this thing is going to fit me! But it was great!! I'm no skinny mini (sz 18) and this accentuates my curves perfectly! Also wasn't aware that the back is completely netted. But wasn't disappointed with that in the least bit. I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the stocking portion. I have thick thighs and though the upper thigh portion of the stockings fits and is not necessarily cutting into my thigh you can tell that it doesn't hold right because of the thick thighs. Also.. I'm a shorty (5'2) so the garter attachment part sort of scrunches in between the bottom of the dress and the top of the stocking
B000UJWRKM|5|Great scrub pants for the price
B001EH4DWO|4|I'm 6'4 and the XL size fits fine.  Shrinks somewhat in the dryer but what do you expect, its cotton.  Wish there was a choice for 4-pack of 1 solid color, instead of the mix and match.
B00ELMLA5C|4|The pants fit fine and my son likes them. I thought the coloured strip at the bottom looked like it was sewn on as an afterthought
B00ANKN05O|1|I am petite, 5’2” and weigh 130 lbs.  I ordered a medium.  When zipped up the jacket was too snug around the hips.  The sleeves were way too long.  It was also too large through the shoulders.  If I would have ordered a large it would have fit through the hips but the sleeves and shoulders would have been even larger.  I've read comments about the belt fitting rather high on the waist.  I'm short and the belt seemed a little high on me so a person above 5'5&#34; would find this to be a problem unless they liked a belt not fitting around the waist.  This jacket was a terrible fit for my body type.
B007O0PAC2|5|Was comfortable and could move around easily with it on....<br />It was a little warm due to the foam backing but it keep its shape......<br />I actually cut the head wrap off and just pinned the little topper onto my hair.......still looked great.....
B001GAPAJ4|5|ok
B003MZ00Y6|5|Great support. Best bra I have owned
B004YKZ480|5|its nice and good quality, its has a reasonable price , and trust me i buy all they shirts till now , that why i rate them with 5 stars good product
B00OK90C1Y|4|I was nervous ordering this top but it's actually very nice. It's slightly elastic and not as cheap looking as I expected it to be for the price. Looks cute under a boyfriend jacket.
B000KTBFDM|4|Some of the feathers fall out easily but what do you want for the price.  Good value overall
B00847H0ZO|4|Very nice belt, compared to a lot of the garbage out their, the buckle could stand to be a bit heavier duty !
B008FND588|5|My daughter wore this dress to Disneyland and she received complements all day long!!  Very cute and great fit (she's 3T).
B002HJ3FAY|5|I usually don't find knee high socks to actually be knee high.  I have long legs and I'm pretty heavy, so they have a lot to cover.  What I usually do is buy thigh high and then use them as knee high.  But these are nice - they come all the way up to my knees, and they stay up there no matter how much I move around, without pinching or binding.  The fabric is very soft and silky.  I'm very pleased, and will look for them again when I need them.
B00OA3J98C|5|This is an excellent shirt.  Fabric and sewing quality are top-notch.  As the the other reviewer noted, the shirt has a trim cut through the chest and shoulders and a slight taper to open up a little bit at the waist. The shirt is cut a bit long on purpose and can be worn out for a more casual look or tucked in for a dressier look. I am very happy with this shirt and am buying 2 more.
B007WA0O66|3|From the product image, it looked like these were going to be a slim-fitting pair of athletic pants. It's actually a wider, looser fit than shown. Don't let &#34;jogging pants&#34; fool you into thinking these have elastic ankles. The material is comfortable but the type that will pick up every bit of hair around and show up terribly if you have light-colored pets. If you're looking for a cheap throwaway pair of pants, this isn't a bad buy, but if you're going for a modern, urban look, invest in some higher quality sweats.
B006SFRLSK|5|This shirt is super thick and warm.  The fit is beautifully snug which I like because I am thin but full chested and always feel like I look &#34;big&#34; in loose clothing.  Love Duofold!
B00CKTXNRG|5|I was nervous about ordering clothes online with our ever trying them on, but for the price I figured why not. The shirts are very affordable, extremely comfortable and I love that the length is long. They don't shrink and wash very nicely. Only wish they came in more colors. I will be ordering these again.
B00O2HWIL6|5|Loved finding a long sleeve workout top (not easy to find). The v-neck is complimentary, and the cut of the top actually gives you a figure...different than the block-cut style work out tops. Loved the hot pink color.
B000N5BK9C|5|I needed this vest set for a very special occasion.  Very nice, true to picture, great quality. Elegant looking vest.
B00HPUM178|2|Very cheap material, after washing it the material was all washed up and faded
B007P5H7DQ|2|After reading prior reviews I did size down and it fit, the problem is that the dress is very uncomfortable. The sequins are very very itchy and will scratch by the underarm area. It also has no zipper so I was scratched all over while putting on and taking off the dress... It is pretty and not as heavy as other sequined dresses, but definitely returning.
B004UR38SU|5|After seeing Crystal Castles live at Moogfest 2011, I had to have a shirt to profess my loyalty in following the band. Alice Glass, the lead screamer...er, singer...is prominently displayed on the front. She is very animated onstage and the image on the shirt captures her personna well. Shirt is comfortable and durable, so the band name and her will be around for quite a while.
B00J9A9R74|4|I got them and they are super cute! I am a little upset because there is already a small hole toward the top near the waistband. The material is funny because it is like mesh like material where it is made up of tiny holes.
B00WXPCWY2|2|I found it not as user friendly as a regular wallet or money clip paired with another card holder. Its modern look is nice but difficult at times to handle card and money because of how the band holds the entire thing in place.
B00IA38LMS|1|Took a long time to ship and fit like a smaller size.
B00LNG9SIK|5|Love them
B00J04PN3G|4|Saving for next year.
B00550R2I8|3|This is hard for me because it's the most comfortable bra I've ever owned. Material-wise it's very soft and it's also very supportive. It has the comfort of a sports bra but the padding and lift of a regular bra. My job is very physical so having a bra like this, where the wire isn't digging into my boobs all day, is super important. I also have a large bust so I need something that's going to keep the girls in place. This does the job. The only downside is that they run very small. I'm a 38DD and I would probably have to go up a size or two to be comfortable and get rid of the \\"four boob.\\" Will keep this one but will size up next time (and there will be a next time!)
B00PIQTFT8|5|Very comfy and fit well. They are well made, I bought two more pairs.
B005N7Z1J0|1|I personally do not care for this at all. Folding it over like it said didn't hide that my button was undone. Just thought it would be better by reading the reviews.
B00TKQBH20|5|I seriously love these pants. Plan on ordering more in different colors. They're a little bit &#34;thinner&#34; in material than my Lucy yoga capris but still stretchy and breathable.
B00BG11QNW|4|I loved it, it was a very well fitting shirt. Everyone kept asking me where I got it 2 buy one
B00G0POOFG|1|This dress is only a maxi dress if your 5 ft tall.......  So not happy with it, and since I only paid $11 it's not even worth the money to send it back.
B0080FNDWE|5|Bought this jacket for my sons who were going to Washington DC in February. My son said that he was always warm and only wore the interior jacket all the time, whether he was inside or outside.
B0034KUMIS|3|Hats could be a made smaller NfL hats come in different sizes , I am a adult but have somewhat of a small head , nfL hats come in small med and large , if your company could start makeing different sizes that would be great !! Thank you
B0017Z26D6|5|Perfect!
B00FCHSJPE|4|It is a great vest for the price. The vest is really made of good quality material. I am satisfied.
B006PGGJOE|5|I purchased two of these credit card holders to take to Italy for my mom and myself.  They were perfect for the trip and we still use them back in the States.  We love them.
B00DYCQA0A|4|These are great jeans.  They fit great and are just as nice as some of the upscale jeans (like Joe's) but for 1/4 of the price.<br />My issue was that I tried a pair on in a store in size 8 and liked them, but they were a tad too tight, so I ordered them from Amazon one size up, but when they arrived, I realized that the size 10 fit the same as the size 8 I had tried on!  Too snug, so I had to return them.  Quality was great though.
B00MNS2ZUU|5|Soooooo comfortable
B007LCV06S|4|It was a gift for hubby and he enjoys is a lot. He wishes it were a little thicker, but it keeps him warm enough.
B00F3WDR8C|5|Comfy. Love  that it is the kind of material lint doesnt stick too.
B000G77J7E|5|My husband loves these shirts.
B005RFFFO4|5|The little one was very pleased with her earmuff on Christmas morning! She has not taken them off yet. Happy Holidays!
B00245OVAE|1|I got the chain and it is not 18 inches but only twelve. It cost more to have it shipped than the product itself. They expected me to ship it back and buy a new one when the 24 inch actually offers free shipping and was the same price as the 18&#34; chain plus shipping for this one. I consider this to be very lame because it is advertised as an 18 inch chain with 3 inch strap and says free shipping underneath all of that. I really expected better customer service and them to make it right.  instead the return shipping was on me for there misleading mistake and why should I have to pay another 4.95 shipping for a $3.95 item. Ridiculous. Never going to buy from them again.
B001IHZD3S|3|It was very cute (the pattern), but fit a bit snug...not tight, more like it had been cut skimpy.  There was no flare at the bottom, very straight.  Not what I expected.  I gave it to a friend.
B00A83VUAI|5|great Bowtie. has a vintage feel for it. we used it for a 20s themed wedding and it looked great!
B000JCT2XA|5|I have had this hemet about 1 year now. I bought it while living in Germany.  I just laid my motorcycle down and this helmet worked perfect. It absorbed the impact and my head has never been better, wish my ribs were the same.  I am going to buy another Multitec once I get my bike back up and running.  My head is worth the cost!!
B00C3WSPNW|4|I am extremely petite and skinny and thought the Small would do ok considering I usually fit XXS or XS. It came, and it did fit, although it was really really tight. I bought these so I can wear in the office because I get cold - however, I found it a little difficult to type on the keyboard with. The sleeves are not that stretchy or forgiving so the holes for the fingers and thumb can be a little restrictive.
B002C468KS|2|I ordered a Medium and they fit like an X-Large. I tried drying them and they do not Shrink.
B008DYZZEQ|5|This coat in the sapphire(navy) is classy dressed up and casual.  Fitted, flattering and a great everyday coat.  Wear with t-shirt in the Fall and turtleneck in the winter.  Thanks for this Deal of the Day!
B000JHCZMU|5|Heavy denim unlike most jeans.
B00N565A0Q|5|Great dress!  Love it.
B00BX90OQW|5|Such a cool t shirt and it fits perfectly
B00OB0FRJ4|5|as good as expected
B00BPI91Q0|3|Shirt is wonderful but they make them entirely too small, order a size or two up.
B011LV1W6C|5|Great Wallet But how do I buy replacement insert ? Please advise. Tks
B00CHNND4I|2|If your head size is 7 1/4 inches or bigger and you want this hat too fit over your ears it won't. I had it stretched over a basketball for over 3 weeks and and that didn't help.  Other than that it is Carhartt quality and it looks good.
B008CGQQWA|5|Perfect
B00D3RC7ZS|5|Very cute, but they do run small and may not fit chubby babies well. Size 12-18 fits my 30&#34;/20lb son well. They may not be as soft as the striped designs but they are by no means scratchy.
B00M4M6YAM|5|It is slightly too big but I love it, and its beautiful!!! I will get the all purple one next!!!
B00O2BRKI8|5|Love it
B007G4VR82|4|This was a very nice wallet. Good quality leather and nice stitching. I ended up going with something with a few more card slots, but this one was very nice.
B00BTPQDZG|5|This outfit fit really well. I'm about 5'6&#34; and 155lbs. Seems to be well made. I have tried it in a few times. Haven't written it fit my catwoman costume yet. So we will see how it holds up.
B00412DEJW|5|This costume is well made, fits as suggested and is pretty!
B00IISDVVQ|4|very nice just wish it would have been a little bit darker of a peach
B00BPFITZ2|4|I bought this robe last week and got it rather quickly. It is a little on the large size however I will still wear it and love the feel of it. The pockets were a must!
B00PV0NJHA|5|love the material and pockets
B001PTGLR6|3|these did NOT have any type of adjustment straps in them that other boys/girls pants have.  If they did, i'm sure they would have fit fine.
B00JTYRX2Q|5|Feels great
B00KI16RUI|2|The fitting was fine, it uplift it but it did not last for 2 hrs, the middle fabric part where the middle clip is had totally detached off. There was no way to keep it attach. Thank god my dress was good enough not to make my boobs look awkward. I will never by again, its too cheaply made.
B002FJJ2HQ|4|Great pants well made, a lot of pockets but no slit for your pocket knife like their competitors.
B00MPWFSTE|4|Cute as can be and seem durable. But they run a tad on the smaller side.
B00M0AY1FS|4|They feel so great to my feet.
B001A3Z92A|5|These are nice fitting jeans and a very nice color of brown, I havent seen any quite this color before, not the usual shade of dark chocolate brown. I will buy more of these!
B00KJJK4AI|4|Very nice for the price and sexy too
B000OWB238|5|Loved this!  Nice hit for our chopshop at our halloween party!
B001ATBXLU|5|You and your company have the best darn customer's relations I have seen in 65 years on this here earth!!! You have been fantastic throughout the entire purchasing process. Thanks just do not seem enough but THANKS!!
B00HWHIWLI|3|The cosmetic appears of these earrings was really good detail considered the cheap cost - exactly like the picture.  Cosmetically very nice appearance.  Why I gave only 3 stars is partly my fault.  I failed to view before purchasing was the size of the earrings.  The rose is bigger than my ear and the dimension is deep so they stick out.  I prefer studs on the smaller size and these are definitely more than visible.  Also, it arrived very well packaged but due to the low quality of the earring with the post on back one had broken off during shipping.  It can be easily fix with glue, but looking at the post back I anticipate this could repeat on the other earring.  Just wish the rose had been smaller.
B00EJSR5YS|5|excellent
B00BOWTCHA|5|Perfect for the Star Wars fan Dad.  Good quality.
B00BLXLX6K|2|The velcro on these bras is a very poor idea. I have had to hide in the back of the aerobics room during a Zumba class to feed the strap back through and velcro it again. Does not withstand high impact, and very difficult to thread through and velcro, especially after nursing baby. Not happy, and definitely wouldn't buy again!
B00A65Z84M|4|This shirt is great for work or play. Figure fitting showing off just enough curves. Cute and stylish. You will get lots of compliments.
B00N4DOKCE|1|the shirt I ordered was  a child's shirt but received  a ladies shirt. did not fit my child and was for a concert
B0089DXJDU|4|My son is very tall for his age so I always buy a 5 even though it's a little big for him. The suit fit well, not really big at all. If anything the legs were shorter than typical 5's. It looks nice though and is a decent suit for the price.
B005GPZY6Y|4|The blouse was perfect for my daughter's concert.  She wore a camisole underneath as it is a bit sheer.
B005TL96DC|5|Love the undersocks!!  my little guy can wear his leg warmers all winter with these.  Also great if I need an extra layer of warmth under a thin pair of pants.
B00O1QJVMW|5|I love these, just what I was looking forward, Had gone to KOHLS  and bought one pair, weren't as nice and more money.
B00FYF6UTQ|5|Comfortable with a good fit, will buy again.
B007W0WNP6|5|that's a beautiful belt my husband loves it.we didn't know how to reverse it and now we know how it's easy to reverse in black or brown the way you want it....we are satisfied with it.
B00HHLQZFE|5|LOVE this scarf.  I ride a motorcycle and wear this in my hair.  I have gotten so many compliments on it.
B00UYWVZXU|4|Soft to the touch and very comfortable ..My daughter will love these..Colours so bright and fun..My daughter is four years old but I order a size 7/8 they are a bit large but comfortable.
B0026HJ9ZC|5|even though picture does not represent real colour.<br />the case itself is very solid and reasonably heavy.<br /><br />I was surprised by good quality, it feels durable.<br />it is not a tiny-tin-foil it is made out of metal i cannot bend.<br /><br />in picture it looks like brass - but in reality it is more like light brown tint with no traces of &#34;gold&#34;  colour.<br />but it looks good anyway.
B001TEGI66|1|I received the Nautica Sleepwear Men's Herringbone Woven Short Sleeve TOP on Wednesday, November 24, 2010.  When will I receive the BOTTOM short pants to this sleepwear?  If the top is all I will receive, then your advertisement is misleading.  The picture shows both top & bottom to this sleepwear.[[ASIN:B001UHN2BQ Nautica Sleepwear Men's Herringbone Woven Short Sleeve Camp]]
B00D0434HY|5|I love this dress.  I received so many compliments along with people asking where did I purchase this dress.  I received my order earlier than the expected delivery date.  Amazon is awesome when it comes to online ordering!
B00CIUFHP8|5|Purchased the brown polarized to replace my original Jawbone black polarized that were so badly scratched from years of abuse. The ones I received fit perfectly and are cut exactly like the original Jawbone lenses that I have. They came promptly and securely packaged. The free lens cleaning cloth was a nice touch as well as the cloth carrying case that had separate compartments for each lens. At this price, I'll be purchasing a couple more colors.
B00SBM3NGM|1|The material was so heavy that it pulled the dress down. I'm 5'8&#34; and it hung just above my ankles. It looked ridiculous!
B00JEKL70Y|5|This is a snug fit around the edge, but I'm stretching it and think it will relax. It's quite beautiful.
B007K9A9VO|1|They're very loose fitting and don't fit to your body like a brief - they're just slimmer boxer shorts, not boxer briefs.
B005UASR50|5|I'm very pleased with this purchase,i'ts breezy,comfortable and sexy to wear around the house and the price was great I paid 11.40 with free shipping through amazon.I'm waiting on more colors.the caftan is very sheer you might want to wear a slip under it or not.If you're a size 39 in bust an 39-40 in hips a large is a great fit.
B0030BNK6M|5|Very nice, and comfortable. Planning on ordering a few more in different colors. I recommend this product. Great support straps.
B008YCXPMG|4|simple, comfortable, versatile - just what I was looking for when I ordered this shirt. It's a little snug around the middle, just more than I usually like but certainly not bad.  Only thing that worries me is it's likely to shrink, even washed in cold water. We'll see.
B00FN82DMM|2|This item is not what it appears.  Quality is very cheap and it looks  just as cheap.  Would not recommend buying it.
B00DXCIEY6|5|super cute!
B00IDAMPRK|5|My ex-girlfriend is thick and suffering from depression. I bought this to cheer her up and she loved it .  It's the little things That count
B006VRX864|5|These are the cutest little outfits.  Great for the summer time.  Very well made.  True to size.  Soft material.  You can't go wrong.
B00GIBT9TS|3|Too short not long enough and I am 5'7. I won't be using it because it doesn't fit. Material is good and looks good.
B00CX1L18Y|5|Just as expected good quality
B007JVY338|3|They don't wash well but nice
B00AP4QMQW|3|High quality.   Arms are a little too long and the cotton lining gets hung up as you slide damp skin through it.  Probably a bit overpriced for what it is but we'll made nonetheless.
B00MASK424|3|Zipper broke the second time it was warn.
B00A0PZU28|3|Love the way they fit.  I like the fact that when they are worn that they do not go below my knees.  Very comfortable shorts and very good quality, so far. UPDATE: after wearing them one time the material tore at the hip seam.  The seam did not come apart but the material tore.  I sent them back to the supplier and as yet after many weeks have still not received another pair nor have I received a credit.
B00LJNXPLI|1|It said it was a 5x shirt in reality was more of a lg shirt
B0015PA2KW|5|I bought several of these to wear to the gym to lift weights. Very comfortable, soft fabric. Good fit. A little revealing, but a classic bodybuilding look which is about as close to shirtless as most gyms allow these days (although they do cover the nipples), permitting very easy movement without any constriction of the arms and shoulders. For $9.95 apiece, they are a steal. 100% cotton is easy to care for, too: wash in the regular cycle, dry in the dryer.
B000PK3Y4E|4|The hat arrived early!  I was surprised at the small box; but the hat was not wrinkled or creased.  The hat is sized for people with average to thinning hair.  Mine is thinning.  It won't fit: if you have thick hair.  The color was not as vibrant at pictured; but still works with my coat. Thanks to Luxury Divas and Amazon.
B003GXFTKY|5|Like I said in the title, \\"It's made by LEVI'S . . .\\" so what do you expect? Of course it's good, durable, fits right, and looks good. I'm not sure what else to say about it. I'm pleased with my purchase, as it holds up my pants like a good belt should!
B000VBELXA|5|This is a cute costume. Easy to put on and take off. My three year old was happy and so was I.
B00Q0LW2MC|5|prefect
B00422MCVW|5|Excelent
B008ATWBO6|5|My son is a thin 2.5 year old and he needed the 2T.  The 3T was too big.  There is no way to adjust the waist.
B00GYPETMK|4|Nice polo
B0092EU5L4|4|looked great on my girl she seemed to like it. metal mulisha makes really good shirts get the shirts one size bigger for shrinkage
B00A6V7UBA|5|Great! Better than the regular type.
B0041EA2Y0|1|Received a different pair from the picture and one of the clasps was already broken when it arrived.
B00OPJPUES|4|The material is really shiny and the fit is really snug,  but for the price,  I'm happy with it.
B006SFSHD8|4|Great fit, soft and comfortable, stretchy and good length in arms and torso. I ordered this, a white one and the ankle-length bottoms from NY Lingerie and am very pleased with both the product and the service from them. The hip-length hem doesn't roll up on me as so many under garments do. I ordered a medium and am a fairly trim 140lb 5' 5&#34;, and the the fabric has enough stretch to be comfortable on someone 20-30 lbs more, yet fits me snugly, too--magic, perhaps? This under layer is very comfy under my clothing because, as I mentioned, it doesn't roll up, bunch up and ride up. Only 4 stars because it was just a little thinner than I was hoping for and I am in a very cold climate (brrrrr). I wear these at all times now, even as pajamas, because they are so very comfortable.
B003H145LY|1|I ordered white and got the printed package; ugly colors and prints and the didn't even fit well. They were inexpensive enough that they weren't worth the trouble to return them so I threw them away.
B009S284XQ|5|I'm usually a M, but sometimes Ds have a hard time fitting into Ms. This shirt fits perfectly for a C or D cup and is wicked CUTE and comfy!!!! Recommend 10 times over.
B000O0ZDE4|5|Nice fit.  Good construction and fabrics. Fine workmanship.  The price is nice as well!  These are made well enough to stand up to washer and dryer and will last for years.
B007C3ZJS6|5|love it
B003WQU5GI|5|Got the matching set.  Shirts fit great and we love them!  Thanks!
B004ARZKJA|4|The set is good looking, woven stripe sets it off; they are a little lighter in weight than what I would have preferred.<br />But, they will do fine.
B00CZ4NLE6|5|Loved it! Sadly I didn't realize I ordered to wrong color for my dress but it still looked beautiful
B000UVP2YI|1|I ordered these tights to wear with the elf costume I purchased. I ordered them for a Xmas party and I had the costume<br />But no tights! It took over a month to receive these and they were 2 day Prime shipping. They came too late for me to wear so they are still in the package. Maybe I will wear them this holiday season.
B006GMMITC|1|Dear Small Breasted friends,<br />Hello to all! My sad tale; I have a revealing dress that I wanted to wear. Its got straps on top, but I'm tired of being boobless. I youtubed some videos on how to become a professional boobies illusionist. Hey, we all need hobbies, right?  One of the products that came up, was very similiar to this one.Being a cheapskate & skeptic I choose this one mainly for the price. My fake boobs arrive in a clear plastic boob container. Not the packaging as listed. NO INSTRUCTIONS!!! My fellow small breasted women, I'm no expert so I REALLY WANTED INSTRUCTIONS. Show me a pamphlet about placement & how to make these suckers stay on. Heck, show me a drawing, I'm easy to work w! Its not very comfortable to go out and be afraid these things will shift. It ruined my inner peace. Therefore, I cant recommend this product.<br />Sincerely,<br />Your small busted friend
B00G3JEH6A|4|Great...while they last. I've had them for five months now and at least half of them have holes.
B000P0B5V8|4|Gave as I B-day gift, and got no complaints. Wish I would have got the matching hat
B004CM80U4|5|It keeps all the fat stored away excellent  look 15 pounds lighter
B000F43HQK|1|I washed this bandana and the skull and crossbones logo went away. I am not a happy pirate now.
B005M73HTW|4|these jeans fit well. a bit light 110z. had to hem the legs. washed a couple times. dont see the problems previous reviewer reported.
B007NAULGS|2|The coloring of the &#34;silver&#34; and gold are WAY different than the picture shows!  The silver is more of a dull, gunmetal gray and the gold is extremely shiny.  I was also lead to believe it was of higher quality, based on previous reviews.  I'm not sure if these people's standards for &#34;high quality&#34; is far less than mine, but it is quite cheap looking and feeling.  I bought this product based on the pictures and reviews and was highly disappointed by both.  This was intended as a gift, but I will probably end up returning it.
B002PBNNY2|4|This costume is great. The price is reasonable, the quality is better than expected. I think it will last for many years to come.
B005FYNXBY|5|These are built to last. Very well made and fit me perfectly.<br />This was my first experience buying socks online. I am one happy customer.
B00HXCNBXG|4|Gorgeous!<br />Fits a little small.<br />Worth the money, good quality!<br />Daughter is 4 months and 12 lbs, and it fits her now
B00CBD1TD6|5|Pretty
B008M5S09S|5|love these socks.  great comfort over other similar brands
B00K769BLQ|5|I bought these to wear to bed and they are SO SOFT and comfortable. I am a woman, but now I will only buy Hanes tees for my husband because I love mine so much. He has Fruit of the Loom and they are thin and stiff. These are the best tees I've every worn.
B00KDY20TW|4|This is such a perfect little jacket. I bought it as part of a white rabbit costume and it did not disappoint. THe color is much more &#34;white&#34; than Ivory which is perfect. It's just like the picture.
B0077S4IE2|4|Comfortable fit even with the mock turtle neck a bit on the large size.  Wears well in hot humid weather.
B009TCFK6E|5|I bought these over two years ago, and they are still in great shape, although I don't wear them too much. They are good quality, warm, and pretty.
B004602364|5|These worked great for a black light event I attend once a month. Would recommend these to anyone that wants to glow.
B00EF52TRI|4|As I always say about Carter's, the sizing and fabric quality are good.  These fleece PJs are another example.  Cute penguin graphics, little ruffle details on the legs.  My daughter loves these.
B008BI12ZA|3|Tlhe product was great but was dissappointed that it is almost too small and the next size is too big....
B007W0XUQW|5|Fits perfectly and delivery was on time.
B00VWEDRDK|5|I'll let the photo speak for itself. I wish the bra cups were larger, but I have HUGE boobs so I didn't expect anything better. This is Perfect
B009T9TJ78|5|Infinitely stiffer than those limp plastic strips that come with every shirt I buy.<br /><br />Just make sure to remember to remove them from the shirt before putting in the wash. You'll probably make a lot of noise and perhaps do some damage to the interior of the drum.
B005MIJWJA|4|I think the slip is a quality garment. It fits as expected. I was looking for a slip a few inches longer and couldn't find one. This works with my knit maxi dresses. It keeps them from clinging to me even in our record heat.
B000NVWYV4|3|I have had this for maybe less than a year.<br />Jacket is great, but is falling apart around the seams.
B00AAIWGYU|4|Wonderful for the winter. I wear it all the time.<br /><br />Thanks for the great communication.
B002G9U6BG|5|I wore these work pants among other non carhartt work pants for 35 days in western Alaska on the bering sea. I can not believe how tough they are. they worked great while logging, working on the boat, and they are tough enough for roofing (the shingles don't rip them to pieces). They were stiff when I first bought them but after wearing them 5-6 times they finally softened up. the more you wear them the better they fit!
B0008EOGCG|5|Great pair of jeans
B00DTVCKQY|5|I love Adidas sports bra.  Nice to wear. Shipping is fast. Highly recommend.  I will be good if it is lightly padded
B000LXBXS4|5|This is the best, most comfortable thong I have ever worn. The material is perfect - mostly cotton so your ladyparts can breathe, but with a little bit of spandex so it stretches and stays soft.  It is expensive but worth it. Highly recommend.
B008NDKOHA|5|I recommend this product to anyone who hates to wear hose or socks.  Perfect.  Keeps the shoes from rubbing and feel very comfortable.
B0043DWJIQ|5|I my better days I would wear a 44 then a 46 so I was concerned about buying a coat on line from anyone.  Growing up in the country back in the good ol days Sears lined denim coats were all we had.  N blue jeaned lined has been replaced with denim and so on.<br />I have larger than normal shoulders and chest.  A 44 or 46 either one may have worked, I selected the 44 and could not have been more pleased.  The shoulders are great with or without a sweater on.  The sleeves fit like a good dress shirt.  My shirts are 17.5 neck and 34 or 35 sleeve.  The comfort range is between the 30's and low 50's, for you it may be different.  I live in Nashville,TN where the weather is always changing.  For me I could have made a better decision regardless of the price.<br />If you need a comfortable WELL FITTING denim line  jacket then do yourself and your money favor, buy this one.  It is as tough as you will ever need it and as comfortable as a well fitting sweater.<br />I have no idea who Guide Gear is and I don't care.  I've learned all I need.  I will definitely buy from them again.
B00JC10LQG|5|gift
B00A74I19G|5|Like a glove!
B00HLAFJVC|5|This shirt is comfortable, fave color and stylish...not to mention versatile.
B00PF9MEBO|5|why?
B00CONNDGO|5|My wife is already starting to see results. Also it prevents you from over eating, if you have it on while eating. Forcing you to just eat the proper amount of food you should be eating.<br />My wife uses baby powder in order to be able to put it without much struggle.
B000ZH9O1E|3|The silicone top that is supposed to help hold them up doesn't. It just rolls down. I wish they fit better because they are cute but not worth what I paid for them not to stay up :(
B00ICGK9F0|5|Took a chance on ordering this dress.  Reviews were good.  It fit great and looks as beautiful as the photo.  Love it!!
B00475YDKW|4|The gloves are great but it would be better if the outer lining did not snag onto things. I use another layer under these for extra warmth and my fingers never ever gets cold.  The shipping took a long time as this should be expected because it is not shipped domestically.
B00GYTK21S|5|After reading the reviews, I ordered a L and fit well. I was surprised about how good the quality was, great buy and will definitely be buying another colour again.
B00695C6F2|5|Of all the things I buy on line I would have thought a bra would be last, but it fit perfectly and I love it!
B009VNY7JC|5|Soft, Flowy, very light weight.<br />Hangs a bit under belt when not double wrapped.<br /><br />Works well with or without Jacket, I am 5'9 and Size 14.
B00B7GL3NY|4|I'm normally a 33/34 waist and after washing and drying once, the Large fits about right.  The Medium is definitely too small - at least for me.
B00B13U2XU|5|So far this is a great case. It's thin, not bulky, and it's got a super cute graphic on it. Doesn't have those annoying rubber grips on the side like some of the other Roxy cases. I couldn't stand those. This one is sleek and smooth!
B00BTPPR26|5|It was perfect the only problem is the strings the u turn in you leg  they fall Dow every time u walk
B001NXBQQ0|4|i purchased a couple of these after buying one at jcpeeney.<br />this bra fits well and is comfortable to wear all day.
B000N5VH5E|5|The book was just as advertised and a miniature version of the full size one I purchased last year.  My husband LOVES it as it's great for when we're traveling. It was a BIT overpriced considering it was half the size of the letter size portfolio but the same price as the larger version.
B00QKGMYWK|5|Great hat. Nice style and quality. Very happy with my choice.
B00JGMYKWC|1|Horrible! The dress kept falling apart! I do not recommended
B00KT1LW8E|5|Comfy, fit my bf well and I think I will fit in them too. I don't know if I would buy at full price, but I'm just cheap; they are prolly worth it.
B00OMVEA2W|3|I got an extra large, but it fit more like a medium.
B00PGIF1GO|5|Best belt i ever owned. Perfect system, lots of designs, i guess that will be the belt system for the rest of my life. And that's not hyperbolic.
B00SY66BNW|1|I got this for myself and it didn't fit one bit, it was way to small. It's very thin material and pretty bad stitching. I would definitely suggest you don't waste your time on this one.
B00LTSSLPI|1|This dress was very see through.. the slit on the chest is nor that deep. It barely reaches my chest. And the sides are over lapped differently. One side the front flap is under the back and the other is behind it?!<br />Also the dress looks very long and in a chiffon almost sheer material. This dress is cotton and only reaches my ankle... it fits awkward. So for c cup athletic build 5'7'' girl. Do not get this!!
B00OQKX020|3|did shrink lightly
B001505UHC|5|I read all the reviews on this blouse before making my purchase and I ordered accordingly.  The fit is perfect.  I love this blouse!
B00EY3GQXO|3|As others have said, the medium fits like a large. Since I'm sort of medium-largish, this was just right.
B00553XP4U|1|Madonna boulder holders back in style and no one told me? Do not buy unless you are okay with CONE B00BS!
B001DNK02G|5|I bought this costume to wear to some college parties for Halloween 2012. I haven't worn it to a party yet, but I have tried it on quite a few times because I love how it looks so much. The dress IS very short, but that's the look I was going for. If you were looking for something modest, buy something else or wear leggings with this. I absolutely love the accessories the costume comes with: necklace, arm warmers, leg warmers, and ears. They make it that much more adorable. This costume fits me absolutely perfectly. I am 5'1 and a size 14/16, size 1 at Torrid. The only thing that doesn't fit are the leg warmers: my legs are about 18\\" around and the tops are a little snug. I will still wear them, I just wish they could go up more near my knees like in the picture. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone over a size 16, or perhaps a tall 18. The fur on the costume DOES come off very easily, but it's a Halloween costume...I'm not expecting super quality here. Also, the zipper has trouble staying up. The dress isn't too tight or anything, but the zipper comes undone if I bend over quickly. I think I will super-glue it when I wear it and just pull it on over my head.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Figure-flattering for plus size figures, the tight midsection helps give you an hourglass shape<br />Plenty of accessories to ensure your costume looks put-together<br />Soft material<br />Fits a size 14/16 perfectly<br /><br />CONS:<br />Fur falls off pretty easily<br />Leg covers aren't perfect fit for girls with large calves<br />Zipper has trouble staying up<br /><br />Overall, I WOULD recommend this!
B00PK8NK0E|1|My some wears a 2T but I ordered a 3T so it would be comfy, and these are too tight.  It's cute...but it is more a dark pink than red...which is not what the description says.  It's supposed to be red and green.
B00IOHOX36|4|a little low cut
B00DS38CWE|5|Great coat!  Especially for the price.  I hate paying a lot for clothes for my kids that will either destroy them, lose them, and/or outgrow them in a blink of an eye.  This is a nice light jacket (but still plenty warm), that is made with quality and has held up to my Kindergartener.  And great for the price.
B000E99ZXK|5|These capri are a great fit and firm control.  Danskin always seems to provide a good overall fit.  The fabric is breathable and comfortable.
B001R4C99I|5|are quite thick, it should be used with shoes that they are not fair
B00VTXSLNA|5|Very cute
B001AF04EQ|1|This is the first review I've done on Amazon, even though I probably average 3-4 purchases a month.  I bought these for my 16-month old for the winter.  We live in Vermont, so warmth is essential.  It's still October, so it's not super cold yet.  He's worn them once to a two hour playdate and today for a hike (he was in a backpack).  When we got home, I noticed a HUGE hole in the seam of the pants.  I'm not sure if this was there all along and I didn't notice, or if after two wears they ripped.  I paid over $60 for these, so I'm pretty upset.  I also missed the return window by a week.  The return policy for this item is unacceptable, given the price and flaw after such a short time.<br />I would recommend these pants, though you should make sure they're not flawed (or have a hole after two wears).  Super disappointed.
B00CLBHN4M|2|Ordered a small. But too small for 5 yr old girl
B00A6MZFH0|5|Love it! Fits great! Quick shipping! Well made.
B0001YSBMO|5|hard to find .
B00AF0SOW6|3|When I am snowboarding with this ski mask it moves around my face to easily and it gets annoying pretty fast. Other then that it is GREAT on. Keeping your face warm absolutey GREAT!
B0083REY2M|3|For 2T-4T, I expected these socks to be a bit bigger. They are SUPER cute, great colors, etc. But unfortunately, my some will only be able to wear them for about 5 minutes (definitely not by the time he is 4T!)
B00FS5DE3W|5|Excelente
B000W6XY4G|5|Great!
B00ELOZSPS|5|It is just right for my husband, light weight and it is has more room in it than his last one.
B005FXADCM|4|I'm a 6'3&#34; ~200lb male.  Got the XL tall which which was a tad bit long in the legs, but perfect in the crotch and over the shoulders.  I normally wear a L, but don't think I would have fit comfortably at all.
B0013N6XTK|3|These are a nice pair of rain gear work pants.  It is a very thick material.  They keep my fiance dry when he has to work (constructon) in the rain all day.  The only problem is that they're not breathable so when working hard, it can tend to get a little steamy since the moisture can't escape.  I finally decided to spend the money and buy the breathable ones.  They're twice the price, but twice as nice!
B007XD4TGI|5|It's a super soft, very thin, t-shirt material, which I loved. I typically don't buy clothing on line due to measurements are never true to fit as described in product info. But this was PERFECT!!!  I wore it out with friends for a night on the town the next night. Of course it can be paired with just about anything and still look trendy. I wore it with black leather shorts, leather ankle boots, and a leather jacket. I felt pretty rock star in that top, which is kind of odd considering it was a big baggy top. I'm a small girl who usually wears close/tight fitting clothes so I don't appear frumpy, but this still looked awesome. I ended up looking up all Allegra K women's clothing and ordered like 7 other pieces. Also, it was super affordable, so even if it doesn't hold up, I already got my $ worth out of it!
B007DJ32AQ|4|ace of tshirts
B005TI1GQ0|4|Arm length is too long<br />Perfect top to throw on at the beach or pool<br />More delicate than I realized so be careful when washing
B00E6NHB0E|5|This might sound silly, but I am a long way from being a teenager and i bought this.  It is fun.  I feel happy wearing it.  And it is the most comfortable nightgown I own.
B002FHELT2|5|My husband really likes these and they stay in place. Very comfortable.
B00817E046|4|Not the same colors as in the image, however still a nice variety. Shirts fit well and are comfortable.
B003GJMBK4|5|The sweater is really cute and very flattering. The color (fuschia) makes it even more cute and the belt gives you a nice shape. I wore it this past weekend with some tight jeans and my hubby said I looked hot=)
B009DNWG5C|5|My husband purchased this item for me and I love it. It kept me warm in a stylish way, and it fits perfect.
B00KYEKP4I|4|color a little too bright than expected...but still looks cute
B00BBW51YG|1|It was very flimsy material and the xxlarge was more like a small. Would not recommend it.  See through material.
B0036JBZO2|5|Very satisfied with quality and fit.
B009O8M04S|3|Really pretty and good material,  but too form fitting for me. Shows every curve! If you are very slim, this will be perfect for you.
B00ZJGBEAU|5|Just Me
B008PZ38LK|5|I have just received my romper and was to taken with the quality and coziness of the material, the style which couldn't have been better and fit better than I could have ever imagined! I picked purple for my first set and just love the look! It couldn't have fit better and is so cute and easy to get into! At first I was a bit worried about it maybe coming to me as a jr size instead of a women's regular, even though it was advertised as a women's regular and was very much surprised with how much I love it and how it fit so well! I am looking to get another set before summer is over and have loved another item that I bought from this seller which was a layered tank top which is also true to size and love their look! I would highly recommend this item for a common/yet attractive romper set that is true to size and attractive and well worth the money! I can't thank ToBeInSytle enough and will be back soon to order one or two more! Thanks for your noteworthy service also! You are one seller that anyone can be reassured what you are buying is exactly what is advertised...and can easily exceed anyones expectations. You will not be disappointed with any thing from this seller!<br />a+++
B008F8WPHK|4|Perfect
B001203BJY|1|The boob cups pointed outward and made my breasts an awkward shape. I wish it was a more rounded cup rather than a point. I did like the fully tighten feature of the strap, but just not worth it if my boobs are pointed east and west of each other.
B009V6M23M|4|Shirt feels and looks to be of decent quality. Shrank a lot in the wash, so you may want to buy a size bigger to account for that.
B00CYY53V6|5|My husband loves these cargo shorts ~ Excellent quality ~ Fits true to size ~ Launders well ~ Highly recommend
B00KFBEFZA|5|My loves the fit and look, wears it everyday!
B006M44GJO|5|This tube top fits me great, has held up in the wash, and is everything I was looking for when I bought this product. Thanks!
B0080YG13I|5|This is a great product, great service at a good price.  I will continue to purchase more items from this vender in the near future.
B0086TZAM0|5|The earlier reviews are informative enough. From those I went with a size smaller and was glad I did. The jacket is a little heavy but is warm and feels great. Happy with the purchase.
B00CALDD88|5|THE COMBINATION OF TIE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND CUFF LINKS MAKE  A GREAT MATCHUP WITH MY FINE TAILORED DARK SUITS  WHEN I APPEAR BEFORE A LARGE GROUP
B00T57CQCY|5|Keeps my feet cool and dry
B0002TORAS|5|I really like these socks - they fit well, are made well, and will last a long time.
B00LGIX0IO|3|Well i got my package in for this shirt and was so excited to try it on, but once i got it on, its waaayyy too long on the sides the rest of it fit ok other than the really long sides. I got a medium-sized. Shirt in, im no taller than 5' 4&#34; and about 113lbs this size was recomended for me but not near as proportionate as in the picture... Very disapdisappointed, and to be honest i dont even think i ordered and medium, i thought i ordered a small? Either way would be much better if it fit as shown in the picture. If someone can help fix this i would give a 5 PLUS PLUS on this shirt since it is very cute in general if it fit better. PLEASE HELP!!! I would greatly appreciate it if the company or individual could help with that. Thankyou for reading this :)
B0025WHH98|4|Very comfortable.  HOWEVER, I couldn't get them in a petite size and they had to be shortened.  They were a little roomy, so next time I'll order in a smaller size.  I resolved this by machine washing in hot water and put in dryer for 40 minutes.  Now they fit perfectly.
B0087TJLCO|1|I ordered this shirt for an event. The size was all wrong.  You need to go up at least three sizes for a comfortable fit!
B00K60E7RQ|1|very small
B007YJRN6O|5|I absolutely luv this hat, when it arrived I cocked it to the left and BAM!!!! I fell in love I luv my fedora and it's sooooo worth the price, I have a big head and I still have room!!!! Luv luv luv it!!!!
B00E4OGJ3U|4|It fit a big large in the collar and is the same shirt as the listing &#34;Kyle Thomas Men's Cotton Rich Laydown Collar..&#34;.  The range isn't defined enough to fit perfectly, but my son only needed it once, so it worked.
B00DCCAFCQ|3|This is a beautiful skirt and my daughter just loves it. The only thing is it is completly see through.I had to go out and buy her a pair of white leggins to wear under it. Wish they could have made it of a better quality material.
B0086UC4LE|5|Buy it girls, it is flattering for any body type. I'm going to wear the red shirt and the color is even better than I expected.
B00LANLCDA|5|Love it - it fits as expected !
B004QWYXFQ|5|This is coolest Pink Floyd shirt I have ever seen (a close second was the one that said &#34;first in space&#34; which was also very cool). Fit was right and the look was awesome. If you're a die-hard Floyd fan, you must own this shirt... even if it's not an actual concert shirt (and I have been)... it's still very cool. (Mine came from Liquid Blue Apparel).
B00KFBI6VO|4|Fits relatively well, but the material is very sheer. The design of the top also makes it weird to wear anything under it.
B00KXOJKEU|5|I'm enjoying my shirts. I'll probably be ordering more in the near future.
B00H8CRV4Q|4|Im 6' tall 170lbs with 31&#34; waist.<br />I just wish there was  a little elastic in thew waist. you're completely reliant on the drawstring and friction to keeps these up.<br /><br />Good size pockets, comfy, good length and not too baggy. Bought the for international flights and have done me well.
B00BBUJZK4|5|Love the wrinkle free fabric for easy care. Size is just right, so if you are an odd number waist...order that or up one.
B00R7GLEK0|5|My baby was too small for it but she will grow into it, the detail of the rhinestone eyes and rabbits tails makes even more adoriable. I total recommend it, speedy delivery.
B003HMX8H0|4|This costume is beautiful and looks impressive.  I am usually a size 0-2, but the size small (4-6) fit me pretty snug.  Be careful about the sizing.
B0041EBNR0|5|Thank you
B00AZ1YT4M|4|When I tried these on, I loved them. They were comfortable, form fitting, and gave me a natural shape (instead of waist line that is too tight).<br /><br />They are a bit long, so I have to bunch them around my ankles a bit. I wore them under boots, so this wasn't a huge problem. They did fold a bit around my knees.<br /><br />I did notice that there was a large run in them after 1 day of use. I emailed amazon, so hopefully I can get a replacement pair. I would also love it if they made these in more colors!
B00MVQDJ0Y|5|Very very nice, great fit , vivid graphics and my wife loved it!!!
B00063W3X8|2|this should cost $2 or so and I paid $10++.  Poor quality.  Visor is a bit on the short side. Frays easily.  shop around for others.
B003V4ALFG|3|This is a quality belt but the width can be an issue on some pants. I have a couple of pairs that getting this belt through the loops in your pants is difficult.
B00AQKL2ME|4|I bought this for my tablet and it fits in properly.<br />The quality is good and feels premium.<br />Overall a good buy.
B000VDVMIK|4|This is a great belt for the price. You only have to take care of any \\"heavy condition\\" (for instance, try to avoid stepping on it in the morning if you left on the floor beside the bed the previous night...)  Great design, I feel myself very comfortable with it.
B002GHC2QK|3|Thought the jacket was heavier.  Returned for heavier style.
B004QXYC6A|5|This t-shirt was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it.  When she wears it many people have commented and enjoyed the reference since they also watch the TV show.
B0067I313C|5|Very nice hat, perfect for summer or spring!  It is light and confortable, is a nice accesory to wear for a casual morning look.
B00H5FXQRC|5|awesome jacket
B00JXZ7DMQ|3|Nice lil chocker
B005I34H8A|5|Reliable for most outside work. Really warm and good in the fall for chopping lumber.
B00JV57ZIA|5|This shirt is amazing!! My boyfriend absolutley loves it! He usualy wears a meduim, but I bought a large because I wanted it a little longer. It fits amazingly! I recomend anyone to buy this for anyone who adores Marvel!
B00DZHIIDG|4|i liked it since i like her dresses and always get them when i can . she is a great designer i am glad it was on amazon
B00A8LPNTY|4|I love the case. It's exactly what I've been looking for.  However, I've had mine for about a week now and noticed that the left bottom and top corners are looking like they're cracking and soon break off.  I noticed the fit was verrrryy tight when I put it on my mini and I was nervous that it wasn't going to fit all the way.  But after trying I finally managed to squeeze it on.  I really hope it's gonna last me and that the corners won't break off because I love it :[[<br /><br />Has this happened before?
B005JSF1Q6|5|After reading some reviews about this dress i wasn't sure about ordering it but am so glad i did.<br />It fits all the curves in the right places and could be worn for several different occasions with flat shoes for day wear or high heels for a night out.<br />l also ordered them in pink,white and olive as i am going on holiday they will be good to pack as they don't wrinkle and will be good for sight seeing with a cardigan worn over the dress,other suggestions is to wear them with leggings they can be worn many different way or depends on your activity at the time you plan to wear it.
B00LVRIHLA|5|This was the perfect bustier for under my rather thin wedding dress. Though my bust did not quite fit into the cups, the shape was flattering and you couldn't tell once the dress was one. Plus it was so comfortable all night and I could relax and not worry about my stomach showing.
B0015M78KC|5|My daughters prefer this nightgown because it has both Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana on it.  They each have one and they wore it down.  Now, I bought them the same again.  It's also comfortable!
B00FF4EI72|5|Sister of the Amazon Prime account owner here.  I've heard of MINKPINK, but I've never seen or owned anything of theirs and was hesitant to purchase a brand whose sizing I was unfamiliar with, but glad it worked out in this case. For reference, I'm 5ft 2 and usually wear a 2p-4p, small-medium, 25x30.  I've been wanting a faux leather skirt for a while and love asymmetrical hemlines, so this skirt really caught my eye. I got a size small and it fit well, which surprised me because although I'm petite, I have a thick waist (i.e. no curves at ALL, so I usually have to pick something that fits my waist but is huge in the butt and hips area). It's fitted without being tight and comes right down to my knees so it's still work appropriate. One thing I've noticed with order faux leather/leather online is that it does take the shape of all the cardboard packaging creases, but I didn't notice any creases by the end of the day.
B000YNOCPM|4|Have been using it for several years now. Still looks awesome, just like new! Fits well. Nice to touch. But after several wears, metal strap fell off. I still wear it coz looks very sexi even with one strap hanging )))
B00HWRPHDO|4|Good fits well
B000NZYDRI|3|They fit ok unless you have large calves.  The zipper pull broke off when trying to zip it up.
B001HQO200|5|I got this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutly loves it. Every time he wears it people ask where he got it.
B00E6Z54ZQ|2|Thought I would give these a chance however within the first hour and first time clipping them on to my glasses they fatally broke and were not able to be repaired.  The shape is large and will not really fit any glasses that tend to be small or even medium.  The clips are big and very difficult to place in the glasses and really it seems that is all you can see.  They are very thin and somewhat flimsy.  Also if you have screws that are positioned close to the nose piece these definitely wont work because the large clip falls right about where the screws are.
B008LW5DXI|4|This t-shirt is funny and true to size.  However, if you plan to wear it in public, be aware that the last figure is also flipping the bird as he says &#34;Stop Following Me&#34;.  The color is true black, even though it looks somewhat gray in the picture.
B000184IMM|5|Simply put..Girlfriend adores this shirt..if you looking for similar type shirt,dont bother looking..this is it...as she says.
B00C0YGQF2|5|LOVE THESE SOCKS AND GREAT PRICE FAST SHIPPING
B0001TOS2Q|5|Do not assume everything on this shirt is in ascii text.<br />The answer is printed directly in the question.  Think about it.
B00CA6XY1O|2|I purchased a few of these jeans over the past year and the last pair I purchased fit quite a bit looser than others. It felt like it was a size too big. I expected consistency from Levi's...
B002RTFK0M|1|Looks just like the picture. However don't buy this cap to stay dry. Your hair will get wet, very wet.
B00DE6ARFK|5|t-shirt fit true to size for me.  Bought it especially to wear to Endymion parade for Mardi Gras in New Orleans because Ian was the grand marshall.  Got the item in time.
B006SFSH7Y|1|this shirt is a thermal weaved shirt, it is not wicking.  Very dissapointed in the misleading discription of this shirt.
B005FYL26C|3|A basic t-shirt with printing.
B005H0JHN4|5|I got 2 of these shirts for my nine year old twin grandsons. Good quality. They must be adult size. I bought a small and they fit well....with a little extra room.
B00L9UNOOO|5|Shirts are authentic and looks just like the picture.i am very satisfied
B00NUDAVOO|4|These were a HIT for Pirate Night on our recent cruise
B001JBNDLM|1|Not exactly the size indicated
B00I9YVNO6|5|Excellent product.Happy with it.
B0085U7NBQ|5|My teenage grandson loves it.  It fits well and with the zip in and out lining we will get lots of use out of it before he outgrows it.
B001N4PO30|4|The skins themselves were everything that I wanted.  Only thing is that the controller won't fit in the charger with skin on.  Hope they can make some adjustments to skins so they can make a controller / skin combo that fits in charger.
B00ETSMC50|3|This hat smelled very peculiar when I received it. I febreezed it. It was not bear able and I sure didn't want my hair smelling like it. Its kind of a strange shape as well. However, I think I can make it work.
B00IS22HXA|1|Too short
B00C166U5A|5|Perfect
B00WRY7CO4|3|The glasses arrived promptly, but when I opened the package on of the lenses had a cosmetic flaw... as if the coloring had been rubbed off.
B00LID3ZQO|3|Too small.  Had to return.
B00L1D5FL4|5|Really cute and stretchy
B0041VSRJA|5|Very pretty, fit slightly smaller than expected.  But they will be ok.  Will wash by hand.
B00PCRTTXK|2|Too tight, probably won't wear again. I never know what to expect in XL size from different brands.
B00HN2BNCC|5|excellent
B0091KDHCI|4|I ordered this beautiful costume in my regular size but it was too small.  I love the design.
B00N44P9SM|5|Love these booties! Use them everyday and they have held up great! Great deal! I pity some puffy paint drops on the bottom for traction so she could stand in them!
B00L65T9VO|3|Comfortable for lounge wear. Little support.
B0053XF87O|5|I love this! Bought this to wear after having my baby. Very comfortable and does not pinch or roll. Smooths tummy without making it difficult to breathe. Most of the time, I don't even know it's there. I love that it doesn't have the shoulder straps like a lot of shapewear, much easier for nursing. I did go one size up and I'm glad for that. I've never tried the more expensive brands of shapewear, but now I really don't feel the need to. This does all that I need and my clothes look nice over it. Most of my clothing does not show any lines that will give away that I'm wearing the shapewear.
B00K5NMRBM|1|On first appearance these gloves seemed okay, they looked good out of the box.  I bought them for a gift for my spouse.  However, after just a few wears it became clear they are not made very well.  They have multiple tears in them now, as the leather is extremely thin.  Not well constructed.  The seams rip.  The knuckle holes are not grommeted so they tear.  Leather seems to be poor quality.
B002FB7VHW|4|for basic boys undershirt- this does the job. holds shape much better than Hanes, etc. and not nearly as boxy cut as some. like it. washes well.
B00AMKFP7G|4|Fits really well and it very firm on the waist down. I have one issue which is no built in bra or complression in that area. So I have to wear one underneath. And sometimes when I am sitting it rolls up. Thats all.
B0007RUNPS|1|I bought a pair of these leggins based on the reviews I read here. I literally wore them twice before the ripped at the seam. They also pilled extremely fast. Wasn't worth the money
B002OUWT3K|5|This is the PERFECT snowsuit for a little one that doesn't walk out in the snow much! I love the option to roll the sleeves or the feet though! Very warm!
B004W4TEP2|5|She wears them everyday how awesome is that. Was on time and ahe enjoyed it when she open them on her birthday
B00CTTDOJ4|4|We are all &#34;aquatic&#34; people, and since her thing is turtles, this was perfect.  And she loved getting it from Seaworld.  My only concern was that the picture and description did not indicate that there was an outer skirt, split down the middle to make it flow, that is made of very thin material that has already torn.  I repaired it, but it will probably tear again, so I will remove it, which will break her heart as she loves to twirl.
B00713ILCS|2|This top is cute on, but very delicate and flimsy. Does not wear well after one wash. Also very sheer and light. Maybe better suited for summer wear. Also stretches pretty bad with wear and picks easily.
B00GUYHXZU|4|Love the clean look this gives me when I am in yoga pants. Just wish it were a bit longer.
B00HLSRNJ0|5|Very nice arrived on time and were very nicely boxed.
B00CWWP3K6|2|To big for a newborn.
B004CANL0U|5|the friend i bought it for loved them, she said it was one of her favorite birthday gifts ever. very good
B00HFXJX26|5|Got this as a gift for my Honey! Fit perfectly & he's a big guy! Loves it & I'm glad because for a man that practically has everything, this one is unique!  He works outside for emergency patrol & it's awesome. Not only does it keep his ears warm, it's wireless! Very happy & satisfied with this purchase & it came early!
B00G9HM3QM|4|A cute summer dress that is comfortable and flattering. Feels light and cottony on and has adjustable straps and an elastic waist. Nice.
B00E1R2IT4|5|I bought two of these to wear on Black Friday shopping and love love love them. My daughter-in-law commented on how her head didn't get too hot going in and out of stores. We'll be wearing them annually!
B005ABH1HO|5|Nice
B00P633OSQ|4|It's actually white and its really big around the arms
B005OBHDVO|5|Better than expected. High price, but with only buying one pair it's not bad.
B00DB7AYB4|5|Been wearing these for several years. Being a bit thick in the middle I like to wear camp and bottom banded golf shirts for work. These soft comfortable &#34;suspendunders&#34; make for a neat smooth appearance. Lately I have been losing weight and they do a great discreet job of holding ones pants up  till you can get a smaller size. Cleaning is easy. Just run them with cold water in the delicate cycle and hang them up to dry.
B001RJZ0US|4|These are a bit lighter weight than my husband normally wears but I bought them for quick drying for our trip to Europe. I think they will be fine.
B00FVSM67Q|5|I had some issues with the dress that was sent BUT when I was able to talk with a manager from the business he was able to take care of everything and went above and beyond to ensure that everything was rectified and I received the correct dress in the end. I really appreciated their customer service and willingness to take responsibility for the issues I had with the dress. Also, 3 of my friends ordered the same dress (we are all bridesmaids) and had good experiences as well. Thank you, Fiesta (Ron) :)
B0055I17V8|3|Pain in the rear but worked in a pinch.  The box made it appear that everything came with this but nothing but the cap and instructions were in the box.  I had to rush out and get items needed to make it work.  This was not helpful as I had ordered it in a rush from Amazon expecting it had all the items needed.  I should have looked really close and at the fine print.  Overall, it worked fairly good for what we needed.
B0092KAZ72|4|Bought this product and it makes my butt look really nice in my jeans --the only problem was it runs really small so the waist was too tight in a medium.  Go up a size when you buy it and all should be good.  I'm ordering a Large and stretching to death the ones I already have.
B005SN5I7Y|5|I couldn't believe it when I say the prices they were offering these five packs for.  In XX-Large, yet.  I always have a real bias against paying $8-10 for a single plain white t-shirt.  These ended up being about $3.50 each, on sale, and I grabbed two.  Never been disappointed in the Hanes name so I figure this will be the case here as well.  I've worn them and they fit well, as I would expect them to.  If you want a great deal, this is one for you.  Put them on your watch list and grab some when they go on sale!
B00KJ2Y1MC|5|My husband looked very cut across his shoulder . HOT...
B00359GRCS|2|When we washed this, it was no longer usable for our large headed baby. It was not worth the cost.
B000BRGNTE|3|I like and use it but it's not adjustable and fits kinda tight.
B003U5TCTC|4|My son thinks the Bioworld Harry Potter shirts are great!  They are difficult to find and my son loves Lego Harry Potter.  This shirt is perfect because some t-shirts run on the small side.  This one does not so he'll have room to grow.
B00LPXHLDU|5|These were great!
B003XSVD66|5|I love this dress! It's so soft & light, and the tube top fits snug around the chest and doesn't fall down constantly. It is abgreat maternity dress for me, but because of the stretchy fabric I will be able to wear it after that too!
B00C9F9ACS|5|Nice
B00M7O0QP6|5|My daughter LOVES this backpack for preschool.
B007BKGC6I|5|I love these socks! My feet no longer get sore when I run.
B00ACIG84C|5|These shirts are extremely soft and comfortable to wear year round. I use them underneath every shirt that I wear, whether it is formal or casual. They wick sweat well, and the sleeves don't bunch up when I roll up my button up sleeves.
B00N33ZKEC|5|Great product, good quality thick material.  Well made and versatile! Ordered a size up.
B008B4PXM2|5|I purchased this as a gift and it was well received. This is as described and arrived quickly and without damages, due to the excellent professional packaging. This is a good purchase.
B0034Z1BO2|4|Good quality and comfortable
B0077S5UQM|2|Too large for an medium size
B000QW6LKA|3|Squeem vest girdle is a very comfortable fitting,fits well, but the quality of the material used is not high quality, this is the second one I purchased, but one I bought out of a boutique, and the quality was way better
B00QNLC4FE|5|👍👌
B00DV0NR9M|5|Love the fit and softness of the s***. I like it loose but it defenetly stretches if you like it tight.
B00PV658IM|5|Love these sleepers so much I ordered more after my initial purchase. My son hates footed sleepers, and these are perfect for  fall and spring nights where a fleece blanket sleep sack is too heavy. They are superior to the Halo brand Early Walker sleep sacks.  I found the Halo sack to be really large, and the leg openings are loose and stretch out of shape easily after a couple of washes. My son would trip and fall, this sleep sack solves that design flaw. The quality of fabrics used are superior, and there isn't a loose thread to be found.
B00J7ZFX1U|5|This is so cute and a really good price for the brand it is!
B00DQZ16AO|5|Most comfortable sports bra. EVER
B0091E6RDA|5|cozy and warm!!
B005FR33SE|5|The colors are so vibrant and cute. The color selection is perfect and I  would definitely purchase them again. Cute!
B00KGHQIIA|5|I got this shirt for my roommate for Christmas, it fits perfectly and the love it! Bonus it's soft!
B003LO1XPS|5|These pants are very thick and they don't wrinkle in the wash.  They are easy and yet professional.  I would gladly recommend them to anyone who wants the ease and style that I love about them.
B003ICFCJQ|3|I ordered this for my friend and at first we really liked the costume based on the pictures. I thought it was cute when it came in but she was unhappy that the side panels were a shiny fake leather material which was not depicted in any of the images online.
B00CIBCRMI|5|I love it when I get what I want, when I want it and at a price that makes me feel like I got a great value. I am a size 10 at 5'4&#34; and this robe fits just right.  It's comfortable and heavy but not too heavy and it looks like the Amazon ad.  And I did not have to try on dozens of these and leave my home to find it. What is not to like?
B00IJI60SQ|4|As much as I want to give this a great review I can't get over how big it is. I wear a size Medium regular everyday shirt and it fits perfectly. I ordered a small Jacket and it's still a little big. I was really hoping it would be nice and snug but unfortunately not. Other than the size I love the look and feel of this Jacket. It's very comfortable and keeps me warm while I snowboard. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a very reasonable jacket to ski or snowboard with.
B0018R75WK|5|scrubs came in a timely fashion and the colors matched the pictures well. comfortable and easy to take care of- they dont seem to wrinkle real easy either. very satisfied.
B003E96BYS|1|Cheap, cheap, cheap! I am so disappointed with these pants. Love everything about them except the fact that they must be made from rice paper. Not at all durable fabric. I bought 5 pair of the pants and 2 pair of the shorts. In less than one year all but one pair each has survived. All of the stress points the fabric has broken down until it is see through. Not happy with the performance.
B007IU94Z2|3|Their ok
B00BMDDCNQ|1|The fit is horrible.
B00IOSCZJ4|3|Returning
B002SEC8DI|5|Comfortable bra. Fast shipping
B005VDVDVQ|5|We were looking for a hat that looked like a rubber duck.  Technically, this is a chicken, but my 9-year-old didn't care and was thrilled with it.  Thank you.  After looking around for over a month, this was the perfect hat.
B005SN3I62|5|I ordered and returned several different slips before coming across this one. All of them fit weird and/or were too poofy or too limp. This one was absolutely perfect and made my dress look stunning. It didn't ride up and I had no issues with adjusting the size to fit me (bridal size 12).<br /><br />Little tip, when you take it our of the box, run the crinoline (every piece) through your hands to get it un-bunched and hang it in a closet to let it fall out. When you get ready to wear it, run the crinoline through your hands again to &#34;wake it up&#34; so to speak.
B002R0F82G|4|I absolutely love this tutu. I followed the size chart and read some of the postings but people rarely say how old there child is or aprox weight and size they ordered. I ordered size 2-4 for my 2 1/2 year old and it's very tight and small on her. She will be lucky if she gets to wear it for a month or so then she will surely outgrow it. She is 2 1/2 and weighs around 30 pound and is very lean. I would definitely recommend this tutu but order a size up and try to use this as a guide. Like I said my almost 3 year old, 30 pound lean daughter barely fits in it. Wish I ordered the next size up so she could have at least worn it for 6 months or so. The quality of the material is wonderful and when I washed it I put it in a net so it doesn't ruin the ruffles and I air dry it. I will probably order another one in next size up because she adores it. Also, it would be nice if it had snap buttons so it's easier to potty, but that's also because this one is so tight on her that she needs assistance with pulling it down. LOVE LOVE
B0047RU66A|5|Love the shirt!! looks like a real Police shirt!!! Really shows off your love for the DC universe!
B00WLJG25K|3|image feedback:  lace is actually royal blue, no gems in the chest, no stockings.<br /><br />fit: okay, torso area is a biiiit long definitely not for shorter girls who dont sew. (since i sew i can shorten it myself) garter straps are in front and on sides, not front and back (that or my thighs are just..big.<br />I'm 5'1 with 34&#34; bust, 26&#34; waist, 36&#34; hips and it fits my bust well, and my butt and hips. as i said it's a bit long in the waist area but fixable.<br /><br />Damage: underneath the bow on the top the lace has a tear about the size of a half dollar. noticed it right out of the package.<br /><br />Shipping: I needed it faster than it was coming, seller really came through for me. Seller speaks very broken English so you need to be patient with them but they are very nice and very helpful and i got it two weeks early!
B00IRTY8EA|1|Disappointed...while the purse was the perfect size, the larger &#34;rhinestones&#34; are actually plastic and peel off like a sticker. As some of them didn't sit flush at the corners, these rhinestones were coming off.
B00K7HB2DU|2|These shirts run at least 2 sizes smaller than what is listed. Buyer beware ! The XL is actually about the size of a medium so make sure you order larger than what you would normally wear.
B00B182PB2|3|not too great. i thought i would have more support
B00HIKVRW0|4|I have not worn this dress yet and will not be wearing it until I take off at least 5 lbs. because right not its a little close. The dress is true to size, I am the problem. Love the color combination. Very pretty.
B001LG1BQ4|2|While the sizing and shape are as expected this bra is extremely uncomfortable.  I have never worn an itchier garment in my life!  The bra would be significantly improved if it were lined as that could reduce the itchiness as well as the headlight visibility!  Don't waste your money.
B00DR6GQ2K|5|Loved by my grandchildren..Highly recommend.
B00DT4R4SK|3|I bought these for my husband. I got the same size his other overalls are (Small) and they were wayyy to big for him.
B00DUUE77E|4|Purchased this for my son on sale from amazon. It is just an OK set. I would not rant and rave about it. The print is cute, and for eight dollars I can't complain too much. The only problem was the fabric became pilly after one wash. Not really a big deal though since they are just pajamas. My son loves it.
B009WB9X6K|5|I was a little worried when I opened the package, because I thought the bra would be too big. But no! It's perfect and easy to snap and nurse and look sexy for hubby all in the same moment! Now I want matching panties!!
B00GYQXWU4|5|Was nice!! Better than expected
B00188KXXM|2|I made the big switch from boxers to boxer briefs after I started running.  I bought some just to run in and liked them so much I started wearing them full time but wanted something more \\"designer\\" than whats available at most stores.  I read good reviews of these so bought a pair.  I like the way they looked so I bought more.  I then realized there was a design flaw (IMO).  The boxers look great until you get to the legs, they have an elastic band at the bottom of the leg openings that keep them in place but the problem is after putting on some close that band usually keeps them wadded up at the top of your thighs so when you take off your pants (hopefully under the watchful gaze of your lady) they don't look as when you first got dressed.  Make the legs tighter, maybe more stretchy to accomodate more thigh sizes and they would be perfect.  Personally I own several brands of boxer briefs and rarely wear these as my current favorites are Addidas (the spandex ones, not the cotton ones).  They may not have the pouch for your junk but they hold their shape very well, stay in place, feel great and work well for both daily and exercise wear.  Lets be honest guys, if you don't have anything to fill out that pouch its pretty pointless so it doesn't really matter, because it isn't padded, lol.
B007XUJ8FS|5|Good price good quality
B003D7HA4G|4|The product was as expected.  I know that woman's costumes tend to run a little small.  I bought a size small for my 12 year old daughter.  She is about 4'9\\" and weighs 95lbs.  It was a little bit big on her but we probably would have not bought a size smaller.
B009H8SOBS|4|My store carries hat sets similar to this but at a higher price. Im glad I ordered this! They are soft and keep you warm and not to mention they come in adorable colors to match any outfit!
B00CQ4CN7Q|5|I bought these for my Grandson.  He is already wearing 6 months at almost 5 months old.  These should fit him soon.  Thank you Carter's.<br />KindGrandma7.....
B00CPKLWWI|4|Love them! Make sure to get a size larger than your actual size. Does not stretch.
B009PZW9D2|5|Beautifully made, pure wool - nice and warm!
B00CVJU4S6|5|love it!
B00091UNX4|5|He loved them
B00B6ECFW0|5|Good fit. Comfortable Henley
B00JELRO3M|5|Like Mulder's picture but better.
B00790B9K4|5|Shipped on time and was exactly as described. Hat is a little cheap and doesn't hold up very well. Rest of costume is so cute that it makes up for it.
B00N1U2MVQ|5|I love it
B00M0FXCTE|5|Sexy yet classy! It has that enough sexiness that I can wear in anywhere anytime. It hugs my body comfortably! For its price,it's definitely a good buy!
B005D0FS18|5|I bought one last year and wore it a couple times. Ended up giving it to my neighbor friend who was without a hat in the cold months (cold for Cali anyway). A few months went by and I missed my froggy hat so much I had to buy a second one. I have a big head and lots of hair and it fits perfectly! Even with my hair pulled up in a bun! So far no complaints as far as manufacturing go - seems well made!
B00BGIQR3E|4|This case is very nice. Easy to hold on to. Just one downfall, it was hard to figure out which way is the top when its not on. So I painted the word top in nail polish.  Overall pretty good!
B00COADTFC|5|I LOVE the color and the fit.  It is a bit snug in the chest area.  I am not very big so anyone with a larger top might take this into consideration when ordering.  Otherwise it is perfect.  The material is thick, soft and the cut is so flattering.  I will see when I wash it how the dye sits but otherwise I cannot say enough good things about it.  So pretty and feminine.
B003XF3FRE|2|Nice quality of material.  cute look, however they slide down when moving.  Could use better elastic top or silicone would be even better. Definitely just over the knee.  unless you have very short legs you wont get any higher and with the poor elastic they come right down.  needless to say they were only wore once.  too much trouble to keep up.
B00LEBWBM4|5|Granddaughter absolutely loves it.
B00NLMPR6G|1|Not pleased with this at all, the print decal looks rough & way too small.
B00M7IEM2K|4|Fits gd on the grandkid and did not shrink up like the sweatshirt did!
B00BPCR712|1|The bill length is as &#34;billed&#34; - just fine - exactly what I wanted. However. the &#34;dome&#34; portion is far too small to keep this thing on my head even in the slightest breeze.  The problem is the hat does not pull down far enough on my head to reach below the back of my head-to neck joint where hats get a place to hold on.  The hat is OK for child-sized heads but not for adults.
B00B1T62HY|5|Supportive, awesome color, plenty long enough and I like that the straps are changeable. I crossed mine in back.
B004L8J0C6|5|I wear a shirt and tie every day for work.  I've been using this product for about three weeks now (that's about 18 different shirts).  I have yet to have a collar, that doesn't have a built in stay, that uses a size other than what came with this kit.  Also, while I rarely use magnets, these are magnetic (although you'll have to buy those separately).<br /><br />  Basically, this is a must have addition to any professionals wardrobe.  While most people won't recognize you are using them the effect it has on your collar (especially with a tie) is awesome!  They will looked pressed and professional all day long.<br /><br />  If you wear a shirt and tie to work BUY THIS PRODUCT!  There are others out there but this is the best bang for the buck that I have come across by far.
B00E8IFOD8|2|Somewhat large, the straps come loose and so does pouch. The waistband fits well, not to small or too large.
B0032FP0X2|3|I chose &#34;too small&#34;, but maybe it's &#34;too large&#34;?  I'm not sure what causes the problem... The problem is that in the attempt to have coverage, the cups go out to the side more, being wider-set (which I thought I needed), but I found that it touches and irritates my underarm area and decided that would drive me nuts.  I'm sending it back. Otherwise, it seems like a nicely-made quality bra. I like the styling in between the cups!  Sorry it didn't work out for me fit-wise....
B00CYM1AYC|1|isn't true to size. It's like five sizes smaller I gave it to my sister
B00BGCTA6G|5|Great fit
B00G8VS6D8|5|Love them!!!
B00PFHF30A|5|loves also
B002KABQR4|3|lower quality than i'd expected - but they work and meet the need.
B00OZRWRIC|5|Very happy with the item. Looks lovely on and we have one happy young lady.
B005OFLSM0|5|Good quality material. Good fit. Good wasteband. Will purchase this brand again. Much better than Hanes.
B00CZ7TXDG|3|Size is not accurate. It seems Playtex does not run true to size.
B00SDS82YM|5|Nice, classy and nice looking
B000E99JO0|5|The suspenders arrived brand new in plastic - I did not expect that :-). I am a Vet and these are just like the LBE/LCE suspenders I used to wear.
B006X9LGFK|5|Great shirt and my husband loves it! Fits beautiful
B00DUF76P4|5|This is a beautiful nightgown that got a &#34;WOW!&#34; from my husband. Just like the other Calvin Klein nightgowns, this runs a tad small. I love the length, I love the purple, the fabric is unbelievably soft, and the sheer places make it sexy while still keeping you covered up. And the best part is that because the neckline is straight (and fits kind of tight, like an elastic, but not at all irritable) it doesn't twist and turn and end up sideways on you in the night...which can be a problem, especially for the bustier ladies.
B004W3BB3Q|5|I bought these for my husband to replace his old Rusty's. The color is great and the material is soft. He loved his other ones and seems to love these too.
B00BULAJFO|5|but yeah, it looks good. lightweight old school baseball shirt. swell fit, with the hint of nostalgia.<br />volcom...knocked it out of the park.
B000WNOFJW|5|They were exactly what I was expecting....Love 'em..
B00DJVY1HA|4|Very thin..
B00IFICP1G|5|My Wife Loves it !!!
B0020HRYYG|5|These are light weight for summer wearing. good amount of cotton to fell comfortable. I would recommend these for working in.
B000H1OI14|1|how bout making a shirt that says \\"riot folk doesn't love the greedy sweatshop labor using putzes who are selling this shirt\\"?
B00DUWLICE|5|Good quality good product best customer service
B00YA23ALK|5|Bought this for my girlfriend as a surprise. Sizes run great. Delivery was fast. And she was thrilled. Super sexy dress for such a low price!
B0086SJ09U|5|I recently bought this item, the price is good, the quality of the product exceeded my expectations, I recommend it.
B002K8PKQE|5|Loved this product. We bought it for our son to use in the swimming pool. It sits comfy and my son looks happy in it. Washing is easy and it maintains it's integrity after a wash. The best thing it didn't cost me arm and leg. Would surly recommend it.
B00KPE507O|5|As expected nice jeans
B00124T7DY|5|The flower has good detail - lots of petals and interesting nuances of color.  It does not look cheaply made in person.  Very adorable and a great gift.
B00N3HV542|3|I believe these are a very good buy, however the large I ordered was much smaller & shorter than my well fitting large Russell sweat pants . I'm approx. 6'2&#34; & am 205lbs. My legs are fit yet not large. These pants would bind above the knee when stepping upwards.<br /><br />I didn't want to get caught up in ordering an XL and having it not fit, so I returned the item.
B0081BHBES|3|Great shirt, size was a little tight compared to other small size shirts.
B001GKU1AW|5|Great shirt for great price.  Has washed well so far, with no noticeable shrinkage.  You'll get lots of people asking you where you got it!
B002QR9GB4|5|This is a great belt at a great price!  It is the missing ingredient with my casual cargo pants to keep them up and me comfortable.  With solid, not flexible, belts I have to cinch up, and it is uncomfortable.  With this elastic stretch belt, the length is right, it fits perfectly, and it works to keep my pants up while not being too tight.  Looking good!
B0039V25V4|5|this is the best belt ive ever had. its my favorite style of belt, i like pandas, i like rasta colors, but what i LOVE is the quality of this thing. so comfortable and just great to wear. its truly hard to explain just exactly what this belt is like but its a must buy if you think it looks good. u will not regret it. i know its just a belt, but its a great belt! and great investments make me giddy, like this did.
B00TG2K03A|2|XXL top too small for 40c.
B000Q7887O|5|The product is as describe and looks great. Arrived in good condition. Well made and looks good. I would recomend it
B0056ZAR20|5|I got this product for my teenage son, he couldn't be happier, he said they arre very warm and  the quality of the sound is excellent
B0082MQOZS|4|This cloth made me really comfortable wearing especially it feels very smooth and light also it is easy to keep.
B00B12XUHG|2|Doesn't fit my wallet. I have a Rolfs credit card holder and this item is to large for the wallet itself.
B00B6E7GTM|5|It's hard for me to admit, but it's getting more and more difficult finding jeans that fit right now that I'm getting older :( ... Either they're too small (from the juniors section) or they make me look ten years older and I definitely don't need that. These jeans are right in the middle. I'm not constantly pulling them up cause they're too small or extra low rise and I'm comfortable at the same time. I like them... Might buy another pair :)
B003R7LD5Y|5|Just what I was looking for for an extra gift for my wife. Her experience with similar products has been good.
B009AMUTFU|3|had to send it back - too big - I love it but it doesn't look on me, like it looks on her. So difficult to buy a swimsuit on line - If I get large, its too small in some, and too big in others!  I could have used a small in this one.  I'm 5'3&#34; , 128 and very curvy.  Tough to know what will look good.
B00KBUFFQ8|5|Great jacket! Nice color and quality in general. Fit as expected!
B00J9IAIGK|5|This button down shirt is adorable on my 4 1/2 year old who weighs 42lbs & is 43inch tall. I always buy a size larger so he can wear things longer & this fit him well. He normally wears size xs in boys or 6T Jumping Bean brand, so the size 6 is perfect.
B00ENRS21U|5|love these shorts. very comfy.
B0018MMF8E|3|This pajama top is adorable. The material is thin and nice for summer. Any horse lover would really love the design. The price is a bit high but it is a unique product so that is probably why. I ordered the wrong size and had to send it back for another. They company was real nice but it took a very long time to come the first and second time.
B008Q0E61U|5|Attractive tie bars, and enough different designs to cover all occasions.
B00LFL2GXW|2|Would fit a child or an extremely Pattie woman. Also one of the rhinestones was fallen off when it came in.
B0007CKMZY|5|Nice Jeans at a good price.
B009GKAZ6E|5|I bought this for my niece's birthday and mainly for a head start on school shopping but she loved it and I have to say it is pretty cute! If i were still in school i would use it for sure!
B009S65BTW|4|I was quite pleased with my purchase. The fit was good and the price was right!
B00F5BI5QU|3|This is a nice product. The touchscreen feature works, it allows you to use your smartphone easily.<br />However, these gloves are not suited for extreme winters/cold conditions. They are quite thing and I would not recommend for really cold weather. Otherwise, a nice product
B003EH3YKY|5|Good quality and proper sizing on this t-shirt a lot of times they seam to be a little to small
B00ANSXVY6|5|Received it much earlier than expected. Wife loves it and wears it proudly. Made her day when she got it.
B00JXMBCJ4|5|Fit was as expected. Light weight yet warm and the color was great.
B0046HJYSC|5|The tie is made out of thick material, so it feels substantive when you tie and wear it. Serves its purpose and yes, use the simple skinny tie knot.
B00ESVMX8Y|5|Wow, excellent quality and styling! For the price, you would've thought we paid much more than we did. Side note: my son is a semi-large 4 year old (80th percentile for height), and we purchased this tie in the 4-7 yr old size. The tie does hang a little lower than we were hoping, but nothing 6 months of growth won't fix! ;)
B00305CBGI|5|I bought several of these for gifts. My teen boys loved them. Great quality, great belt.
B005PQPLG2|3|I thought by increasing the waist size I could enjoy this fit even without the stretch waistband.  I was wrong.  These are too small and I intend to return them for a suitable size.
B006NU7C84|5|Very cute on, comfortable and the belt is actually a keeper.  I normally do not like these belts, but this one is really pretty and not cheap looking.
B00CH38QMC|2|Sent it back for refund which was quickly applied to my account.  It was very form fitting and I would not recommend to anyone heavy.
B00HGRIG4W|5|Nice shirt, well made, durable fabric.
B00RT3KR22|5|love it.
B000XFZ4NA|4|I got lots of complements about the blazer. It was a great buy and a great color. Although I will not be able to wear it until October, it was a great out of season buy for a bargain shopper like me...
B001W9032S|5|Put a white ribon on and it was perfect for a wedding in the sun.
B00GGGLZ74|5|all right, thank you very much
B000N8X5NS|5|This is the 3rd or 4th pair of Dickies I've bought from Amazon and each pair has been great both in terms of fitting properly and being well made. Really see no reason to buy jeans anywhere else.
B00473Y0E8|5|I love this hat, it is well built and comfortable. The sizing runs smaller than the kangol hats that I have but I like the Christys better....it has quickly become my favorite.
B00KTY7W1C|3|I outgrew my daughter and that the selected size was big for her .
B00OVY46IS|5|This bra fit so well when I tried it on! And it's quite comfortable too. It's super cute like Victoria's Secret but at an affordable price
B007KF1U8Y|5|These fit great on my son.  I love them they last a long time for a growing boy.  Thank you
B00DCN2WPS|3|They are very slippery material and the wire on the inside is twisted in the middle. I also only got 9 in my order and there was supposed to be 10.
B00FS7OX8K|5|Looks awesome on her and fits awesome, win win. Very sexy and flatters in the right ways, wish it came with stockings too.
B009Z3X20S|5|High quality! Pretty expensive but it really is one of a kind. I have to force my daughter to wear other hoodies while I was this one. Speaking of washing, it stands up well to multiple washes! Would buy again!
B004HO6MIY|5|I love the shirt, but it runs a little small. I would recommend this shirt to anyone. Just order a size larger.
B00CAAJA2W|5|I bought these for my daughter to send off to her at college.  These are her favorite jeans and she finally wore out her old pair.  She looks great in them.
B002NUWYTA|5|I just bought this dress. I was hesitant to buy from metrostyle based on some of the reviews for other items but this dress was inexpensive and I thought I would just try and see what happens.  I bought the size 8. I am 5'7\\" tall and 140 pounds so I was just guessing the size and got lucky with the size 8, the fit is perfect! Hugs me in all the right places, my 19 year old daughter was just blown away at the fit of the dress on me.  I will be buying again.
B00K17NEIC|4|My grand baby loves her Dora pj's. And I thank you for that.
B005FNB88K|1|Terrible fit--not very stretchy/giving. Too long
B001LIS1TW|5|Great robe...pockets , and attached belt. Everything I wanted in a robe and comfortable to boot . It is a great material....not too hot and not too cool just the right weight material . It also washes and dries like a dream. You have my absolute recommendation for this robe.
B00DWYAQF0|4|Good quality pants - but seems to run on the smaller side; for a 3T, these are pretty tight on my 2 year old.
B004CFYQPY|4|Fitted as expected
B00IP6G6W2|5|Great Deal
B011A9OPZU|4|I had a little trouble getting the shirt on, I had to tug and pull it to get it all the way on, but it was smooth sailing after that.  The shirt stayed down all day, no riding up, which was really nice.  The fit was snug, but comfortable, even sitting or lying down.  But, most important, was the way I looked when I put my regular shirt on over it!  I looked trimmer, firmer.  Like I had more tone and muscle which was just what I hoped for.  An added bonus was the ability of my skin to breathe so there was no heavy sweating underneath to cause problems. I love this shirt.  The next one I buy will be black!
B00HA7FM5Y|5|Adorable 2 piece outfit set. I ordered 5 other two piece sets at the same time as this one and when they arrived me and my fiancé both agreed this was the cutest of the ones we bought. Liked it so much we dressed our little girl in it for her springtime pictures at daycare. Pants were a good fit (not to tight or short) and the top (unlike many other little girl tops) was actually long enough that it didnt expose her mid-drift. Top is a thin material would suggest for warm weather or a onesie underneath when worn in cooler weather.
B00UF809S0|5|This is my 4th puchase of Sakkas blouses. This one is by far the most eye catching. Love the weight of the garment in this hot weather! Can't go wrong here ladies
B00L1RQ686|5|This product has a great chevron-paisley combination. Colors are vivid, size just perfect (I am 5-8&#34;). The fabric is not see-through and is stretchy enough to fit the curves of the body.
B00E879OGM|4|I'm a prepregnancy size small and have gained a &#34;normal&#34; amount of weight, almost all in the belly - this dress fit pretty tightly across the belly and butt, so I probably would prefer a size M. The color is more olive green than the picture.
B00OV3R5YQ|5|Great
B00S8J9GR8|5|Love this shirt! Good quality, fits well.
B0007YRA7U|2|The cup size was too large.  I could have fit a couple more breasts in it.
B00GNR4JGU|5|I really like this shawl, it hangs nicely, fits well with lots of room, it's a simple throw on that makes any outfit look a little nicer and it's small and easy to carry for days when I'll be out into the evening and need to throw on something warmer. Glad I bought it.
B00HD7FNDW|1|When I got it ,I found it a little small and the first day I was wearing, the thread broken at front chest which was really embarrassing...
B000OAZBZU|5|Goof
B005SZFAN4|5|Not sure what sizing people expect, but these were 100% as expected for a loose fit. Same quality as you always expect from Dickies.
B00PG3O1DI|5|Cute hat!
B00E96AYZC|5|what I needed
B000PHN5T6|2|The material is very cheap and loses elasticity quickly-the material around fly fly especially... my guy has been jumpin out of there all day.
B003WOL15E|2|The size of the shirt is too big and the sleeves are too wide.<br />Actually, you can see it in the picture...
B00JJ8MLYC|5|I love this jacket and I get a lot of compliments on it too!! Great fit, great price, perfect!
B00LCISXIK|4|This top is such a beautiful material with white embossed stitching. I read other reviews that stated it was not well made but thought I wouldn't have that problem... Wrong. The top stitching around the neck came out on the first wearing - so disappointing. It would be perfect had the stitching been done with a little better quality. &#60;sigh&#62;
B00HDA35FC|5|They are a good fit on a newborn baby who weighs 6-7 pounds.  I don't know how long they will fit, but the whole point was to find hats small enough for these first few weeks/months, and this set was great for that.
B007A0PM4C|4|They look and feel fabulous!
B008LY1TD4|5|Great gift
B00BS2CNN6|1|The shirt was not an American Size Large, I ended up giving it to a friend, it would have been fine otherwise
B00EZCVIXM|4|This swimsuit is very flattering. It is extremely heavy though, a lot of fabric. So, it can be quite constricting on extremely hot days.
B006SFRMJS|4|Nice leggings. Fit well.
B008JY1G1G|5|I was looking for a down filled black coat that would be warm and comfortable but not make me look all puffed up.  This coat is just that.  Lightweight but yet still warm and is very cute.  The hood is perfect for the English weather.  Highly recommend.
B00GS7NUZ6|5|I received this jacket quickly, and it is nearly exactly what I was looking for. The extra large collar is very attractive and different. I'm not a huge fan of woven cuffs and waist bands, but because the color is true Navy Blue, and it fits perfectly and the collar makes it unique, I love this jacket! If I need another faux leather jacket in other colors, I will definitely try this seller first. Thank-you for a smooth purchase, quick delivery and a very good price.
B005PQQ8EG|5|Comfortable and a good fit. They're Dockers and they should fit properly or you bought the wrong size!
B005C82NGE|1|I bought the original at sears, but this one isn't the same quality. It was misshaped after 2 months. Don't waste your money.
B00HFF76DM|5|Item arrived on time and it is what I wanted.
B003L1E2YA|3|This is such a cool design. I mean, it's the MOON. I love how slim it is, and all of the pockets are well-placed and perfectly sized.<br /><br />Also, it's quite durable--it's been hanging in there for months now.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it really looks like it's made from paper. People keep asking me if it's handmade.<br /><br />All in all, I don't regret this purchase, but I think I'll look for a more expensive one next time.
B00B3HV3SW|5|I purchased this nursing bra for my daughter when she was 6 months pregnant. She absolutely loved it! The fabric is soft and seamless. The fit was perfect. This is a high quality nursing bra and wouldn't purchase any other brand!
B007U3IZOS|2|The sizing of this costume is off, by a lot. The product details claim this is for a size 2-8, I figured it would be about a 6. Not the case. I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 34B and this costume was falling off of me. Obviously had to return!
B00N72YBZ8|4|very much like the feel of the fabric, colour and style are flattering
B00KC2UAUQ|5|Beautiful dress!
B005N85KWC|4|Perfect for wearing to the pool to workout.  Size was accurate.  I like it on my husband who uses it mostly at the rec. center pool.
B00HFE5KZ4|1|Rolls up
B00JB8PD04|5|very nice and young,but leather jacket's size have larger than my shoulder size. Infact that i swear i have carefully measured
B00470LLNO|1|The very first day the clip broke off and they did not hold my childs pants up the clips are cheap and junk. Walmat may not have as many colors but at least they work!<br />[[ASIN:B00470LKAI Mens / Womens One Size Suspenders Adjustable - (Various Neon Colors)]]
B007VDOJK6|5|Love these socks
B004ALRAJO|5|DELEIVERED FAST JUST AS ORDERED
B005JI1V38|5|Will order larger size next time.  Have no problem with the quality, etc.  Fast shipment.
B00BGWXZ76|2|The construction seems fine, and it has a substantial one directional stretch width-wise (it can be stretched about 50% wider than at rest). (It does not stretch at all length-wise.)  But I do not like the artificial feel of its 100% polyester fabric,  Next time I'll make sure to get at least 60% cotton in the flannel.
B004LLHFS4|2|I loved the old style of this camisole called \\"one fabulous body.\\" It had it's shortcomings as well - it was a bit short.<br /><br />But this camisole is pretty horrible. The cups have way too much padding. I'm already big enough, thank you!<br /><br />As an FYI, I remove the underwire from all of these camisoles. I don't need it, can't stand it. And with this camisole, it's certainly not needed. Stiff, uncomfortable. Ugh.<br /><br />Bring back the old style!
B00O46T6XS|5|Great quality, fast shipping! Thank you from California!
B008RPMPCQ|3|It got the job done but it is a little on the cheap side. For one it does not look all nicely waved like the picture. The pearl embellishment fall off as there is barley any glue to keep them on. The lined seam was frayed on some areas and the packaging it comes in makes it very wrinkly. I read in other reviews to just steam it and bring it in the bathroom with me when I shower....that didn't work the few times I did it so I finally put the iron on super low and went to work, it got the job done.
B00GBC8NNC|5|Love this hat on my son! Great quality!
B0038M1XYO|4|My daughter is not in dance but loves to pretend. I got this on sale and she is really thrilled with it. The fabric is substantial and can take a good stretching while she puts it on by herself, unlike the \\"play\\" versions that snag and tear.  She didn't care that there were no sequins and no glitter like the play versions have; she felt like a real dancer, she said.  And the fabric is also very soft and breathable.  I took away one star because I HATE to hand wash clothes.  I should have noticed that before I bought, but overall I don't regret the purchase. I do think that if I put it in a lingerie bag on the delicate cycle then laid it flat to dry it would probably be fine.
B00E5PYCUA|5|The Tshirt is soft and cute, looks vintage. My son loves to wear it and he gets lots of compliments about it when we hit the park.
B0027APHCC|1|The picture about Lennon must be use better material ...better quality ....<br />Let it be... expensive .. But let it be the best...<br />Have a good business ....
B00IFDBEDQ|5|Nice product. Does what it says.
B00JE5317Q|4|Good quality. . Fits well..... doesn't bind in the shoulders!
B006X4ERKQ|5|Bought this for my husband who is a mechanic. He needed something that wouldn't scratch cars as leaned over the motor. He loves it wears it every day. Fits right and comfortable.
B00JPPN4WW|4|We used this as a costume for my son for Halloween!! Much cheaper and reusable versus the suit.
B00BW20ZV4|5|She loved it.
B00IKVTY58|4|Easy to wear and use. Parts are user friendly and durable.
B00KSFDN9W|5|Everything turned out as expected.  The sweater was even delivered a day earlier then anticipated.  Overall a very well made product, from what seems like a stand up company.  These elves kept it crunchy in milk.
B008DS5B9G|2|These look cool and stylish, but they stink, literally. They are very thin and I have large feet (size 13 shoe) so that doesn't help, they feel more like nylon than a comfortable dress sock, and they do not hold in odor. So after walking in them for a few hours, your feet will start to smell bad!
B00MMZ9AR0|5|The dress is beautiful on.  Fits perfectly.  True to size.
B00SFHVJRI|2|The suit was cute but very small. This is NOT for a tall person, or anyone that is well endowed.
B00M3ESR0Q|5|VERY NICE QUALITY...
B00EY6I2K6|3|The shoe is as described, but too narrow in the ball of the foot area.  This is not a fault of the shoe, I have arthritis in my feet and often encounter this situation.
B00GY8OKCQ|3|I love it, is exactly what I wanted, i love it, i love it, i love it came in perfect condition
B002R5A6L4|4|They stay on and look cute.    What more do you want in a pair of leg warmers?
B00CQHMVZM|5|Awesome color and great styling for this hoodie. Fit just as expected so no problems there. All around great hoodie for the little guy.
B00152RS5C|2|VERY disappointed in this sweatshirt.    I gave it as a gift to a new \\"big sister\\", and deliberately selected a sweatshirt rather than a tee shirt because the recipient lived in Alaska and needed something warm.      When it arrived,I was shocked at how thin it was. VERY lightweight.  NOT what I expect from something labeled \\"Sweatshirt\\".  It was not returnable because I had personalized the gift with the new Big Sister's name.    I tried to rectify the problem by buying a pink turtleneck t-shirt to wear under the sweatshirt, but it still wasn't heavy enough to meet my needs.  Or rather, to provide adequate warmth for an Alaskan winter.    This sweatshirt should not be considered where warmth is required.    The design itself was cute, and  the recipient enjoyed the image which looked something like herself.  (You are able to select hair color and style to be used on the shirt's image.  The company that offers this sweat shirt sends the purchaser an email wherein you are able to select certain features to be included in the image: hair color, hair style)  I appreciated the ability to personalize this shirt.    Had I known how light weight this sweatshirt actually was, I'd not have purchased it.  It almost seemed a misnomer to call it a \\"Sweatshirt\\", in my opinion.    Knowing what I now know about the quality of this shirt, I would not buy another.
