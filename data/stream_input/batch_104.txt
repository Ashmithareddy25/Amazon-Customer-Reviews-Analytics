B00B1HJ584|5|good  prefect nice  but just little big better<br /><br />Thank you<br />Gaetan
B00KS1RUFY|5|Good product. Exactly as advertised.
B00R6RQCB6|4|Mirror is the correct size; however the adhesive is approximately .375 inches too small (.188&#34; per side). Hopefully, the mirror does not fall off within 3 years.
B005345DOQ|5|Perfect for those cold morning rides to work helps keep you warm but not so thick it feels weird in ur helmet or makes ur head sweat
B00BGUMF9W|4|Easy to install
B00UXX0CL6|1|the description says 60/40 split but it is NOT!  It's a cover for a solid bench.  The quality looks good otherwise, I just wish it would fit.
B00KRJ8MWC|5|love it
B006DYNVTE|5|These were about the only spark plugs I could find for my 2011 Honda CR-V.<br />I replaced the OEM plugs which had about 80K miles and the engine seems to run smoother afterwards so I am pleased with these.
B010JRGG7Y|5|Different style but nice
B00BAZBYTU|5|perfect
B000KZ069K|5|Came fast and worked wonderfully
B0030DKDY2|4|Fast shipping and very easy to install.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Worked excellently! My beautiful tan leather booties were splashed with a drink and looked terrible. The cleaner worked perfectly and the shoes look brand new!!
B000E4VC86|5|Good product. Works and fits perfectly. Does not come with the three securing nuts.
B00N1YNRAW|4|Feel kinda cheap but are actually holding up .. Not bad
B009W85YTI|5|It's good but my seat backs are split so that does create a bit of an issue when accessing the back seat.
B001S8G8Q8|5|I was dealing with always cold on the passenger side and always hot in the rear. This only took a 1/2 hour and really easy to install. Take out the lower trim below glove box and take out the glove box. You will see it in the upper left, unclip electrical connector, remove 2 bolts and remove. Just do a reverse for installation. Part worked great and was at least 50 dollars cheaper on Amazon. Really happy with my purchase.
B009DK3P9G|5|Fit perfectly
B005C2PT2K|5|Beautiful just like the picture had it for 3monthe and it's still good as new !!!
B0041LN1L4|5|GOOD !!!!
B001C3XD0S|5|It was just as advertised. Just what I wanted. Fit perfectly.
B00TDG54UI|1|2 cheap fall off my car 1 hour later got ran over waste of money
B0079RUMNW|5|Exceptional quality & received sooner then expected - seller highly recommended will definitely buy more decals.
B00032KC30|5|Great product
B00P9OEZR6|2|I personally don't like this product. I have a black car with good paint and this product leaves my car looking like oil has been smeared on the surface. I love Meguiar's products but I'd skip this one.
B001TAPLYA|4|Great product very easy to install.
B00APOCMCK|5|The License Frame looks great on my Vette. I love the fact it's made of metal, not plastic. It really adds to the look of the car.
B0075VU64M|5|Item as described and prompt shipping
B007GCEKLU|4|The original battery installed by Verizon lasted only a short time. I suspect they installed a used or returned battery rather than a new one. This one I bought here has already lasted longer than the &#34;original&#34; defective or used battery from Verizon.  Time will tell!
B00NNY6I4C|5|👍
B00SXGB2UU|5|Got to use this in my shoei J-cruiser. The temp was 33* the altitude was almost 11,000ft (beartooth pass) heading south. No fog where the outside shield was covered even though my breath was making moisture below the pinlock. True 5 star product highly recommend for rain or low temps!!
B00NM5U52S|5|boyfriend loves it! tows a call up a trailer easily too
B00QXUFCAY|3|As bright as my HID!!
B001G7E4KS|5|Perfect fit and easily installed. And you can't be Toyota quality. I intend to drive my FJ until it just won't go &#34;no mo&#34; so I think I may just by a 6-pk so I have them on hand.
B00062YUUS|5|Very good
B00GG9FBKS|5|I love this stuff. It makes washing a car so much quicker and easier. This stuff is just great.
B00M0DHCJC|2|Says &#34;Chrome&#34; which I guess it &#34;is&#34;, but I was assuming it was chrome plated metal.  Nope, it is chrome plastic.
B000HAEPAO|4|Worked out ok for what I needed
B00NQ8FD4G|5|JEFF FROM BURIEN WASHINGTON IS A &#34;BOSS&#34;
B00C6AXFPY|5|great product!!
B007V2D07U|5|nice piece, fits good keeps the sun out
B00LV6JNDW|5|Arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for! The covers are really soft and stay on well. I got this for my 2012 Prius C and the steering wheel cover was extremely uncomfortable and too big, but otherwise great!
B00KCQSOAA|5|Perfect fit, and really easy to install. I especially like the steering wheel cover!!
B0068TYFFS|3|Advertised as white background, but was only the black, no background to it.
B004F04Q4M|2|Like the item but did break after about a month.
B005G9CN3C|5|Plenty of bulbs to pick from in the kit!
B000OEFT9Y|5|Just what I needed
B000UVUAFO|4|buffs out nicely!
B00OUM8GLY|5|Perfect for my four-door 2000 Volvo.  Takes a while to get the hang of closing it up, but once you master it, it's a breeze and wont' be flopping it around at the front seat passenger's face.<br />Also perfect by keeping the dashboard sun free and damaging.
B001551IKU|5|Durable plate. Great value. I bought 2.
B00J2Y1C0W|4|Beware the shield is really close to your mouth so it fogs up in an instant!  My last helmet never fogged up this easily.
B00T0TYZRQ|5|love it
B002FDGTD2|5|Got this for my 2007 Yamaha R6.<br />Super easy install and looks fantastic.<br /><br />Sound wise (stock headers and cat): on the initial startup, you'll notice it's just a little bit louder. More importantly, it has a great low end tone to it that gives the bike a more aggressive sound.<br />Taking off, I also noticed some nice differences from the stock exhaust in that it brings some of that low end growl when you first get going.<br />And as always, it screams in the infamous top end.<br /><br />Overall the product was constructed well and seamlessly integrates itself with the design of the bike.
B000FZXJSA|5|Useful clips. Nice seller.
B00ZU1FYGY|1|If I could rate 0, I would. It is a cheap knock off and isn't the right size to fit the whole grill. About half an inch too small on all sides. Leaves a gap between the grill and the frame. Don't waste your money. It's a scam. 96 BMW 328i sedan. E36
B000SBCHCA|5|Works fine just long enough
B000HAEPAO|4|a little lighter guage than expected. However may do the job
B0041QEZ6E|5|Some states require you to light your tag. These do that and more without any modifications. I have mine also wired to my blinkers to increase visibility when turning.
B00I2Y01LO|5|This works for window seats, but does not fit the center seat
B004O844DS|4|I am going to review the rack and the mounting brackets separately, also I am keeping in mind the price I paid for the quality of product that I received.<br />Rack 4 out of 5 stars<br />I bought the rack and the extension.  The rack and the extension are very nice and sturdy.  I found it very easy to assemble, all hardware was there and they even supply the allen wrench so i didnt have to go dig in my toolbox for one.  The welds look ok,  the finish also looks just OK.  I feel that in a year or two, I might have to refinish it.  Overall, for the price, this is a great rack, very good value.  We will see how it holds up to the abuse I have planned for it.<br />Mounting brackets 2 out of 5 stars<br />Keeping in mind the following:  It is very difficult to design a universal rack mounting system that is going to fit every single crossbar on the market nicely.  I am not judjing them on that, I think they did a good enough job.  My main concern is the weakness of the u-bolts that were provided.  I believe the ubolts are 6mm in diameter which is slightly smaller than 1/4&#34;.  They should deffinitely beef this up to at least 5/16&#34; diameter.  It seems to hold the rack up nicely, but I dont feel its bomb proof, i can imagine traveling down the freeway at 65mph or faster with a loaded rack, I just dont think those ubolts cut it.<br />Specific Vehicle Mounting - 1999 Jeep Cherokee XJ Classic<br />Again, I understand that designing a mounting system to fit universally does not mean it will fit perfectly for my vehicle.  In my case the classic Cherokee has factory cross bars that are low profile, very slim.  This meant that the u bolts were not only too long, but the threads did not go as far down as I needed them.<br />The solution was to cut off the excess threads and use washers to shim up the nut.  See picture.  With the right tools, this was very simple, just a little extra time and effort.<br />I should note that i did not even bother with the thumb nuts, but I wasable to separate the plastic, from the actual nuts, then I was able to use the nuts and bolted them in with a socket.
B0000AXQPA|5|A little time consuming installing due to the large hole you have to cut....be prepared to cut a hole double the size of a regular head unit....great product though....has some sticky foam on the bottom to stabilize the head unit and cushion....great idea!! Very satisfied!
B000PUFN8E|5|I use this for keeping my motorcycle key on my key ring but able to pull of when riding. Quickly accessible and doesn't increase the bulk of the ring greatly.
B000RNW5O4|5|Appears sturdy. Works well and was easy to install, once I purchased the appropriate torc wrench.
B00G7X5BVM|5|Best car wax ever. Made my black car look like glass
B00KL3ALGO|5|I bought this product to shade the front passenger side of my SUV's.  Traveling home from NC 2-weeks ago on the Interstate was extremely uncomfortable for my wife due to the afternoon sun as we drove south.  Both of my SUV's (Hyundai and Volvo) have blind-spot awareness systems that require a clear view of the passenger side-view mirror and the Sun Shade leaves plenty of clear space to see.  I was also concerned with how they would fit with the slanting of the roof/windows but the smaller size fit very well.  I would not recommend using them during in-city driving as they cause a slight waviness when looking straight through the Sun Shade but for Interstate travel I believe it will be great since lane change is the only reason to look out the side window.  As noted there's plenty of visual space to see the side-view mirror.  These shades cost a few dollars more than others and it was reviews dealing with &#34;customer service&#34; that influenced my decision.  The other reason for choosing this product was that they did not require suction cups or other connectors to attach to the window.  These attached flat, smooth and tightly and came off just as quick (and can be stored in the pouch for storage in the vehicle seat-back.)  Thanks Enovoe, I look forward to your other products!
B0017OCROA|5|I wrote a review shortly after receiving this cover as the fit and construction were great. After two seasons in the summers sun the water resistance  of the top of the cover are gone. The black upper part is faded to grey and is no longer holding the water out. My Harley doesn't see winter outside but the summer it's in the driveway. Looking for a spray waterproof to extend the life. Believe me I have no regret about buying this cover. It is well worth the money.
B0036UI2QA|1|I got this product on 6 aug and i put it in my car on 9aug. First 2-3 days, the smell was little too much and I was not liking it.<br />Then, 2 days back- I realized there is no fragrance of at all. It is gone! It is a waste money and I will wait for 1-2 more days and if it still does not work, I am sending this back. Disappointing!
B005HAYDR4|5|Love these handles!
B00KJGPN2K|3|Spekers are bad had to replace it with a different one
B00M1URMZ8|5|Ordered, came in on time, and works like it is supposed to
B00SXE4GI2|5|Out of the box, the cover survived 6 days at the open airport parking lot in SW Florida. I used the cable but wasn't sure the cover would still be covering my car when I returned. Hooray it did! Well done and thanks!
B0091DJWV0|5|I have used it twice. I am a recently retired Tech (over 40 years wrenching). I bought it for its SRS and ABS capability. It found the problem in a GMC stabilitrac system using the ABS checker.. This is very nice. Although not professional grade it works very well and the build quality is good.<br />Great Value!!!!!!!
B005TB7ES6|2|Good quality shade but awful adhesive.<br /><br />Installed it and put the window up for 36 hours. They fell out.
B009D1GQQO|5|it was excellent it had everything I needed to rebuild my carbs.
B009EAAV7O|5|Came very quickly, easy to install - perfect!!
B00DQJ8T00|1|Did not fit, adapters are junk.
B00AG39RRS|5|Came as promised. Didn't fix my problem though, found out the battery was shot  even though it was a couple months old. 2004 545i.
B004MAPD8S|4|This stuff works great! Follow the directions and it does what its supposed to. I spilled a black cup of coffee on the antique couch I recently reupholstered but had treated  with this product and it beaded up and rolled off like mercury! Great stuff!
B000BV01CK|5|WORKS GREAT
B00JBIX85G|5|Arrived on time and fit perfectly!!!
B00IVPA4FM|4|Well-crafted, but weird fit (looser than I'd like). Pinky through middle fingers fit fine, but pointer finger is 3/4 inch too long. :/
B004VQM4OE|3|Be aware, the product is not as pictured.  It seems research has shown almost all CAI are the same.  I chose this one because of the Banks name and reputation, and also because I loved the raised white letters on the air box, &#34;banks Ram-Air&#34;,  I though gave it the edge in the choice. Be aware there is raised letters but they are black not white and completely blend into the black air box so the pictures are not correct.  Product was simple installation, not very rugged when installed, the air box is held by 3 metal studs that allow a lot of movement.
B00UEMH5L6|1|The inserts fit perfectly just be sure to align them the proper way before removing the red tape and placing them. Also wipe down the grill with rubbing alcohol before placing them to ensure the adhesive sticks properly. My only complaint is that the inserts do block airflow to the ambient air temperature sensor enough to make a 5-8° on a hot Arizona day.    Edit: Engine was overheating and couldn't make it up long hills on the highway without getting dangerously hot. We're hard to remove but now they are gone and in the trash. Would not buy.
B008O9DV78|5|Really great and useful product.  Well constructed and easy to use... just read the instructions and if you're still not sure then watch a couple of the You Tube videos on it.  Just make sure that the backflow preventer is reinstalled correctly in case it falls out... it's just a couple of washers.  Mine came out when I undid the package.  I added a regular hose washer to the backflow preventer assembly when I put it back together... don't know if they forgot to include it or not, but not a big deal and works perfect.  Anyway, was easy enough to reassemble and works as it should.  Really simple to operate and much better than a wand or a hose inside the camper.<br /><br />Before I bought it I read quite a few reviews on it... some were negative.  I really wonder if those folks read the instructions or took the time to figure out how to work it right.  It's not something you can just ram and jam... take your time and do it right and you will be very satisfied!
B000N37CUK|5|Used it spark plug cylinder nuts on camry 96. Worked as expected for the job and quality is reasonable. On par with other brands like craftsman.
B005HIOMVI|5|Awesome!!!! I like the added height and it worked perfectly! Will use it many times over!
B00QLDDC50|5|Luv my kitty sticker
B005HITDEE|1|The cargo carrier was scuffed up, leaving raw metal exposed so I am expecting rust to come unless I paint it. The weld was so thick where it folds that I could not fold it so I had to hammer it in. The cross sopport was difficult to assemble as the hole was bent. The quality control was lacking greatly.
B007OW603I|5|Fits perfectly.....replaced in seconds
B000ALIS5S|5|Excellent. As good as OEM
B0002MBQUY|5|This product is well made and reasonably priced. Installation is easy for anyone to do!
B00439WBUG|5|Although I have not yet used them, they appear to be of good quality. The case is very nice quality. Product was delivered quickly and item was accurately described.
B00G3INDUW|5|This is a good winch it does reel good for me. It has a lot of pull power .I like it.
B00AYXM4DY|5|As professional detailers I must admit this is one of the best products in its class. We use it to make our customers black trim pop. It takes some seriously harsh chemicals to wash this stuff off!  We order it in bulk. Customers love it!
B00X4SGJYG|5|Everything went very smooth with the installation
B00OOJGJCQ|1|Terrible. dont buy. I installed it and as i was in 3rd gear it came offff...its glued down!!! Definitely not safe!!!  Im eyond pissed off
B00KGIE0F2|3|bought this as a spare. price was reasonably. shipping was prompt.
B00681BFJU|5|Awesome product will buy again
B00DSSNPSU|3|Good
B000C57W6S|5|If budget allows always use moog
B00771YXQ2|5|Fit perfectly! My mechanic even said the price beat his discounts! It even came a day or 2 early.. I'm extremely happy!
B00DQ9T8BO|5|Used as a resonator perfect
B001I1GFRC|5|thanks! just what I wanted
B00317223W|5|highly recommend the sproket change, man what a differance in ride and mileage, DO IT!
B004V9T4EE|5|I wonder if they have good gasket for multiple downcomer the exhaust from a truck trailblazer 2004
B00HPZELZ8|5|worked like it  you would expect it to
B0060HVFO2|5|Works very well on scuffs and scratches
B002PQW6NG|5|The headlamps were easy to install without any tools other than some pliers to pull up the red snap down for the electrical connection.  My warning light went out after replacingbut I never had the xenon lights from the factory.
B000BW8VW6|1|When I opened the box found two already with little dents. Figured it's not a show car I will install them anyways well that was were it all went south two fit all four rims just fine the third one well not so much. But at least it dented all to hell when I was trying to put it on. That's when I just gave up put them back in the box and got to repaint the rims I just painted.and no hub caps on my car. I know lucky me.
B00GJDTZQ2|5|He loves old Beetles like this one, he wants to eventually buy it!
B00P2C9ZP2|4|Great switch, solved the issue I had with my 2009 Passat Wagon 2.0T.<br />Easy install after removing fuse cover and then being able to easily get to the switch.<br />After a year the switch illumination failed when changing vehicle battery. Got another switch.<br />Recommended!
B006FP632S|5|Just what we wanted for our 95 year old
B00NLN8A6O|4|Arrived on time although the box was destroyed hardware was laying in the box gaurds has chips gauges was also bent at the body mount point that caused problems called extream terrain and they refunded me 10%. All in all on the jeep it looks great I'm happy with it.
B001GC2LVM|4|only use this only first time was a over shot had to try one more time it went well if it go that well next time it will be great
B000AS3D3S|5|Quality I would expect from an original equipment supplier.
B008TXHZ58|5|The perfect thing for seeing what's behind me.  Well worth the money
B00PFQDNBC|5|They fit my 2003 bmw 320i. and work good.
B00FO6Y1D2|5|This is one of our BEST purchases from Amazon. We put on each side of my car and the back to let people know my teenager is driving. We get a lot of laughs when people see them. At the moment we are teaching 3 to drive so it makes it even funnier when they see our faces with these on the vehicle. We recommend for ANYONE learning to drive.
B0042D0V78|5|work good for my 2003 bmw 320i
B004I0P4FO|5|This unit is a fantastic replacement for the water-logged and rusted unit on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee. I was amazed that I was able to find this product on Amazon Prime. It arrived quickly, installed easily, the wiring harness matched that of my Jeep, and it looks great. Nice to have clean and operable fog lights and for a very reasonable price. I was very satisfied with the quality of this unit.
B000S2SKIY|5|Fit perfect, done in less than 15 minutes.
B00G6IRHQU|5|Good price and fast shipping
B001RLXDYQ|5|Have about 5,000 miles on them, so far completely uneventful. I replaced the stock platinum plugs with these after the engine started stuttering badly on steeper inclines around our house. Its apparent immediately that the car is much happier using these than what was in it to begin with. Didn't seem to increase gas mileage (I'd hoped they would) but running better is sure to be better for the life of the engine.
B00KYH9O5Q|5|Lights are bright and the colors are vibrant and easily distinguishable. The color change mechanism works well. The company itself provides amazing customer support. Great product
B009IHQSTS|5|very nice belts, no different then th more expensive ones
B0095TD5S6|5|As advertised....thanks
B00A1XGR4E|5|As described.
B000OZS9Y0|5|Put them on my center console boat, works great
B0068G08NY|5|Came with everything that I needed to replace the factory ones on my Polaris 525IRS Outlaw. No issues. Shipped and delivered quickly!
B00DOS0K2I|4|Not the highest quality but does work great with NanoSkin pads or sanding pads
B001J0Z8XO|5|as advertised  arrived faster than estimated
B00A8MZ7IA|5|super nice, plush cloths. great for cleaning any surface. Especially where you want a streak-free shine. I use them on all sorts of projects and around the house.
B00B1E4SKM|5|This remote is great.<br />I'm very happy with it.<br />I did the installation in less than 10 seconds.<br />I'll definitely buy more products with this guys.
B000F0WZ1C|5|Very happy, perfect fit, fast delivery, good price.....what more could you ask for??
B00Y20MMUA|5|arrived sooner than expected, part fit works flawless, very happy with purchase
B00LSYVZB0|3|Works great, the fit isn't the best with my Hilux though.
B009WAAQ7G|1|Beware!  I bought this product specifically because it claimed to include an AC charger that would work with a Nuvi 2559LMT.  IT DOES NOT!  When I plugged the charger into the Nuvi, the Nuvi displayed a warning that the cable would NOT charge the Nuvi.
B00B0DGRAS|5|Love them
B0009XQUK2|3|Good for really small systems but not for larger systems like automobiles.
B004ZA0J4I|1|Didnt even closely fit like described. Cheap rubber broke when lightly touched. Product had multiable dents. Waste of money!
B00J4PGY5W|5|Excellent product at reasonable price and shipping cost was extremely reasonable to Hawaii.
B00FP0G5EK|5|I have used these looms on everyone one of may extended families cars. 4+ at this time. Simple easy and none have failed. Some vehicles do not require the harness but I like using a relay system to protect the older cars. Plus, its easier to run the wires!
B00BCRMB34|1|Poor quality don't buy, everything ripped
B00CQ44I42|5|Fit perfect, fast and easy install 2 hrs max.
B006ZVMZA6|4|this was a tight fit on my 93 grand cherokee (v8) and requires you to twist the hose quite a bit.  The stock one had the same bend in it.  I'm sure there's a good reason for it, but it seems like a straight shot would have made more sense.<br /><br />Also, the piece that connects to the compressor didn't quite have the right bend.  If you're VERY VERY careful, you can bend it into shape with a crescent wrench, but for the love of god, go slow lol.<br /><br />I found the connecting portion to the firewall (going to whatever the piece inside the car is called - eludes me at the moment) to also need some manhandling to get it connected properly.<br /><br />Paint job seemed a bit... meh.
B0051CCJNS|5|I installed this on my bike with no problem. I used a cheap $8 Harbor Freight chain breaker to remove and install this chain. If you do a youtube search you'll find the video that shows you how to use it. I been raiding the whole summer with no problems.
B000B8Y016|3|must have
B000CB0UFW|5|Just what the Maxie needed.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Perfect bag for long trips.we traveled 17 hours to Orlando Florida and the bag performed as spected . Would recommend to family and feiends
B000IYNVL8|4|Perfect fit and install was pretty easy for my 2000 Focus ZTS. Only drawback is it's loud. I don't remember the oem fan this loud. But hey, it's keeping the old gal cool and on the road so I'm happy.
B00029WSZ4|4|Fit just fine and they look great
B00B1WBPMI|5|A perfect gift! I received my order faster than expected and wowed at the great quality of the craftmanship and quality of the keychains I orderd .
B00526K6E2|5|This thing is awesome because I love Superman and Disney, so it's the perfect combination of the two! :)
B000ALG1DE|4|Perfect fitment, works almost too well. I only put in one new one, and it lifts with the old strut just fine. I think two brand new ones would be a bit much without the weight of a spoiler.
B000C2AIQW|1|The right hand side valve cover gasket was frayed or chewed up in two corners. There is no chance that this could possibly have sealed on a valve cover. I had to return it.
B00TE65V9Q|5|I am an introvert, I play tetris. I turn old, get license, get car. Can't play tetris in car, this is BS. I come with plan to fix. Get Tetris part for car. Drive car around. Park car in mall, ingest consumerism, retreat back car. Girl stand next to car, girl see me. Girl ask tetris plate mine? I yes. She ask for my line piece. I give her the T. I am man.
B0017J3XMU|5|Works grate for my application and i like the 2000 watt rating. The fiber glass housing is ok with me i just added another coat of clear enamel on it.
B00HJDUNWQ|1|The lights had a short in them causing to blow fuses in my truck and would cost to much to return.
B000RNW5NK|5|Fits right onto 2003 Doge Ram 1500. the V shape opening for the bumper mount helped a lot because i couldn't get the trailer ball on the bumper off (because of rust). that was one reason for getting this trailer hitch.
B00ZW686IK|3|I was disappointed with the brightness.<br />I had always heard that I should match the color of the LED with the color of the lens; but found the Warm White much better in some applications.<br />These seemed no brighter than the old small T10 in a lens that is still in good condition.<br />Those are the key words, &#34;Lens in Good Condition&#34;.<br /><br />In a 1986 Chevy Pick-Up whose front marker lights have almost been bleached to white by 25+ years of sitting in the sun, these were a perfect solution.<br />Those lenses absolutely needed the color identification.<br />In newer vehicles, I found the Warm White to be a MUCH BETTER solution for front marker lights.<br />The Warm White probably has a much greater Lumen Output.<br /><br />.
B000BRQ0TW|5|Holds good
B006FLMGGO|4|I wish it was harder but it does hold up around the edges if you put it there on a hot day with some books on it, it is very flexible which is part of the problem but it keeps its shape as long as you dont have it in an awkward position
B0089GPA0M|5|A must have for the true Transformers Fan.
B00651CLCS|1|This is a terrible antenna. I left it on for less than a day.
B00DP2UYE2|2|The tire shredded after about a month of use. With the cost being so much higher than the tube tires, makes no sense to spend the extra money.
B00QSESIDI|5|Works great!
B0023VFUWM|5|The tail light was just as expected.  Perfect fit and in perfect condition.  It was very easy to identify on line, and took very little time to receive.  I am pleased in every way.  Five stars!
B00BCRMBGQ|2|i guess i cant expect more from a $20 seat cover but after one week of use, the seat cover are pretty worn-out maybe its because its the people i been ubering mess it up but idk. the care seat cover looks great tho but hey what do you expect from a $20 seat cover right
B007GD59YG|5|The epoxy worked great I did my transom with it and it is solid. thank you
B00VMMMSMI|5|careful this might cover the top of the sate on the license.<br />check your state's law and regulations if you don't want to be pulled over...<br /><br />other than that, it's pretty neat.
B0006IX87S|5|Received item very quickly.  Very easy to connect!
B000ZAXGPQ|5|Fits very well and appears rich. Material is fabric however looks overall good.
B00YVHGTBM|5|Works great with my Carista app on my 2012 Audi S4. Was able to do most of the modifications I was hoping to do and the product support helped me get the items I couldn't figure out working the day after I submitted an email asking for help. Great product at a great price with outstanding customer support!
B0016LE80K|5|It can come handy
B00ARUSSD4|1|Glass part of the mirror  is very loose. Hard to see driving.
B00EKMHH2I|4|Nice bright bulbs. Really tight in 921 sockets.
B00829LRQM|5|Excellent
B0042HLK8S|5|Works great!!!!
B00BD4JPLC|5|Easy installation looks great
B00HHNK01W|4|Good thanks
B00M9NIB9I|5|Great little replacement seal beams for my vintage fog lights.
B00RW82LGE|1|I was looking for the window switch this is not a window switch.<br />This which turns off the rear seat windows does not operate front windows at all.
B00XY5F22O|1|These are NOT Sockets for bulbs!!! The have the same &#34;Outee&#34; anatimy as the bulbs!!
B009F4JHHO|5|Great price, and all the features work on my Honda 2003 Pilot
B000COO3RA|5|Wrong for my car, but nice
B00V30J86I|1|Too small.  Mounting cords too short.  In a Jeep Grand Cherokee it stretches too tight.  Lower strings too short to clip under seat.  Poor instructions.
B00S71HFQ6|5|I would buy again
B00LPG2WXG|5|I boght 3d led light bar it is nice I when to ensenada I turn it on and it ligh up the rod like daytime.
B0027UKMLI|5|These are cool. perfect fit and function. bought two for our Quads. installed about a year ago. have used it extensively with no twisting, bending or paint flaking no problems at all, very heavy duty product, built to last.
B00CQCKIWU|5|I install this pretty diffuser and the looks is nice big differenceand nice touch its easy to install 👍🏻🙏🌹
B00IKPZX4K|2|I was disappointed, it was not the exact fit for the Saturn Sky right side inside door. I took it apart and used the handle in the old housing.
B007V2B8WY|4|Okay, I'll make this short and sweet: It fit perfectly, it shields the sun, and it definitely lowers the temperature of the car.  Some of you might have noticed that most private aircraft while parked have these because electronics are sensitive to heat.  On the down side, it is somewhat bulky and a little unwieldy but after a few attempts you get the &#34;hang&#34; of it. ( I couldn't resist that one.).
B004BU1UEA|5|I just had them installed yesterday, but them seem much improved, over the stock pads, for my Triumph Tiger 800.  I noticed the awesome stopping power and would choose EBC, over expensive, non-effective OEM Triumph parts, the next time, also. The pads feel like I have an an extra rotor, for stopping power, just like another reviewer said.
B00KHYEU2I|5|Delivery was quick. Product was as described and install was super easy.
B0052SF0LO|4|WOW- make sure you don't look directly into the light! You'll be blinded by the brightness! The set -up left a bit to be desired- it was a trial and error to adjust - I actually thought we'd have to send it back as defective because it was not going off in daytime but we kept at it and now it's working quite well. So far quite pleased. We do have inclement weather ( well, who doesn't?) so time will tell if it will hold up but for the price it seems quite good and the light extends well into my back yard where I wish to keep an eye out for pesky critters like the neighbor's cat who thinks my flower beds are a toilet and a raccoon that tries to make off with my bird feeder.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Works great. Great delivery time by Amazon.
B00I2JHLMQ|5|Like the original but for a lot less money.  What else is there to say.......
B00DERDU44|5|Brought these for my 2002 BMW 530i to replace the Bosch plugs that I didn't care for in performance, I have been running these for about four months and like the gas mileage and it seems the little extra kick I'm getting from these plugs.
B00316K61S|5|Quick delivery. product was as advertised. Have used it and it work well. I like this item...
B006VYHR46|5|Bought this item and it is exactly as described. Fits perfect in my trunk with the options to use it with the 3rd row down or up. Very convenient feature that made me choose this over weather tech. Mat have textures that prevents items from moving around. Works great.
B00H2TD5IQ|5|WOW! found this part somewhere else for over $100 and here for about 11!!! it worked just fine. Great deal. Thank you.
B000I14RY6|5|Only useful for small jobs but that is what I needed, it pulled my wiper off!
B0054JXD2Y|3|really need a rate on this one...... its an oil plug...... if the oil doesn't leak out..... then its probably doing the job it was intended to do.....yes?
B000CKGAV6|2|Not bright at all
B0014COKYU|4|Good stuff
B00393V9YG|4|I LIKE IT
B000BVRZ74|1|Too hard to get off windshield  I am still trying to wipe it off.
B000GKD5NI|5|Fits the back of my Camry perfectly, really helps to reduce the glare of the sun.
B00GUJAUUU|5|Did what I want it to do.
B0055DQ2RC|5|great value,good locks
B001MX1H42|1|Used the passangers side one only a few times before it broke not very strong  cheap plastic
B001AJH1HK|5|I was concerned when every mirror extension had a review about the mirror moving around and not being stable.  I mounted these on my Dodge Ram factory mirrors without issue.  They tighten nicely on the mirror and provide great view of my 30 foot camper.  I would purchase again.
B00379ABX2|3|Sign itself does what we need it to but it would have been great if I didn't have to spend 30 minutes scrubbing the bar code sticker and the remnants off of it when it arrived!
B00PKRW0LK|5|Good quality plus they remind others to give a new driver some patience
B00BLPSLPO|5|It's perfect product I like it and good quality
B00II3M86U|1|I purchased a package with[[ASIN:B00II3M86U Gold Stars 11568305 LED Replacement Bulb 1156 Base 250 LUM 12 or 24v Natural White (2)]] two (2) of these bulbs in June 2015. Between purchase date and February 2017, I ran one of the bulbs less than 500 hours - 8 out of 24 chips still light brightly, 1 chip out of 24 chips still glimmers, and 15 chips out of 24 are DEAD.  See attached picture. The bulb I have not run much still works great. [[ASIN:B00II3M86U Gold Stars 11568305 LED Replacement Bulb 1156 Base 250 LUM 12 or 24v Natural White (2)]]Given that these lights are advertised as having a 60,000 hour life, the bulb is over sold.
B00RDJFVS2|5|Arrived on time and product fully satisfactory.
B009E89QAY|5|Awesome replacement cable.
B00IAARHTO|5|Make sure you remove the stone and super glue on so they don't fall of. Love these, my third set over a few years
B004DRVGHM|5|Good product
B00JDTYTPQ|5|Good product
B00G7XKMG6|5|Love it! Although the the drop down tinted insert doesn't go down far enough and it distorts my vision
B00CASDZKC|4|I bought this to protect the light leather from the kicking legs of my little guy... and it works... seems to be durable enough. Lost 1 star since the fit is kind of tight in my Accord.
B00332UM1E|4|Love it
B00I0SAXYM|3|Holds my monitor off the floor nicely
B00FM7B1AO|5|OMG, best bargain and great charge.  My husband installed it over 3 weekends.  I could not have done it, but he has electrical experience so it the most time was spent making it look finished on the side of the garage.  In some counties, electric companies are offering rebates for installing a charger.  Locally, there were $500 rebates.  Check your local PUD / electric company.  Love my Leaf - no more gas.  I changed from a trickle charger to this charger and again there was no impact to our electric bill.  Full charge from zero to 100% in 6 hours, mid full in 3 hours.
B00U5OMBJ4|5|Great light
B0002L6J8Y|4|It works fine. My recommendation is to make the Velcro  strap a little longer.
B00D1SWPPG|5|L.E.D output is pretty bright. 5 stars
B003UVCY00|2|BATTERY DOES NOT HOLD CHARGE
B006WQSGPW|3|I ordered the hub for a car without ABS but I received the hub with ABS sensor install. Not a big deal but not exactly what I wanted.
B00CEXKBS2|3|fits perfect on my chevy silverado 2015 LT...easy install..minor scratches on the item!
B007EHOWSI|5|This product was a perfect fit!!
B005RR42LY|4|Like everyone mention, very bright and makes the car look cool.  One of the 7 bulb was defective. But I didn't used the one for the trunk so it worked out.
B000EDQQCY|5|Perfect replacement for my aged and disintegrating camper vents.
B00449VP8O|5|Good price, good service. good product.. Great supplier.
B002626OLY|3|I was expecting to work better.
B00BCRMAAS|5|My son is installing my new OxGord 17pc Set Flat Cloth Mesh Gray & Black Original Seat Covers Set in my 2000 Mazda van. So far, I am delighted with them. It only took him about 10 minutes to install the driver's seat. It was easy to slip on the back because my headrests are removable and he just took it off, slid the seat back cover over and then put the headrest back on. There is a generous opening in the seat cover where the spokes of the headrest go. Next, he put in the bottom seat cover, it was a little more difficult but it still didn't take him too long.  I must confess that I didn't watch the rest of what he did. It was just too hot out there. And the heat is why he has only put the one on. Next week it's supposed to get out of the 100 plus degrees and he says he will put my car in the shade and install the rest in the evening.  Until then, I have been sitting on the one I have and driving around so I can tell you that I do like the fit. I'm not sure if it fits exactly but the reason why I wanted these was because they have a universal fit. I wasn't sure if I would put them in my car or in my husband's car. I now know that I'm happy with them in my car.  They change the look of my car and will help to protect my seats from dirt and food for the next year or so. I know that once they are all installed, my car will look cleaner and newer. I plan to order 2 more matching seats because I have 2 more bucket seats in my van.  I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion.
B000WEKQ3K|5|Perfect. Thank you.
B000BO8TTY|5|Works great
B0042HE5B2|5|Worked great. Saved me a ton
B008OAEVG2|5|The product arrived as promised and was in good shape.  No modifications were required. I am pleased with the bracket.
B000BUOSG6|2|too small for my camper. Not as described
B00062YQXE|5|Have the V&H exhaust and bike was running funny between 5 and 7 rpm's put this bad boy on and it ran like a champ
B0030GF2LI|5|The teens were excited to use them.  They were just as advertised
B006B25H72|5|Perfect after market product.
B00P7V7SWK|5|Work great, needed a low mount only problem I had to drill new holes to mount my racing seats from the bottom
B00PEWNQOG|4|Good product
B0075XGZFO|5|My son was thrilled with the new decal for his car.
B005VPS2TU|5|Perfect match and 1/5 the dealer price.
B00BAZBUQ2|5|Looks great and shipping was fast.
B000CPZYCM|5|Very good
B004W4MBXO|5|I have no words but a pic says a million .....
B00ES52O2A|5|Very good product looks good
B002GTKAHQ|5|Perfect mirrors.  A breeze to install...although I'm only running one currently.
B00394L32S|2|We had to return the first cover because it did not fit our C5 correctly.  Packing it up  and shipping it back was definitely an inconvenience.  The second one arrived this week and we tried it out today. It fits a little better but still looks very awkward. Not at all like the picture.  Not sure what we're going to do at this point.
B000E9Z49Y|2|not strong enough for glass cleaning.  i've had that film on both front and rear windshield and wanted to clean it with papertowel.  used once and it didn't clean it as well as the others like RainX regular glass cleaner.  it's good as a surface cleaner because it gives a good scent, but that's about it, it's weak compared to others.  i do use glass cleaner without amonia as well because i have tint on the windshield and windows but this particular cleaner is the weakest of what i have experienced.  sorry, i love mothers products and literally have all of them, this is one product that is very disappointing to me.
B00199M5QS|5|Fit is perfect and work like a champ and at a very reasonable price.
B007TY71MK|1|Product was defective and when I returned it they tried to say it was not their product: (  Not a good experience!!!
B000C0YR8Y|5|perfect fit , no more squeaking
B00KISG4CW|5|Fit well. Easy to install and looks great!
B001DCF0XQ|4|I have a 2008 Mazda3 5-door, and this is a great replacement for the original fuel cap that broke. The only problem I find with this cap is that it doesn't come with an attachment to attach the cap onto the fuel tank door. The functions the same as any fuel cap would.
B0019C4YF0|3|This is just cheap plastic but good for the price. Would not buy again.
B000I2SWXC|5|can be knock out of place.
B000NNONWK|5|Much more heavy duty than I thought it was going to be. I do have to wrap the metal hooks to prevent them from scratching the bike. Appears to be very water proof. Fits my 2015 Street Glide great. Very Pleased.
B004RZU3Q0|5|Nice and bright. Looks good too!
B004J38OXO|5|2004 jeep drives like it is on rails now
B00H7HD8LW|5|Cheap but great quality love it
B0023VMRXM|5|Perfect
B00JC8DTWW|3|Used part from auto scrap yard
B000PAS2YG|5|Fast, easy replacement. Works well and will buy again
B0024NWQY4|1|Guys a joke never wrote me back about the headlight that leaked water the first 2 day i got them just complete junk and she never sell to anyone!
B00PPGGVSE|5|very good quality.
B00NHIHLQS|5|Got these in the mail the other day and I'm working on getting them installed in our 1986 Chevy van, just not as running lights.  I'm using one of them to illuminate the steps getting in & out of double side doors, at night we are always tripping on them and either falling in the van, or trying to NOT fall down the steps!  I'll find another project for the other one later.
B000CGFWTG|4|Exactly what I needed.
B000150J5K|4|Really spruces up an old truck. Almost makes you not see the rust on the rest of the vehicle!!
B000CCM3JC|4|Exactly what I needed.
B00BFD5GEG|5|Fit perfect and works just like the original bulbs that came with the CNC ...
B00S28HNRK|5|Nice weight to them, really good appearance, the rings are heavy duty.
B002FY28QS|4|Perfect
B00SMA0O9W|1|This looked exactly the same as ours and the # was the same but our mechanic said that the insides wouldn't fit inside this replacement. Not a help to us.
B00G1RXGCU|5|Excellent sale will buy from again.
B00Y5FSKDU|5|I placed the emblem on my engine ,It looks great on my Altima Coupe great product thanks.
B004QGBMT2|5|Good tool
B00D8RYHHE|2|Great light bar really bright the only flaw i have is first time i drove it fell off because the bolts came loose because they didnt provide lock washers highly recomend adding 2 bucks worth of hardware for a little insurance
B00V4049K2|5|I have never found an answer to the hot/stale smell in my car.  I travel for work and have brochures and cardboard boxes in the back and they smell musty in the summer.  Purggo is the answer.  AMAZING PRODUCT!
B0063MI8DU|4|Good
B00KTJ3ZMW|1|I couldn't get them to program I tried numerous times never been able to get them programed I have 2 working keys yet they wouldn't program
B0068ETQOI|5|I've only ridden with the vest a couple of times so far, but the fit and quality are excellent.  Make sure you get one big enough, it fits as described and doesn't have extra room.  The hinged elbow pads are especially great.  It's slightly heavier than I expected, but the design is excellent and &#34;breaths&#34; great.  I had a similar jacket that was lower cost but it self destructed in about a years worth of wear.  The material in this jacket seem like they will hold up for the long term.
B00852MK30|4|Solid mount. Only one per package so order two if needed.
B002SAY33U|1|Not too impressed, wrong door sills for my 4dr tacoma
B004I14HMO|4|This light is better than the dealership model
B00BITHKY6|2|For starters, it's a much different color blue than the stock color. While it fits perfectly, it is not durable at all. Getting ready to buy a pair from another seller, and hopefully it's a better quality item (in color and durability) than this one.
B00APO8SEG|5|Good quality
B0087NB2OU|5|Awesome product!<br />We use them in driving our V10 powered RV.<br />Easy to use as both intercom and HF phone headsets!
B001TMGC7I|4|The silver detail means it doesn't match my other cup holder (2008 328i). Fit perfectly and functions exactly as it should.
B001O074JU|5|I have had these in for quite a few months now and the truck has never ran better. Better gas mileage as well.
B001EOWPXG|5|fit on our E-150 without a hitch, pun intended. holes line up well, no drilling for us.  Make sure you have holes in the frame at 8&#34; and 10.5&#34; from rear hole on receiver. You may need to remove the flaps that we had installed.  You will need about 110 ft/lbs to get them off and the same to torque the new bolts to, with a 1/2&#34; drive, 3/4&#34; deep socket.
B00TUDVR14|4|Would have been perfect of it came with hardware to mount / ground the harness. Or at least pointed out clearly that it didn't come with these. Other than that, its just what you need
B005X97OHA|2|Just too small except for limited travel, then it would be best to just do ice in a cooler.  Started getting loud after a few weeks on startup.  Maybe a freak thing, not sure.
B0096BAMA2|5|Works as advertised, with Denso you will never go wrong.
B000C57RZE|4|I installed these on a 79 C10 and they work very well. The downside is one of them was defective and leaked from a factory weld on the top of the shock where it mounts to the frame. They refuse to do returns if they have already been installed on the vehicle so be sure to air them up and test for leaks before hand. The 2nd set worked properly.
B00BNIOH84|5|So simple - no mess / I've had E-Zpass for years and the glue made a mess on windshield from the tabs!  What a great item - I don't have to leave my pass in vehicle to be noticed or stolen.  I LOVE IT!!!
B00NAN93DE|5|Awesome product!! My son gave it to his dad for fathers day, and his father put it on his gun safe. It looks sooo cool, better than ee expected!!
B010G30HDU|5|Great! Shipped without bending, thank you.
B00WH1ZC80|5|I know that many people probably use these to hang bags when they go shopping, I use them to keep stuff like McDonald bags from being tossed all over the car.
B005J2Q18E|5|Perfect factory replacement for my 2013 sonata gls 4 cylinder. Good price for factory replacement iridiums.
B005CWUURO|4|good
B0006302MM|5|Excellent item
B00M1OUBES|5|I first saw this NOCO Boost out in Buffalo,  NY this past July. A friend of mine had her battery die on her and we scrambled for jumper cables. Lucky for us the restaurant owner came to the rescue with this handy little item. I was quite surprised when I turned the engine over and it cranked on the first try, I had to have this. To my luck, seller your product came along. This is the light weight and its weight in gold.<br />I received this item at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased opinion.
B00CQ43IAC|5|Great light I wish they made more powerful than 25w, but I am very happy and the cover lens is great and fit perfectly, even though pricey,  I buy them again If I need more. I just ordered the Amber color for fogy days. cheers
B00H6XTKSW|5|Nice! everything I was expecting
B001GN6QQW|4|An excellent replacement for a rusted out breakaway switch on my old Coleman tent trailer.  Easily fit in the same place as the old one, and has long leads so you will have no problem with wires.  I'd give 5 stars, but the plastic plunger in it seemed to be in very tight.  I did not pull it out for fear that it was a one-use only item, and one out it would not go back in.
B00CQ453G4|5|Awesome light, I installed and use them today, the packaging wah perfect it has been shipped and arrived on time,<br />very bright even for 25w led. but very happy with it. the connectors are perfect. it work marvelous on FJ. thanks, even pricy I think it worth the money
B000B8GAPK|5|My Jeep wrangler 2001 was giving a check engine light for evap.. once I used this cap it no longer did! great cap!
B00U0K3VQ0|3|The reflector is very good in reflecting the sun. The only thing it can be better is that it is too soft. I wish it is stiffer so that I can put it on the window easier.
B004AXESTM|5|have had on for about a week now on my G35 and everything is fine. Nice bright white color.  UPDATE: just make sure to clean off the connector to the bulb and the bulb itself one bulb stopped working after a week because I didn't clean it and off course we know it's annoying as hell to take it all off again
B00155MF0C|5|Perfect fit for a 2007 CVPI (retired police interceptor) Mine came with a lockable storage with 2 keys and mounting hardware. No need to mount in crown vic as its that perfect of a fit. What a difference maker.
B00FH3YB5K|5|She LOVES it! Such a great product. It seems this product has been replaced by a new/improved version named &#34;Purse Pouch&#34; which includes a small pocket to securely accommodate items like a wallet or a phone - in addition to the original large section that can accommodate purses, bags, etc. The added small pocket seems like another great idea which has been added to an already clever and very useful product!
B00MWPC3R4|5|TOP SHELF HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B000E7YP82|3|This bag is easy to load and has nice big zipper pulls but has some rips in the stitching attaching the zipper to the bag. Additionally, the leading side of the bag will get wet inside during a rainstorm. The amount of water that got inside wasn't too bad considering the amount of rain we encountered on our cross country trip. Some of the zipper teeth also got bent.
B000A0EJ9S|4|Good product and price.
B00OSQGPII|4|Nice pan. spring holes may need to be relocated depend on your motorcycle back bone length.
B000CORVK6|5|Bought these for my 1972 Buick skylark as I was going from a small block to a big block the springs were very hard to get into the control arm but once the sat in place looked as if they were original my cars height from the wheel well was 24&#34; with the stock springs right now I'm sitting at a good 27&#34; height just a heads up I had to compress the springs down to 12&#34; will update once spring get adjusted or have any problems down the road
B001PWA0IO|2|THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR YOUR BROKEN FORD TAIL GATE LIFT , GO TO FORD AND GET THE CORRECT REPLACEMENT
B00AWYBKK8|3|Blades work well, however they do not fit my dodge Dakota properly. Color fades quickly.
B00T2U112A|4|If you are using STRICTLY for pliers, it works great and keeps them organized. I however planned to use it for a variety of screwdrivers, pliers, and a wrench. I thought that the magnet which holds the tools together was present on all three sides of each plier compartment. Instead the magnet is only on one side, so If the tools you try to hold up aren't side enough, it just seems that there is a lot of space wasted. Also, I think that the size of the plier holder could have been a bit smaller in size while still providing the same number of compartments. To me each section of the holder seem pretty wide and big, and it takes more room on my metal pegboard than I would have liked.
B00D7TD7VU|4|Seems fine. I'm hoping I never have to use it other than a decoration on my key chain.
B00CXUI16K|1|good morning this product es.&iquest;son original brand or generic? I am interested in buying it but I want to be sure. my email is janer14@hotmail.com
B00BQYCKE8|5|Great for washing, polishing, and waxing my 1962 vintage Sunbeam Alpine Series II.
B0001CMUV4|5|Simple, works well, the stainless won't rust and is plenty tough...better than the other cobbled Frankenclamps I've seen for sale online.
B002MQDY4O|5|Works great
B00IIVUXLO|4|Good
B005N53CBQ|1|It did not fit my seat properly
B008NBRLUA|5|Great, looks impressive on the vehicle
B002P8T45W|5|Tank u very much:)
B001KS8L7K|5|good stuff
B007HGGD1K|5|easy to assemble worked great
B00VWMKV1I|5|Stick incredibly well. lasted even though i went in the pool and only chipped slightly the next day. wore for 4 days with them looking great!
B009XFDYNS|4|RECEIVED BATTERY IN GOOD CONDITION AND FULLY CHARGED . FOUR WHEELER CRANKED RIGHT UP. ONLY TIME WILL TELL,BUT SO FAR IT'S GREAT.
B008X0336M|4|Replaced both rear on a 1993 Honda Accord EX Coupe. Installed without any issues. I've owned this car for about 5 years and the struts I replaced were original so I don't know how it's supposed ride with new struts but I'm happy with the results. It handles much better. It's a little firm over bumps but no more than I expected for a car this size.
B00PEZ2XC4|5|Beautiful.  Stick in easy and big enough that can be seen from distance.
B000BODVEW|5|As Advertised, worked great for my exercise ball.
B00JSDGC5M|5|Added a much needed increase in breaking performance.<br /><br />If you are doing a replacement, don't order new caliper hardware as the kit comes with very cleverly designed caliper pins that are phillips slotted on the ends. Anyone who has ever done a brake job knows the pains involved in getting needle nose pliers to rotate the pins in order to make getting them out easier. With these, I assume that feature is there to avoid scoring the pin when changing pads in the future.
B0009RSXPI|5|Meter is working well should have had it long ago.
B000CQBG1O|1|I still do not get it what they really for. I am a handyman and a self taught mechanic who a lot of people believe can fix everything.
B009PHF32E|5|Very easy installation, working perfectly, great service.
B00JJU4B0W|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B00AK7NGH2|5|Good quality. No problems with it at all.
B000E28C8G|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B00L4G2XCC|4|Decent price. However, longevity might be a concern
B004X973EA|5|Awesome stuff for the Harley
B00HYKRVK6|2|The clear coat didn't work at all.
B0072QWOBS|5|Ride in comfort and style. No excuse to not ride with PPE now
B009EU22W6|4|This is my first Arai helmet.  I switched over from Shoei RF-1100 to Arai Signet Q because my head shape is long-oval and I prefer Arai's light-weight and craftsmanship.  The helmet is very high quality, fit and finish is second ot none.  The biggest difference is the padding inside the Arai is much more cushie and thicker than the Shoei's.  I feel even more comfortable wearing it than the Shoei.  Air flow is great, I feel it has more flow at full open position than the Shoei.<br /><br />The only down side I would say is wind noise which is MUCH noiser than the Shoei.
B00WVJR0D8|4|It is BRIGHT.  It fits into the headlight assembly with a bit of persuasion.  Only complaint, and it's minor, is that the beam is less 'directed' than a standard halogen.  That said...I see the road and they SEE me!!  Those are the most important factors for a rider.  Worth the $$$$
B007ZD2RR4|5|Very pleased.  Quick install and they look great.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Soaks up the wet stuff
B0044GONZE|5|Item fit perfect and looked like new even though i bought used.
B000E2CVIS|5|K&N is what i use in all my vehicles. Wouldn't choose any other brand of filter. Excellent quality, and great performance. Got this for my 2001 Honda Shadow 750 ACE, and i love how it has a bolt head on the end of it for a wrench. Had a hell of a time getting the old one off because of it's location, and i know when it's time to replace this oil filter with another one, i will be avoiding a ton of frustration.
B005C584WO|5|Don't know why there was never one on my wheeler ?
B00PNUIKDG|5|YouTube video made it easy to take old handle out and put new one back in. Looks exactly like its supposed to look.
B004O844EM|5|Fits good, was easy to instal.
B005XA6T7A|5|Excellent replacement part at reasonable price. Not great for someone with no mechanical experience. If you understand basics, you save mega bucks over going to dealership. You tube has a good video about this replacement. Watch, and stop where you're comfortable. If you forget, back up and refresh. I'm a retired mechanic. Took me about four hours, but now I understand the procedure so I believe if done again, I could knock this out in about 1.5 hours. Hardest part of replacement was installing new cable in window frame and motor. Was a PITA. Once figured out, it was a piece of cake.<br />Good luck.
B00SARRQ70|5|What a difference! It took only a couple of minutes to install. Looks great.
B005AHUQNE|5|Just what I expected!!
B00U5I9ZZI|1|It wasn't what I was hoping to get. It seems so fragile and didn't enhance as expected. Would like to return it.
B004X1R7UI|1|Way to small,
B00KTIY89C|5|Great!
B0096BARCA|5|great fit - worked as described
B005PZMKZI|2|Only te two front seats fits on my car, the back seats does not fit. Not a good buy.
B001TWD5GY|5|They work. Easy directions.
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|We have these in our pop up camper now and I only bought 4 the first time, thinking I wouldn't want more or that they'd die out.  Boy was I wrong!  Logging in to get more and spares, great product.
B0006301W8|3|Water & Dawn worked better.
B0050LU2GQ|5|Works like a charm.
B001QFD7YE|5|If I knew it was so easy to change out my mirrors i would have done it long ago!
B0031P6B3Q|4|little tough for my daughter, seems a little sticky, but it needs a little breaking in.....
B0040ZJ2W8|5|NOW HE'S PURRRRING DOWN THE ROAD IN STYLE.
B00SCY3HP6|3|The light is great and easy to install, the downfall is that is was suppose to include the wiring harness, which it did not. I did contact the seller and they have one on the way for me, so I'll give a three star rating!
B00MASFBXQ|2|Should be all metal ! For strength ! Will see when we hit the rough stuff !
B0066RUGGE|5|Works good on a feestyle.
B00K150VAI|5|My husband is very happy with his new toy!
B00B6ZC4FW|5|they have been on the bike for a year now. they are holding up well. no shake when your driving which is nice. sweet design to swag up anything!
B00916WLHE|3|I am only giving this three stars because for my application the wire leads were too short.  I had to solder extensions to each wire to get the length I needed.  The plastic female plugs does not seem very &#34;heavy duty&#34;.  The male plugs I cut off, did not need.  These will work for my application, which is a Harley Davidson Sportster H4 headlight.
B00OZ1HVGG|3|Fitment was decent. Sounds good. Def recommend remapping after install. Overall worth the money.
B000EVYGQY|3|i Got It for my Brother and He doesn't know how to use It
B00FVU3W4U|1|not what I expected not made every well wont by  another one
B007RVNLME|5|Love it.  Made my old remote work like new with no sticking buttons.
B00KHUQ9NK|5|I like It
B009AJLUNI|5|They look great, nice touch
B00K8MU0DM|5|fast ship great price
B000GTYLU0|5|Fits my 2012 cbr1000rr
B00NQHZ0WC|3|Bought 2 sets. 1 Bar of 1 set doesn't work. Working on it
B00JG3OIFU|5|Good stuff
B00YVQD4A2|5|Love this product! Holds both mine and my husband sunglasses in one clip!
B008QDK0RQ|1|Battery arrived, installed battery and wouldn't work at all. Took battery to local Auto Zone, had them test it and attempt to charge it, wouldn't hold a charge higher then 6V. Attempt to return unsuccessful. Attempt to use 3 year warranty unsuccessful, no customer support at all. Spent over 2 hours on with support and got transferred a total of 15 TIMES, only to be disconnected.<br /><br />Will update review if I hear back from manufacturer or amazon.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Just the right size,the bleed off valve is a nice feature.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Literally 3 days after I put it on it started changing color,  and absolute terrible quality,  I get better quality with no antenna on
B0009IQXCM|5|USED FOR YEARS A GREAT PRODUCT
B00SSJNSVI|5|My daughter picked this lunch box out.  We didn't realize that we ordered it from Hong Kong.  It took a couple weeks to be delivered but it's great quality and fits everything including her water bottle.
B007SKAKPU|4|so far worked on all but 1 car... the one i needed it to work in. Not its fault possibly and have used in other cars where it was perfect n.  4 stars for cheap plastic.........
B000CCM3J2|4|It sticks pretty well but it's really messy. if u put too much on you're gonna have a bad time
B000182DWE|5|excellent product fit perfectly
B0001EW4DG|5|These are just what I needed to vent Hot Louisiana heat and still keep out the ever present rain.
B0007WQN1Q|1|This was a total waste of time and effort. Amazon said this cover would fit my 2015 Ford F-150. .at wasn't even close.
B00HVI96U4|5|This fit great, and helps hold the key together - I've heard these keys tend to fall apart.  Works fine.
B00ONHO3YK|5|very pleased
B00157TGXY|5|I have been reading up on black tank cleaning, and finding out that  bio degegradibal products are the best.  Any way I have been using this Walex BIO-Pac  since 2013 with no problems.  I have read  some comments about the smell, that the product puts out.  Yes it has a slight odd piny woody type smell during the opening and closing of the flush valve.  Anything greater, then there is a liquid seal or venting problem with your RV.
B00R15MJNI|5|Is this cat not stinking cute!  Looks great on my little car.
B00GX4Y9AY|1|I'm so sorry for this product.  Supplemental instructions was horrible.  It seems like they tried to translate from Chinese to English.  Just couldn't make out what it is saying.  I tried charging my laptop with full charged but within 30 minutes the charge on this thing was a big ZERO!  And without charging my laptop at all.  Amazon should not sell this on their website.  To add another thing, this doesn't have a adapter for Iphone 5 even though this charger was made in 2013.
B00XULP8XA|3|Not bad for the price
B00XI9F9VK|5|Really protects my remotes!
B003O6RNU2|5|Perfect
B007JMOPW6|5|Although I'm not using it to its capacity, I have to say it's doing a great job.
B00KNF30V8|5|Great goggles, the easily interchangeable lenses are awesome. The lense that comes with the goggles gets a lot of glare in bright sunlight riding but works great for overcast days. I recommend the gold colored lens for really bright conditions. The impact resistance of the lenses is also a big plus.
B006ZTFTVU|3|The instructions aren't very good. You will need to find the service manual to get the torque specs. The instructions also doesn't clearly show exactly which bolt is to be replaced. Other than that they seem like a good quality product. Hopefully I don;t drop the bike and never find out!
B001QU8CM6|5|Went on easy and stopped the squill after a hi output alt. swap.
B00TEABVQY|5|direct replacmen for vehiicel
B00852684M|3|I haven't figured out if they can turned off or have to be removed to conserve the batteries. They will turn on whenever the wheels are moved. The constant stream of light is only achieved at higher speeds.
B000GKTYNI|1|I am disappointed because I have the impression that I received an old container from prior year(s). Maybe it's just the storing condition, but the product arrived in a damaged, wet carton and the Prestone container had a faded label (noticeable wear, scratches, part of label damaged) and looked like having been stored already for quite some time. This was clear in comparison to another brandnew Prestone container (same content, but new label design) that I bought from a local store with clean labels and a &#34;fresh&#34; look. The lot numbers were different of course, but no indication of manufacturing year. I somehow expect that products which are sold as new (new formula, see product picture with&#34;new&#34; in red) should not be from prior time before a production/labeling change.
B00B22DITK|5|Excellent
B0023VITP2|5|Great price, good quality and a direct fit!
B009LUQFMC|1|One of the three bulbs did not have the proper contacts and blew my dome light fuse. The bulb had contacts on both sides, shorting the connection. I cut off the improper contacts, and had to go buy a new fuse, but now it works. Horrible quality control. Would not buy again.
B002OUIYW0|2|When opened amazon box it was plain to see that the product had been  opened.  Not only the box but the parts inside.  Tested the fan on the solar panel and it would not work. Sending all items back. Very disappointed.
B00YMKO2RG|5|great look for not a lot of $$$
B000TWDVM8|5|Product is as advertised. Good ship speed.
B002HGB0CM|5|I have no problem I m w
B004BTBPC8|3|This item doesn't fit to Range Rover Evoque Dynamic 2014..
B000CQOIVO|1|It has met all our expectations. Good price . Works well. The only issue I have has been the release pin to pivot the wheel. It is difficult to but it may be this way to secure the wheel tight on the tongue of the trailer.
B005AY54IE|2|This exhaust is very well built, and is a direct bolt on, but does not sound good!
B00ZTNZIQO|2|Overly priced for these stickers
B00LCFOIVE|1|Don't bother
B000182FGS|4|Going to try to make this short and sweet. Usually when I order a product off amazon I do A thorough search as far as the quality I expect to get. So this product had pretty good reviews so I'd figure I'd pull the trigger and go for it! This was for my 2002 Ford Escape, I thought it needed something more and this was it! Quality was pretty good; it was at my doorstep in 3 days. Just one problem I had with it ( see pic ) the threads on the driver side of the bar were crooked, being that I'm mechanically inclined I just used an impact gun to re-thread it with the bolt and it worked ( reason for 4 stars ) Otherwise it has two lips for after market lights which I decided to go with LED as I do quite a bit of back road driving, it worked out great! Overall I highly recommend this product!
B00SO1YXY6|3|does not come with cooler or any other items pictured. very flimsy, but serves my purpose as a divider.
B007Y2D56S|1|First off one of the bars arived damaged. Of course I left the wrap on the bar so I did not scratch them during the install. I did not find the damage untill I installed. These bars hook to the cab and not the frame and they hang way too low. I would retun them if I did not spend over an hour on the install. Then again I still may take them back off as I dislike them that much.
B01092I9LA|3|Installation was harder than expected even after watching the videos. Also thought it would look tighter to the upholstery
B003ZWHMGU|5|great saved about $60  thank you
B00UZGQBWA|1|This is a HORRIBLE product!  Purchased one new at Costco two weeks ago and it has leaked some sort of black ooze all over my auto's leather seats.  I can't get the black gunk out!  We do live in Arizona so the heat likely affected the &#34;oozing&#34; process. This product is made in China and lists the ingredients as 100% polyester except for the base which is &#34;100% polyester with PVC dots.&#34;  Save yourself some real headaches and DO NOT BUY!
B006P89S86|5|Just what we wanted
B0040M31C8|5|Inexpensive, looks good, and functional. Couldn't ask for more in a non lighted low profile plate holder.
B004A2LRGU|4|Nice
B0076NMKZC|1|I checked the code but it did not match at all
B005FI5J5I|3|Although it looked great, you couldn't see the registration sticker on my plate, it was too wide had to send it back.
B000EDOT82|4|worked great kinnda pricey
B0094MF3F2|5|Great product, fast shipping, very satisfied!
B00DHYEASY|2|Listing said it would fit a 2004 Chevy Trailblazer but my fuel neck looked completely different.  I have the LT version, perhaps this fits the 04 LS model.  Return was honored but still a pain as we didn't find out it was wrong until after it was up on the mechanics lift for service.
B000O0K71I|5|Exact OEM fit. OEM part
B00G258I0G|5|This is a must have product for Rv'ers.  This product makes entering/exiting the TT so much easier, especially for my young daughter. I am 280 lbs and it feels very sturdy and is adjustable for uneven terrain. I should have bought this at the dealership when I first bought my TT (although I bet it is much cheaper here than at the dealer).  As the title says, must have!
B002N5L9N2|5|worked very well with coupler, makes the job much less messy.
B000UVUAFO|4|I used this product along with the Mr Clean Magic Eraser to remove a large paint transfer scuff. The product worked well and got rid of most of the damage. Looks 95% back to brand new! Polished up nicely, pretty easy and straightforward to use.
B00TG3PWZA|5|Great quality. Made the job look very professional
B000C5C92U|3|contains only one half of a kit to repair a single door  description was vague  reviews stated that it was a kit that one repair a single door which is incorrect
B00JOY6U7U|5|These look pretty sturdy in the picture (which is what I wanted).  I am pleased to say they are even nicer in person!  The cord is thick, the connections are firm, the clamps feel solid and I have no fear of them slipping off or having a bad connection.<br /><br />These are rated for 15 amps.  I don't doubt that they are capable of handling that load.<br /><br />If I need another, I would buy again in a heartbeat!
B00HJDI22E|1|lights had a short in them and caused my truck to blow fuses.  It was cheaper not to send them back.
B00YRJI3D6|5|I got this yesterday in the mail.I am always looking for key chains , I usually break mine so I have a lot of those rings that key chains come on but no actual key chains. This one came with two additional key chains. It is not your typical key chain all you have to do to this is push the side of the key chain and you can put your keys on there. It is very easy to do , now with this when I drive my husbands van I can put his key on my key ring and take off when I give him the van back. This would work great if you had to share a vehicle or anything that else that needed a key.You can take the key on and off of the key ring with just a push. But you don't have to worry about it getting pushed by something in your purse and your keys coming off. You have to push it in a certain place in order to get keys on and off the key ring.I think I will buy all my kids one of these for Christmas so they don't have 2 or 3 different key chains anymore.<br />I received this for a discount for my honest and unbiased review
B00AZPP0Y6|5|Amazing light for the price. I understand and was not expecting it to compete with a Rigid ind. overpriced light but it sure comes close. For thirty something dollars you cannot go wrong. I have mounted this on a Suzuki z400 using the Rigid ind. bar mount. When I do this on my other quad I will skip the Rigid bar mount and use a piece of angle iron instead sing these have feet that will bolt flat. One suggestion I have is to open up the light housing and add some clear silicon to the perimeter to avoid moisture/condensation build up.  One other note.  ... This unit is not a flood / spot combo but it works very well on atvs .
B002OIB9GU|5|The window visors were just what I needed to keep the wind level in check when you have the window rolled dow just a little to let the fresh air into the cab.  would recommend this seller to friends.  There was no problem installing the visors if you follow the directions on the box.
B00B1VA5E8|1|I installed these and they starting rusting after just one day of rain.  Small dots of rust pushing up through the chrome. Spots will not rub off and you can feel bumps with your finger. These are very cheap. I doubt these will last more than a year. They were a pain to install so I'm keeping them, but I would not recommend them to anyone.  Waste of money.  Stick with your stock handles.
B004EDF8HY|3|They are supposed to put a load on the power [with more ohms] to new LED Tailight bulbs I purchased as they blinked erratically fast. These only helped a little. I put OEM bulbs back in.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|super absorbent and soft, not like those cheaper microfibers.
B000CNNG5Q|5|Fast shipping. Nice product.
B007POCE9Y|5|Great, in place and performing well. Thanks
B003TKPR56|5|Sounds good 👍🏼
B0050C7VXM|5|The package said it would stretch to 6 feet and it will, but with some tension.  I was worried it might pull out of the sockets.  After three trips it has worked just fine.  The Light up feature is not that noticeable in the daylight.
B000C622SK|5|Nice parts
B000C8224M|5|fit on my 2000 tacoma
B00F3QUMCW|5|great fit, very nice sleek look.  I recommend this product!
B001FLTHAM|5|The price was about 1/2 I could find it anywhere else and delivery was a lot faster than I thought it would be. When I installed it, easy to do, it worked excellent and tripped no codes. I didn't have to reset the computer for anything. Excellent product.
B0031BHU9O|5|Fantastic brake pads, no screeching or breakin sound, for my Triumph 800 cc speed triple...I expect that they will last much longer than the OEM brakes, as they lasted around 3000 miles, and I am not a speed demon.  I read the great reviews, and bought them right away.  Just had them installed yesterday, but very impressed by their stopping power, and lack of scraping, breakin sound.  Very impressed but too early to tell, regarding longevity.
B00CBYTT6E|3|Nice piece.  You will, still need to use fill plug on the axle to tell when its full, hence this doesn't spare you from getting fluid everywhere.
B000CQDKIQ|5|Easy installation.
B000VZL2CY|5|Wouldn't use anything else.  If there is a NGK plug for made for what I have.....I use an Iridium, period.
B00K7VE2VK|5|I had been using a pre-mixed product that is much more costly. This product reduces the cost per wash greatly with no loss of quality. With premixed products you are mostly paying for water and the cost to ship it. Concentrates reduce shipping weight and therefor help combat global warming.<br />This product works very well. The built in measuring cup makes it easy to mix. I make two 16 oz. bottles at a time, using the spray bottles I saved from the above mentioned pre-mixed product. one bottle is enough to clean my Acura sedan and Outback wagon.  I use two microfiber cloths; one for the initial wipe and one to dry any remaining cleaner. I do one section of the car at a time.<br />I still go to the carwash if the cars are really dirty, but most of the time this does the trick in less time than it takes to drive to the carwash.
B001NYMUWI|5|good stuff
B00W6CWLV6|5|It arrived early and was just what i wanted :)
B009T8DPDS|3|wasn't for myself
B000CFDGO0|5|fits perfectly
B0067MFQ1S|5|Good product! Very good quality
B00KJ8IY60|5|They work great. Had a couple of problems but they have the best customer service ever!
B00O72R7Z8|4|Only reason its not getting five stars is because the wires are pretty thin. Just wish they were thicker still a good product though and cant beat the price.
B004QHLG4W|5|Went in as expected, no problems to date.
B008SQSZ8M|5|Amazing. Build right and sturdy makes my Lowarance that much more useful. Price is a little high I feel like but it least its build right.
B00O2Z4OEC|5|Good Ones!
B00IJQOJEU|5|Love the new radiator, had it on for about 4 months now. Previous OEM radiators would crack and leak. Only issue is radiator cover did not fit back on
B00OD4AQHG|5|They look awesome on the car!
B0002ILK4K|2|I purchased 2 of these batteries and I'hd one problem with one won't hold charge more than 7 days and sometimes less when I'm using my Car Booster or not.  The other is outstanding it will hold charge for a month if I let it go that long.
B00GHT9L4O|5|Awesome solution to a stupid problem.... With some grinding u can use this on the front passenger side of a trailblazer ss (6.0L) and it fits without any modification to the driver rear on the same truck .  If u hear a tick do it before the gasket goes!
B00K5N0RFA|3|For the price they are great. If you are expecting the same brightness as a more expensive brand than you will be disappointed. They are much brighter and clearer than incandescent lights but don't have the intensity of high quality leds. I have a grote led lightbar and the light is intense, these lack that.  Having said that, if you are looking for a decent off road, work or utility light these wil work just fine. If your looking to build a trophy truck than don't be so cheap.
B004AGA8SY|2|Living in the rust belt, I choose to buy only brake rotors that have a zinc type anti-corrosion coating that protects all the un-swept areas of the brake rotor that the pads do not contact.<br /><br />The product description leads one to believe that these rotors are coated. They are not. I have purchased other Bosch rotors, for other models that have the coating. There is some mention in the product description that this coating is available on specific part #'s. I have tried contacting Bosch, and searching the internet for this info with no luck.<br /><br />If you are looking for coated rotors, forget these ones.
B00008RW9U|5|My husband is a clean car guy, and they are not all the same. This California duster is the same quality as when they 1st game out.
B0002MG5M8|5|Great price and fast shipping, instructions were simple and easy to follow.  Highly recommend
B00882JPDA|5|worked like a champ
B00429NKWK|4|Headlights cleaned up really well. Plenty of solution/paste/sandpaper in the kit to complete two headlights. We'll see how long it lasts.
B00D9C2CDO|1|Leaked
B00EK5E2J6|4|Looks great on my dark gray truck! Only thing is there's a small gap between the lense and the bed. But awesome lights!
B00EER3FVG|1|The lights  suck  only half of the lights  work, I bought two of them and they are both the same,3 to 4 led are not working after I installed them
B00KTEG8P8|3|I had a plastic truck bed liner that took two inches off the inside bed length. I wanted to use the full bed length.  Prepped the truck bed - washed it with Simple Green, then scrubbed it with a scotch bright pad, water, and TSP to remove any wax and scuff it up.  All the shine was gone. Took the tail gate off, prepped, and masked.  Wiped the truck bed and tailgate with paint thinner and let that dry.  Masked the truck to prevent any splatter.  Mixed the paint with a drill and long mixing blade.  Then brushed the hard corners and rolled the coating on.  It went on fairly easy and the roller provided the texture.  I waited the recommended time and applied a second coat.  Took off the tape and paper masking without incident and let it dry.  It looked good.  I have a little over a quarter can left for any touch up or repair.  Easy to apply, texture, and clean up.<br /><br />Follow up - After 5 days - the paint looks good.  However, anything dragging over the top caused the paint to comes off or scratch.  Carried some brush and small tree branches to the land fill.  When I pulled the brush out, the liner was scared in many places.  I dragged an ice chest out of the bed and took the paint with it.  It has not hardened completely, kind of like a coat of asphalt. Touched up the paint again.<br /><br />Follow up - After 2 weeks - The paint looks good.  Went fishing and had the ice chest in the bed again. Finally the paint is hard and does not peel off when the ice chest was dragged over it.  The paint still scratches easily. Not the toughest paint for a bed liner.
B00I4FV78W|4|I was debating between 3 and 4 stars. I ended on 4 only because I don't have prior experience with cross bars so I'm not sure if my issue is normal or not. Overall the quality is fine and very easy to install. I feel like they change them since some of these reviews have been written since most of the install instructions did not apply. Either that or I'm (my husband) is far more intelligent than the other reviewers because these were pretty idiot proof to install.<br /><br />I have a 2012 Jeep Grand Laredo for reference.<br /><br />If you drive anything over 30MPH there is the worst wind noise. The first time I heard it the radio was off and had to look all around because I could have sworn there were at least two motorcyclists by me. Nope, turns out it was the cross bars. They do come on and off easily so I'll just be removing them when I don't need them.<br /><br />My suggestions: Either drive with your radio way up or simply remove the bars when not in use.
B00QRHDIPY|2|The instructions say, &#34;Please don't place the charger in the rainny day, ir it will lead to a short circuit.&#34; now does that sound like Waterproof to you???<br /><br />I may write another review after looking at it better and trying it out.<br />I bought it to keep an RV battery maintained and I am hoping it will work.<br />The info on the page says it is weatherproof, but Hubby says that it says &#34;do not use in rain&#34; and that will not work well for what we will be needing it for.<br />But I will try it out and then may write another review after we see how well it does or doesn't work.
B00BD5GZAA|4|I love the look but it's hard to put on
B000BPOIB6|4|I drive a 2000 Dakota with the 4.7L V8 & 135,000 miles on it. I was using iridium plugs prior to changing over to the E3s. My mileage went from 15 to more than 16.5, which by my calculations is a 10% improvement. I was only expecting maybe 4 or 5% based on reviews. I've read 1 complaint about them being made of copper which wears out in a relatively short time when compared to platinum or iridium, so I'm only going to rate them 4 stars. I was expecting a return on investment in just over six months, based on research. My pleasant surprise came when I learned that the ROI was going to happen in less than 3 months.
B00QT6BXL4|1|Absolute garbage, not worth a penny
B00AE1M9YK|2|It does not fit my steering wheel
B00KS13R9C|1|Too small nothing like mentionrd
B00EDF9OKK|5|Ok - being that I'm inexperienced with A/C stuff, if you're going to use this with a manifold to fill a system, just a word of warning - I'm not sure how you can attach these without making a little bit of a (UV luminescent) mess - make sure you've got the right adapter first!  I should have used the piercing style one as you can screw it on tight before actually piercing the top - my fault for not paying better attention and getting the proper tools.
B007MVT52O|5|Lol this is funny every time I see my mom who loves it. She put it in her room and calls it her markup section. Points to the sign now anytime someone else puts something there
B005G5R5LQ|5|VP filter hose fits air tight so that water does not leak into the fuel.
B0002UEN0Q|5|on time and perfect
B00GBVHQB8|5|good
B00BZ3RD88|5|good fit and nice upgrade
B00O8ZNJ2Y|2|Although the light itself seemed very bright and evenly disbursed in the 10 seconds I had it lit up, it would not snap in all the way on my 2015 GMC Canyon.  1 of the 2 bulbs would snap in with the red o-ring removed, but then the bulb was not completely stable in the housing, so it would have vibrated while driving and that would be annoying.  Also, the factory hardness would not snap on to either of the bulbs I received.  I will be returning these and looking for an alternative.
B00S75G3BU|5|Works great i would recommend this to any one with a small block ford and yes it did increase my mpg thank you
B00QHIRCZK|5|Will do business again
B00LTX7RPS|5|great product!
B005ESZ058|5|works great
B001AIZ5HY|5|I love the before after photos of my car. make sure take good before after photos and show it your friends. love it.<br />just one complain is, I had a few pair of each sand disk but for one of them I only had one, I dont know if they missed it for me, or it is the way it is. but I felt like I need a another one (overused)
B00JSA82TO|5|Excelent
B000AM8BF4|5|We have used it several times and it works perfectly.
B004CF6H92|5|It was right starter and delivery was on time
B0000AXQN1|5|Excellent product.
B00B5KYS02|1|this was very difficult to apply and the staples that were sent did not hold.  I had to throw the entire pc away along with the material sent and I purchased a whole new arm cover for $70.00.  This is not easy to assemble and should be noted that as it is all trashed now.
B002BHRXJ6|5|Tool worked just fine.
B00W9EBF0Y|4|Works as advertised, straight-forward, simple, easy. I would recommend it to anyone who's trying to fit their car in a tight spot.
B00B0TA8FW|5|Quality piece.  Looks and fits great. Put this on my MK6 R.
B00SK6YGVU|4|Worth the price and I like that it's adjustable to fit to your specific car. And really easy to just spray clean w a hose I really like that compared to the carpet mats you have to vacuum
B009VI5W82|5|What you need to not spend 200$ + or more for the ICP
B000EBKG90|3|On the small side for a 2008 dodge truck (Large windshield) but will work.
B00BCRMAAS|3|Look good, fit better than store brands, great value
B00GU0ET24|5|This rim tape is awesome,and it came really fast! I put it on my 2008 R6 With bronze wheels and you can't even tell its on there until light hits it at night
B00J4P6Y5C|3|Did not come with retainIng clips for the pads Had to reuse the old ones
B00T6XIHQ6|5|EXCELENT
B000L9G3BA|5|This was a great buy! The dealer quoted me a $1500 price tag on replacing OEM and warned me that if I went aftermarket, I'd never get the sounds of the OEM. He was right...it was 10x better!!! Love it! And for the price point, it's a steal!
B00NIGNY6U|5|Brillint worked a treat highly recomended seller quick dispatch
B0066QV6KU|5|It works
B004R389M2|4|I received the hitch without the fish wires, which are necessary to install the hitch.  After emailing the company the UPS express sent 2 out of the 4 that were to be with the original purchase, but we were able to reuse one of those to finish installing.
B005596JKG|5|Great price
B00S2U6EZA|5|I drive a 01 325xi and the knob fits like a glove. The silver with the nice leather trim compliments nicely to the interior of the car. Feels light and shifts very smoothly. I prefer this much more to the one that came stock with my car!
B0028MLGK6|4|Not a lot to say. This didn't bring about world peace, or improve my love life. But, my car did pass inspection. That's worth the price, right?
B00192MU2Y|5|Just installed but seems to be of good quality.
B002J8LMVC|5|This is a step up from anything I have yet to use. No gimmicky bike pump or emergency lights attached ... Just a very easy to use, commercial grade jumper that only requires a charge once every 90 days. Spend that extra $30.00 and get something you can rely on in emergencies. That was the reason for producing these type units anyway.
B00TUK2YC8|5|The product was just as described and very easy to install.. very happy with the way it turned out.
B001PWFPE8|3|Installed on a 2015 Silverado 3500. The install is a piece of cake if you are familiar with working on cars etc... The nut sert went in easily and the install was straight forward. However, I was expecting the damper to slow the tailgate a lot more when you let it go. I have a half ton truck as well with the factory tailgate assist that opens considerably slower. Overall its not a bad product for the price but definitely not OEM standards.
B005P5DNH2|5|Great step, works great, and folds out of the way when not needed.
B006OPJSCG|5|Nice product!
B00HFWYZO8|4|They fit quite well, and seem to be heavier and better quality than others I've purchased in the past.
B009PDBI5O|5|Very good
B005VNM1EO|5|Spring the extra cash for the OEM part if you can.  I went through 2 of the cheap aftermarket ones in 6 months and then decided to stop throwing away money.  Not to mention this one will actually match your interior trim!
B00CHESQKI|5|Absolutely love the mats. A Perfect fit for my 2012 Audi A7
B00LHB08C6|4|Nice and cute.
B00UFERZKO|5|Great product.
B0087NB0ZQ|5|great for bluethooth GPS and rider intercom. If you like pure crisp sound from music you will have to do some adjusting when recording. as with any speakers they can only put out so much quality sound.
B007ROUQ6U|5|Received on time. They came completely charged. Installed in my gate opener with solar charger, working great!
B005FNKSMW|5|I got this item incredibly quick. It was charged and ready to go for my four year old daughter's power wheel. Very happy with the product and so is my little girl.
B00DQG0776|5|Very good quality!  The pattern is distinctive and nice.  The glossy finish is perfect.  So nice.
B006DDHZ1K|5|bien
B00AKFAZTQ|3|Image shows locking lugs...these are not locking lugs
B00BEX76R2|5|Really nice shiny appearance. I used it on the back of the car.
B00RWN6QCY|5|Only had the item for a few months and it's already full of condensation.  I expected this from the less expensive models not this one.  Problem was resolved.
B000BZG8ZU|4|shipped next day and worked with my Mercedes
B000BZXTDY|5|Fit was great and seem to be wearing in fine
B000EQD4BM|4|Well 4 stars because the wires are good solid Parts but I was shipped wrong ones .. No big deal !
B000B68C1W|1|Easy to install but broke on the second day. Luckily Amazon refunded easily making a frustrating day a little easier.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works perfectly...
B007BXCLPG|4|Great product!
B001AX65QO|5|used to replace factory hangers... did what I wanted
B00B2QEVHE|5|got them yesterday and they're amazing! havent put the bench seat ones on in the back yet (need to vacuum dog fur out first) but they look great, fit my corrolla s (newer model) just fine. Had a bit of room in the seats but that was expected. they look JUST like the picture. Super excited.
B00QJFB2YI|5|Great product. Perfect size. Pretty bright as well! Used as reverse light connected to independent switch. Will be posting picture soon.
B000VKXSTO|5|very good
B0009Y6DTE|5|$25 for this brief case.  It is definitely worth the price.  The photos of the bag are deceiving.  There is a HUGE amount of space in this brief case and plenty of pockets for the small stuff you carry all of the time.
B004CMMFK0|5|awesome products!
B00ZI7V67Q|1|Do not buy for ssr. It does not fit, the description is wrong.
B00KTKSS4G|5|goood
B0055HQOXA|5|Just installed on my 2010 800 50\\"er. Pros; Looks good and sounds like a lil jeep now. Gave my Rzr more clearance between the header and tire when shock is compressed which I needed for my 30\\" tires. Cons; The instructions could be revised is about it.
B00JKTD73Y|1|Clamps are too small and flimsy to attach to frame around window.  Appears to have been designed to attach to window with no frame - but i have never seen a windshield on a boat without a frame.<br />Do not buy.
B000182EWI|1|Total waste of money, didn't even stay on 24 hours after applying. Too bad I cant get my money back!
B002302CAG|5|Used this on last bike trip to tie rolled up rain suits over tour pack suitcase luggage rack. Nice size for it with the 30&#34;.. Also the plastic hooks don't mare up anything. Works great recommend..
B00X8UYW0I|4|Battery is incredibly light and works, I just installed it today and so not sure how great it is.  I hated, hated that the it had a screw and nut.  I have to position the nut in a little space and this took me30-50 minutes just trying to position the nut and screw.  I have one screw jammed in and hopefully it will not come lose.
B00SBZRELY|5|use it to fuel up my boat. Works as advertised.
B0002UHWFO|1|I had wanted an ossilating fan for my shed for some time.  When I saw this item, I really didn't expect much...  Just a small ossilating fan.  I got the package very early.  Packing wasn't bad.  Immediately upon opening the box, I noticed how flimsy it was.  No big deal, it was cheap and intended for light use.  I installed it and went to turn it on.  The switch pushed inside the unit.  Frustrating, but these things happen.  I took off the back screw and looked.  The switch plate was screwed in, but the switch wasn't attached at all.  No glue or anything...  Not even any residue.  Upon examinaton, the switch that came with unit I received never would have worked. It didn't have anything that could have bridged the contacts.  Poor design, poor manufacturing.
B0024DYM3M|5|This was a great value and good product quality. I really like it!
B00QQYWL4C|5|put these on my jeep soft doors love em
B00AQ2D4I2|5|Great hitch great price, no problems easy fit.
B001HZIF04|5|Bought this for my 01' GMC Sonoma. The round side worked great but the rectangular side is angled differently so the tailgate would not go on so I ordered the correct one sold by itself and no more problems.
B000C5SG86|5|Recently bought a universal oxygen sensor for my 01 Toyota Corolla. It was a Bosch. Bad idea,  Car performed terrible, bad idle and stalled multiple times.  Denso is the original OEM part. It's identical. Replaced the sensor again and it was like driving a different car.  No more stalling and poor performance. Toyota's are pretty sensitive with their 02 sensors. So I would stay away from universal sensors like bosch.
B001NAQSQG|5|Great
B00T37AC2M|5|Perfect
B0007XXTVC|5|It was annoying to have a water heater on my motorhome that would not work when we took it out of storage this year. Eventually I isolated the problem to this part and once I knew what was wrong I was grateful instead of annoyed. Some insect had built a nest in the burner tube in the water heater and when the gas came on the blocked tube caused flames to come out everywhere inside the heater except where they were supposed to go! So the original part did its job and opened up from the heat of the flames, turning off the gas supply, and saving us from major damage and possibly a motorhome that burned to the ground! This is a vital safety device and once it gives its life to save you and your RV you do not want to succumb to the temptation to just bypass it. Buy this kit for a reasonable price and you get two new thermal fuses so you have a spare on hand for next time plus a little jumper wire that you might need to retrofit this to some heaters, but it fits directly in the model we have. Good price, good service, plus the priceless peace of mind that comes from knowing that this humble little device has your back!
B00OAKE20K|1|These brake rotors were the wrong size and were send back for credit.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Looks great and keeps my car cooler in the hot Florida sun.
B00B9HHT0M|1|Terrible artwork and sticking boobs on Spider-Man to make him a her?
B0002UEN1U|3|Always good stuff
B000ED9ZBI|4|I absolutely love these headers, big performance increase with and intake and a tune. Just be aware it changes the sound of your Tiburon completely! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't fit as well as I thought it would for the money I spent. It actually touches my A/C compressor. It hasn't damaged it yet but it's only a matter of time before it over heats it and wears out the seals.
B004A6OAL0|5|Works great.
B00HTOB0NG|5|Very happy..after purchasing all the flickering and issues I had with my hid kit went away
B004BFBK2W|3|Worked awesome hooked to the rear of the SUV for hooking up to the trailer but was flickering when mounted to the rear of the 32' travel trailer.  It is supposed to have a 300' range but couldn't do 50'?  It was fully charged so I know that wasn't the issue - had to return it.  $200+ for an OK product is way too high!
B00GQ2TC14|2|No pictures, no instruction on how to connect, I connected it wrong and threw it away thinking they didn't work.
B002QLBJXI|5|Worked great.  Well made.
B0049MX7C8|1|Non working out of the box however I didn't find out until it was tested after 31 Days, just a quick check on my part with a local trailer shop......DEAD UNIT. No chance of recovering the item or my money back. Buyer beware, its a crap shoot with electronics.
B000C5I6H2|4|Good!
B006G6VDQC|5|Fit perfect and bright as day.
B008RQ4ALY|4|easy to put on & fits
B009DJPGD0|2|good thing it was on sale I'll be pissed off if I payed full price for this crap  better than Fel-Pro  but not as good as Magnum
B000EQAFAK|5|so far the rides been smooth.. cant complain on my Jeep 2001 Wrangler
B003IY3QRY|4|Worked well on my old steering wheel.
B005MVB3S0|5|Latest & best.
B00BITHMWG|4|ok
B007KPUXVY|5|I ordered 4 of these for my front and rear turn signals.  They are well made, they fit like OEM, and they look great.  I have them on 2015 H-D Street Glide.  They fit with no problems at all.  Great product.
B00HLK77YO|5|Excellent!
B00KXGVPSW|4|THERE GOOD BUT NOT COMPLETELY WATERPROOF.
B000NCOKZQ|5|I previously bought the Schumacher WM-12 but the cable rings were under size for the studs on my battery.  This rig has the larger diameter rings.  Its also fused.  Definitely worth the extra $1.69
B0027JY7F6|1|Works but it makes my hands sweat so much even with baby powder!
B00FH8P1DG|5|Outstanding value, bright, mounting on strip mining equipment, follow up after experience.
B0075ZHKLK|4|Use to commute to and from work. At 60mph + the wind noise is petty loud. I wear earplugs and the helps a lot.
B0080E4CW0|5|good parts .will buy again
B000C8PA3M|4|Item as described
B002M3P828|5|This bag is huge! We used it on the way to PCB, and ran into a storm. All dry.
B005LDBU0U|5|For long distant riding this is the easiest solution for a more comfortable ride. I use this seat all the time now. I have two of them one for me and one for my wife. Strongly recommended for those who may struggle with back issues or long riding habits.
B00T8DRL20|4|A good product, but not durable enough.  Can be smashed or broken off of the steering wheel.  The lock can also be broken.  However, it's the second one I've bought cause it's the best I've found for a price less than $80.
B00OU67Z80|5|Meets my needs very well
B008J5H6I2|5|Great item
B0014FGVVW|5|great
B00JREPRJE|5|Look great.  Fit perfect.  Great Price.<br />Fit my 2011 Prius and finally plugged the center cap hole left after removing the plastic hub caps.  I recommend spaying some corrosion prevention compound inside on the hub (especially the front) prior to installing the cap to protect the threads from possible trapped moisture.
B002OMR91A|5|Worked perfect!
B00N18UBS4|4|Great fit
B007EEVIR4|4|This is number two for me. First one worked like a champ so I went back for more. Another bike I was working on was backfiring through the intake. After multiple carb cleanings, rebuilds and adjustments....replaced the carb and bingo. No more problems and runs like a champ. Have another suspect bike that may be getting one of these as well.
B0033YZKYG|1|DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  DURAFLEX DOES NOT BACK UP THEIR PRODUCT!  I spent $550.00 on a full body kit that was said to fit my 07 Pontiac G5 and it did not.  I took pictures with a tape measure proving that this kit was not made to fit my car; including pictures of the Duraflex and pictures of my OEM.  I included a statement from the professional body that worked on my car and Duraflex blew me off.  Now I'm STUCK with a piece of garbage.
B00WH1ZC80|5|Helps keep grocery bags in place!
B00DBNF756|5|Made Nissan hub caps become Chevy hub caps....
B00RM327NG|5|I have a thick case so I opted to put the plate on the outside.  My phone is big so having the plate inside of the protective case worked but it was a weak hold.  With the plate outside, it holds well and is perfect.  Awesome product.
B012993WL8|1|Didn't work.  Connects with Bluetooth but does not communicate with the processor on my 2003 Honda Pilot.  Seems the baud rate may not be right or something.  I'm using Torque Pro and it works fine with my older V1.5 ELM327 cheap adapter.  Don't waste your time with this one.
B007RP4CHS|5|Excellent quality (OEM), exact same size as the standard Alpha emblem.  A nice upgrade to make your H3 Alpha stand out a bit.
B0022XDAKK|5|Very nice addition to my Star 950 ! Good quality!
B004RFKBEO|4|It works but I would like an extra inch between bikes. Depending on the size of bikes and the height of handle bars and seats, you may need to rearrange a couple times before finding the right combination. I fit 4 full sized mountain bikes on the rack. Because bikes are touching, there will be minor scratches on point of contact. Be careful of brake handles and accessories when locking down into position. Wish this item would include Velcro for the brake handles on the bikes. That would be a bonus, as the brakes would help the overall performance and stability.
B00AQQP594|5|small and easy to apply
B009S31VVW|5|The area that breaks on these handles, looks to be improved on these!!!
B00DVWK7YI|5|I moved to a city that does not allow me to carry a small stun gun, so I bought this as an alternative. While it is big (it has to be so your fingers can fit through) it's cute and functional. If you give someone a good jab with this, it's going to hurt. I hope to never have to use it, but it's something small that makes me feel a little better.
B00DD0X3B2|3|Cool<br />Wish the plate holes were covered by the frame<br />But they are not<br />Oh well
B001AIZ5HY|5|This little kit works great and it's relatively easy to use.  Cleaned up my headlight lenses and made them look like they were brand new.  Oddly enough, it seemed that my lights were slightly brighter and I could see better at night.
B00EZ85W7O|5|Great price, easy to apply and look great!
B005K8IHKC|5|Very easy to install if the old muffler was out and you have the right gasket and bolts. I bought the set of bolts and nuts from the suggested list from Amazon but they did not fit (and come really late, 2 weeks). Bought the extra hardware from Home-Depot. the bolts and nuts fit well but they could be rusted sooner than the kind intended for exhaust system (steel are not the same). I wish they include all hardware for the job with extra cost. replacing the muffler will be walk in the park, a very small local park.
B00CITJHJG|5|Fit great in my '13 Tundra crew cab. Definitely recommend.
B004ADB3AY|1|Beware! Only one piston not sold as a set of 8!
B00X5S00DQ|5|great price, does a great job too! Much nicer than expected for the cost.
B004M06BRA|5|A must have for any hot rod
B00JIARQ1O|4|Love the step by step instructions that came with the antenna.
B000A79I2O|2|I bought this ramp for my F150 and was pretty much immediately disappointed. While the ramp may be able to hold the weight that it says it can, I would be highly wary of doing so. I weigh 185 and was worried about walking on it much less adding additional weight. It is made of a very flimsy aluminum that has tack welded supports. When it is being used, it tends to pop/creak and twist. There are certainly better ramps for the money.<br /><br />Please also note that the ramp is not one piece, but rather two separate ramps that are not attached. When it says bi-fold, that refers to the ends of the ramp that are used to stabilize it on the ground
B000778LCU|5|works well
B007RLPX4S|5|Fit well and not to hard to replace
B00M9LE0UE|5|Great easy install , looks good !
B000C9SJUC|4|A good quality unit from ACDelco.  The seal on the original 14 year old cap and broken down and a CEL light was the result, this fixed the issue.
B000S2U49W|5|exactly what was originally n the vehicle. works awesome and now I have a radio
B003VASR9C|1|Runs opposite way the ones on the camper are.
B000IYT158|1|It fits fine but it doesn't lock.
B00ELJZJWK|5|Didn't have a small fuel line adapter for my 89 F250, had to buy another pump, will keep this one for back up. Otherwise, got here fast, nothing wrong with the product.
B0080HJL7S|5|I just ordered my product and it arrived really quick.  I opened the envelope it arrived in and then opened the plastic poly bag that the product arrived in.  First thing I noticed was the baby blue rhino car gear logo which I thought was neat.  I then took the product to my car and began to install it.  It was super easy, just unbuckle the buckle and I had to lift my seat head rest and wrap the strap around the neck of the head rest and then buckle it.  I didn’t adjust the straps as the positioning was bang on out of the bag for my car.  I know I’m going to enjoy this bag because I constantly have garbage in my car and this makes it very easy for me to keep cleaner. - item received as part of promo for review
B0042HBSYE|5|I liked
B008Y791O2|5|Correct fluid and a good price
B00I5HRG02|5|Great product very sturdy
B002MGPFPU|5|Works great!  Now I can take my 99 year old mother, who needs a wheelchair out more easily.  She was having difficulty stepping up or down from the curb to get into the car.  Now I can wheel her right to the car door.
B00SDOCAL2|5|Perfect !
B009SCXB5W|4|These are really easy to install and work great.
B00132CG4M|5|It is everything that it is advertised to be!  Right after installing it on a tailgate that my wife and I together could barely raise, I had my 5 and 7 year old granddaughters lift it up for me.  Well worth every penny that I paid for it!
B00KLXWFNG|5|Excellent product. Highly functional and look really cool in my 15 FoST.
B003BYFT9O|5|Great console. One of the least expensive options out there but still one of the best made. Large enough to fit big fountain drinks, enough storage, high enough to comfortably rest an elbow, wide enough to be sturdy and not scoot around. It's worth it. The reviews were what lead me to this product so I felt compelled to contribute.
B00IQBE2MC|4|There OK
B0000AXRH5|5|It does what it is supposed to do.
B00X5FL02Y|3|The back side of this unit is not like the original one. The back is one cover and not a separate small round for the battery. It worked though, but if I'll see the battery covering method, I probably will not buy it. I would rate it 3 Stars, because it still works for me. Thanks.
B00FGLZN3M|5|Nice addition , great product I'm pleased.
B007QV0R7W|5|Looks professionally,
B00CEKUO1O|4|Cool technology that blends well in the day and is highly reflective at night.  Note that the day look is glossy Black.
B0024GJ568|5|Works well
B00UKUUSVQ|5|VERY CUTE, LOVE IT
B008D6YGE4|2|I have 4 various Yakima racks, so maybe my expectation was too high. I was looking for a reasonably priced upright rack. All my other racks are fork mount. The price is the only positive thing about this rack. It doesn't seem big or sturdy enough to confidently hold a 29&#34; mountain bike. The wheels straps are very cheap and don't tighten very well.  It may work better for 26&#34; or road bikes, but definitely makes me nervous with a 29&#34; mountain bike. Also, you'll need a separate locking solution if you are worried about theft.
B003ZYS8UW|5|Perfect for the boat.
B00E0OSK22|5|Stopped the rattle on the D-rings.<br />Tight fit, but its supposed to be.
B004SCP600|5|No issues
B00ELHNIHK|5|great quality great price
B00CBTRMZ4|1|This one failed after about 9 months.
B00DSO9ISU|5|Fits the new EZ Pass as advertised.  Will buy again when my husband's old EZPass gets replaced.
B0000AY2Z6|4|works well. Doesn't seem as powerful as the roof vent fan they make.
B005NLQAHS|4|Work as per advertised. However the LED lights is facing the wrong direction for my WRX.
B00NNTT7WM|5|Perfect for beach and park. love it!
B00BDEP5ZM|5|I had never used this product before but bought it after reading some good reviews. I got a new travel trailer and needed something for the black tank to decompose things. I used to use the green packets the you would drop into the toilet. I believe this does just as good of a job. The black tank seems to flush cleanly so I will probably stick with this stuff. I like that it will decompose whatever toilet paper we want to use as I don't want to use &#34;camping&#34; toilet paper. We just use the same stuff we have in the house and it works great.
B00DMAI3FO|5|Good product, good shipping time
B000C5CEKC|1|This not fit my Honda 2003 crv LX
B000CIMBV6|5|Still loving the sound on our GT500 after a year and a half!
B00B7FC4DI|5|Luckily, I haven't had to use it yet, but it is nice to know that if I ever do, it will take care of any small punctures to my Goldwing's tires and keep me on the road!
B000W1R1J0|5|Works great. Nice molded case. Fast delivery
B0074OL4EQ|5|This fit my 2013 Honda Civic Hybrid perfectly. Great quality and a must have for anyone who wants to keep there carpet clean. Low maintenance just sweep or vacum.
B00TF2S4MU|5|Love it.. Gives my car my style to it.  It will last a long time.
B001DBXSIQ|1|Very weak metal, while tightening BY HAND I was bending the eccentric washer.
B006R7E0NI|5|Good touch up paint.  Color matches.
B00ED8U7FS|1|This Wolo (719) Air Horn only has one resonator. Unlike other air horns which have two resonators. This horn is not much louder than the original OEM plastic horn which comes with the motorcycle. Don't purchase this air horn. If you do, you will be disappointed. Waste of money. Rip off.
B008ND1NH0|5|Got to me faster then an autoparts store could order it and for way less. fit perfectly on my '07 Mazda 03.
B000BUU5TU|5|So far this device worked very well for me. I had it installed on my black tank as recommended (although not across from the drain, but rather on the side, as my configuration didn't allow for it to be installed on the opposite side). After emptying the tank, I run the water through this device for 2 minutes, two times. The third time the water comes out clear, after which I flush the grey tank.<br /><br />Rubber angled part is not needed, unless the tank wall on which device is installed is angled.
B00029WZGQ|5|Really good
B00EFVJ50G|2|Didn't last as long as I thought it should. The description says it is 100% water proof, it isn't. Water seeped through the outer layer and then got trapped between the outer layer and inner layer. Then both layers rotted and tore almost completely from front to back. I would not buy again unless I had it on the bike and under an over hang of some sort.
B00OPOUI86|5|its great it doesn't fit in my 2003 Volkswagen beetle but it nice !!!! it a rubbery filling so if you don't like rubber don't get.
B000LQ78YY|3|Not as bright as I had expected. Pretty worthless during the day.
B00D8U0A86|5|I LOVE MY STICKER!!!!!!!!  GETTING ALL KINDS OF LAUGHS AND COMMENTS!!
B00CMOV6OG|1|None of the correct products were ever received. However if the real product was received. I am sure this would have been nice.
B002MQCY7C|5|Works great and is a must for all helmets. Arrived on time.
B00FDGVMVW|3|Not built very well at all. Turned brown in a few weeks and got terrible reception.
B002J7O7TC|4|I like these for the phones and the TV screen. Haven't tried my glasses yet. I would recommend them.
B002669U3O|5|Very nice
B004UZDPY4|5|Perfect
B00EJFH6YA|5|Great light light. Well built and bright!
B00TM0W9H6|5|Gasket set worked as expected.
B005OV63HY|5|Works much better than the shorter, more &#34;stylish&#34; version I bought that got bent by the wind and stopped working.  Plus, you don't have to remove it going through a car wash!
B00B2YE4B4|5|bright bright BRIGHT!
B00IACBEGY|5|Nice for the price but it did not fit my older model ml350..<br />But I found a body shop to modify it and it looks great!
B00PV5DQV4|5|Bought these floor mats for my Ford F-150 and with a little trimming they fit perfect!!
B0009IQXXG|5|This spray is easy to apply, not messy, and creates a long-lasting shine. It's so much better than the Armor All tire foam I previously used that I wish I had discovered it years ago.
B0073G25MU|5|I have purchased many hid kits from Kensun and they are all great kits.  Just recently i had a small issue with one kit and called customer service,  I have to admit this was the best service ever,  they told me they would replace any malfunctioning parts,  didn't even hesitate I wish all customer service where like this just anxious to fix the problem and make things right again.  Highly recommend them.
B00CQD4BUE|5|When you open the box you're thinking &#34;this ain't possibly gonna work.&#34; But the bottom line is: it does. Easy in. Easy out. Oil measurement is easily readable. Worth every penny. Especially if you've ever had the misfortune of snapping the synthetic OEM dipstick. Mine broke halfway down the shaft. Was a nightmare to retrieve. This skeptic is now a believer.
B001D5JUXY|5|Love this
B00K6D8BUW|5|Have purchased other items from STVMotorsports through amazon before. Highly recommend
B00APOFQYQ|5|Exactly what I needed after the original exploded due to the previously mentioned defect. I've had it on for a year now, including two hot summers, and it hasn't exploded yet so I'm hopeful it won't need to be replaced again.
B000C57L7I|5|Installed on my Chrysler town and country. It took about 30min. The rear end would bounce like I was riding in a boat. Now it rides like new again!
B0040D2QC8|5|If you need to replace the clips holding the air dam on your Chevy truck these are a must have and at a great price. I priced these clips locally and they were a dollar each. At 5 bucks for 15 you can't go wrong.
B00JRE38EA|1|Really bummed about 2 bulbs being DOA (yes I know the polarity matters) and the fact that two already flicker. They've been in the car (foot wells) for less than a week. I really thought with the nicer packaging and the better quality of construction (in looks) that they'd be worth it. I ordered exactly enough bulbs I needed (12) and now fall short of what I needed.
B001HLIMD8|4|Definitely lessens the pressure of the seatbelt against my shoulder/collarbone but it tends to slip around a lot.
B00BX6ZM8A|5|Grandson very pleased. Chain was easy to put together.
B00AII94XI|5|Love it!
B000C7LYVU|5|Item arrived exactly as described and fast, installed easily and works fantastic. Great product, highly recommended.
B00OUUP4QG|4|Awesome and easy to install. No wires or altering your car. Only reason for four stars is because the instructions on the back are clearly translated to English and are hilariously bad.
B0041M9CMU|5|Perfect fit and smooth riding on my 05 Altima.
B009S2ZQNM|5|Fast delivery and very happy with quality of the handle. Actually this one is better than the original one that was on my truck. Heavy duty. I would recommend this seller and their products.
B004KK553I|5|Love this. Really pretty just what I wanted
B010GWIB84|4|Great little lights worked great for the application I am using them for.
B001F0MHV4|5|good quality and price..
B00K65HPVG|1|It did not do anything it saidvit should have done it was awaste of money and my time
B008FCE8IA|5|rails were great  shipping was fast
B0042KJV9U|3|Works somewhat...hard to read and cheaply made.
B00MX3OU5I|1|A waste of money! I used it for like 3 days and it always slipped off of my key.
B003175IUQ|5|I did not buy this pipes through Amazon! Also people that buy pipes don't realize that most loud pipes are iligal depending on ur state. I'm in California, so I know. Still they install them without realizing they can be stopped by police and given a fixing ticket meaning they have to revert what ever they modified in the first place $$$$$$$!!....saying that! This pipes are perfectly legal and are not loud! They do growl when u hit the throttle!!!<br />They are perfect for my taste! Legal and if I want to turn heads??? All I have to do is hit the throttle and I'm notice!
B001B0VP3E|3|Okay so these look great on my 2015 jeep rubicon! I gave it 3 stars because it was a little difficult to get them on.... But once I snapped them in...I loved the look!
B00SH1SN6C|5|This thing works great.  I was skeptical, but they definitely work.  I may buy one to keep in my other car.  It will certainly come in handy if my battery is weak or if I encounter someone who needs a jump.  These take up much less room than jumper cables and are much easier to use.
B00IN5C0CK|5|Everything fit perfect very satisfied
B00LEBLI82|4|They work well, but just know that they are are not as bright as the standard bulbs.  So, you'll just need to decide what is most important to you. We are putting these in our 5th wheel where we don't need as bright of light, but keeping the others where we want brighter light.
B00KMGHMSU|5|The scent is very tropical, kinda banana mixed with other things. Very cool that you can change the intensity and the scent last a long time, usually only flip it once a week. Also the device itself is an awesome concept.
B00N0GLT6A|5|Easy install, good fit, will purchase again.
B00ZF4KFAQ|5|love it!
B00HXJ8MBK|3|I love the pattern and quality of the seat covers, but they are a little too big and slide around on my car. (I have a 2014 Honda Civic.) My package also did not contain shoulder pads or a steering wheel cover.
B000CPI5XC|4|Thank you!
B00UXNNA4W|2|I own a small mobile automotive repair business, spent several years as a Mercedes Benz tech and have worked on them since 2001.<br />I have a customer with a 1999 Mercedes S320 where I installed this part. Within 4 months, the blower motor began operating intermittently. I checked it out and couldn't duplicate the problem. A few months later, the frequency of the fan not working became worse. I removed the assembly and found that the brush for the positive terminal would stick in it's position and once a little wore off, there was no more contact. I adjusted the metal rails a little and tried to increase the pressure on the spring and it worked for about a week. I removed it again and lubricated the slide for the brush and it worked for a few more weeks. Finally, I replaced the motor with a Bosch motor and no further problems.<br /><br />The amount of time, frustration, headache this caused my customer and myself was hardly worth the few dollars saved by not getting an OEM motor to solve the problem. I recommend getting a brand new Bosch motor and quality resistor for a blower motor repair.
B000RFUF12|5|I have spilled battery water all my life while trying to get just the right amount in the cells.  This Plews is a great product.  I recently purchased a golf cart to drive out in the country and this is a real timesaver for servicing the battery pack.
B00KLNUX44|5|Looks like day light in my car definitely a good light.
B00GWFKSOK|3|moderately heavy weight and appear they should last. I expected them to reach further up the edges of the floor - as I expect snow & ice to get carried into this area in winter...
B003U91QEC|4|If you have bad door pins, this is the one you want so that the mirror doesn't shake.  If you have good door pins get the newer version that's easier to fold.  They both fit 2nd gen Blazers (95 up)
B00X5GS1CU|3|good
B000C5I9KQ|5|Best gas cap in the market. Do not buy any other gas caps. This is the best. Trust me. Works well with my 2001 Audi A4.
B0041WFH1U|2|I liked them and the look and easy to install. However after just after a year 4 of the leds went out and I can't replace them. I don't suggest it unless it is just a short term purchase.
B004FST89C|5|Great stuff!<br />Turned out better than I expected.
B000C0TAHC|5|Right size, right item.
B00BFDG4QU|5|Legitimate Honda genuine part. Works as well as you'd expect a Honda gas cap to work to be honest. Fixed the check engine light I had.
B00CYP2Y7Q|1|Nothing special about it
B00K6LQ55C|4|Installation was hard.  The bolt did not line up with the bracket and it resulted in cross threading.  Then worse.....the bolts head broke off.  uhg
B00CG5RYEW|5|I love them some people laugh some people get pissed off I think its funny
B00FOOV40W|4|works fine
B000WJC7Y6|5|Great cap! Has a Gas gasket !!! use it everyday from ski to trucks  does not leak if you tighten correctly!
B000GU5PW2|3|wasn't for me
B001GH1PUU|5|Works awesome! Well worth the money!
B00BYXF3OA|1|Picture is deceiving !! looks like a full size bath towel but is not !! Hand towel is very thin and cheaply made !!
B000CO80OW|5|Works great and fits well on my 2015 Scion FRS, Ft86club forum help me a lot for the instruction of installing it. You can also refer to your manual.
B001NS24AM|5|Great service and product.
B00KTHXYO8|5|So... The plastic key ring holder on my original keyless entry broke off so I figured, 'no problem. I'll just run by Toyota and they'll have a new one I can buy for a few bucks.' Nope. That'll be $200. What?!? I still have the part and it works fine. I just want a new case. Still $200.<br />Amazon had the case and shipped it via Prime. It took all of 30 seconds to install so thanks for saving me $192!
B00CGTVCIC|5|I love this cover!  It is thick, strong, and has nice black color.  The threads are neatly imprinted as well.  It also fits my steering wheel in a great way.  I was worried because my wheel is actually cream colored, but the buttons on the steering wheel and the manual shifters are black, so it color coordinated beautifully!  It did not wrap completely around the wheel, but that made it all the better because a little of the cream color still shows in places.  Ill show you a picture to show what I mean.  I am using it on a 2010 Lincoln MKS. I couldn't be more pleased and feel lucky that I found a cover that does not take away from the beauty of the interior.  Hint, since it is so strong it does not stretch well unless it is warmed up a bit, so we sat it on the dash for about an hour on a hot day and the sun warmed it right up.  Then, it went on easily.  I LOVE it and highly recommend it.
B004AQZUX2|5|Assuming they last...  this will be the BEST possible solution for replacement lights!  Amazing price!!  HID WAREHOUSE rocks!!!
B000KKENBM|5|Great product
B00IDHJZXU|4|Much nicer than my old chatter box with way more features (and lighter!). Only downside is the battery is integrated and can't be changed on the fly.
B004HA8J2K|1|Didn't charge our battery at all.  Wish i had returned it when i had the chance
B00I3OBNJ2|5|Perfect product for my 2013 Chryselr 200. Very easy to install and included everything that was pictured. Has held up well. I even accidentally left too much of the connector hanging out while towing a small trailer and the wires held up well!
B00D9C2CDO|3|Definitely not waterproof.  Water resistant, yes.  I purchased this for a camping trip and packed it with some sleeping bags, sleeping pads, and a few other light items.  On the 5 hour drive, it rained a bit, but not a lot.  When we got to the camp site, I unzipped it to find that the one sleeping bag which I hadn't wrapped in plastic was damp.  That became my sleeping bag.  A few other items were also damp because water had seeped in through the zipper.  I followed the directions, place the opening toward the back of the vehicle as directed, etc...<br /><br />I gave this item three stars for two reasons.  First, it isn't waterproof, obviously, so that's bad advertising.  However, I learned my lesson; just wrap everything in plastic (like a garbage bag) and it'll be okay.  I can accept that, so this was a good purchase for the money.  You get what you pay for.  The second reason is this thing is loud as hell when you're driving down the highway at 70 mph.  I believe it's the flap which comes down over the zipper.  The noise comes and goes, depending on your speed, the wind, and so on.  You get used to it, but during the first hour of driving, I pulled over twice to see if I needed to fix anything.
B0071I3218|1|Sold me the wrong product said it was for 2008 would not fit wrong one not happy
B000CIQMWU|4|Happy! Read accompanying review for other side mirror!
B00M32YYSM|4|good carb, good price also.
B000HM579K|5|Works good so far!
B003YJ8TVQ|5|Works great...does not overheat.  Fast delivery.
B001G7W3GU|5|perfect fit for 03 s430
B00NWGZ3A6|5|Works great!
B009OBVS20|5|Ease of operation.
B000B66KFC|5|Love showing we are from Ohio
B000CN9JCA|5|Looks good. The only problem was putting the s clip on the hood. They were very tight but I understand why they're that way.
B00Q1F65K2|4|Cant really say much about it as I used it to do a projector retrofit. Worked well. Does come with extra bulb which is a star in it self. Their was a bit of a fitment issue where their was a quarter inch gap around the light, but I replaced the top popin tab with a tip tie to pull it in, and the gap is pretty much satifactory. I have seen some people drill new holes and what not to solve this problem, but I rather try to avoid drilling holes if possible.
B00YRQ8STI|5|No complaints here.  Light bulb works as intended.  Would buy again.
B00IJF6P2K|1|Advertisement said it fits on my vehicle but it does not. Waste of money.
B00VRQ79SC|5|Great product for my Polaris. This is the way to fix your fuel problems on an EFI Polaris 550. FYI when changing the fuel filter, get a ford 150 application for $9.95 It works the same as the $50 Polaris one. Happy riding
B000BNZPT2|5|Great product, easy install.
B00NLMCXK4|4|Great fit and easy to put on
B00JY8RX6S|5|On time and worked as indicated.  Just be sure to follow directions regarding cleaning and using promotor.
B00FT1ZQW2|5|fits perfect you get everything that you need in the box.
B000CQOIVO|4|Not too quality, but works and was shipped pretty quickly.
B000TQ6VJY|1|I am sure this item works fine... but beware, MADE IN TAIWAN.
B005BNZEZC|5|Just what I wanted and fast
B00DWKYXLC|5|Love the product the color is great very bright as well
B00CIJ5Q50|5|Bit too large but good quality.<br />Friendly staff too<br />Just cut off the saddle part of it. look weird lol
B0013ERRT4|5|Love it
B001PWA0IO|5|Fast shipping. Item as described
B005R6R6DG|4|No worries from this product! Works well!
B0015CKZCA|3|Had a tough time putting on
B0009V1WS4|4|Product is as described and great for it's purpose. I like that it has a rubber cover to cover the keyhole and help keep it from rusting. The only odd thing about the product is that you have to have the key in when locking this. I know you have to have a key to unlock (it's a given) but wasn't expecting to have to put the key in to lock it. It's not a big deal, just slightly odd design and inconvenience.
B00PJ67AQW|5|Fits my needs
B004RZU3Q0|3|Better than nothing, but these are not commercial-grade or daylight-visible.<br /><br />This is not a tail-light like you see on public busses or emergency vehicles, i.e. the kind that is *BRIGHT* even in full sunlight.<br />This unit uses weaker LEDs that are *adequate* to meet the lowest standard of day time visibility, i.e. they *can* be seen when viewed in a 15 degree cone behind the unit -- but in day time you have to be looking at them to notice, they do not grab one's attention.<br /><br />Build quality is average to above-average, plastic molding is clean & water-resistant seals appear to be good.
B00Y3HRJYQ|5|Looks great on the car but minor adjustments were needed.
B004XONTFW|3|this does not contain the space where you're supposed to tap for a temp sensor as shown in the picture on amazon, the box, and the manufacturer's website.  quality-wise, it looked fine...whatever that means.<br /><br />sent it back.
B0081SQY1W|4|Well made, but I had to trim it a little so that it would fit into my handbag.  The heavy plastic helps keep it from wear & tear in my handbag.
B00MH4AQSS|5|Quality unit and fits nicely
B001EOYJG2|5|Very nice
B00C6BX1JI|4|Had to bend top mounting brackets slightly for a &#34;Better&#34; fit.
B00A9T28R0|5|This is a great product I have used for about 3 years.  You simply wash, dry, and nothing else.  No spray, no rinse.  I wish Turtle Wax had not stopped producing this product.  I don't know what I will use in the future that is as good as this product.
B002308WFU|5|On time and as promised
B0000AZ5PM|5|This works well as a filler.  It sands easily and takes a finsh well.
B00M9ICSF6|5|fantastic
B009DJTNW0|5|Good
B0028FIOHG|5|Very good
B003LFDTFO|5|This thing makes a HUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGEEEEE difference in the handling of my 2014 f150.  Can take canyons so much faster without being unsafe.  Can keep up with a 2011 Hyundai genius coupe.  Must have. Doesn't disturb factory ride quality.  Just prevents body roll.
B0031I204W|4|It works well for my scooter. The measurements seem a bit off in some areas, and the material is fairly thin. For the price though, it is pretty much what I expected. Keeps it covered to deter theft and pretty dry if it rains.
B00BWT9THS|4|Perfect fit for my 2006 seadoo GTX
B0006IBYSI|5|I have been using Mobile 1 Synthetic since we bought our 2003 Chevy Silverado in 2003 New. Better Gas mileage &amp; lower rpms.
B00AQ2OMK6|5|Looks great and I do feel a difference in braking performance
B002ET2O2W|4|Works as needed.
B00KBINF7G|5|Love it works great I just keep it in the car every where I go.
B006FNKYJI|5|Very easy to install, no modifications required. Arrived quickly and well packaged.
B001V8U12M|5|Pleasant transaction excellant sale thank you
B006FNRCXY|5|The fit on this transmission pan was perfect, and it looks great.
B001D6GYLO|5|Seems to work fine.appeciate the extra length.
B00S0G18Z2|5|Fits perfect and is OEM!
B00MIDOAOY|4|It looks great now that I got the right one! First set of bars were for a completely different truck so I had to wait a second week for the right ones.
B004AFISA0|5|OEM part as listed
B008BR6UKI|5|infiniti dealership wanted to charge me $370 dollars to install this!!!!  i did this in one hour on my 2012 infiniti FX-35 limited edition.  Excellent quality on build.
B00FW1JP9O|4|I am happy with most of the lights, but I should have read the details closer. The ones that get me the most are the reverse lights. The reverse lights that were sent are not the right brightness. The reverse light should be a 921 and the one included is in  the 200's. I can't really complain full as this package was well priced, but be sure to read the details and don't be a knucklehead like me.
B00Q3KDP7G|5|I bought front and rear bumpers and it made my Razor 1000 look even better.
B000I1FM8G|3|After getting it, I am not sure why it is $165
B005EMK03G|4|Haven't really used it on the road yet which is why I bought it.  My HHR SS has limited, reachable storage and I'm hoping this will help on trips.
B00ZYZOE08|5|Exact fit, great price-less than half of dealership price. So far working to perfection. Simple to install. (swing out glove box)  UPDATE 10/5/15: Has stopped working on all speeds except 4.
B00092893E|3|Got this to clean the fuel injectors on my Honda since the MPG was going in the wrong direction... however I don't see any change... so not sure if this works at all.
B00VNJ4TRW|5|Works great and even matches the color of the car
B00ATPWQVM|4|Perfectly functional. It fixed my horrific idles for a fraction of the price of the OEM replacement. I knocked off a star because the fit into the airbox is pretty tight. I had to remove the airbox and really wrestle this sensor into the gasket, but it went in eventually for a tight seal. Other reviews mention that this can fix some automatic transmission errors. While I didn't purchase this for that reason I have had similar transmission faults. I'll be sure to update this if it fixes that problem too.
B00XL7LMO2|5|Didn' t work in my car
B00BITI7WU|4|just like the factory ones that came off of the car. Perfect fit and true to color.
B000C9DQ0U|5|GREAT
B00DB42QRM|4|I love the antenna on my small car but it doesn't get as good of reception as expected.
B00EECLOT6|5|Great product use them in my business all the time
B00DR4C3VU|1|it does fit, but just to go the store and buy a good quality air filter (10$), and cut it to the size of your ac vent. that is what I do.
B005ZVSF2Y|5|These should add a nice touch of class to my tires and help them stand out from others.  The &#34;MG&#34; logo is truly iconic.
B00HRH9H9O|5|Does the trick and cheaper than the same model available locally at dealer.
B00BSFXUYE|5|Purchased these LED light bulbs to replace some of the installed overhead reading lights in our 24-foot Class C RV.  They worked great!  We were looking for an LED soft white option in the RV, none of those blue lights or &#34;natural&#34; white LED's would be acceptable.  Compared to the standard soft white incandescent bulbs we had, these were a tad more &#34;white&#34; than those, but not very far off from the original soft white bulb color.  They put off plenty of light compared to the incandescent bulbs we had and with the reduced power draw from our house batteries, this was a double win on our part.  The price was great and we are very happy with this product!!!
B004MSJ7C8|3|Purchased this set to synch my 1973 CL350 which has the KEIHIN 722A carbs (*Not sure if these carbs were standard for this year model).<br />KEIHIN 722A carbs have 7mm vacuum ports, so the brass extensions that come with this set are 5mm thread--they will not work on these carbs.<br /><br />Bummer. I will have to find a way to work around this problem...
B0049Z4LX4|2|it broke down in 2 months
B00Z515O5K|5|These jumper cables are heavy duty. I like the 12 ft of length you get as most of the time when your needing to be jumped or need to jump someone off, it's never in a convenient location. These jumper cables allow you enough room that you can jump one vehicle off from another without having to almost put them bumper to bumper. They have a nice weight to them and the covering feels nice an sturdy. The no tangle feature is my favorite because I have trying to keep them apart and the no tangle makes them much easier to roll up and put back in the bag. They came in a nice zippered bag so there not loose in your trunk or behind you seat. The grips are nice and tight but not so much that they are difficult but enough so that you get a good connection to the battery. These will be going everywhere with me behind the seat of my truck! I received the product free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B000CFAV5M|1|The product itself looks ok but the problem is with Amazon's automotive garage app that says this product would fit my 2011 Sienna. It's not even close to fitting. It's about 3 inches to long and the curve is not right. Also with something that is fit specific it should be verified somewhere in the manufactures description. Most of the time I check the reviews but this time I didn't and it bit me. Always check the reviews before buying.
B009D6AA8E|5|im sure these would look better on a bike they are meant for, i was not intending on them fitting my Honda Crf150 like stock plastics but they worked to the point of looking good! They also came with a front plate but that was quite ridiculous looking.
B007HRT3WU|3|Item was suppose to be 8' lengths, but was not.  One was 6 1/2 inches shorter than the other which was 6 1/2 inches longer.  Both came with the ends damaged, scratched,  and one was bent.  With the ends damaged I had to cut off a couple inches on both moldings.  I started to re-order but was able to use both.  It does not seem to be that hard to ship two equal lengths of molding undamaged and straight.
B00BCRMC1U|1|A big fat ZERO!!!  I could barely get the bottoms of the front seat covers on without ripping them. The top of the bench seat cover was not a fit at all, I couldn't use it in any way.  He only decent thing was the steering wheel cover. Such a disappointment.  I don't know how this product got its positive reviews. Thanks for the colossal let down and waste of money.
B00G4DDGHQ|5|excellent upgrade from stock reflectors
B00O0SRA10|5|great value and great product.
B003O8X51Q|4|This product is easily applied and everything comes with. Clay, lubricant and the squeegee. You will need water, hair-dryer and good hands to do the job properly. I like the fact that it comes as two pieces but in reality is the edge between the first front and side is exposed to the most debris as it's physically susceptible to that. In simple words, it should have come as one piece so the edges are totally covered and no chance of damaging it or scratching which on the way. I understand the application might become difficult, but it's a suggestion and see if it's possible. I do understand that it has a warranty of 5 years and will update you on that. The picture is a proof that you can't see it!!!
B000SJ0DFK|5|I purchased these for my new light blue Diamondback bike because they look so much better that the standard black plastic. Installation instructions left a lot to be desired but the end result was exactly what I wanted.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Took all of 5 minutes to install.
B00CLBTHJ6|5|THEY LOOK VERY GOOD
B00YQEZIWQ|5|Stickers applied easily and look fantastic.
B00D8L97WA|3|nice plate but mine was bent in shipping
B000M8OYNE|1|Bought this to inflate a kiddie pool and it didn't work. After running it for almost 45 minutes it wasn't even remotely filled so I can't imagine it would be useful for anything. Return policy was horrible and I had to pay to return it to them AND pay a restock fee.  Overall horrible experience.
B000BO4WZY|5|work well ,love it
B00YRJI3D6|5|The keychain is just wonderful!  I love it!  The color is exquisite, and the texture of the leather is just magnificent!  It is already being put to great use, and it really coordinates with the color of my car.  LOL.  I think it is one of the nicest keychains I have ever seen and it will be used and treasured for a long time.  Thank you Mehr Enterprises, for a great product!  This wonderful keychain was made available to me at a reduced price in exchange for a fair review.  For sure, that is an easy and pleasant task!
B008Y8I6BA|2|Too big.
B00DBERGFO|1|These lights are terrible replacements. I bought 4 and 2 dont even work. Wont buy again.
B00XBUK19Q|3|A handful of them are dope. Tons are just random garbage like 2 I got were orange juice ads and 1 that I wasn't sure what it was, turned out to be from some Mexican soap opera. Good for the price tho
B0016ZJ4TQ|5|Everything as stated.  Fit perfectly.  Arrived earlier than promised.
B003DNJ728|5|very nice cover for the price & fit my 54 well.
B005IZ170Y|2|Sorry, we used it one time, one of the prongs on the 30 AMP male plug melted into the plug.  I really liked the look and the feel, but not sure why it melted.  So we returned it and will buy a different selection.
B00OC90BR2|5|Looks great and still bringing, heavy chrome a good buy!
B00RM327NG|4|Very nice!  My wife loves it and I am ordering one for myself.<br />(We have Fire Phones, and this mounting system works great in our Honda Odyssey and Saturn Vue!<br />No real features, so to speak, but for the price, very nice, easy and simple system for hands free phone mounting in cars.<br />I'll say this - I think I read somewhere that this mount wasn't that good over bumps.  We use Fire Phones - fairly heavy in today's phone world - and iBlazon covers.  The magnets on this mounting system are top notch, and we've never had an issue with the phone falling off of the mount while going over bumps.<br />Again - not a &#34;feature rich&#34; mounting system - but a very simple, affordable system that works really well.
B00RY9WQVQ|3|I assume these will serve their purpose although I hope to never test them. The slider portion and hardware seem very lightweight and the carbon pattern is spiraled like in the picture.  If I paid $60 for these I'd be upset but they are cheap insurance.
B002AP95H2|5|works great!
B00UEC87QS|5|Nice detail. Simple install. 10 minutes maximum. Time will tell how they hold up but it adds a nice contrast to the green of my 2015 Sahara. 3M tape is steadfast but removable which is nice.
B00SLXDFOQ|4|Super happy with this product. It feels supportive but not obstructive to natural movement.
B00HJEXEF8|5|Bulbs worked great!
B0045K2Q9Y|4|just for spares  does job
B001C9VPAC|5|Fits perfect
B00OJEY9KA|5|These black replacement lights look HOT on my Arctic White Alero...plus they came equipped with hi/lo beams... no additional bulb purchase was required ! And, it only took about 1 hour to install both...doesn't get any better than that...
B005WKJEZ0|5|Easy,easy,easy! The hardest part was getting the caps off the wiring on our vehicle. Installed in the driveway in about thirty minutes. Plug-n-go!! Awesome product!
B00D42AFS8|5|Great product.  Be careful with some of the recommendations for storage - I found most to be too small if you want to keep the charger with the other equipment.  Needs a bigger storage bag than most recommended.
B007NQ7LSI|5|This hood lock was exactly as described.  (OEM Mopar)<br />You will need a blind rivet gun/installation tool to install this; luckily for me I work for an aircraft rivet manufacturer and we use this type of tooling daily.
B004QEH1T4|4|thanks
B00Q7FNH6Q|5|Package was exactly right!!
B003PJE4ZA|5|Bolted right on to my 2003 Forester. Make sure you torque to spec! I towed a cargo trailer from Missouri to California with this hitch and had no issues at all.
B00FBR2V04|5|works good
B005FB52WA|5|Awesome decal but there is another one with a pistol as the L
B00DSVMCUE|5|Great product for the price.  I returned simply to get the xxl.  I wanted a little extra room for a hoodie or pullover underneath.
B0002SR7TM|5|Quality at a fair price, i would recommend picking up the anti splatter pad with this.
B000F192J4|5|I had the typical curling dashboard a lot of LeSabres have. I took a razor knife and cut the dashboard itself and removed the curled piece.  Then I put this cover over the dash. It looks so much better. I cut the supplied velcro strips into smaller, more narrow pieces so I could have more points held in place.  I let the car sit in the sun for a while and everything laid down nicely.
B000C0TDGA|5|cheap and fit on my 2.4L tacoma
B000AMZJWW|4|Works well, but sometimes the first reading doesn't measure.  Accuracy seems spot on.  LCD readout could be a little larger for old eyes.  Able to read well in bright sunlight, just a tad too small.
B000SL4AA2|1|Burned out after 4 uses. Don't bother with this one. Poorly made. Maybe good for small infatable toys but I would even think that would be too much work for this.
B00WAHNMJW|5|Extremely pleased with product, very bright lighting, memory recall on pattern selector, numerous patterns, very well built for the price
B009T9ZQBQ|5|Love this.  Fit my 2012 Honda Civic perfectly!  My second set I bought.  Deluxe look with the rugged built.  Better than any other so call custom all-weather floor mats!
B00HSO1NHA|5|The product is exactly as advertised.  It worked very well for my application.
B00MR2QY18|5|It works will spreading out the fiberglass in the cracks and place's hard to get. THANK YOU
B00DWVN08I|3|This is a great hitch plug, heavy rubber with thick lettering but, this product states that it fits 2002-2014 Tundra, along with other Toyota's.  It doesn't fit my 2007 Tundra, it's far too small, the size of the outer edge is the same size as my hitch, I can almost fit this whole plug inside the socket.
B0048FIBC2|5|Enhanced the appearance
B006L7QA2I|5|Just put this on my car yesterday. It looks very nice. Semper Fi!
B000U0Z2L2|5|worked great
B00IFPJGE8|5|Excellent quality. Perfect fit
B00G4BXB1Y|4|Looks great, installed I no time. Kinda looks faded after a little while, but overall happy with this product.
B006O84LWU|4|It's a good solid chain and came with the masterlink.
B001KOG75M|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  I use them to protect my 4Runner paint from the Kayak tie-down straps.
B00L2P1DPI|5|Thanks
B001EAQTRI|4|works well but a little bulky
B00KWRMK1S|3|The item came on time and packaged well but the bulbs are not as bright as I would have liked them to be. Not even as bright as the original old-fashioned bulbs.
B0026PEM24|3|There is no elastic or rope included. Mine had to be cut to fit a 205/15 tire. Be prepared. Otherwise, ok.
B00FTB3L06|5|Easy to install.
B00E1SMDG6|5|I recently bought two rear brake rotors from Callahan brake parts and couldn't be more satisfied with the quality of these rotors. They completely took care of the problem I was having ,like the car shaking and the rumbling noise when I pushed the brakes. I highly recommend these rotors.
B00080QHMM|4|I liked how it is, but it died after two years or so. Short life.
B00PCUE054|5|love the sketchy look
B00684TAYY|5|Great product
B001O0CCJW|5|Great locking lugnut kit for the $$
B00JOB1P1O|1|Product looks to small and cheap I will order the red one and its bigger like the real thing.
B00LX12EEA|1|There was no lower mounting hardware and they ended up not fitting my bike. I ordered this item for a 2007 FHTC, was assured it would fit.  It didn't.  Return policy, you pay shipping.  Shipping was $62.00.  Junk!
B00LMRFJGK|5|something original in my group of jeepers
B00136OJZ2|4|As expected, no complaints. A longer lead wire would have been helpful in my application
B003YNIJO4|5|Just like OEM down to the premounted zip ties to reuse the factory bracket for a 08-14 STI
B008VGDYNU|5|Have had this holder on several highway trips so far. Its well built and a quality product at a great price.
B003U87CLE|5|As promised
B005UTS670|5|Love these on my car.
B000C427MI|5|Worth spending a little more. The integrated nut makes removal a breeze. Be careful to not over tighten.
B002AKIAVE|5|Great tool! You don't need the bolt. Took a few times to get it right but it works. Used on a 2008 Mazda 3 with a 2.3 liter motor.
B005JV7SW8|5|great helmet. very comfy and is light weight. i use it autox with the bmw cca
B000C2WFA4|5|I have a 2005 Infiniti G35 4 door Sedan and it fits perfectly.
B00HSEW8ME|5|CHROME is a Chicago staple, and this bag looks outstanding. Very comfortable even when packed to the maximum. Very durable as well.<br /><br />I chose the 'motorcycle' bag over the normal bag for the large size combined with higher durability of the materials and the grey/black color scheme. I use it for bicycle and daily use instead, even bring it to my 9-5 job and it looks professional.<br /><br />Only downside is the heavier material wants to kind of 'fold' instead of rolling when trying to open the flap, so its a little more difficult to get small items out of the bottom while its slung around your neck.<br /><br />Overall 9.9/10 great purchase!
B00JBICS7U|5|These headlights look awesome! However if you do not regularly work on your car or aren't a mechanic, I would recommend professional installation because the bumper needs to come off for installation.
B001NND78U|5|Really nice heavy duty
B00CQAOLL6|5|Easy to install.  Might need a little more documentation for some people.
B00HBY4Q4Y|5|Fabulous Key Chain, Looks great, Fast shipping, arrived 1 day early<br />Thank you Triple C!!
B008G32DN0|5|Always great
B00FM1CKK0|5|Not too big it is awesome!!!
B00Q5JRJBS|5|Works great
B00YWMVGIW|1|As of right now it's a one star. Part number 5417 does not come close to properly aligning with existing holes. I have a 2009 mitsubishi lancer 2.0.
B004PL9BVY|5|Use it in my Coats tire changer for the air motor lube. Good stuff.
B00KN1AD12|4|The pro's out way the negative's 1) cost very cheap and they work, 2) simple to use and attach (also part of neg) I have attached these to three different cars no issues.  The neg you have to use your brain attach them securely. the clips do not hold on edge of your door. BUT wait if you have the Oh Sh$t handles I have wrap them around them and they are solid. The one car that did not have those handles I just moved the door gasket down some and clipped the clips in their nice secure fit that way. Good Luck.
B001DRH2HI|5|Complete kit for reseal of c5 corvette P/S pump
B002PQJ95O|5|They were excellent
B00AKFRZG2|5|Great sound. Pretty easy to install
B00FEH2ABG|1|It does not even got fit for my car even though it says it fit for my brand.
B001CKOA2Q|5|I like just a joke me and a few guys put o. Our trucks
B00TWEC9E0|5|Good quality
B0081SQY1W|5|Nice size & hooks on rear view mirror with no difficulty. Now placard will not tear
B00IQ2V41S|5|My sister in law bought one of these for me as a stocking stuffer just because and it turned out to be one of the best car wash tools I've ever encountered.  It does a very good job of helping clean the car, and the flip side with the &#34;scrubber&#34; portion is great for the stubborn spots and bug grime while still maintaining the integrity of the cars paint.  Does no damage to the vehicle, and cleans very well.  I was so impressed that I bought the 12 pack!  When it's time to replace, I will definitely be purchasing these again.
B0002SQUTU|5|Works awesome! Allowed me to complete job with no headaches. Would buy without hesitation.
B00KTHZWU2|3|The dealership was able to program them to start the vehicle, but the head of the fob is not the same as the original, so getting it out of the ignition is difficult. Also, the key release on both fobs broke almost immediately. Now the door key will not stay in the fob. but considering that an OEM fob costs $180.00 each, through the dealership, I can live with their shortcomings.
B000BO6RUC|5|As promised!
B00P99KKAM|5|Bought this for my dad & he loves it.  The color is vibrant & has just enough squish.
B000C5G3W2|5|Good rubber quality, fits perfectly. Would buy again
B007ZCD2F6|5|The Keeper winch is great. It is on my boat trailer now I can reel my boat in standing on the dock with the remote and not even get my feet wet. Great buy
B00391FOSK|5|Perfect! Air running like new!
B000C11JJI|5|I was a little hesitant to purchase this item since it was a Amazon open box item.  But it worked great.  I think I know why it was returned.  The regulator was positioned all the way to the bottom.  When that is true you cannot mount the window glass to the regulator.  I simply plugged in the motor and used the window switch and ran the regulator up to the middle position.  Installing was completely normal after that.  Everything works great!!!!
B0028ZKMM6|5|This worked perfectly.  Easy to install on my 2006 Yamaha Roadstar Midnight Silverado!
B0006IX7W4|5|exactly what it should have been, simple and easy.
B0002BGELQ|5|Perfect option for hard wiring an electronic device in your car.
B0050IJK8A|5|Fits our Can AM Outlander perfect
B00KYFGTF6|5|fits my can am spyder
B004UPZXQM|5|Works well, really nice to have on hand to clean any spots during a car show
B000ANUHAA|4|good pricing
B005NSV4SQ|1|Does not fit 92-93 kx250
B004VRR9EI|1|The mounting hardware pictured was not included.  Looks like it was taped to jack at one point.  From the reviews I thought this issue was resolved.
B00ELHTE5A|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B00IDDTFWA|5|These speakers are amazing how they sound.
B001O04HZO|5|These are great brake pads.  Braking is smooth and quiet.  Fit my Hyundai Elantra with no issues.  I will definitely buy these again.
B00KCRNZ9Y|3|The mat is of very good quality and it does fit well....except it covers up the tie downs for the window screening so you can only use the upper tie downs not the lower ones so the screening is not fully attached anymore. The emblem is nice too. I'm not sure how this problem could be solved other then maybe holes could have been stitched into the mat to slip the tie downs through if you need them.
B006ZVITPG|5|So far, so good. Replaced the original which was leaking badly and this unit is holding pressure well. I do not see any more leaks, A/C is now consistently cold. This unit did come with a rubber O-ring for the switch so I did not have to transfer that from the old one.
B00YBGA8U6|4|Nice fit and easy to install. Now we have vents open even when it rains.
B001A1RLC8|5|I haven't really used them yet, but I already love them. I am getting my first bike soon and wanted the right protection at a decent cost. They fit perfectly and they feel very secure. Thanks.
B004VRLDE0|4|Bought an 09 Ram that was dropped and bottoming out on the smallest bumps. I took it to the shop and they told me the shocks were no good. They offered some Ranchos for $250 each but I couldn't afford it. Bought these online and installed them myself. Only problem is these are the exact same shocks that were on in 1st place! Oh well. It rides good now but time will tell if they are worth 5 stars.
B001LHVOVK|5|This is a great tool. Came in very handy for me as I wanted to check the problem on my car as it was not passing the emissions test. The reset feature was great as I could get my car pass emissions test after resetting with this tool. make sure you drive your car for at least 35-40 miles after resetting the car's computers before going for emissions testing otherwise they fail the test and ask you to come back once the computers are all up and running.
B00N12RQW4|5|Very good thing
B00VSDZAXK|5|Put this decal on my car, it adhesive  is working great!
B0066TMKTI|3|Works... kind of slow to respond/get to temperature.  Keep in mind, this isn't an &#34;analog&#34; sensor so to speak - when it hits temperature(s), its just on, and then off.  Its not a sensor in that you can get a reading out of it.<br /><br />I found that while it comes on at the correct temperatures, it takes too long for the assembly to transfer the heat to the sensor (or whatever is inside) to trigger.
B00HQPV29U|5|2008 AUDI TT- APR stage 1 : Changed from stock DV to new rev D DV after receiving P0299 code.  couple month later got P0299 code again.  Checked other possible causes and it lead to boost leak again to DV.  It seems that DV was not able to hold boost with APR tune. According to people with similar symptoms installed Go Fast Bit DV and problem seems to go away.  I just installed today and test drove for 30 min very aggressively!!  I could notive the difference when shifting gears. Good Product..  Can anyone do something about the CAM Follower!!?
B004NV6FE2|5|These things are a must!
B00EKTTXY6|1|Fell apart almost the moment we opened it ..  My son is six so maybe just not for his age group ..
B0041MCLW8|5|I have got this brand at the autopart store before. No issues and will use again.
B004MXN71U|5|Really good folks to deal with. Very pleased with product and service.
B000DZBHLI|4|Works as advertised
B000EQD7IW|5|Great quality for inexpensive price
B00G0KRHK0|3|i enjoy the smell when i open the door but the vent is not easy to clip in
B00IBOKTTO|5|Love them fit awesome and a good deal compared to its competitors quality.<br /><br />They also have an awesome look and fits the feel of the frs interior
B001H2C9PO|5|Exactly as described, worked perfectly. Superb customer service.
B00480BWCI|2|NOT THE QUALITY WE EXPECTED. USED THEM ON OUR 5TH WHEEL CAMPER TO STABILIZE AND 1 COMPLETELY COLLASPED!
B000VT58DO|5|very good shape, looks good on the car and works for what I needed it for.
B00QUBN0M8|5|Perfect!
B003OA21KA|5|Fits perfectly, stays put. I read the other reviews about how bulky it is, I disagree. Simply roll it up and store it in your SUV, it's not like there isn't room in this size car.
B00WW28T16|1|I have used a lot product of JDM Astar but this product failed...It should not be on the market...I have concerned about it will interfere the radio. I will double check on that...but again the brightness is not noticeable at night.
B0022ZF0BA|5|Perfect for making your Harley clean and fabulous. Great on Chrome. A must have.
B00F7HD6VQ|1|I love this sticker.  It is so funny.  I really and truly don't run.  One time we thought our toddler was missing. (Turns out he was in the bathroom, washing his hands.)  When he didn't answer right away I RAN outside yelling his name and looking for him.  My other children were shocked.  Mommy never ran!  But I digress.<br /><br />My brother is a marathon runner and I am so proud of him.  But I don't run and that is okay with me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I bought and put this sticker on my clean car.  But when my car got covered with snow/ice, the sticker came off and could not be used again.  Bummer.
B003E22UCC|5|Installed these on my 2009 328i and love them!  As others have posted, the initial 'bite' from the OEM organic pads is gone, but not by much.  These pads still bite and are quite capable of quick/smooth stops.  Add to it, I've driven for nearly a week on them and NO DUST...NONE!  I worked for nearly an hour to clean the inside of the wheels before I remounted and can still see the gray paint!  Now my back wheels are starting to powder...guess it's time to swap those out too!<br /><br />Excellent product, excellent price, excellent results!
B00XNZ2ZZM|5|HAVE BOUGHT MANY ITEMS,ALWAYS SUPER NICE PRODUCTS,HAS ITEMS YOU CAN NOT FIND,FAST SHIPPING,THANK YOU
B0011FLODA|5|great fit
