B001GAOY5U|4.0|I ordered this from Amazon and twice they sent me the 2d version only..  After the second time I spoke to a Rep and he stated that after further investigation,   Amazon only has the 2d version of this movie and when they get in the 3d Version they will   send out e-mails to the costumers who called in and will allow you to repurc hase the correct one..    That is nice but STILL the wrong description is on their web site, they should at least correct that instead of   steering new costumers in the wrong direction.   Finaly I purchased the 3d version from Wal-mart and they also sent me the wrong disk 2d only but they quickly overnighted the correct one to me the 3d version.     All in all the kids love the 2d version and the 3D version on my 60\\" screen projection Tv.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This CD was for my daughter who has been a fan of Jimi's since she was a teen ager. She was so greatful to get this CD, because she had lost her's years ago. It was in good condition and the seller was right on the money with the discription and the mailing. She will be enjoying this CD for years to come.

1592402038|5.0|Although this book may be thought of as a language arts reference dealing with punctuation usage, it is also a valuable resource for songwriters who have difficulty getting the cadence or flow of their words to align properly with musical beats.   The exploration of the use and effect of a comma in this book is, in essence, a discussion of a major element of prosody and lyrical white space, concepts best elucidated in  [[ASIN:097777080X Songcrafters' Coloring Book: The Essential Guide to Effective and Successful Songwriting]].   The misplacements of accents in lyrics is a common problem,  and this book can help.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|This movie might have actually been ok if JJ Abrams actually made HIS OWN original universe and NOT lazily twisted that of Roddenberry's. Granted, the Star Trek movies needed a shot in the arm, especially after that last Next Gen lemon of a movie written by a \\"Trekker\\" with no life, BUT this was NOT the answer. The idea that Kirk right out of the academy at the start of the flick is put in command of the Federation's newest and most high tech flagship by the end of the movie was bad enough, but the manufactured, contrived story line to put Lenard Nimoy back in time by destroying his home planet reminded me of the lame Star Trek movie \\"Generations\\". The high point performances in the movie were the characters of Uhura, Scotty and especially Dr Mckoy....the rest of the performances were seriously out of character to the point of stupidity. (Could Spock have been played as a bigger weenier?)Really JJ, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HAVE THE GUTS TO MAKE YOUR OWN UNIVERSE? The large, cavernous insides of a ship that is made to travel in space, go into battle and seal itself again hull breaches was retarded as also the were pop gun phasers used. Some sets in the movie, most notable the engineering scene, looked like they were put together in the same way as the old 1960's made for TV \\"Batman\\" sets. The Plot again was so predictable as to be embarrassing to watch. Yet the movie made money...so there will no doubt be another.. and after the sad Next Generations movies... well , even this JJ Abrams production looks ..well, no THAT bad.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Rihanna has had an image so carefully calcuated that the public knew very little about her.  Fast forward to her domestic dispute with Chris Brown and suddenly Rihanna's personal life became very interesting to the public.  It is clear listening to \\"Rated R\\" that this album is very much a reflection of the place she is in her life.    Rated R is very much \\"In your face\\".  The lyrics are direct, to the point and rarely hold back. The beats on this album are more bold and edgier than ever before.  Synthesizers, electric guitars, voice overs, and pounding bass are the main weapons of choice on Rated R.     \\"Hard\\", the current single, and arguably the best track on the album, features a sound bigger and more powerful than ever before.   Perhaps a shout out to Lady Gaga, Rihanna is letting the world know that nobody is taking her place.  \\"Russian Roullete\\" is uncomfortable and honest while \\"Rockstar\\" celebrates the dynasty Rihanna and her handlers have created.        There is an honesty in this disc that is exciting.  Wether this new crafted image is Rihanna's or her record companies, it is refreshing, exciting and surprisingly genuine.
0805091742|5.0|As in all of his work, Dr. Gawande latest book brilliantly reminds us all of the huge value of getting the human interaction side right to accompany the advancements in science and technology that his (and other's) field of work has witnessed. It highlights the inadequacy of technical expertise when not joined by an equal (maybe greater) emphasis on strengthening our relationships with those we work with and care about.  Though the medical narrative is gripping, I challenge you to not be moved by so many of the other stories of people under complex pressure trying to get things right.  The beautifully written examples of Wal-Mart and Katrina and of Mr. Hagerman are worth far more than the price of the book just on their own.

0765322889|1.0|A friend recommended this series to me after hearing that I liked George RR Martin's amazing books, so I was eager to sink my teeth into it. However, that eagerness quickly turned to severe disappointment and boredom, and I had an extremely hard time forcing myself to finish this book with the hopes that it would pick up and improve by the end. (It didn't.)<br /><br />All of the reviewers who claim that anyone who doesn't like the books just isn't *smart* enough or *patient* enough to handle the sheer awesomeness need to seriously get over themselves. Regardless of the fact that this is the first book in a series, it should be able to stand on its own as a single publication/book. That's why it's published that way.<br /><br />This is a single book, and readers shouldn't have to be told that they have to read other, later books, in order to get any enjoyment or meaning out of the experience. This book should have some information or plotline self-contained enough to be worth reading... but it doesn't. There is a huge difference between letting readers fill in the blanks themselves while still providing a basic framework and doing what Erikson does, which is tossing out random things and calling that a foundation, shabby as it is. There's not a gap between the reader and Erikson--there's an impassable VOID of knowledge.<br /><br />Erikson is probably a great dungeon master for a D&D campaign because he's obviously  put a lot of thought and effort into the surroundings of the world and the history, geography, and large-scale politics within that. I do give him props for that.<br /><br />However, if I could sum up Erikson's writing in one or two words, those would have to be: flat. Incoherent. His characters are flat and empty, with no real characterization or motives for anything that they do. They're written with very little to no description of either their appearances, personalities, or pasts, and the actions that they take seem completely illogical at times. Rather than focusing on storylines or fleshing out a few main characters, Erikson takes the approach of jumping from place to place and person to person constantly, meaning that when you still have no idea who the previous characters are or what they're about, he's already moved on to (barely) introducing new characters for you to spend your time not caring about.<br /><br />I get the impression that in Erikson's mind, things are well developed and make sense, but he's obviously had trouble translating that onto the page. The whole book feels like it was written by him FOR him, meaning it has the stylistic assumption that we're already familiar with the personalities and backgrounds of the characters within, rather than just constantly being barraged by new characters we really don't know anything about.<br /><br />The plots and subplots are so poorly explained and developed, and so inconsistent, that the whole book comes across as lacking any kind of major focus or progression. There is no good pacing to anything that happens, and inconsequential events and characters are treated equally with the things we are supposed to assume are important.<br /><br />There's no reason for a reader to invest themselves in a book where there's no reason to care about the characters or anything that happens. For how detailed and complex some aspects of the book are, the characters are nothing if not shallow and empty, and a \\"plot\\" of any cohesive kind is near-impossible to find. In addition, the author really could've used a good editor, as there are a lot of grammatically incorrect/awkward sentences and needlessly convoluted phrasing.<br /><br />In the end, I got almost to the end of the book before I actually said out loud, \\"This is just awful,\\" and had to put it down, and I rarely find myself unable to finish a book. In the end, I'm really glad I picked this up at the library instead of buying it.or fleshing out a few main characters, Erikson takes the approach of jumping from place to place and person to person constantly, meaning that when you still have no idea who the previous characters are or what they're about, he's already moved on to (barely) introducing new characters for you to spend your time not caring about.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Each succeeding series of Doctor Who has been better than the last, thus far, and there's a reason for that: everyone who works on the show cares madly.    Although Series Three still claims the single best ep of the rebooted program [the freakishly scary \\"Blink\\"], Series Four introduces an alien race that play a major role in the life [and death] of the Fourth Doctor [David Tennant], the Ood. We also get to meet The Doctor's Daughter [whom I hope we see again] and witness a crossover of all three programs set in the Whoniverse [Doctor Who, of course, Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures], plus a confluence of companions.    The series continues to make us laugh, cry and gasp [frequently at the same time] and remains as exhilarating and quirky as ever.    Plus, when it comes to bonus features, we get a surfeit of goodies: commentaries [featuring combinations of writers, directors, cast members and others] on every episode; Doctor Who Confidential behind the scenes specials for every episode and: David's Video Diaries [only a couple this time 'round]; Deleted Scenes; Teasers & Trailers; a Retrospective Featurette, and the Children in Need Short \\"Time Crash\\" [featuring Doctors Five and Ten].    Once Mr. Tennant's five final specials have been aired, I hope we get as comprehensive a set of them - the current releases, with just one special and one DWC featurette, is definitely lacking [and the Torchwood: Children of Earth set is worse, with just the five chapters and one Torchwood Confidential ep - c'mon people, give us our commentary tracks!].
B00004RFFS|5.0|I have this movie on vhs, but wanted it on dvd, we are in the \\"twilight faze\\", and I wanted to share this movie with my daughter. This movie had the HOTTEST VAMPIRES!!! I also ordered the Twilight Saga for my daughter (all 4 books) for amazon at the same time. Amazon is the best place to order on-line. The service is quick and I've never have a problem in the years I have been ordering from them. A must have movie for you vampire collection.

B000001FS3|3.0|Where for two songs they're ready for the history books;  where for two songs the Edge waxes universal; where for much of the lp, he masters the possibilities of dynamic delayed guitar--the jangly guitars and atmospheric production that surpass even The Feelies and The Woodentops. Hardly a movie couldn't (doesn't?) use the first two cuts as a soundtrack. Instead, for the next 4 songs you hear as the Mekons aptly characterized: \\"the Dublin messiah just scattering crumbs.\\" Best to stand a  distance from Bono. Maybe he's more prophetic now as owner of Forbes magazine? The added expertise of Eno/Lanois remains (if only they didn't hold back so on Larry Mullen jr.) But alas, no one can save Bono, and therefore, the further you get in, the more you hear the background music; or...the soundtrack.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|The most special effects I've seen in a movie. They probably used $1.5 million per minute. You can't see the difference between computer generated people and ordinary people anymore, between what's real and what is special effects. The movie is one of the best ever made.    The story was a bit predictable, but the rest was all a surprise.
0385504225|1.0|Let's see there Robert Langdon the ever so bland, tweed jacketed protagonist that every female protagonist in the books seems to have some sort of ambiguous romantic connection with.  A couple of characters who you are not sure whose side they are on and of course the gimp-like S&M, muscular religious psychopath.  How many of these books can we take?  I can't take anymore.  The plot was a ridiculously jumbled mass of history and legend.  The book should have probably ended 100 pages earlier.  I would rather read a Nicholas Sparks book before reading another Dan Brown book (and that is REALLY bad).
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This is it. The most definitive, best sounding career encompassing Bee Gees collection. Well worth purchase even if you have prior collections. Can't beat the sound and although everyone can always point to a song or two they wished was on it, I honestly can't think of any gross omission. A minor quibble, it would have been nice to have studio versions of the live songs, but I understand most of these songs were never released by the Bee Gees in studio versions.<br /><br />Crank it up loud. These great songs have never sounded better. No matter what Bee Gees era you prefer they sound incredible in this package. So, if you desire one Bee Gees CD, this is it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The T.V. version on HBo was good, very good. But the novels are much better! I still enjoyed the True Blood first season and second season also. Can not wait until it is out on DVD also.<br />The series does not adhere to the orginal novels a lot. More things happen in the novels. The novels also have a different twist to it. Not saying that the HBO series is bad or anything, because it is not. I enjoyed it very much. This is a great DVD, from a Greater book series.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|There are those that like Tarentino, that \\"get\\" what he's trying to do, and those that probably don't, just as there are those that love and alternately loathe other directors (like Woody Allen, for example).  A disclaimer...I like Tarentino, so perhaps this can't be qualified as unbiased, but still, I so thoroughly enjoyed this 2 1/2 hour movie that I had to chime in with kudos for director and cast.<br /><br />Ultra-violent (hey, if you were expecting something else, you picked the wrong director), witty, well-paced and expertly acted (over-the-top by a mile, but hey, that requires a skill set of its own), the 150 minutes fly by, and even the non-action scenes (the bar for example) have a frentic pace and tension of their own.<br /><br />Tarentino makes you \\"like\\" his characters quickly, and become involved in the story because of this.  Even the minor roles have such depth that you want to find out more about them.  So many movies feature a great plot, but lack of interesting players ultimately dooms it to a \\"one-watch\\" movie...the reason you can watch and rewatch movies like this and Pulp Fiction is the engrossing nature of what is accomplished through expert direction and acting.  That, and the constant surprise twists and quick deaths of main characters keep your focus long into the second hour.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds does retribution like no other movie about WWII has thus far, and even though it devles into the satirical at times, its point is made well.  Highly recommended (for the non-squeamish).
B00006J3WH|4.0|This is GREAT! Loved this particular episode, and its so nice to have the music. I actually bought two - one for me, and one as a gift for a buddy. All original music, and the actors sing their own songs. There's also some extra tracks with music from other episodes.<br /><br />If they reprint it, I hope they include the song that Anya sings later in another episode that flashes back to this one. Too fun!!<br /><br />Only thing to watch - one CD was fine, the other acted a little oddly, spun very noisily, when used in the car. Oh, well, totally worth it.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|The Dark Knight is a visually stunning, multi-layered, mind blowing ride.  The story is so deep it's impossible to take it all in on the initial viewing.  Heath Ledger plays the Joker to maniacal perfection.  He is by far the best Joker I've ever seen (sorry Jack).  He is the first actor to make the Joker frightening.  As much as it pains people to know they will have to replace Ledger in subsequent chapters as this was just the beginning of the Joker and Batman.  I also thought including the cameo of Scarecrow was a nice touch.      As usual Christian Bale was an excellent Batman, but I feel that something is lacking in his portrayal of Bruce Wayne.  It may not be his fault even.  I've always viewed Bruce Wayne as a tormented soul who views the mantle of the bat as a bane in his life.  Nolan's Batman almost seems uncomfortable as Bruce Wayne and would rather be the bat and leave his life as Bruce Wayne behind.      The film is dark and brooding as a Batman movie should be.  It runs a bit long and my wife often points out that it took her 3 separate viewings to make it all the way through.  I still feel that it is an amazing film that was sorely overlooked at the Oscars.
B000UJ24SC|4.0|This album is a pretty solid release from dahlia.  I like deflorate more but its still good.  Best songs are everything went black, what a horrible night to have a curse, i worship only what you bleed, deathmask divine and warborn.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Read most of the reviews on this site. Most mention the acting or Claire Danes. To me what set this series apart from anything else is the members of the cast they addded. Jeff Perry who played Mr. Katimski, Lisa Waltz who played Hallie Lowenthal and Senta Mosses who played Delia Fisher all came on this show after it had already had at least 5 epsidoes. I think  the creators were smart enough to know they needed a bit more. These 3 charcters addded so much to the show without taking away what was already there. Mr Katimski  scenes with Rickie, Hallie with Graham and Delia with Brian and Rickie are some of the very best.  Fans of the show go back and watch the scenes involving Mr Katimski , Hallie and Delia and tell me if you dont agree that they are some of the very best.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|Puccini's tearjerker opera is much more enjoyable on stage, then on this film. I recommend to everyone, who haven't done it yet, to see a DVD of this opera [with or without Netrebko and Villazon], where the singers do not just simply \\"mouth\\" the arias, are not hampered by the extreme close-ups, and sing through the whole opera in one singular time period. A lot is lost in the filming process!  Robert

0312330537|1.0|A friend recommended this book, so I vowed to finish all 900 plus pages of it even though halfway through I could see there would be little value in doing so. The author's point, I think, is that love can conquer all and you can determine your own fate, or something like that. But the problems with this book are many.     First, it is hard to sympathize with the main character, an escaped criminal who lost his wife and child to his heroin addiction, which he turned to robbery to support. Although he seeks meaning and salvation throught the book, not once does he make an attempt to atone for the robberies or apologize to his wife and child - which would seem like the obvious first step. There are too many characters most of whom are incidental to the main plot. Less than 50 pages before the end of the book, he is still introducing new characters. His ability as a writer is uneven - sometimes the descriptions are decent, usually the action scenes or the conversations. Too often though he throwns in his shallow, homespun liberal philosophy, ruining the momentum. All these factors and more detract from what could be a very exciting story if it had more focus, more of an overriding theme to it all.     At its best, when he simply reports events as they happen, the book can be quite moving, if not completely believable - for example the way the slum village elder deals with two boys fighting and a man beating his wife. Too often though his descriptions miss the mark, sometimes laugably so - \\"Money isn't the root of all evil. EVIL is the root of all money\\" or \\"happiness is a myth, it was invented to make us buy things\\" - or at their worst, blissfully ignorant of the facts, for example, the so-called cause for Palestinian statehood.    You can see the plot coming from miles away - I won't reveal the details in case you really really want to read this book - but, just don't expect to be surprised by anything that happens, much less care about all the many characters, few ofwhom have any redeeming values and most of whom meet senseless deaths. After a while you just stop caring about all of them.      This book can't decide what it wants to be - action/adventure, a traveologue about India, an exploration of the meaning of life, or a sappy romance. It tries to be all of the above and succeeds at none. Ultimately it is a triumph of quantity over quality.     And about all the reviewers who say, \\"the best book I've ever read.\\" Click on \\"see all my reviews\\" beside the reviewer's name. Chances are, it's the ONLY book they've reviewed. Kinda makes you wonder.

B001AQO3WY|2.0|I loved the characters, the relationships between the guys, the acting, the special effects--you really come to love these guys.    What kills the whole thing is half way through the movie the Political Agenda starts to creep in--complete with \\"Why are we here? What's it all for? We're baby killers!\\" reminiscent of bad Vietnam movies.    The end of the film depicts our heroes watching a \\"home movie\\" that shows dead bodies as the song \\"When the Man Comes Around\\" plays, and the heroes slowly walk off in self-loathing and disgust.     I walked away from this film in disgust, as well.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is a classic...a favorite of a 50ish son and a gift for him. So, I got a copy for myself too. We'd just seen a production of \\"Music Man Jr.\\" and it brought back to mind our pleasure in the wonderful work.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|The reason this album is shy of a star is the fact these songs are featured not only on his famous albums, but his greatest hits as well.  These are songs that were supposed to be featured in his \\"This Is It\\" concert in London.   I have to say that this compilation is a nice selection of his work.  If you get the two cd version of this album you will get a beautiful rendition of \\"She is Out Of My Life\\" accompanied with acoustic guitar.  Also the \\"Beat It\\" vocal track is interesting.  It's all the harmonized parts sung without any instruments.    I honestly do not know whether songs like the acoustic version of  \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" and the live version of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" were sung recently by Michael.  If the answer is yes than I am amazed of how his voice was eternally youthful.  No signs of wearing down what so ever.  As for the other famous studio songs like \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Man In The Mirror\\" on this album what can I say?  More likely you have heard any of his famous songs in your lifetime and I am sure you have your own opinion.
B001UV4XUQ|1.0|My Oppo BD-83 blu ray player has never hit a snag in six months of use (even when I was using it during their beta program, it played all DVD's and Blu-Rays).  Then it met \\"Summer.\\"  The disc started to play a trailer and halted in the middle. Then it jumped to the main menu. There, despite hitting every \\"play\\" and/or \\"select\\" button on the remote to advance, it would do nothing except provide the universal circle with the red line through it on the upper left screen.  I tried close to 10 times, reloading and so on. Nothing worked.  I double-checked live to the Internet for the latest firmware updates. But my player is up to date.  When I tried another disc, the player briefly had a problem until I restarted everything again.  My player definitely did not like Summer or whatever Fox has put on this disc that is causing the problem.  Beware.
B00003CXRM|1.0|Oh, brother!!!  The only reason I was interested in & purchased this film was because I understood it spurred a revival of interest in bluegrass music.  How fully disappointed I am!  This film is offensive and pointless from the get-go, with profanity and misuse of the Name throughout.  The portrayal of the people of the Deep South during the Depression is of a vulgar, common folk who cannot think for themselves or formulate an idea of depth, full of hate and mistrust toward one another, with the protagonist being the lone thinker in the entire cast.  What a useless waste of time!  I fast-forwarded through much of it, seeking to at least find a song here or there to give the film credence.  Even that was disappointing, as only during the credits at the end were there a couple of songs that weren't interrupted by absurdity.  I feel terrible that I wasted ten dollars on it.  I initially thought that I'd sell it or give it away once it was over, as I knew I had NO further use of it; however, it is now packed away neatly in its case at the bottom of my trash bin.  Please invest your money and your time in something of value, not this garbage!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I grew up with The Lost Boys, Anne Rice, Buffy, so I was eager to watch True Blood when it came out in 2008. I watched the series on HBO and then bought the DVD set before I ever picked up the books. Now that I've caught up with all of the books, there are drawbacks to each. I can certainly \\"see\\" the characters better putting a face with the books. I understand that the secondary characters had to be developed to flesh out the rest of the show (i.e., Jason, Tara (who's not even in book one), and Lafayette (who's barely in book one). Bill's \\"child\\" came totally out of nowhere, but I absolutely loved her character on the show, and looking forward to more of her.      I understand that we HAD to see beyond Sookie, I get that, but I hope the development of these secondary characters don't overshadow Sookie. She is the show and for the most part, I like Anna Paquin's portrayal. It will certainly be interesting to see what Alan Ball does with Bill's character  as other contenders for Sookie emerge (she practically has a harem of men). Since he's been cast as a lead, I don't see Stephen Moyer really going anywhere, plus his engagement to Anna Paquin is also setting the stage for more Bill in the TV series. I'm hopeful that Alan Ball will allow Bill's image to get \\"dirty\\" and I don't mean crawling out the ground covered in dirt dirty. His later actions in the books should even up the playing field for the villification done to Eric Northman's character. Alexander Skarsgard lives fully up to his role as Eric, even though we see so little of him in the first season. His second-in-command, Pam, is also a delight both on the screen and in the books, so I was very excited to see she was pushed up to a cast regular!     Anxiously awaiting Season 2 on DVD, and hopeful that I pursuade the hubby to let us get HBO again, so I can stay caught up with Season 3!
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I am a sucker for a happy ending...and this has a good one.  Also grew up in the 80's so enjoyed very much.

1439157383|3.0|***Spoiler*** though why I bother with the warning I don't know, I seem to be the last person to read it.  It is a really good little novel with the appearance of careful research, thought provoking issues, and believable (although sometimes not very likable characters.  Right up to the ending which is out of place and medically implausible. Plus I choked on the pixie dust.  I would have much rather read a longer novel that made some sense of the events (and gave the kid more than fifteen minutes to recover before pinching her toe and declaring her brain dead, then removing her organs while she is still alive - Need lightening emoticon)   I will probably read reviews of Ms. Picault's other novels and read more carefully selected ones - I do like her style when she's not chopping off the end and getting it in the mail.
0545123267|5.0|I'm not going to write this long review, so that I can give the main story away. The only thing that I'm going to tell you, is you desperately need to read this book. I read the whole thing in like 4 hours. It's amazing, and frankly, I would give it a million stars, if possible. This book is told from 2 perspectives, and I fell in love with Sam, and felt compassion for Grace. This book brings soo many emotions to the front, for the reader. You feel what the character felt, and you love with the character. It's so important that you read it, and find out for yourself, how truly great this book is. CANT WAIT FOR LINGER! (the 2nd book to the first one.)
159102594X|5.0|I picked this up in an airport, a long flight to sit through. I started reading, and then I just didn't stop. 5 hour flight, didn't stop, collecting luggage didn't stop, taxi home still reading. Home, kiss the wife, eat some food, go to bed so I can keep reading. Slept at 4, woke at 7, off to work. On the subway, still reading. \\"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous\\" I think to myself as I duck out of the office to sit in a coffee shop and knock back 10 pages, to get a fix.... \\"Just one more page....\\"    If you like good writing and can handle fantasy (Some people just flat out can't) Buy this book. In a year, you will push aside old Eddings and Salvatore in your haste to reread it. It has pride of place on my shelf, and I recommend it to everyone.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I have watched this movie more than a few times in many variations and for me this is the ideal culmination of this film. The soundtrack, visual quality and final cut by the director Ridley Scott is the way this film should always have been viewed.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|A great movie for all ages...Hitchcock, Kelly, and Grant--a great combination, filmed in sunny France.
B000OIZSVY|5.0|I cannot read all 560 reviews to see if someone has addressed this, so.... I picked up the sample to check out on my Kindle. It seems that there is a British edition of this book, and a North American edition. There are apparently some differences between the two, addressed in the preface to her North American version. The Kindle version, however, is the British one. Just a warning for American Kindle readers - thought people should know. I wish we had a choice between the two. I live in Europe right now, but generally reside in North America.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Such a collection of refreshing new artistry! Alicia Keys at her piano, what else could one wish for at Christmas. Element of Freedom is a perfect good-bye to the first decade of 2000, perfect hello to a fresh new year. Keys infused joy into the songs, we LOVE the album, changes of style & all! She's a beautiful soul!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|It was good the 2nd and 3rd Time it is a must own for any one who likes Action movies.

B000069KGM|5.0|There is no need to waste your time with pseudo-intellectual garbage. Pick up this album, find a place with natural reverberation, put it on speaker, and let Chicago Transit Authority speak to you.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|We saw the Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas in November. Love this CD. It brings back many wonderful memories.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|This combo album is outstanding if you are a Beatles/Paul McCartney fan.  You get a DVD with the concert and two CDs with the music tracks.  What more could you ask for.  The price is right, the music fidelity is really good.  I plan to give some of these as gifts during 2010 especially for young people.  Perhaps I can help to create new Beatles fans.
B000002UWE|5.0|Great album, all the songs in this album are great, i recommend this album to everyone !!! a must buy !!!
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Without a doubt, My Christmas, is the best of the Christmas concerts! Andrea's voice is magical and David Foster is a genius with his arrangements and accompaniment. The stage setting was gorgeous and the gowns and tuxes confirmed the definition of Classy.    The musical guests blended nicely with his voice and the Morman Tabernacle Choir singing the Our Father was so very special for me as well as the Ave Maria. As an Elvis fan, I was glad Blue Christmas(one of my personal favorites) was included.  Even the Muppets evoked a smile and some chuckles with Jingle Bells - the slow then stepped up version. As I write I am smiling about the last comment.    Andrea's singing the favorite carols and ending with the most beloved of all - White Christmas - made for enjoyable viewing time and will, in my opinion, become a classic. I will be watching it over and over during the Christmas season and sharing it with my friends.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Unlike most science fiction movies, this movie uses fake news reels and fake interviews to develop the plot. The plot, despite the gore and curse words, is fantastic and memorable, it involves the main character changing into an alien, then befriending an alien in the hope he can change back into a human. This movie combines a Science Fiction movie with a documentary, and has a well developed plot that makes it one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Having seen the show Britain's Got Talent when Susan Boyle was climbing her way to the finals and when Simon's jaw dropped when she hit the first note of I Dreamed A Dream I knew this was the kind of music and musician I wanted in my collection of CDs.     Having read some of the reviews I can't add anything new. Love her voice, love the song choices and her reasons for selecting those particular songs.  If there is a negative it would be that a couple upbeat songs should have been included for some variety.    Having been a Broadway Musical fan for many years, I hope her next album is all Broadway tunes.  I think this is where she will shine, although that might not have the mass appeal that is desired.    Congratulations Susan on a brilliant first CD.
B00275EGWY|5.0|A great movie that was suspenseful all the way through. I saw this movie and gained great appreciation for all troops, and then saw a second time and noticed so much more. A great movie that is even better the second time!
B001E75QGG|5.0|5 of 5 stars for the action-adventure movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Really nice to have Indiana Jones back after two decades. Older, smarter and a bit slower, but, still the Indy we all know and love. The movie opens with the Russians (oh, we're in the 1950's now) trying to break-into Area 51 to recover an artifact. They've brought Jones as a hostage and to find the artifact in the storage warehouse. From there, we're on a typical Indie quest. I can tell you that there is a Crystal Skull (or two) involved. We do see the return of Marian (Karen Allen) as Indie's lost girlfriend. There are other surprises in this movie.<br /><br />Expertly crafted and on par with all three previous Indie movies.Richly photographed, great sets, great action and fun chases. I have added this movie to my list of favorites and highly recommend it! This is a two bag-of-popcorn feature movie! Let's hope for more adventures in the future.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Absolutely hilarious, a great zombie flick that is defiantly worth buying. I went and saw this movie and laughed the whole entire time, there is not a dull moment in the entire movie.
B00003CXXP|2.0|2 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Frankly, I'd give this movie a 1 of 5 stars, however, it is really well made with great photography and clean special effects, so it gets a 2 of 5. Set in the future where a company made a mechanical boy. The kid who played the robot did a good job. The story is insanely dull and excessively long at 2h25min. If they cut about 1h from the movie it would be OK and get a higher rating. Sorry, I do not recommend this movie; BTW, I lasted 1h30 before quitting for something else.
0142410705|1.0|I wanted to like \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\". I have loved every single one of John Green's novels, because he is a good writer, and usually develops a good story. I do not compare his books to each other whatsoever, because I honestly hate it when readers complain that one novel isn't like the others. So FYI- I'm judging this unbiased, considering.    This.. Is, unfortunately, not a very great story. At all.    I'm an avid reader. I love reading subjectively, and getting pulled into books. However, I couldn't get into this book, and it was really, really hard to finish. And the plot was really, really boring. I thought that the basis of a road trip would bring excitement and thrills- Unfortunately this is really not the case. There was nothing within the pages that was really noteworthy. They end up in a town that isn't noteworthy, where a lot of uninteresting characters are introduced, and an abundance of uninteresting things occur.     I ended up returning the novel, knowing that I would never read it again. It's maybe okay to read once- It wasn't complete torture, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing the book.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I recieved my DVD earlier than expected and it was in fantastic shape. Played beautifully. I would definately buy from this seller again.
1881273156|5.0|The book is a great read for a couple. My husband and I have been reading it together at night before going to sleep. It really opens your eyes to some things that maybe we have ignored in the past or were just not aware of. I would reccomend this book to every couple. I hope your love tank gets filled!
1400076943|4.0|Great book....I really enjoyed reading it.  I will look for more books by this author and recommend it to others...Also sold at a great price with timely delivery.
0307269981|5.0|I could go on and on like all of these long winded bloke but I'm not trying to impress you I'm trying to tell you not to be an idiot and read this trilogy.  Or feel free to be an idiot that just makes me look better.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|In viewing Disk 2 of the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD of Shrek [[ASIN:B00003CXXJ Shrek (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], I noticed that this widescreen version looked somewhat cropped. I compared it to the full screen version and found that, indeed, the top and bottom areas of the full screen version are missing in the widescreen version.    While I absolutely love the original Shrek, my great joy in viewing the widescreen version of any movie is seeing all of the image that was originally shot.  Somehow that did not occur in the transfer to DVD in this \\"widescreen\\" version.     This Two-Disc Special Edition is out of print, but it is currently the ONLY way to obtain any widescreen DVD of the first Shrek movie. It is my hope that IF they ever re-release the DVD in widescreen it will show the entire image area that was shot.
B0000AE8RU|1.0|It's hard to believe how bad this recording is of this most beautiful work. I purchased it because it was one of the few with an ending written by a contemporary, and not usually heard. (Mozart died before he finished the work) It took a long time to arrive , but the worst thing was the sound and the performances. Unfortunate, as this is little better than amateur, and should not be sold as a professional recording, as it is definitely not. Too bad, my loss, but Amazon should have some criterion for selling this stuff. I'm not pleased. Amateur of certainly OK, but not to be sold for a hefty price. DON'T BUY.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|[[ASIN:B002KSPKRS Ear Force X41 Digital RF Wireless Game Audio+ Chat with Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound]]    OK, I first must emphasize that I do not play online gaming so I can't give any review as to the microphone and its integrated sound quality with the earphones. With that said I think the X41's are simply fantastic albeit I have nothing else to compare them to.  First let me preface this as to why I purchased them. Actually there are several reasons I made the decision to purchase a set of headphones.    I'm 62 and certainly not an avid gamer but I really enjoy a few choice games as in FPS and to some extent driving games simply to get away from the intense shooting associated with FPS games. My eyesight is not the greatest and while playing MW2 I noticed that I could not always see the dialogue printed on the screen and at the same time I could not always make out the dialogue being shouted out to me over the background of the shooting noise. I have my T.V. and the Xbox set up in a room where I happen to keep a very lovable African Grey parrot (it's more or less her room) and if I turned up the sound on the T.V. too much it seemed to bother her and rightfully so. Also the sound quality coming from the built in T.V speakers, although quite acceptable, is certainly not the greatest. Ergo...the decision to search for some good headphones to satisfy my gaming experience and of course to alleviate driving my poor parrot out of the room!    I'm very confident that the sound quality of these headphones would never make the mark for listening to music but for gaming I find the quality just great albeit it may not be stellar. As for the reported issues of popping and hissing noises I've not experienced anything of the sort. Also, someone mentioned that turning them on can be somewhat of a pain but I'm totally lost on that comment. You simply turn on the transmitter, sit back and then turn on the phones and you're set to go! It may be that there is more to it when playingon line but as I mentioned earlier I never do so. All I all I would strongly recommend the X41's and I'm now enjoying a whole new enjoyable experience when I decide to sit back and do a bit of gaming. The only thing I was VERY disappointed in is that I had to switch out my HDMI connector (which I just recently purchased!) and go back to the Xbox HD AV cable.
B002SJIO54|5.0|Do not be fooled by the negative reviews for this movie. Consider that Peter Jackson likely would not add his name to a nonsense effort.  Unquestionably, DISTRICT 9 is the most unusual movie you may ever see, but the effort to do so is worth just that. The first 20mins is a wee bit of a turn-off, simply because the format and setting are so different from what we have come to expect from movies in general.  The story, the acting, virtually everything about the movie are apart from the norm ... but, the story, the acting and everything about this movie come together quickly and take hold of your attention as if it all were from a good book you just cannot put down.  Sit back, pay attention, listen carefully (actors and accents are South African), be patient, you will find yourself caught up in the unusual and, like I did, you will find yourself enjoying the story, the acting, the setting, and pulling for the good to win through. A unique experience to be experienced. I am right about this as were the other reviewers who provided great feedback for this contribution to movie making.
1878424505|4.0|Ruiz's book is simple and straightforward, and easy to read.  While the reader may not take every word literally, there is enough value and Toltec-based wisdom in the Four Agreements that I found the book good enough to give to a number of friends and business clients. Not revolutionary, but common sense thinking that bears some investigating and thought.  Happy reading.
B000W799NU|3.0|I enjoyed it in the theater, and it made a good gift for my sister, but personally, I'd just get it from the library instead of paying for it.
0345452585|5.0|Delivery was timely as promised. The item was the exact quality promised. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I recently moved into a 2 family home where I have neighbors above me. I have a nice surround system but I can't really turn it up much because of this. (especially at night) So I started to look into different headphone options. There were a lot of choices in the market. While other pairs seemed like they could do about the same things for similar or even less money, Turtle Beach is the leader and was hoping that this would maybe offer more consistency in the quality as well as good tech support. I decided to spend the extra money for the X41. I have had friends who bought the X31's and loved them, but I wanted the surround sound. Now about 3-4 years ago I bought a pair of wireless headphones and ended up returning them. They seemed to have a bunch of noise in them and the range sucked. Well, those problems seems to be gone now, thankfully. I love the fact that you don't need another power outlet. You can use the USB on your Xbox to power the base. There is no analog audio pass through, which is a little puzzling. My guess is that they really want people to use the optical and do surround sound, which I am sure most will do anyhow since they are paying extra for it. An optical pass-through is included though. This means I can still use the surround on my receiver at the same time. I've got Dish Network high def box, A PS3, and a Call of Duty MW2 special Edition Xbox 360 all hooked into the TV with HDMI. The TV has an optical out which passes the signal of surround to the Headphones as well as the surround receiver (Pioneer VSX1019AHX) I am using. You really can hear surround sound in the headphones. I was skeptical, but they actually came through. When playing MW2, you can hear EVERYTHING. You hear little rocks falling, You hear the snow crunch, and more importantly, you hear the enemy footsteps. The gunfire and explosions sound amazing. And everything is directional. When a harrier is hovering, you hear what direction it's coming from. Same for Left for Dead 2. You can hear what direction the witch is in, something that is hard to do on many TV's. The bass is deep and rich. You have great volume control. You can adjust volume on the game sounds or the chat. My only complaint on the headphones is that it's hard to hear your own voice on game chat.  The headphones also work when using my PS3. The only difference is that you cannot use it for PS3 chat. But it still sounds killer for games. You can even watch TV and use these to listen to at night. Heck it would even be good for someone who is hard of hearing and needs them to hear without blasting everyone else out. They are more comfortable than most wireless headphones I've tried on. (or wired for that matter)  I can't think of much anything bad to say about these. I'm very pleased with the quality all around. I wish they were a little cheaper, but I guess you really do get what you pay for. They could lower the price, but then they end up taking out features.  I do wish they would have done an internal lithium ion rechargable battery. I think I'm going to look for some high end rechargeable batteries for this.  Amazon has the best price on these that I could find. This is not a heavily discounted item. Most of the sets on Ebay were higher. These ship directly from Amazon and you pay no shipping and no tax (for most that is. Apparently there is tax in at least NJ. I am not sure where else).  It only took 6 days total from the day I ordered them for it to be on my doorstep. And this is during the week before Xmas!  Kudos to Turtle Beach and Amazon as well. One very happy Customer.    Edit- From time to time you may experience poping and clicking from interference in the room from other wireless products. Mine tend to do so every so often. Not enough to be bad, but enough to mention.
B002I6251G|3.0|British bands on their third album always do so with a desperation that belies their creativity.<br /><br />This sounds like warmed over She Wants Revenge.  While derivative isn't a big thing to LA bands, England has a richer heritage.<br /><br />Take your time next time, band. While I like this album it's too pretentious and deliberate to warrant the kinds of listens I gave their last album.<br /><br />Electronic music is better left to bands who organically grow it in their sound.<br /><br />This album wreaks of PLEASE MAKE ME POPULAR.<br /><br />3 stars and why don't you tour with Muse?<br /><br />(Oh, and who did they tour with a few months after this review? MUSE. haha.)
B002R68U7K|5.0|this is the fan box, it's beautiful, but there are mistakes with the single \\"3\\".
B00005NOOH|4.0|This is a terrific series on WWII.    However, I like many others, received the set and it had two of the same discs instead of (in my case) the unique second disc.    Additionally, when you purchase through Amazon who essentially sets up a marketplace for the actual seller, Amazon becomes completely useless when it comes to helping you get a replacement disc or a partial refund.    I rcvd the set as a xmas gift from a family member who actually purchases gifts, like, WAY in advance.  Plus, by the time I got around to actually opening the set to view it, it was a couple of months after xmas.    It didn't matter to Amazon customer help that I had the reciept and the actual purchase date and all I wanted was to exchange the duplicate disc for the correct disc.  Too much time had expired from the actual purchase date.  I was able to get to a regional manager before they wouldn't allow me to speak to anyone higher.  They offered to credit the family member's account $10.  Big deal from a multi-billion company that is more concerned with raking in their percentage of your money while keeping their distance from the independent sellers who stink up internet sales.  Now I'm stuck with an incomplete set that someone paid hard earned money for and I'm coming up snake eyes with purchasing just the single disc to complete the collection.  I'm probably going to have to call [...] and beg.    So, again a great series, but I highly recommend you purchase it from a someone more reputable then whom Amazon allows to use their marketing clout to sell defective sets.  And no matter where you buy the set from, make darn sure you open it an inspect it immediately after receiving it.
0385737947|5.0|The Maze Runner is a tremendously gripping work of young adult science fiction. Dashner pulled me into it in chapter one and never let go.  In terms of literary parallels, I would say that The Maze Runner could best be described as Ender's Game meets Lord of the Flies.<br /><br />The character arc of the protagonist Thomas was brilliant. The story begins with Thomas entering a dystopian civilization (called \\"The Glade\\") populated by  unsupervised teenage boys.  Thomas has no memory of anything prior to that moment.  He soon learns that each of the other boys had arrived the same way over a two year period. The Glade sits at the center of a massive and unsolvable maze filled with horrifying and deadly creatures called grievers.<br /><br />Throughout the story, Thomas' character is slowly revealed to the reader as it is being revealed to himself. It was very effective. Throughout most of the book, neither the reader nor the character himself really know whether he is the hero or the villain.<br /><br />The story moves at a blistering pace, barely leaving the reader time to breathe.  Dashner has a very crisp and enjoyable writing style, filled with vivid description that puts the reader directly in the middle of the sights, sounds and action.  The plot twist at the end took me by surprise.  I had thought I had it all figured out...<br /><br />Parents will like the fact that there was no sexual content and the violence did not achieve the level of gore.  The fake profanity was somewhat excessive, though.  Instead of using real swear words (which of course would have been worse), Dashner made up a brand new lexicon of fake profanity.  He then used it fairly gratuitously, which was a bit distracting at times.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a truly great work of YA science fiction - the best I've read in a while.  I would be very surprised if this book does not become an instant classic of the genre.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I decided to ignore the warnings about this movie only playing on updated, internet connected players and I'm glad I did. I just played this on my $98 Magnavox Nb530mgx profile 1.1 player, and....\\"no problemo\\".<br /><br />Terminator 2: Skynet Edition, has a notorious reputation for not working on some newer, more expensive, internet capable Blu Ray players. Many have said it'll only work on a profile 2.0 player or that you need a code for a profile 1.0 player. The Nb530mgx is a profile 1.1 player without a internet connection and it booted up and played just fine. No firmware update or code needed. It took a couple minutes to pull up a message stating that it knows I don't have a profile 2.0 that it's not connected to the internet. That I should get one to take advantage of all the features but that it'll load up anyway. It took another minute and filled in 3 triangles on the same screen and I was at the main menu. I went straight to the extended version, pressed play and it started up as normal. I recommend for those that have it or will buy it, just be patient and let it load up. If it did for mine, I don't see why it won't for yours.<br /><br />There's not much I can say about T2 that hasn't been said 1000 times. It's a classic, still holds up very well, one of Arnolds and James Camerons best movies, good effects, good action scenes and so on and so on. It's all true. You can watch it again and again and it's always good.<br /><br />I found the picture quality to be slightly better than the last T2 Blu Ray, which was disappointingly identical to my upconverted T2: Extreme DVD (which is still a very good version). I wasn't expecting a big leap here so that's fine. It's still very clean and close up shots are nicely detailed. It just doesn't pop like newer transfers.<br /><br />It's the audio that really sells this one with a pleasing improvement over the previous version by providing the lossless, 6.1 DTS-HD audio. For those with capable receivers, it's well worth the double dip.<br /><br />T2: Skynet Edition is definitley THE best T2 to get for the audio and video. I'm sure that many will love the extras and internet enabled features as well. For me, I just want to enjoy it in it's best possible audio and video available and I did and know I will continue to in the future. T2 is a fun film and Amazon has frequently offered the Skynet Edition for $11.99 which is an incredible offer. For those interested, go for it. Although there's no guarantee it'll work in your player, for $11.99, it's worth the risk. Highly recommended.Edition is definitley THE best T2 to get for the audio and video.

B002RSDW80|4.0|\\"Julie & Julia\\" is a thematic biopic based on two sets of memoirs: blogger Julie Powell's book \\"Julie & Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen\\" and Julia Child's memoir \\"My Life in France\\", co-written with her great-nephew Alex Prud'homme in the last years of her life. Nora Ephron writes and directs these stories to run parallel, whisking the audience back-and-forth between picturesque post-War Paris and Julie Powell's dismal 2nd floor walk-up in Queens in 2002. Powell was a government worker who spent her days fielding calls from the families of 9/11 victims. Feeling aimless and dissatisfied, she decided to set a personal goal: To cook all 524 recipes from Julia Child's classic work \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in one year and blog about the experience.<br /><br />Eventually Powell's blog attracted a following, caught the eye of the press, and resulted in a book deal. So \\"Julie & Julia\\" has the distinction of being the first feature film based on a blog, or partly so. We not only see Julia Child's (Meryl Streep) first forays into French cooking in the early 1950s and her struggle to get her groundbreaking cookbook, written with collaborator Simone Beck (Linda Emond), published but also the lifestyle and self-image of two different times and generations contrasted. Julia Child was an upper-middle class wife of a career Foreign Service employee (Stanley Tucci), taking in the City of Lights from her beautiful apartment, an American housewife in Paris trying to find something constructive to do.<br /><br />Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is a working class Gen X bureaucrat and frustrated writer. Child seems unfazed by any obstacle and always optimistic. Powell is self-absorbed and difficult to live with. Nora Ephron tries to emphasize their similarities through cross-cutting: They had both been government workers. They both had supportive and tolerant husbands. They were both consumed by a writing project, and they both loved good food. There's no question that the Julia Child half of \\"Julie & Julia\\" is more engaging. Meryl Streep captures Child's enthusiasm and can-do spirit with gusto, without doing a straight imitation. She is Child as Powell imagines her and as Child portrayed herself. Paul Tucci is the unsung hero of the film with his quiet portrayal of adoring husband Paul Childs.<br /><br />Julie Powell has been sweetened up a bit for the film. Amy Adams' characterization, though it may make Powell more appealing, also rings false at times. It conflicts with her behavior.

B002QY9RMA|2.0|When it has came down to Beyonce', she has honestly been the most overexposed artist of 2009, and for the whole decade. Not only that, but when she originally released I Am... Sasha Fierce last year, she was crucified for making a double album out of it that was absolutely too short for listeners to enjoy. That alone was a massive dissapointment. Now, instead of deciding to release a new album, she instead chooses to go back into the past and expand the original album, into a new project with mixed results. For the deluxe edition of I Am Sasha Fierce, she takes all 10 of the original tracks, and tries to expand the record, with a few new songs, Poison and a remade collaboration of Video Phone with Lady Gaga. Sadly for the new tracks, just as much as the regular tracks, she doesn't really want to take her time, and instead comes out with a wasted bag of tricks. For her collaboration with Lady Gaga, she has absolutely no such chemistry with her, and instead uses her vocals from her original song.<br /><br />All in all, there is honestly something that makes it a huge miss if you try to fix something that is broke, and turns it into something more damaged. That is sadly what Beyonce' had showed, rather than taking her time for a new record.  If you've already previously bought the original version of I Am...Sasha Fierce, stick with that, and don't bother with this version at all. She might have overexposed herself as a single lady, but her songs aren't worth the notes she sings.<br /><br />Album Cover: C<br /><br />Songs: D<br /><br />Price: D<br /><br />Remastering: C<br /><br />Overall: D 1/2+
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|This is a pretty good cd. My fiance is a fan and enjoyed it quite a bit! :)
067182449X|5.0|Absolutly, wonderful book. By far better then I expected. Sad, but a beautiful piece. Absolutly incredible! Probably my fave of all time.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Ms Beyonce or should I say Sasha Fierce?!    I have to say that I was very dissapointed in Beyonce. After realeasing the smash albums \\"Dangerously in Love\\" and \\"B'Day\\" (her claim to sex and fame), I was expecting so much more from \\"I.... Need an Excuse to Be a Whore\\". However I found the album both mediocre and disgusting at times. Everyone loved \\"If I Were a Boy\\"? Or did they? I would have loved it more if she didn't steal the song from some poor little girl who was trying to make it in the industry. The first disc was pretty plain and bland... she's in love and she's out of love? \\"Dissapear\\" is the only song that receives 3 stars on the first disc. Beyonce I wish that you would go back to WRITING YOUR OWN MUSIC. The second disc which was very DISSAPOINTING i have to say was only played once in my car. \\"Single Ladies\\" is both addicting and intruging but is the only track that delievers. Diva is garbage. What \\"almost 30 year old woman\\" wants to be a diva? She is very bragginful and just annoying in that track. Sweet Dreams is full of hidden demoic messages, and video phone is overly sexual and disguisting for me to listen to without being uncomfortable. She is overhyped and overpaid. Come on if you want real music please purchase \\"The Fame\\" or the \\"Fame Monster\\" or \\"Rated R\\" because this was just hard to listen to and annoying. And Why put like 10 songs on 2 discs? STUPIP
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is my favorite CD until she records another one...I listen to it at work all day long...she lifts my spirit and makes it soar...the emotion and purity of heart shines through and she is a shining star to our faded world...THANKS for having her CD...keep me informed when another CD is in the making...for pre-ordering...
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|the script was written by ayn rand so you dont get a nasty surprise watching it after you've read the book..     nice one    (i wouldnt recommend watching the movie though PRIOR to reading the book..)
B002O5M4SA|5.0|There is nothing I can say about the content of this movie that has not been said before. It is my favorite movie (and I consider myself a film buff); It has amazing action, amazing character development, amazing act, just amazing everything. The Blu-Ray version itself is good. For a movie that is 15+ years old, the remastering is fairly well done, though of course putting it up against the likes of new films like District 9 in glorious 1080p will make you see the overall graininess of it. Nonetheless, it certainly suffices.    Important thing to note: This has BOTH the US theatrical version AND the International version (with the ~20 minutes of extra scenes included). This is GREAT because now you don't have to choose only one version; you get both.    The 10 year retrospective documentary on this is also fairly enlightening and interesting for fans of the film/fiction.    If you haven't seen this movie and you own a Blu-ray player, buy it immediately.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|shipping took a little longer than expected but the product was in great condition and as advertised, and my friend was thrilled.  would use again.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I just found this show on TV last month and thought it was worth giving the Big Bang Theory second season DVD a try. Everyone that has watch this DVD has laughed and laughed. I could not find one bad show on the entire DVD. It was so good I purchased Season One. Can't wait till they release Season Three. This is intended for adults mainly 18 to 40, but I'm 60 plus and still found it very funny.
B000I0QL82|4.0|Like it's pseudo-remake WHITE CHRISTMAS, this keeps growing on me with every viewing.  Might help that I hadn't seen it in a few years before last night - and that I've become much more a fan of musicals, and both Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby.  Der Bingle is Jim Hardy, part of a dancing team with Ted Hanover (Astaire) and Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale); both men are in love (or think they are) with Lila, and Jim thinks he's going to take her away from dirty, all-work and no-play Broadway to a nice little farm he's got in Connecticut.  She balks at the idea, decides to stay with Ted, and Jim goes off to the farm anyway.  Soon he finds that farming is just too hard, and concocts the idea of turning his huge lumbering farmhouse into an inn and nightclub - but only open on holidays.  He also accidentally stumbles on new female singer Linda (Marjorie Reynolds) to help him out - and become his new amour - just as Ted, predictably, has a falling-out with Lila.  Complications ensue...<br /><br />This is marvellous fun, though one thing that is quite noticeable on multiple viewings is just how obnoxious both Ted and Jim are.  Ted's a serious drinker who doesn't know when to stop (which results in a marvelous \\"drunken\\" dance sequence with Linda on Lincoln's birthday); he also seems to have no qualms about trying to make off with every woman that Jim's interested in.  Jim on the other hand is domineering and possessive to extremes, going so far as to try to sabotage Linda's chance at stardom - which ultimately ends in her leaving him, going off with Ted, and going to Hollywood where the whole \\"Holiday Inn\\" concept is re-created for a film, and the inn built on a set - except that the set, of course, is exactly the set that was used in the \\"real\\" part of the film.  It's so self-reflexive it might be the first post-modern mainstream Hollywood film.<br /><br />Famous songs include \\"White Christmas\\" (original to this film, and the winner for the Best Song Oscar), \\"You're Easy to Dance With\\", \\"Happy Holidays\\", and \\"Easter Parade\\" - but all of the songs (by Irving Berlin, who apparently came up with the idea for the story in the first place) are pretty swell.  There's a nice balance between Bing's crooning some of these numbers and Fred's hoofing throughout - which provides another element of self-reflexivity of course as the film seems to grapple with the notion of whether singing or dancing is the more important element in a musical - and never resolves it (how could it?).<br /><br />One unfortunate element that really can't be ignored here, and that certainly does make the film a little bit problematic, is the treatment of race - from characters appearing in blackface during the Lincoln's Birthday segment to Louise Beavers' typical \\"Mammy\\" role as, uhh, \\"Mamie\\", and the just-for-laughs naming of her son, \\"Vanderbilt\\".  I certainly don't think the portrayal of African-Americans here is at all mean-spiritied - but it's also pretty ignorant and insensitive, and viewers who have problems forgiving old Hollywood stereotypes need to be warned that they're in force here.<br /><br />I think that what I liked about the film the most is that, despite the two star's constant bickering and underhanded behavior, they do get to learn lessons the hard way - but we also don't believe for a minute that they're entirely born-again nice guys at the end, as the last number slyly reminds us.  Reynolds as Linda is quite charming and pretty, and reasonably believable as the naive girl just getting started; Dale has less to do but is fine.  They're both a little stronger and more self-willed than the women in many musicals of the era - though they both still fall for these jerks in the end.  Ah well, that's Hollywood.  Mark Sandrich, who directed most of the best of Astaire and Rogers' films of the 30s, puts it all together with class and keeps it moving, and Walter Abel provides fine comic support as frantic manager Danny.olidays\\", and \\"Easter Parade\\" - but all of the songs (by Irving Berlin, who apparently came up with the idea for the story in the first place) are pretty swell.

0385474547|5.0|The seller listed the books as \\"acceptable\\" condition, but really the book was in great condition. There were only a few worn edges--nothing serious. Also, the book was promptly delivered. Overall, great purchase.
0446402397|5.0|This is truly a thrilling and exciting novel set in Communist Russia.  The setting makes the story pop and is wonderfully written.
0385341008|5.0|This title leads one to think \\"chick lit.\\"  But this book is so much more than that.  Stick with the opening pages and get into the culture of this little community on the Isle of Guernsey.  Be prepared to meet a series of solid characters who make you wonder what you might do in a similar situation.  Although the end of WWII is the backdrop for this book, this is not a book about war.  It's a book about survivors.
0618918248|2.0|Faith is a belief in something for which there is no proof.  As science has not proven or eliminated the possibility of the existence of God, Dawkins finds himself in a rather interesting quarry.  He has faith that science will one day prove God is not real.  So his faith in science is akin to that same faith in God that he criticizes.
B000QXDED6|1.0|I thought it would be something like 'Gladiator'. Instead it was a dreary colored computerized show - it was more like looking at one of those super hero comic books only the characters are moving. Not anywhere near portraying an actual event. Total waste of money.
B000002A46|5.0|I love Mariah's Christmas album. I've had it for a while and play it every year around Christmas.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Talent just flows in this girls blood like water. Once again she inspires and sings from the heart. I love every song on her except for the filler, forgettable track the Skankonce (Beyonce) produced. It sounds like the bad version of \\"Single Ladies\\" and its completely random on this cd. Other then that track, this CD is magical uplifiting journey completely different from her last CDs. Great CD!!!

B002SGY4LK|5.0|Why re-invent the wheel when you've found a well-written review you agree with?  Here's what David Hurwitz wrote for Classics Today in giving this album a \\"10/10\\" rating:  (I concur whole-heartedly.)    \\"This is as fine a set of Beethoven violin sonatas as has ever been recorded. It has everything: excitement, character, explosive contrasts, subtle shadings, and the long cantabile line that Beethoven demands--and it's superbly recorded as well. Isabelle Faust and Alexander Melnikov form a true partnership, playing off of each other and imbuing the music with a genuine, conversational quality that's very fetching. There are so many examples of this, but perhaps the most winning is the give-and-take opening of Op. 30 No. 3, in which the players seem to surprise each other with each rhythmic exchange. Indeed, keenly sprung rhythms give this set much of its special distinction, whether in the dazzling first movement of the \\"Kreutzer\\" sonata, or the lilting ländler in the scherzo of Op. 96.    Lyricism and an effortless, singing cantabile also permeate the music, and these interpretations. The opening of the \\"Spring\\" sonata seldom has sounded so fresh and natural, while the finale of Op. 12 No. 2 is truly \\"piacevole\\" without ever turning \\"bore-vole\\". Five of these 10 sonatas have slow movements that are marked either \\"espressivo\\" or \\"cantabile\\", and that's exactly what Faust and Melnikov offer, without ever turning sticky or drowning the music in excessive sentiment. There's a clarity to the phrasing here, a sharpness of focus and an understanding of Beethoven's large musical paragraphs that's very much part of the expressive point. The bottom line: this is a great set, and if you love these works, you must hear it.\\"
B002QH2NUA|5.0|The performance is great, with an outstanding band and magnificent sound/DVD audio. Out of previous DVD's, was a little bit concerned of this idea of handing cameras to the public, and how would that end in the final cut. Well, it is all done with great moderation and refinement. It serves the purpose to create the ambience and connection with the audience; great editing job.    Not to be a surprise, but Paul's committment and deployment of talent at the stage is incredible. You can actually feel how exhausted and satisfied he is at the end of the show. A great, great performer and entertainer.    Give a 5 star this time, against low rating of previous DVD shows. No wonder this awaited production being directed by McCartney himself is a major leap in the right direction.    Haven't heard the CD's yet, which I think is a great touch to be included in the package.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|My wife and I saw this opening weekend and we both loved it. I am tempted to suggest this should get 4.5 stars because I expect more from James as far as story goes, but then I think about the complete and awesome development of the world and animals and I'm back up to 5 stars.<br /><br />And now for my guide on How to properly view AVATAR:<br /><br />1. Go see it in 3D. It is worth the extra money to upgrade the experience. It would still be good in 2D but the 3D is done at a new level for 3D (I've seen a number of 3D movies and nothing has compared to this). FINALLY, someone has made a good, worthwhile reason to see a 3D movie!<br /><br />2. Upgrade one more time and see it at IMAX if you have one available. The extra screen size would make it even more amazing, especially in the forests.<br /><br />3. Keep in mind that the combat forces are mercenaries and not government military. They tell you this in the movie but it seems most people miss that brief piece of dialogue. (I hate it when movies use State and Federal troops (real heroes) as the bad guys.)<br /><br />4. DO NOT let your mind compare it to Native American stories. Yeah, it is the same story and the blue people often look and sound like Indians, but suspend your memory of Dances With Wolves and history class and enjoy the movie as a fresh experience. (You might also have to temporarily purge \\"Kaena\\" and \\"Final Fantasy: Spirits Within\\"... so, yeah, the story is not original at all, but the world around the story sure as heck is!)<br /><br />5. DO NOT drink a liter of cola during the first hour. It is almost 3 hours long but it goes by as if it were a 90 minute movie. I can't think of any parts where you would want to spend 5 minutes trecking to the bathroom.  The theater was packed and nobody made a sound for the duration of the movie, so I'd take that as a sign that most other people were as glued to the screen as I was.<br /><br />6. Last but most important: just go Experience It!  This movie is worth supporting by seeing it at an expensive 3D showing, first-run theater.  I say \\"Experience It\\" because, even if you took all of the story elements out, it would still be a fantastic experience.  The world that has been created is AMAZING and, thankfully, much of the movie feels almost like a safari where you are enveloped in that new world.  It really is an experience.st-run theater.

I don't have any comments for improvement. I liked the simple furnature that let's you concentrate on the actors and the singing. The picture is very clear and vivid, the sound is first class and the acting is usually good if not perfect (as is always in operas).  To summarize, it doesn't get better than that
0812971825|5.0|Elizabeth Strout's rich second novel is set fifty years ago in much quieter times when mainstream Protestantism was, well, mainstream, when fear of Russia and atomic attack was palpable, and when there was nothing remarkable about educated women who had no career plans. What was unacceptable was that grown men should cry.     Tyler Caskey, an earnest young Congregationalist minister, proves exceptional, and his tears are earned. He marries a young woman with whom he is smitten but who lacks an inclination toward the life of a minister's wife in a small town. When she dies of breast cancer, angry and disillusioned, he is left with their two daughters and a powerful secret that will haunt and humble him. His stern, moralistic mother takes the younger girl, while Tyler keeps Katherine, a kindergartener. He has the help of a housekeeper named Connie Hatch, who is troubled but with whom Tyler makes a connection. Distracted by grief, he downplays signs that members of his congregation are making devastating conclusions about his relationships with both Katherine and Connie.    Strout is a keen observer of community dynamics, and she establishes sympathy for characters others might dismiss. We see them act, often blindly, to escape their pain and to establish themselves as authorities about everything from Freudian psychology to cranberry contamination. The tensions build until they reach a dramatic turning point in which Tyler's ministry is transformed.    Strout's stories are marvelously rich in human understanding. The paperback has an author's note that I found worthwhile.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Originally boycotted this movie as I'm an original-cast (mostly) Trekkie, but... GREAT movie! Delivered within a week, great condition. Thanks! Also wasn't aware that J.J. Abrams was involved. I love his stuff!
0143038583|4.0|This book was great for the first 300 pages.  It was really interesting to learn about how corn is grown and how meat and processed foods are produced in the industrial food industry, and about how organic food isn't much better a lot of the time.  Basically what I took away from this is that more people should be vegetarian, and eating less processed food. It takes lots of petroleum products to produce the corn and lots of corn to feed the cows, and all those petroleum products are polluting the environment, as is the cow manure. He shows a really cool farm where the cows are grass fed and the chickens eat the grups in the cows poop and then the chicken poop enriches the grass for the cows to eat.  Sounds great - people eating that meat are fine.  But he points out that this solution is not feasible for most of America.  Then he spends a few weeks being vegetarian and doesn't like it, so he spends 50 pages or so justifying eating meat.  One argument is that keeping family and religious traditions is important, but he is Jewish and eats pork and shellfish.  So for him tradition is a valid reason not to be vegetarian, but not a reason to avoid foods he likes.  Self-serving? Then he says animal rights people are naive because some island got overrun with pigs when the pig farmers brought them over, which attracted eagles that are eating the local foxes, and so they are shooting the pigs, but the animal rights people don't want the pigs to be shot.  Stupid animal rights people, stopping the necessary solution.  But he doesn't recognize that the original problem was caused by pig farmers.  Then he says being vegetarian isn't feasible because it's not sustainable because there are areas like the northeast US that can't grow enough vegetation to support itself, so food would have to be transported in.  But the northeast US can't grow enough meat either to support itself, as he acknowledged in an earlier chapter.  The most sustainable diet for the planet would be vegetarianism with dairy and eggs - then cows can convert the grass into milk but you wouldn't need to constantly be growing and killing new cows.  But he doesn't acknowledge this.  And why is he so against transporting food?  He points out how screwed up the American food industry is.  Why shouldn't people import grass-fed beef from Argentina if they want to eat beef?  He is fine with people driving hours every week to buy a chicken from his beloved grass farm - didn't that use up a lot of oil?      All in all, I recommend the first 300 pages of this book highly, but not the rest.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|So I've read all the books, I've seen all the movies, I must say though I am not by any means a \\"hardcore\\" fan but a fan nonetheless.<br /><br />As said over and over by the one and two star writers... this movie was really not that great- which is really disappointing since the book was amazing. I totally understand editing and transfer but so much was cut out or cut down that to someone who has chosen to watch the movies and not read the books- the movie can be awfully confusing.<br /><br />I felt like allot of the main and important characters were sort of cut off. This book really gives you insight into both Snape and Voldermont but the movie failed to do so.<br /><br />Further more the lighting wasn't the greatest - my partner and I literally had to turn off all the lights in order to see everything that was going on.<br /><br />As stated by another reviewer was by far the best (in my opinion) film so far created from the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately being a fan I do want to see the next (two?) films- I just sincerely hope they use the opportunity they created (cutting the book into two films) and pick up the pace on more of what was left out of the half blood prince film.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Until the release of 'The Matrix', the film Blade Runner was considered by many as the finest work of Science Fiction to date. Everything that had to be written about Blade Runner as a movie has been written, so I will just focus on this particular Blu-ray release. In my opinion, it is one of the finest Blu-ray conversions of any movie I have ever seen, certainly for a movie with this many years.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice is that this particular package includes more relevant material about the movie than any other release (that I am aware of). In addition to the 'Final Cut' (the actual Blu-ray product) this five-disc set includes the theatrical US and International releases (both in standard definition) as well as bonus material, such as a clip on the life of Philip K. Dick, who wrote 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?', on which the movie is based.<br /><br />The actual Blu-ray conversion (which, as I mentioned before, is the 'Final Cut' version) can be considered a standard by which older movies should be upgraded to high definition. For starters, the Studio logos are not simply upscaled, but are recreated anew. This puts you on notice on the commitment of the authors to the quality of the conversion. Then, the opening scene (the gloomy skyline of L.A. in the year 2017 - I may be off by a year or so) is simply fantastic. But the high quality of the conversion is not limited to the CG shots: as the scenery moves to the street action, you continue to enjoy excellent quality of image. The sound is equally good, and if you are able to crank up the volume on a 5+1 home theater audio system, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />In sum, you can not go wrong with this Blade Runner release: it is reasonably priced, has lots of material, and the main feature is released on Blu-ray on a level of quality that is very, very good.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Every few years or so some stunning new songstress appears on the pop music scene and commands the spotlight. This past year I note a Lady Gaga seems to have been everywhere. The cover of Rolling Stone. Little snips on TV. Videos on YouTube. In the pop press. Who is Lady Gaga? And how did she gain such sudden fame? Well, I first heard her music the XM Radio dance music channel. It really stood out from the general background of selections they play! With only one listen on one song, I knew I had to have her CD album. Why? It's beat heavy, melodic, energetic, catchy and fun; it's my kinda music and it's fun listening! Now, she has another CD out, \\"The Fame Monster.\\" Well, I had to have it too. How could I resist? I ordered the 8-song version. I received the Deluxe edition of twenty-two songs. The first CD has the eight new songs and the second CD is a repeat of \\"The Fame\\" CD. Tough break. I suppose it was a mistake in the Christmas rush.<br /><br />\\"The Fame\\" (CD-2 of \\"The Fame Monster\\" album) proved out as a wonderful album. There's a lot of brains behind the release of this original CD. It's supposedly a debut album, but it really seems like a Greatest Hits album released after a long and successful career. Every song was a winner and the production was marvelous! And the music stood out and away from all other pop music! Catchy? Jeez Louise! What an assortment of songs! I can't stop listening. This album was a stunning introduction to a sparking new personality. The recording sounds like a crazy concoction mixing electronica, ABBA and Madonna, but it worked big time, plus Lady Gaga has her own very distinct voice and persona. I bought the \\"Fame\\" CD, and I'm very satisfied with the entire package. There's not a song I'd delete. If you like to buy individual songs and want to capture the very best tracks, in my opinion you might get MP3s of \\"Just Dance,\\" \\"Love Game,\\" \\"Poker Face,\\" \\"The Fame,\\" \\"Starstruck,\\" \\"Boys Boys Boys,\\" Paper Gangsta\\" and \\"I like it Rough.\\" If pressed for a ranking of the songs, I gave \\"Paper Gangsta\\" the top nod and \\"Brown Eyes\\" the bottom, but all of the songs were excellent. The lyrics were humorous and almost frivolous, but that's the way I like this kind of beat-heavy dance music. It's not made for deep thinking; It's just fun, fun, fun! Relax and enjoy!<br /><br />Now there's another 8 songs to enjoy on CD-1 of \\"The Fame Monster.\\" All of the songs are quite excellent and in the same beat-heavy electronica fashion as \\"The Fame\\" CD. Good listening. Fun Music. The Lady is a wonderful singer/song writer and has attracted immense notice.<br /><br />Where is this going to go? It's one of the greatest starts for a pop star within my recent memory great. What could she possibly do for an encore in 2010? I suspect Lady Gaga going to be another Madonna with a long and lustrous career. Let's hope so for she is certainly an entertaining person so far. Alas, I also recall a number of one-CD wonders. Will Lady Gaga have imitators? Of course, but she's going to be a hard act to follow. Well, in any case, the \\"Fame\\" album and \\"the Fame Monster\\" followup has to be one of the highlights of the year and a fresh new turn in contemporary pop music.<br /><br />Gary Petersonor a ranking of the songs, I gave \\"Paper Gangsta\\" the top nod and \\"Brown Eyes\\" the bottom, but all of the songs were excellent.

B002NPCSJG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Old Man's War.  It was a great mix of hard SF, miltary action, and a love story.  I found the book extremely hard to put down and it was the perfect length.  I very much look forward to reading the rest of the series to see what happens to Perry.  I am now a big Scalzi fan!

UNLESS YOU NEED A SUBSITUTE FRISBE OR HAVE RUN OUT CLAY SKEET TARGETS, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ ANY ONE OF THE SEVERAL OTHER ONE STAR REVIEWS OF THIS TRASH BEFORE WASTING YOU MONEY.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|It`s my first Tissot watch Once I saw them I fall in  love with  that and have been  dreaming for a  half year to  buy them until now. it looks  much more better than on the screen. Delivery is perfect as  was anticipated. Great watch! Sincerely advise you that ! and 10x for off.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Man, I hate reading all these cheap funk reviews complaining about the price of what has to be the most exciting Rolling Stones catalogue release since The Rock & Roll Circus.  This is an upgrade of the Greatest Live Album -- ever!  I've bought bootlegs costing as much as this release for just 2 or 3 'new' '69 Tour cuts -- and none of them sounded anywhere as good as the songs on this release.  Plus, the packaging is amazing -- a cool box with a small picture-filled hardcover book and a great repo of the '69 Tour poster.  If this were a bootleg release, I wouldn't have thought twice about shelling out a C-note for it!    So what's with all the penny-pinchers?    The Stones have always been reluctant -- Jagger in particular -- to release their unreleased back catalogue.  And there's so damn much of it!  Brussels '73 and the soundtrack (not to mention the movie) of Ladies and Gentlemen: the Rolling Stones, just to name two of the best.  I know because I have bootlegs covering a lot of their 'hidden' catalogue.  For 6 years in the late '90s, I published 'Sticky Fingers Magazine,' a Stones tribute and bootleg review vehicle.  If Great Dane or Swingin' Pig had released this package back then, I would have thought I'd died and gone to heaven!      And paid twice or three times the price, and thought I was lucky to get my hands on these sonic gems.    Not only do we have 5 unreleased songs from the incredible '69 Tour, but they are BY FAR in the best sound I've ever heard for these songs -- freakin' amazing sound.  The Under My Thumb here just kills the well-known (in bootleg and collectors' circles) version from Altamont.  And Mick Taylor just smokes on his solos!  Prodigal Son and You Gotta Move just put away every prior version, including the ones on the Gimme Shelter bonus tracks.  Hell, I saw the Stones live on this tour in San Diego at the Sports Arena and they didn't play those songs half as well there as they did at MSG -- certainly, the sound wasn't as good!    Plus, it was great to hear BB King and Ike & Tina Turner again, just as the Stones had in mind back in the day when they wanted to put Ya-Yas out as a double LP.  In conclusion, Run Don't Walk to the nearest store and buy this amazing collection.  It's worth collecting and savoring -- pure ear candy!    John Carr
B002NXSRX4|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch but more than likely a rental and not a purchase.  I bought the movie for my kids who love G.I. Joe (and so do I since I grew up in the 80's).  My only complaint is that they stuck to the traditional Joe TV show and did not introduce stupid new items like the accelerator suits which turn out to be dumb.  Also I am mad that Scarlet and Duke are not an item which they are in the TV Show.  Overall this is enjoyable for everyone in the family and if you have younger kids you might want to watch it first to make sure they are ok with the violence.  I don't remember any blood but there are lots of explosions and gun battles which might be too much for younger kids.  Enjoy!
0446691437|1.0|The more Pressfield writes about Resistance, the more it feels like it's his own Resistance to produce a more helpful and honest book. What could be said in a couple of pages, namely \\"just do it\\", is expanded far too long. There are so many disingenuous statements, crazy metaphors, and arrogant judgments based solely on his religious leaning that overwhelmingly drown out the few gems and valuable insights in between. Any form of entertainment or expression that doesn't conform with the author's personal values is considered a Resistance, a vice that must be gotten rid of. Heck, all ailments and disorders Pressfield does not suffer from are also dismissed as Resistances.    The longer he wages his imaginary holy war against the evil Resistance force, the more it reads like snake-oil advice from feel good self-help books. Would I consider the very act of seeking help from and reading this book a form of Resistance? Absolutely, because I feel very happy and liberating deleting it from my kindle after reading a third way through. I can't stomach sticking til the end where there are even more religious nuttiness as warned in the forewords and many reviews.    On the upside, at least Pressfield successfully helps me overcome one form of Resistance.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I watched this season with my 6 and 4 year old this year and would set the DVR for the late Friday night airings.  Every Saturday they would ask to watch Star Wars which sealed the deal in me buying the season on disc.  If you watched the Star Wars Clone Wars animated movie that came out over a year ago then you know what you are getting into.  For those of you that haven't seen either the show or the movie, the plot is set in between the last three movies and the original three movies during a time called the Clone Wars.  The show is not too violent for younger kids and does not show blood.  The animation is top rate and enjoyable for adults who like the original movies.  This is good quality family viewing for everyone.  My kids love watching the episodes over and over again which makes owning the entire season well worth the $30-$40.  I bought this on Blu Ray and haven't watched any of the extras yet because it is a Christmas gift so they will see it tomorrow.  The rating above is soley based on the show itself.  Enjoy!
0439882826|5.0|I purchased this book over a year ago for my husband and two young sons (3 and 6), who are all die-hard Star Wars fans.  One word about this book:  AMAZING.  There are tons of intricate pop-ups on every page with informative and detailed character, historical, and location descriptions.  You'll be shocked at the level of pop-up detail....and the working light sabres and Darth Vader mask (with SW's ROTJ \\"Anakin\\" face underneath) will delight every reader.  Even my mother, who is NOT a Star Wars fan, is amazed at the intricate detail and enjoys reading it with the boys.  I've given this as a gift to my friends who are Star War fans and they use it as conversational coffee table books.  Yeah, it's THAT cool...    Please keep in mind this is a \\"shelf book\\" if you have kids under the age of 11, meaning it stays on the bookshelf, read/looked-at with an adult, and then put back on the shelf.  This is the kind of book that will break your heart if torn or ripped accidently (or worse, on purpose).  After a year, my boys still look through this book 2-3 times a week.  It has taught them to enjoy and respect books, which is an invaluable lesson....    Note:  The quality is so good I recommend checking out other Matt Reinhart pop-up books...

B002SJIO5E|1.0|For sixty years I have been an avid SiFi fan, never seen a film I didn't like.  This could have been good, but the filming must have been done by a 3 year old with a cell phone. My wife and I watched it in a theater and the picture jumped around (shook) so much we couldn't watch most of it.    The movie industries and camera companies have spent millions to control camera shake. The effect in this movie is as if someone hand held the camera with maximum zoom. Even shots of people standing still and talking were jumping all over the screen.
0307454541|4.0|A Swedish crime novel sounds like an odd mix. But apparently Swedish crime novels are taking off.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a tale of a complicated international financial fraud and the buried evil past of a wealthy Swedish industrial family.<br /><br />The central character, Mikael Blomkvist, is a crusading financial journalist who has fallen into disgrace by publishing an untrue story about a titan of industry. His eventual sidekick is a prodigy with superior computer hacking, serious trust issues and a dragon tattoo on her left shoulder blade.<br /><br />In the town of Hedestad, a village three hours north of Stockholm, an 82-year-old Henrik Vanger wants to offer him a job. He wants him to solve a 40-year-old mystery: What happened to Harriet Vanger, the daughter of Vanger's pro-Nazi brother, Richard? Harriet was just 16 when she disappeared, and despite a lengthy investigation no trace of her was found. But every year on the anniversary of her disappearance unusual flowers are delivered to Vanger.<br /><br />I found the Swedish names very alien in the text. Other than Ikea, I am not used to running into the language and its places. I also found the combination of financial journalism and a murder investigation to be an odd combination. It worked, but it seemed odd to me at times.<br /><br />In its original Swedish it won Sweden's Glass Key Award in 2006 for best crime novel of the year, and won the 2008 Boeke Prize. Larsson was posthumously awarded the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for International Author of the Year in 2008. Larsson died at the age of 50 of a massive heart attack in 2004.<br /><br />The book is first part of in Larsson's \\"Millennium Trilogy\\". The title character with the tattoo appears in the second part The Girl Who Played with Fire. At least according to the excerpt in the back of the book.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is worth reading if you are looking for a good crime novel.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|I hesitated in buying this CD at least four times in Target since the release in October, primarily because the first cut is \\"Gabriel's Message\\" which lead me to believe this was just a compilation of some Sting arranged Christmas stuff. Then Anne Marie stepped in and on the day before the day before Christmas, arrived \\"If on a Winter's Night\\" to the UPS hub in East Butler (with a newly arranged \\"Gabriel's Message\\" and so much more!) I had to trek out to get it, but let me just say it was worth the trip. Perhaps some of Sting's finest arrangements and a couple of sublime originals is this--a dark, haunting, mystical reflective piece on Winter. The music is brilliant from Sting to Purcell to ancient traditional. The lyrics are poetry. The liner notes, (written by Sting himself in a conversational, open, almost confessional tone) give you not only a sense of what went on in the artistic production of this beautiful thing--but insight into Sting himself. Glorious and Exquisite. And the music was great, too!  ;o)

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up was the story of two kids that happened to fall in love with one another, and their love contniued through childhood and into adulthood and beyond. During those years was a lot of happiness and a single want for both of the people involved: they wanted to go on a trip and follow their childhood idol to a waterfall that was placed in a really remote locale. The only problem with this plan was that life kept getting in the way and, ultimately, an old man's love fell ill and vanished from his life. This left him with nothing save memories and a house that the two had built, and even that was being threatened by building springing up all around their home. Then something happened to make the house a monolith that was to be torn down so, in his desperation, the old man turned to the one thing he knew. Balloons. Rigging the house with them, he took the home and saw it go airborne, finally allowing him and his memories the chance that they always wanted. The only problem with that was the stowaway that the old man wasn't expecting and the things he found when he got closer to his dream.<br /><br />Up was not what I expected was was good nonetheless. It was sad, however, and the beginning of the movie touched me and made me wish that the old man would have gotten to do the things he wanted to do when he had his love by his side. you could tell he wanted that as well, and that the house wa smore than a house to him - it was a reflection of the life he had spent with the only person that understood him. As his balloon quest took him on his way, he was forced to choose between this and something he knew was right - and that said a lot on the way things normally play out. On one hand there is the \\"right\\" thing to do. On the other is the \\"things one wants to do.\\"<br /><br />I liked the tale because it took all sorts of things and showed them for what they were. Talking dogs, a person who was not what he was supposed to be, the love of a mother for its children, the hopes of a son as he wants nothing more than recognition from his Dad - all of these things play out and more in such a well-crafted tale. I also liked the fact that the ending was one I did not expect, just as the movie was one I was not expecting. That made me happy and, truthfully, the whole saga touched me and made me feel good about this pick-up.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would call this a kid's tale, and I say that because of the way it began. It was sad - depressingly so - and I didn't think all of that was what all parents want for their kids. It does have a lot of morality issues it places in front of its viewers, however, and those were interesting to see as they played out before this audience of one. Personally, i liked the story quite a bit and would say that i would be worth watching for children and parents alike. I'm not accustomed to saying that these day, either, but I thought this happened to be true here and recommend this for consumption on all age ranges - provided that parents agree with what is shown in the beginning.s nothing more than recognition from his Dad - all of these things play out and more in such a well-crafted tale.

0385504225|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Angels and Demons, and The daVinci Code before that, but this one was not nearly as good.  Although many of the facts and symbols in and around our nation's capital were interesting to learn about, I thought the story dragged on way too long (500 pages for a story that takes place in one night?!).  If you're a big fan of Dan Brown you should read it, but I doubt you'll like it as much as you liked the others....
0307454541|5.0|This is an all time favorite book. It has mystery, suspense, romance, a bit of violence. . .everything. I borrowed it from the library and then bought it for my husband so he wouldn't have to wait months to get it from the library. The next in the series is equally as good. Can't wait for the third to come out. Too bad the author didn't live to see his literary success.

B000KIE11Q|4.0|My swatch irony looks good and works well but the plastic links in the band broke twice within the two year warranty period.  Swatch fixed the first two times inside the warranty.  I managed to use a spare link the first time it broke just outside the warrant period but the next time it broke I didn't have any spare links but was able to find a excellent heavy duty resin band on ebay.  The black plastic links seem to split at the end closest to the watch.  My watch was always quite loose on my wrist so there was no undue stress on the band.
B002RSDW80|2.0|I want to start by saying that this is not a simple case of `Meryl Streep is better than Amy Adams' even if a lot of other reviewers want to paint it as that.  This is much more complicated than that.  In fact, Amy Adams is fine here.  She has her moments of charming, her moments of intensity, her moments of hysteria and overall she is adequate.  The real issue I have with `Julie & Julia' is that it doesn't live up to the subject matter and the script is a sloppy and uninspired mess.<br /><br />That, and a few `other' things.<br /><br />The film shifts from Julia Child's life in Paris and Julie Powell's life in New York.  Streep portrays Child as she begins to take a hold of her own identity, learning to cook and channeling her good-natured mentality into a healthy and respectable career.  Adams portrays Powell as she tries to break away from the downtrodden near pathetic path she has chosen by finding herself in Julia Child's recipes.  It is clear that Powell is inspired and in awe of Child and wants to feel a connection with her.<br /><br />For me, this all sounds like it could produce delicious results.  Sadly, this meal is rather bland.<br /><br />I'm going to go ahead and start with the acting, since that is what is getting all the attention.  When I first saw this film in the theater all those months ago, it was the first bit `potential Oscar contender'.  Everyone had been raving Streep as `on her way to the podium for her THIRD Oscar' and so I was excited.  I love Meryl Streep.  When I walked out of this film I thought to myself, `she was good, and funny, and charming, but there is no way she is the best'.  Then I saw a few other films (`Bright Star' and `An Education' to be exact) and there was no question in my mind that what Carey Mulligan does in `An Education' is not only the best performance of this year, but is a complete marvel and one of the best performances in any category of this ENTIRE DECADE.  After watching this film for a second time last night I found myself even MORE confused about Streep's Oscar buzz (and countless critic award wins).  Meryl Streep is undoubtedly a force in front of the camera.  Nearly everything she does is phenomenal.  Sadly, for me, her performance here is a tad too far over the top.  She is hammy and, while that quality can at times be appealing (her constant jovialness is infective), the script is so dense and hollow that it barely allows Streep to expound on the WOMAN that was Julia Child.  There are subtle hints that something is brewing beneath the surface (her sincere breakdown after learning of her sister's pregnancy) but this film is more focused on the food (which all looks delicious BTW) than giving us a real taste of who Julia was as a person.<br /><br />Streep is entertaining, but she is FAR from Oscar worthy.<br /><br />Like I said, Amy Adams is adequate.  She doesn't really do anything wrong, but the whole idea of her character and her life is far too clich&eacute;d to be anything noteworthy.  The snag in her marriage and that whole FORCED breakup is ridiculous, but totally something you saw coming the moment she said, in her blog, that she was `risking her marriage' for this experiment.  Her manic desperation can at times be endearing and entertaining, but nothing we haven't seen a million times before.<br /><br />As far as the significant others go, Stanley Tucci is the best thing about this movie (end of discussion) and Chris Messina is the worst.  I love the quiet and supportive nature of Stanley Tucci.  He just has this softness and this endearing quality to him.  I adored him in `The Devil Wears Prada' and I find his work here, alongside Streep, to be equal parts charming and engaging.  His warmth never feels forced or awkward (in contrast, when Adams delivers the SAME TOAST she fails miserably at giving it any kind of natural affection).  Messina is just an obnoxious stereotype who fails to do anything by overwork his character, and that disgusting way he eatshis food haunts my dreams.<br /><br />In the end, the biggest culprit here is Nora Ephron, the films director and screenwriter.  Because of her, the film lacks any real bite whatsoever.  It is bland and boring, overly long and full of generic clich&eacute;s that make this far less than a film of its nature should be.  This is supposed to be an inspirational `coming of age', romantic comedy set to the tone of a biopic, but it lacks any of the chemistry and warmth that make those specific film genres so lovely.here is Nora Ephron, the films director and screenwriter.

0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's latest novel spins a good tale with some good twists.  It's also a great read before visiting D.C., and will help you narrow down the myriad of places to tour.  That's all the good I have to say about it.<br />The characters are shallow.  The pace of the book is so unrealistic that it pulls you from the dream we usually enjoy while reading a novel.  You would think they evacuated Washington in order to do all that is done in this book.  I don't care if it's midnight - there are always people everywhere in D.C.  You can't blow up the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and then expect to drive across town without seeing ten million emergency vehicles, and at least that many tourists.  But that's not what bothered me.<br />First, let me say I could care less about the controversy of The DaVinci Code.  I didn't read the book and didn't follow all the clamor.  I thought the counter-publishing of works like The DaVinci Deception were reactionary and overkill, not to mention probably did much to promote anything Brown subsequently wrote.<br />Second, it's a novel - got it.  The views expressed herein don't necessarily reflect those of the author, bla bla bla.  But there's no way you can read this and not sense that the philosophy within the writing goes far beyond backstory, character or scene development.  It sounds more like soap boxing.  So, what philosophy?<br />Brown levels the differences among religions, stating that they all have value and originate from some ancient, vague mysticism.  The book is gnostic, wrapped in the most recent package.  \\"Truth\\" originates from secrets kept from centuries past within a small circle of Masons, or other secret organizations.  Even within those groups, only a few people really understand the truth, which is guarded within enigmatic symbols to protect the world from the destructive effects that would come should the unworthy gain access to these powerful secrets.<br />Hold on a second - I've got a fair question: what secrets?  What exactly is the secret?  Well, he never says.  At the end he references (and, baby, does he twist Scripture here...) the Logos (see John 1:1).  But even here he takes what Scripture makes fairly clear, and casts a cloud around it in order to manufacture a mystery.<br />This reminds me of Finding Forester, which was a wonderful movie.  In this flic Sean Connery plays a famous, best-selling author in the vein of Harper Lee, who only wrote one novel.  Connery mentors a talented kid from a poor, inner city neighborhood.  Throughout the movie your told how incredibly talented Connery is, how wonderful his book was, and you wonder what else he has published, and how good it is.  The problem - you can't demonstrate how good literature is in a 90 minute movie.  So you have to believe that Connery is that good, because they're never going to prove it through prose.<br />Brown does something similar when he spends an entire novel debunking orthodoxy while lauding gnosticism that he refuses to explain.<br />It's a secret.  If I tell you I'll have to kill you.<br />Yeah, right.  I find the novel arrogant.  I had to exert will power to finish the book after the third time one of his characters pontificated on how `simple minds actually take the Bible literally.'  What does he mean by literally?  Well, for starters he's not just talking about believing in a seven day creation, or a literal flood, or some other doctrine typically held by fire-breathing fundamentalists.  He extends it to include believing in a literal resurrection, a literal Christ, etc..  He places Jesus on the same level as Mohammed and some obscure prophets from religions known only by Harvard anthropology professors, in spite of the fact that they teach contradictory things.  (e.g. did Jesus die on the cross?  Koran says no, Bible says yes.  It can't be both.  Was he resurrected?  Koran, no, Bible, yes.  They can't both be correct.  And the entire religion of Christianity hangs on the answer to these.  They are not trivial doctrinal issues.)  Jesus (and Mohammed) for Brown are just good folks who had a better grasp on some grand ancient mystery than most people.  Unfortunately most of their followers have twisted their teachings by actually believing them, rather than grasping the enigma behind what they actually taught.  Oh - if only Brown had gone so far as to draw a cartoon of Mohammed, we might be spared some future experiment in thrashing Orthodoxy!<br />Such is gnosticism redressed, a heresy dealt with centuries ago by the early church.

Jesus (and Mohammed) for Brown are just good folks who had a better grasp on some grand ancient mystery than most people.  Unfortunately most of their followers have twisted their teachings by actually believing them, rather than grasping the enigma behind what they actually taught.

B0026P3G12|5.0|this album was more then wonderful!  I cannot wait for the next album to be released.  She is one of the best! A very rich voice one that plays again and again in my head, can't get much better than that!
B002DD46P2|5.0|This score is a solid piece of work that appears to take elements from various artists such as Zimmer, Rabin, and Gregson-Williams. There is a great deal of similarity to scores of \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Armageddon\\", \\"The Rock\\", \\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"Enemy of the State\\", and \\"Spy Game\\". If you enjoy any of these scores at all, you will enjoy this score despite the less-than-stellar film.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This modern take on the beloved classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is all out fun. The premise of what would happen if you could step into the book and meet the delicious Mr Darcy has many clever twists and outright laughs.  It also enticed my 17 year old to put down Twilight and pick up P&P. We caught this movie on BBCA, and immediately ordered it from Amazon. We have watched it several times, and have given as gifts.  The clever takes on many of the iconic scenes from P&P (favorite: Mr Darcy and the pond) invite you to join in on the fun the modern day Amanda is having with all of Miss Austen's characters.  I really recommend this fun film to all lovers of P&P, and to some Twilight fans, too!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Purchasing the moving up was my first experience with Amazon.com.  The movie arrived quickly and intact.  Tracking information was excellently provided so that I would know my movie was on it's way. AND it arrived in time for Christmas!  Great job Amazon.
B001P06GX4|4.0|My family loves board games and this is a good one. It is easy to play and can challenge you to think. It is not really educational but it is fun and it's nice because it is for 2-4 players and it doesn't take a long time to play a game,
0553345834|4.0|I wish I had read this book as a freshly minted MBA. It would have alerted me to some speed bumps on the freeway of business.     McCormack is like a coach or a grandfather with extraordinary wisdom and experience taking you to a series of lunches to help guide your career.      It's not a ladder to success, but rather a valuable building block for a strong foundation. It's also an interesting insight into the sports management business.         Highly recommended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I enjoy listening to this cd.  Her rendition of Wild Horses was especially great to me. I want this lovely voice to be available to enjoy for a long time.
0307593525|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift, but admit that I read through it. Some very good recipes that I would like to try out. I am not a cook, but this book makes me want to be. Pick it up...
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush were at their mindblowing best with this record.  It is one of those rare albums (yes I'm old and still call them albums), that you can play from start to finish and every track is great.  They had huge releases before and after MP, but never anything as moving (no pun intended), complete and with great messages.  Each of the trio's contributions are exceptional here, in my opinion no one really stands above the rest.  My favorite song on here is the lesser-played \\"Camera Eye\\" which is the most progressive track on the album and one that has sadly never been on any of the many tons of live releases that have come afterward.  I wish they would cover it someday!  Also, don't listen to \\"Red Barchetta\\" if you have a fast sportscar with a great audio system in it.  You will get a ticket...
0307408833|3.0|I've made cupcakes, brownies, cookies, and a tea bread from this cookbook so far.  Some items have been great (cupcakes and cookies), some just ok (brownies), and others a downright failure (tea bread).  As others have mentioned, the ingredients are very costly so a dud is VERY painful.  I've been cooking and baking for years so I'm not inexperienced but have had some major disasters with these recipes.  It is to the point that I am wary of using my high priced ingredients on these recipes since they may not turn out.
B002N1AEN2|3.0|This album slipped under the radar with me. I just found out how highly acclaimed the album is within the last few weeks as many best-of-the-year lists have included it. I think I briefly glanced over an online news item or review back when the album was released but didn't give it much thought.    This British quartet (now trio, I believe) has produced an impressive debut as they opt to go with soft, echoey guitars,  chillout, breathy vocals, slow to mid-tempo electronic beats (no live drums here) and introspective lyrics about love and longing and regret. Sometimes the music is so mellow, I find it hard to pay attention to what the lyrics are that the guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim are singing. For me The XX is a strange combination of Tindersticks, Everything But the Girl, and the little known 90's ambient band Insides (please check out their samples for their album \\"Euphoria\\" on Amazon MP3 downloads!).    After several listens I do think the album as a whole is a bit overrated as the quality of certain songs don't quite match to the album's standout tracks - \\"Heart Skipped a Beat\\", \\"Islands\\", \\"Night Time\\", \\"Stars\\" and the one real classic track, IMO, \\"Intro\\", an instrumental that I just can't stop playing. I wish it was longer than the 2 plus minutes it actually is. It opens with some dreamy guitars (somewhat reminiscent of 80's greats The Chameleons and Echo & the Bunnymen) for a few bars before the eventual synth beats come in, almost reluctantly, before it takes off in a funky direction that's quite infectious. This song ends entirely too soon.    I'm sure the other songs will grow on me more than they have currently. There are really no bad tracks on here. And I'm finding this an album you can play repeatedly without tiring of it. I'm glad I gave this album a chance and I hope I can catch them on tour.      *** 1/2 stars.
0451457994|5.0|Sci- Fi doesnt get any better than this. Written in 1968 (concurrently with the movie), this book is about how man came to be, what might lie ahead. Written just before the US landed on the moon, this book stands the test of time and addresses man's quest for exploration, increasing understanding of the universe and extraterrestial life.<br /><br />The history of man is one of finding things we do not yet understand. Imagine finding a huge monilith buried under the surface of the moon and then later another one near Jupiter. What do they mean, how did they get there, what threat if any, do they pose? What response should the government and scientific community take?<br /><br />Arthur C Clark does a masterful job of exploring these questions. You may disagree with his conclusions, but his answers are certain to provoke thought and a new perspective on life as we know it now. Isn't that what good literature always does?
0786868724|5.0|This was a wonderful book, the flow and verbal images were superb.  This would make a great selection for a book club.
B002X1ZEPA|1.0|it is good but not so good. all her other albums are fine but she went over borad with this album! save your money! buy something else for christmas! about like 3 out of 13 i like on the album! wow! i am music, i am queen of music at my school! this is not good for your money!!!
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|What a wonderful production! The main singers are top-notch and totally believable in their roles as the young lovers, and the supporting singers are equally fabulous. I was absolutely enthralled with their singing and acting skills. The weakest links in this production were the stage direction and the make-up department. Act I moved so fast that, even though I am quite familiar with the opera, I had trouble keeping up with everything that was going on. The director seemed so intent on being creative that there was a general frenzied quality about the entire production. The flashbacks and scene overlays were very distracting and quite unnecessary to the action on stage -- it actually took away from focusing on the opera itself. Even the clouds out the large garret window moved at a hysterical rate of speed.    The other problem, and I have to agree with the other reviewers, was the make-up. In Act I Mimi looked too robust for her condition. If she is on the verge of collapse, then she certainly couldn not be feeling very well, but she did not appear frail at all, and had the wrong make-up on to reflect her condition. She also looked quite underdressed for such a cold winter where artists are destroying their own work for a few seconds of heat. In Act IV, once again -- singers great, make-up awful. Now Mimi, in her last stages of life, comes into the room with so much black eye shadow that it looked leftover from Halloween -- not the effect I would expect to see in someone so frail. Again, she was inappropriately dressed for the cold, wearing nothing but a sleeveless blouse. I wanted to wrap her in a down comforter rather than worry about getting her a muff for her hands. But again, the singing and acting came through gloriously, and the conclusion was dramatically heartbreaking.    For personal reasons, it is too bad that there is not a fade-out after each act so you can catch your breath and get ready for the next act. After all, it is still an opera, even though it is in movie form. I show these operas to a local opera group, and it is going to be tricky to catch the end of each act so that we can have an intermission.    All in all, I recommend this production to anyone who loves opera, as well as anyone who has never seen one. I purchased it immediately after watching it, and I'm planning to use this production for my upcoming showing of La Boheme in the spring. A must-have.
B0026P3G12|5.0|It's a cd full of longing, but not sadness.  Her voice is pure and the songs beautifully song!
B00164KYV4|2.0|Given the cast (apart from Ben Affleck), I was very hopeful for this film.  Alas, it was mediocre at best.  I was disinterested to the point of actually turning it off with probably 10min to go.  It was, in a word, boring.  And setting aside the numerous clichés about love and relationships in the digital age, the plotlines and chemistry between characters were dismal.  (Ben Allfeck as good guy?  Sorry, but he can't pull that off).     This was a struggle to watch.  The actors were obviously not at their best (e.g., Scarlett's scene at Handy Mart where she wins an ice box).  Boring boring boring.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had the series on DVD and I was just amazed and in awe of the beauty and intricacy with which God had created our planet.  I gave the DVD series to my parents and upgraded to a Blu Ray player, so I had to buy the Bluray version.  Watching on Bluray is a COMPLETE new experience, its like I haven't seen the series at all.  The colors are bright and crisp.  You can actually see the detail of the fur on animals.  My feelings and eyes tell me the animal/ bird/ mountain I'm looking at is real and I can reach out and touch it, but my mind tells me its a combination of my Samsung 52\\" TV(50,000:1 contrast ratio) and the Insignia Blu ray player (I have one of the lowest models).<br /><br />I think everyone on this earth must have this series, there is so much about our planet that we dont know.  The visuals and narration engage you in deep thoughts :)
B002HWRYJE|4.0|As a follower of the original series, The Next Generation, and all of the films, this interpretation of Star Trek is a really good one.  The characters are fun and not stale.  The actors seem perfect for the roles that they play and the story isn't half bad.  There are a few times when you want to say \\"huh\\", but not many.  The special effects help the \\"huh\\" quickly disappear.  Not wanting to spoil it for those considering a purchase, let me say that those who enjoy a movie with lots of action, comedy and special effects should buy this movie!  It reminds me of Indiana Jones in space.  Star Trek purists may find some things disagreable but that's to be expected.  Chances are even the purists have seen this one and most likely purchased the movie.  I own all three versions of this movie and even bought a Blu Ray player specifically for this film.  Note: If Leonard Nimoy is in the movie, rest assured this Star Trek movie is a very good one.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I got this CD for my mother who discovered Susan Boyle while watching a television interview and performance.  She fell in love with her and when she found out she was releasing a CD she had to have it.  I ordered it for her and she loves it.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|Having very much enjoyed recent (and not so recent --- 1940's P&P) film versions of my favorite Austen books (P&P, S&S, and Emma) I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, since Persuasion is probably my \\"favoritest\\" Austen of all. How disappointing!  I have no quarrel with the casting or the costumes or the sets or the scenery; BUT it seems to me that anyone who hasn't read the book will have little or no idea where the title comes from.  Lady Russell's persuasions eight years before the novel opens are only alluded to in passing, and those during the course of the movie itself seem more like intimidations.<br /><br />  Rather they should have titled this particular film \\"Family From Hell, after an idea of Jane Austen's\\"
0061719544|5.0|Since I watch Craigs Late, Late show every night, I wanted to better understand the man with the past.  Laughed my ass off, thruout the book.  Being a child of the 60's and 70's, i got everything he was talking about.  Tho, I did'nt do the drugs he did and I never drank.  Wished there were more pictures....like when he was in bands.  But, I loved the book, anyway.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excellent performance. My wife and I enjoy listening to her voice and the songs on this recording. Looking forward to more.[[ASIN:1849383774 Susan Boyle I Dreamed a Dream]
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I have watched Dexter since the first show on the network stations. That got me hooked! When I learned that I could purchase the DVD's on Amazon I just had to have them. Amazon.Com has been great! What I like about Dexter is the fact that he lives a regular life while having this one secret! I watched Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under and loved the part he played, I think he is great!!!
B002QB1910|4.0|I will admit that I have never purchased a Rihanna album.  I have heard songs from her before but never really cared for them (other than UNFAITHFUL).  I first heard \\"Russain Roulette\\" through an album link talking about \\"Rated R's\\" release.  I took to the song right away and from there, things tumbled.  When the listening samples became available through Amazon.com, I could not believe how many songs I liked.  Then once I finally received the album, I put it in my computer and sat back.  Each song showed a defined level of one type of emotion she was feeling.  I was shocked at how truthfully raw she was and could feel her thoughts.  A great product that yielded SEVEN favorites.  Good work and definately memorable.  She will receive nominations and possibly awards for this one!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. is such a worthwhile documentary. I enjoy hearing perspectives on all sides of an argument and find this to be an undeniable compilation of the atrocities plaguing our food industry. At times I found it shocking, but felt that necessary to encourage the change we all need to make. Food is the energy that fuels your body and mind; we should care more about how it is made and less about profit or cost.
0545123267|4.0|In alternating first-person narratives, Shiver is the story of Grace and her yellow-eyed wolf, Sam. Grace was saved by Sam when she was a child, and Sam is her winter wolf who watches her from the edge of the woods. In the summer, Sam turns human, but this may be his last year of being human and when tragedy strikes and he shows up on Grace's porch in human form, she needs to do all she can to hold onto him, but winter is biting at the windows and Sam knows that this will be their first and last time to hold onto each other.<br /><br />This YA fantasy/romance is a winter read, best read with the wind howling outside, the snow falling or as in Hawaii, the thunder and lightning threatening to tear the house down. I liked the temperature at the beginning of each chapter. It created tension as the temperature dropped, because it was a countdown for when Sam would disappear forever.<br /><br />The beginning of the book starts a little slow, and stilted, but once the two teens are together, it truly becomes a race for time.<br /><br /> I can't wait for the next book, Linger out in July 2010.
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|Exceptional by any standard of music. Alice in Chains is alive and well.  If you were ever a fan of Alice in Chains, you would never hope for the band to die with Staley.  It is a great disrespect to the other living members.  And they have pulled off an unquestioned masterpiece of a caliber only Alice and Chains can do.  The ratings speak for themselves.  Any one with an ear will love this album.    For the fans, this album is about moving on so the rest of the band isn't living under the shadow of a beloved member.  If you can't respect that, you are no true fan.
3527406018|5.0|Like what the other reviews have said, this book is the ideal choice for someone who is just starting their particle physics education. If you are interested in purchasing this textbook, I would recommend that you have some familiarity with quantum mechanics before attempting this book. You don't have to be a QM expert (although the more you know, the more you will be able to get out of this book). Griffith's book on quantum mechanics, while not the best, should be all you need. You can even get by covering both books at the same time...which is what I did. Other than that, an understanding of special relativity at the level of a standard modern physics course is all that is required.    Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to learn more about this exciting field of physics.
0786868724|5.0|Mitch Aubom has another wonderful story to share with us. Equally as compelling a read as \\"Tuesdays with Maurie\\". This story is original, not a sequel. We purchased multiple copies as gifts to friends and family.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Why buy the dvd when you can see Dr. Horrible online for free???  Two words:  Commentary!  the Musical!  ALSO, the outtakes are AMAZING along with the video submissions to join tghe Evil League of Evil.  Also, if you don't buy this dvd, you might one day randomly die a violent and horrible death.  True story.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|At 2.5 hours, it's about an hour and half too long. Nice story .. nice sad ending. It's a story about death, as told between a daughter and her mother on her death bed.
0307394549|4.0|This book is a great collection of recipes broken down into categories such as \\"light and crisp\\", \\"chunky and nutty\\", \\"soft and chewy\\", etc. Most of the recipes use everyday ingredients and are easy to follow. There are also plenty of glossy, tantalizing pictures to inspire you. Martha lives up to her reputation for quality recipes and publications with this book.<br /><br />My only issue with this book is that many of the recipes are repeats (exact same recipes) as the ones in her Christmas special cookie magazine publication. I would highly recommend this book if you have not previously purchased any cookie magazines by Martha. If you have, you probably already have these recipes.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Over all great experience buying from Amazon.   This was a gift,  but I'm sure they will enjoy it, they are big Trek fans.
B001NR8F2O|3.0|This album is only available in the KISS ALIVE Box Set and separately as an MP3 album on Amazon.  This was supposed to be the true ALIVE IV release, but red tape between the band and the record company, the release was delayed (By like 6 years) and KISS Syphoney was slapped on with the ALIVE IV sub-title....    This live collection is pretty good.  I actually think the Live version of FIREHOUSE on the cd is like the best live version I own.  Shout it Out Loud sounds good and really like the live version of LOVE GUN found on here to be excellent.  There are a few gems on here like the Original Four performing HEAVEN'S ON FIRE, I LOVE IT LOUD and LICK IT UP.  In concert, though, Paul alone played I STILL LOVE YOU before they ripped into BLACK DIAMOND and was disappointing it wasn't featured on this cd.  Ace's into the void was on here and sounds great.  Must say: Psycho Circus and Duece sounds much better on the Symphony/Alive 4 album for current recordings.  Though not a complete show released on cd, it is a nice addition to a KISS collection.  Someday, like with the KISSOLOGY DVDs, I wish KISS would release KISSOLOGY CDs of complete live shows from such tours like CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, LICK IT UP and REVENGE--Gene, are you reading this? LOL!!! It's KISS, it's an ALIVE release--They rule, even now with the new cd SONIC BOOM...I think KISS may actually be around to do a 50th anniversary tour--and could even maybe release an Alive 5 and 6 in the future!!!

0691126658|5.0|I used this guide on a birding trip to Uganda. This is an excellent guide.  When you order the guide though be sure to order the soft back edition rather than the hard back if you are going to use it as a field guide. The hard back weighs more and if you happen to drop it the back is liable to rip off.  If you do order the hard back be sure to reinforce the binding with shipping tape. Unlike some guides this one has a well though out index.  The common names are indexed separately from the scientific names. The family name are in bold so they stand out and the font is a large size for we old time birders who have a difficult time reading small print. In the back is a map of the area with all the important bird sites noted and listed. Certain of the drawings are not accurate, the Mountain Greenbul being a prime example.  The description says the underparts are yellow and they are in Uganda, but the drawing is not. The descriptions and range maps are opposite the drawings of the birds.  This is the 2nd copy of this guide I have owned.  I gave the first copy to my Uganda driver when he asked if I would sell it to him.  Folks in Uganda have a difficult time getting birding equipment.  If you do go there, take a couple of extra laser pointers, and an extra birding guide with you if you have room.  They make great gratuity items if you do not wish to sell them instead.  Also an extra pair of inexpensive binoculars.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Honoring the characters we all know and love, this movie is an entertaining and action-packed new Star Trek. It also doesn't hurt that the great special effects look beautiful off a blu-ray disk.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I'm a longtime fan of Sting, from about 'mid-police' days (from Ghost in the Machine, on), and frankly, I like his Classical stuff better than the jazz stuff by far (the lute album was very nice).  Having said that though, I'd agree with many, that his voice does sound a bit weird with him trying to accurately mimic the (supposed) Elizabethian vocal quirks.  IMO, his voice is so unique, and uniquely NOT like the typical voice singing this type of material, that he should just stick with his normal singing voice.  But hey, who am I to argue?  The entire point of my soft criticism is just that this tends to make this music wear a bit thin pretty soon. I can't listen to it over and over like some of his stuff.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Mark Wahlberg, an actor whose fierce gaze and sneaky humor can carry a movie over the rockiest terrain.  This movie has mayhem and drama. Entertaining.

The Secret continues to breathe new levels of excitement into my world...I believe it can do the same for you!
B002LVVCQM|3.0|It sort of pains me to give a Richard Dawkins book only 3 stars. Since the untimely death of Stephen Gould, Dawkins is the premier writer for non-scientific audiences about evolution. Unfortunately Dawkins has taken this effort, which he said would be his main statement `for' evolution and turned it into a statement `against' creationism in all its nefarious forms. There are the unrepentant `young Earthers' who think the Earth is less than 10,000 years old, and maybe flat, (and have to be at least mildly admired for their blind resistance to facts) the `enlightened' creationists who think `God' directed evolution through natural law, and the least intellectually honest who disguise their basic creationist bent behind the guise of `Intelligent Design.'    Unfortunately this is all plowed ground for Dawkins; he has covered all this material in depth elsewhere. I'm not sure who the intended audience for this book was. I am a biologist and have studied evolution all my life and found little of interest or new there (as compared to Dawkins' admirable `Ancestor's Tale') and the on-going bullyragging of creationists has become frankly boring. I realize that this idiotic point of view is actually increasing around the world, but \\"if all the world believes a foolish thing, it remains foolish\\" (Bertrand Russell I think).    Dawkins needs to foregoe this `debate' with creationists and return to explication of evolutionary facts for the lay reader. Creationists are not, barring some terrible epiphany, going to change either their closed minds or there pernicious attacks on science; the courts not popular literature is the proper battle ground.    Read this book if you are unfamiliar with basic Darwinian theory and want at least to become familiar with the basic arguments against creationism; otherwise read any of Dawkins' other books, they are better written and more informative.
B001QB9H10|5.0|The action in this installment of the Transporter series I would have to say is the best thus far. This is a very entertaining movie.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I love every single track. It's been years since i've enjoyed a full album. Muse has also inspired me to dust my piano off and play along, especially with \\"I belong to you\\" (although i'm still mad that the Twilight crowd has sank their fangs into that one).    Every track is very melodic, catchy and intelligent with many layers of music to look out for:    1. \\"Uprising\\" - makes you want to clap along. One of my favorites from the album. The melody sounds like the theme song to Dr. Who.    2. \\"Resistance\\" - 'it could be wrong, could be wrong' - the chorus is the same idea as the chorus of \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\". I love the piano melody too. This is another of my favorites from the album - it starts off with the kind of sound I love Muse for.    3. \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" - WOW! I love the chorus with the mixed octave voices and the string plucks that go throughout the song.    4. \\"United States of Eurasia\\" - Starts out very slow but turns very ballady and sounds like the band Queen towards the end. I love the minor (harmonic minor I think?) strings. Tell me that part doesn't sound like that one piece from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom! \\"Slave Children's Crusade\\" [...]    5. \\"Guiding Light\\" - Not one of my favorites from the album compared to the others but still very good. The sound reminds me of another band - Queen maybe? Can't figure it out.    6. \\"Unnatural Selection\\" - This one has a much harder rock sound, very good but not for everyone. I love the beginning organ section and the chorus where he says \\"counterbalances corrosion....\\"    7. \\"MK Ultra\\" - Probably one of the more forgettable ones from the album but if it's on I enjoy it. It has some memorable parts. Better than Guiding Light though    8. \\"I Belong To You [+Mon Coeur S'Ouvre A Ta...\\" - I absolutely love this song - my favorite from the whole album. The piano part totally makes this song. The break in the middle for the classical piece is strange but it grows on you.    9-11. \\"Exogenesis\\" - Ilove how they broke it apart into different movements of a symphony like they're Beethoven or something :). Very low-key and beautiful.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I don't know where to begin.  This is a wonderful cd by a wonderful woman.  She makes us all believe in ourselves because it's a complete victory for the underdog.  Everytime I hear her sing I Dreamed a Dream I tear up.  She is just fab and I am so very glad she was on England's Got Talent.  I was not a Simon fan AT ALL until I seen his face when she opened her mouth to sing.  Granted, there are a couple of songs on there that I did not expect from her but that's ok.  My final review\\" LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.  Did I mention that I LOVE IT!!!!!!
B002ECJZ76|4.0|A Christmas Story from Finland is a film about Nikolas, a young orphan boy that grows up to be Santa Claus. The film starts out very slowly, taking almost 15 minutes to captivate. Once that introductory hump is passed, this is a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming movie. This ends up being a really sweet movie.<br /><br />Not all is perfect with this film. The Scandinavians understand something essential, if they want to do business with the world, they have to speak English; otherwise they will simply talk with 2 or 3 million others that speak that one unique language. This film was dubbed in English, the actors all spoke Finnish when they shot this film. Post-production equally decent actors spoke the English sound track. There is no way to sync sound and mouth movements with two unrelated languages, (to think that is even remotely possible is ludicrous).<br /><br />The downside to this film, there are only two soundtracks, English in 5.1 and English in 2 channel stereo. There is no Finnish soundtrack. There are no subtitles period, not even for hearing impaired. The production company blew this DVD; a choice would have been good.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful. Nikolas at all ages is believable. The makeup was not good, as people aged, that failing was more apparent. This movie was shot in some of the most inhospitable places in the world. They shot in 35 below zero weather. It stands to reason that the snow in the film is real, nothing sprayed on. Sadly, we've gotten so used to Hollywood's version of snowfall, that the real thing now looks horribly fake. People actually had rime ice on their beards and mustaches. You could feel the cold in the film.<br /><br />This is an all age's film. Lisakki is supposed to be an evil horrible man, a la Scrooge, that mistreats Nikolas. In reality he is simply very particular and demanding about work. Nikolas is never mistreated, at least not on camera. He is expected to do a good job, but nothing outlandish. Saturday morning programs have much worse in them. In the end, this is a wonderful warm movie.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from this film. I love Scandinavian film, and thought this had potential to retell a story we all think we know. I loved this version of the St. Nikolas story, it made so much sense. I wasn't disappointed.hem. In the end, this is a wonderful warm movie.     I didn't know what to expect from this film. I love Scandinavian film, and thought this had potential to retell a story we all think we know.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Enough has written about the movie itself, this review only has relevant information about the aesthetics of the blu-ray disc artwork. Though I do not care, I know a lot of collectors would. The discs do not have any artwork printed on the back, other than a title printed in blue text. Looks cheap enough. I loved the movie and that's why I bought the blu-ray. But if you care about how your discs look outside the blu-ray player, then this might turn you off.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Even 8 years after her debut album, 'Songs in A minor', Alicia Keys remains one of the most exciting artists recording today. Each album is highly anticipated by critics and fans alike. Of course, there is no shortage of R&B artists or singer-songwriter-pianists out there today but what Alicia does that sets her apart from her peers is that she dares to be different. In her debut, she was groundbreaking because while other female singers set their music to a formulaic R&B framework, she melded blues, jazz and swing to create a completely individual and unique sound. But what is particularly impressive about Alicia is she continues to evolve, tweaking her sound and style with each successive release. Her sophomore effort 'The Diary of Alicia Keys' saw her subtly incorporate more electronica and funk while her third studio release 'As I Am' saw Miss Keys' soulful and gritty vocal work set against a more rock-influenced soundscape. While the divergence in style between this and her last release is less than that between the other albums, she nonetheless shows she is an artist of continual evolution.     In 'The Element', she sings of love and heartbreak with that raspy yet sweetly sorrowful alto that is classic of Miss Keys, but she has the talent and diversity to give these timeless and much-sung-about themes a fresh take. Take for example, 'Love is blind', which I feel is the strongest song. She summons up a hitherto unheard of timbre in her voice that at once conveys desperation and defiance. Supporting her are finely crafted background vocal motifs and strong melancholic beat. Then she effortlessly switches gear to sing sweetly of loss in her release 'Doesn't mean anything' that is reminiscent of 'No one' from her last album. The diversity continues with the sparse 'Try sleeping with a broken heart'. Then there are the funk ballads 'This bed', 'Unthinkable'. One would think that such diversity contained within one album would cause a discord. Yet the work as a whole is actually extremely cohesive. The shifts in style keep the listener engaged throughout the whole album.     Many people have maligned 'Put it in a love song', the much anticipated duet with Beyonce. The song has a motoric, highly percussive, almost angular beat (similar to that found on Beyonce's 'Single Ladies') contrasted with moments of softer melodic phrases. I feel it shows a playful side and the two superstars actually work well with each other, feeding off one another's energy.     As much as I admire Miss Keys, her albums tend to have some low moments and this release is no exception. For example, 'Like the sea' uses the opening lines of Debussy's first Arabesque for piano, which as a pianist myself, I find absolutely tasteless and cringe-worthy. It did not work like Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' did on her introduction on her debut. 'That's how strong my love is' is an overly sappy and sentimental piano-driven ballad where the piano motif sounds like muzak by Richard Clayterman rather than the spunky jazzy funk Alicia is known for.     Despite its flaws, this is a very satisfying and commanding release from an artist that is at the top of her game and yet still shows limitless potential. It leaves one wondering what kind of musical alchemy she will conjure for her next release. And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, Alicia Keys is here to stay.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This one got knocked out of the park but there was a flaw, near the end of the flick which disturbed me a bit.  Do you honestly believe that the theatre would have been this lack with security?  In the real life, there would have been soldiers covering each door and entrance.  There would have been armed guards in the projector room and behind the film screen, plus a bomb sniffing German Shepard at the main door, where the tickets/invitations were being checked.      Other than that, I really liked it.

B000008L90|5.0|One of the enduring things about Donna Summer is the ability to transform even mundance songs into dance tracks with that powerhouse voice that carried her from the chorus' of the 60's musicals to the forefront of the disco era.    One thing is for certain - if you have the cassette, the LP(album), or the elusive CD (of which I have all 3 formats and 2 of the cd version), this is an album that shows again that Donna was on top of her game right after SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY hit the airwaves.    working again with the same producer, Michael Omartian, she provides \\"ear candy\\" track after track.  Everything from her signature diso-esque sounds to full on gospel.    Worth the price when you can find it - in any format~!

0882709194|5.0|What sets this edition apart from others is Ray Comfort's introduction dismantling the myriad fallacies of evolution: the complete lack of transitional forms, the assumption that in this one case entropy was working *backwards*, that information comes from chaos, the many hoax fossils and deliberate distortions of fossil data (such as 'inferring' transitional forms from bone fragments rather than complete skeletons), inability to account for the pre Cambrian explosion, etc., etc., etc.    This is probably the only shot a student has at getting a balanced presentation of evolution, both pro and con. Although Darwin is at somewhat of a disadvantage. He did not know what his followers would do in his name, even after he warned that 'if it could be disproven that life could have evolved through numerous, successive slight modifications my theory would be false', which has been done in numerous instances since publication of Origin. The fact that this work was chosen is probably that it is considered 'classic', so there is still some merit in refuting it.

B002Q9MZHE|4.0|This performance of La Boheme should please most people. Villazon and Netrebko certainly live up to the hype. If you looked at the packaging, you would think that they were the only two performers. They are featured on the front cover and written about extensively on the back cover. Oddly, there is no mention of the remaining cast members, all of whom give worthy performances. They include  Vitalij Kowaljow,  Nicole Cabell and  St&egrave;phane Degout. Kowaljow and Degout are amazing and at times almost steal the show. Cabell is a delightfully flirtatious and then sensitive Musetta. This DVD is a movie and it's one of the better film versions of an opera that I've seen. Occasionally, Robert Dornhelm opts for closeups when the singers are wide mouthed, which struck me as odd. He clearly loves Netrebko and she gets plenty of loving closeups when she's not singing.<br /><br />This is definitely a worthy addition to any opera lovers collection, but the lack of notes and casting on the packaging is unacceptable.
B000X418UO|4.0|With the constant deluge of new movies being released either in theaters or onto DVD and Blu-ray, it often proves difficult to find the time to revisit older favorites that haven't been watched in quite awhile. This was most recently the case with the 1997 action hit \\"Con Air\\". I remembered thoroughly enjoying this movie upon its release to theaters 12 years ago, and having re-watched it again, I discovered that I still enjoy it just as much to this day.    \\"Con Air\\" is the story of parolee Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), a former Army Ranger, who's placed into the middle of an extremely deadly situation when the prison airplane that he's aboard is overtaken by the other prisoners. Now, Poe must overcome seemingly insurmountable odds against some of the worst society has to offer in order to make it home to his family in time for his daughter's birthday.    This movie proudly features all the elements that are crucial for any successful blockbuster action flick. From the relentless pacing, hard-hitting action sequences, clearly defined roles of good and evil, and even a little bit of humor, \\"Con Air\\" ticked off every box on the action movie checklist. Over the course of the film, the proceedings never felt tired, boring or lacking in entertainment value. Of course, one would expect nothing less when Hollywood's most prolific action film producer, Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Armageddon\\") is overseeing the project.    Written by Scott Rosenberg (\\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\") and directed by Simon West (\\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\") the film moves along at a very brisk pace from start to finish. The execution from page to screen, is that of a smash-mouth actioner that is fully aware of who its audience is and what they expect, all the while delivering in full.    Rosenberg's script would never be recognized as being one of the great dramatic screenplays of our time, not that anyone would expect such an achievement from this type of film. That being said, the script is jam-packed with sharp,quick-witted dialogue and engaging characters that draw you in no matter how depraved they may be. If a writer can make characters that represent the basest criminals of our society interesting, and dare I say entertaining to watch, then everything else should just fall into place. On the flip side, perhaps it's not a good thing to make these types of people entertaining to audiences. Maybe the fact that something like this is acceptable is just another example of how far our society's moral compass has degraded. Either way, that's a debate for another time and place.    In my estimation, for an action film to succeed, it's not enough that there be action aplenty. The characters, be they the heroes or villains, need to be more than merely one-dimensional clichés. There must always be a purpose driving both sides of the movie for it to endure over time with audiences. If there is no drive or reason behind the events unfolding: then, don't bother with releasing the movie to theaters. Instead, let the movie die a slow and painful death alongside the plethora of Steven Seagal movies that no cares to remember. Not to mention, there must also be some element within the various players (primarily the hero or heroes) that connects with the audience enough for us to be willing to go along for the potentially wild ride that lies ahead. In all of this, \\"Con Air\\" succeeds, which is why myself and numerous others still find the movie just as entertaining after all these years.    Speaking of the characters within this film, they of course would be nothing if it wasn't for the myriad of talent employed to bring them all to life. Leading the cast is Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage (\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\") as former Army Ranger turned unfortunate victim of circumstance, Cameron Poe. Cameron is the epitome of what it means to be a hero no matter the cost. Honestly, he's a borderline cliché of stoic heroes past. He's a man whom through training has been honed into becoming the perfect weapon; conversely, he has the proverbial heart of gold and will do anything to protect his friends. Despite the familiarity, Cage portrays Poe as a hero conflicted by his desire to reunite with his family; however, he feels honor bound by his sense of duty to stand his ground against seemingly overwhelming odds. It is this inner-conflict, along with his dry wit and clear compassion for others on display that allows Nic to elevate his role beyond the one-dimensional character he could have been.    The supporting cast of characters is an eclectic collection of talented performers from John Malkovich (\\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\") to Ving Rhames (\\"Mission: Impossible\\") to Steve Buscemi (\\"Reservoir Dogs\\"). Each supporting cast member clearly enjoys their time onscreen, especially those portraying the various criminals.    Veteran actor John Malkovich could have gone extremely overboard with his portrayal as Cyrus \\"The Virus\\" Grissom, a man whom, as described in the movie, \\"...is a poster child for the criminally insane.\\" Yet, Malkovich merely gets to the edge of overacting before reining his performance back in. John delivers a character that is intriguing, disturbed, and above all, devoid of morals. He's a killer without mercy, complete with a sardonic wit that makes you cringe just a little every time you laugh at one of his comments.    Alongside John in the criminal cavalcade are Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi, as a militant raging against anything and everything and a cannibalistic serial killer respectively. Rhames is entertaining as the man known as Diamond Dog; sadly though, we never really get to see what makes his character tick. Unlike Cyrus, Diamond Dog is relegated to merely playing second fiddle in both the story and as a villain. A little more time with this character could have provided the story with even more depth and intrigue, but we'll have to make do with what we got.    As for Steve Buscemi, what can I say other than the man's physical appearance (perhaps slightly accentuated for the role) is nearly perfect for the deranged serial killer, Garland Greene. His character was one that could have been taken too far into Hannibal Lecter territory, and there is one scene that introduces the possibility; thankfully, Scott Rosenberg had the smarts to not go that route. While taking Garland to that level of evil onscreen would have lent the movie an even more serious tone, the end result would have been detrimental to the film. The decision would have thrust the film into such a dark territory that it could have potentially lost its commercial appeal and resulted in a weaker performance at the box office.    Of course, as is the case with all movies, all of these elements alone cannot make for a thoroughly entertaining experience. To finish the experience, you need a director capable of harnessing all of the loose elements together to create something worthwhile for audiences to enjoy. For this film, former commercial director and first-time film director Simon West (\\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\") seemed to be the ideal man for the job.    As a director of TV commercials, Simon undoubtedly knew the importance of grabbing an audience's attention from the get-go and never letting up. A trait which I believe benefited him greatly on this film. Despite his background, Simon seemed to restrain himself from rushing the story along in order to get to the more thrilling aspects of the film. By doing so he allowed the audience time to get to know his characters somewhat before thrusting the proceedings into high-gear. Although, I do wish a little more time could have been spent on expanding upon Cameron's time as an Army Ranger or exploring a few of the other main criminal characters. Even with that slight drawback, the film, as it is, stands far above so many other action films out there.    Finally, \\"Con Air\\" is an extremely entertaining action film rife with surprisingly entertaining characters, humor, action, and even some drama. If you're a fan of all those crappy Steven Seagal Direct-to-DVD movies (or any of the others that are just like his) then do yourself a massive favor and pop this movie in the next time you feel like watching an action flick.    \\"Con Air\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|We love this movie. We taped this movie on DVR for my two year old son and he loved it so we decided to buy it for the car too. It is so cute and my husband and I really enjoy watching it too. There are jokes that only adults catch on to, but nothing that kids can't see. It's funny and not one of those movies that get annoying when the kids want to watch it over and over.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|I bought the Stereo Remastered Box Set (back in October) with great anticipation.  Although I have not listened to all the CDs as of yet, I have noticed a distinct difference in the sound and clarity.  Since I am doing this review under the White Album, I will start with this one.  It seems to me that the music on these discs has had the bass boosted and the music compressed, thereby affecting separation and clarity.  Case in point: BACK IN THE USSR is a little clearer in terms of the high end spectrum (cymbals, piano), but the bass has been totally subdued. In the original '68 recording, you could at least hear the plucking of the bass guitar strings, now.....nothing!  On BIRTHDAY, John's voice is barely heard at all, with the bass jacked up!  On....ME AND MY MONKEY: the guitar and drum snare have been basically lowered with heavier bass.  OK, it does have its good points, too.  REVOLUTION 9 sounds great, and the acoustic stuff like JULIA and BLACKBIRD sound better than ever.  Overall, I actually like the '98 remastered version better from the 30th Anniversary CDs.  But, to each his own is my humble advice to all.<br /><br />The one constant thing I did notice after listening to half the box set is the distinction of the sound between BEATLES music from '63 - '66 (hence B1) and '67 - '70 (B2).  It's almost like night and day!  For some reason, the earlier albums sound clearer with more clarity and separation while the later albums are more compressed with heavier bass.  I actually enjoyed their earlier CDs remastering but, I was a little disheartened at what the engineers at Abbey Road did to the music of the older albums.  But, that's just me.  Others may like the new sound to SPLHCB, White Album or ABBEY ROAD.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying it's a bad investment to buy this box set or any other BEATLES albums because the music does (and will ALWAYS) rule, but to those who fancy themselves audiophiles, be prepared to either like them or be somewhat disappointed with the remastering job.disappointed with the remastering job.
0143038419|5.0|What a yummy mixture of pure, gut-yanking honesty about one's inner life; humor and the luscious, rich color of world travel!  So many of my friends were reading this simultaneously, as we'd discover by surprise.  We'd say:  \\"I'm in India.\\"  Or: \\"I'm just in Italy....\\"  I read through it, highlighting parts that resonated with truth for me, folded down pages to read to my boyfriend who was wowed by Gilbert's writing and alternately guffawed at her clever and funny twist on food and culture.  I journeyed with her via my own divorce, through my own self-discovery and release from the torture of my own mind and to a greater God than that contained by religion and of also unexpectedly finding love again.  I put this book on my list of best reads of all times.  In many ways, Gilbert's journey was a template for so many of us readers, only we traveled through pages, she being our tour guide through the pasta of Italy, India-infused spirituality and the sands of Indonesia, her suitcase stuffed and overflowing from the inward journey.  Bravo! Bravo! This review was written three years ago and just now published here, which means O Magazine has excerpted Gilbert's first book since this publishing phenomenon, plus delivered a Q&A with the author. I'm hooked. And, I'm buying.

B002SQNM9A|5.0|Swifty does it, again. It's impossible for her to put out bad music. Sure, there are only six songs on this album; but quantity does not equal quality. Taylor should be commended for her integrity in never stuffing filler songs in her albums.     Songs:   1. \\"Last Christmas\\" starts the album off with a bang! (or should I say Wham!?;) Taylor's cover of George Michael's holiday classic has a more upbeat tempo and fun, rock and roll edge along with a tongue-in-cheek gender turn, but still perfectly conveying her persona of heart-on-her-sleeve vulnerability.    2. \\"Christmases When You Were Mine\\". First of the two new Taylor songs on this album slows down the mood. The usual great lyrics from team Swift/Rose in a monologue to a broken-up lover and the Christmas memories they shared.    3. \\"Santa Baby\\". Playing the materialistic vixen perfectly. I like the tongue-in-cheek allusion, \\"one more thing I need, the deed, to a platinum mine\\". Judging by the number of platinum albums she has, I'd say TayTay's got that covered.    4. \\"Silent Night\\". Beautiful, spiritual, uplifting. Perfect song for her voice. Like an angel singing.     5. \\"Christmas Must Be Something More\\". The other new Taylor song, upbeat tempo, worth the price of the entire album. Taylor gets a lot of inspiration from fairy tales, this one's from the Dr. Seuss classic \\"The Grinch That Stole Christmas\\", but of course, putting her own unique spin: \\"So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives\\". Taylor's not afraid to show her spiritual, Christian values here, where she downplays the commercialism and materialism that Christmas has become (in stark contrast to track 3 \\"Santa Baby\\"). The great artists, like Taylor Swift, remind us of the Truth with their art.    6. \\"White Christmas\\". Nice quiet, peaceful ending with this classic.

0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown has become one of my favorite authors with two novels:  \\"The Davinci Code\\" and \\"The Lost Symbol\\". Delving into the reasons and rituals behind secret societies, he reminds me of the ancient author Homer,(\\"The Iliad\\" and \\"The Odyssey\\") whose unique blending of documented facts with his own improvised story line was one of the first to do so, and also served as some of the first literature I was exposed to.   I'm impressed with this captivating, flawless style, the weaving of highly intricate plot material into such readable language; the ease of tracking the names and characters because of the interest each of them instantly provides the reader; and obvious meticulous research of actual facts enhanced by the fictional characters.      Both of these excellent novels are intellectually stimulating as well as being intensely captivating. I decided to read them well after they were written simply because, during an intense resurrection of dormant-since-high-school-enthusiasm with American History and the forefathers, I became more intrigued by the subject of Free Masons after discovering just how many of the forefathers belonged to the society.  The limited research experience has changed almost every pre-conceived concept I held about them.  Their phrases and rituals are woven and used subconsciously throughout our own open societies, \\"giving the third degree\\", being just one example of the influence noted.  As you read, signs and symbols you never particularly dissected mentally before take on a whole new dimension.    In a quick summary that is not intended to do the topics justice,  the main character, Robert Langdon, is an educator extraordinaire who specializes in the history of secret societies, covert coding and symbols that date back to early recorded histories, where persecution for free thought - or thought unsanctioned - drove the people, who deviated from the mainstream underground - most of them possessing genius.  His research is widely respectedand recognized as important, as is his common sense approach in the interpretation of it, making him a desirable contact when scholarly evaluation becomes necessary.   However, it \\"ain't easy bein' him\\",  he finds to his discomfiture - as he is thrust headlong into reliving the mysteries surrounding these secrets, their societies, and their symbolic structure.  Adding to the intrigue is the knowledge that most things seemingly are intertwined; across the ages, across cultures, protected by a chosen few who must prove their worth and their dedication.  This is the underlying thread for both of the novels.     Both books have extensive reviews already assigned to them and little more of actual use to a prospective reader can be given; but in highly recommending both of them,  I also  enthusiastically rate both of them five stars and would rate them higher if the choice were mine.  They are certainly out of the ordinary.

In 4ch mode, you can only select up to a 48k/24bit sampling format.This was somewhat of a bummer for a quality-dependent engineer as myself.  2) The device can also be used as a USB microphone/USB audio interface when connected to a computer via the USB cable. (it makes you choose whether you want to connect it as eternal drive to retrieve the recordings or as a standard USB audio device)  In this case, the bandwidth is limited to 48khz/16bit/stereo, conforming to the standard for USB audio devices.  3) The two XLR-inputs have preamps that are comparable to those found on USB audio-interfaces in the same price range - for normal close-miked music, interview recording or high-output mics, this is not as much of a problem, but if you want to capture pristine natural soundscapes or silent sound events and need some gain on the pres, the first thing you hear hissing are the preamps, not the mics you connected.  4) Using external preamps and turning down the somewhat hissy amps of the H4N on the other hand tends to overdrive easily.  The target group that will enjoy this device most are people who record their rehearsals, especially using the built-in mics - also, people making composition sketches using the 4ch multitrack mode that allows overdubbing(!... pretty incredible for such a tiny box for $300)   All the functions sit right on the edge of being \\"almost pro\\", yet it isn't completely pristine, not really top notch:  If your priority is top-quality, the bigger recorders such as the Tascam HD-P2 or the Korg MR-1000 or an Oade Bros modded Fostex FR2 are definitely better choices. But that is a whole different pricetag, and does not include any mics whatsoever.  So, it seems where it's at, it's without much competition at this point.
B002WTOXUK|1.0|I was surprised at how bad this film was! How could all these special effects be rendered so blah?   It was so bad that I lost my normal ability to suspend belief in order to immerse myself in the film. Rent it. don't buy it

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles Stereo Box Set is something I was expecting to be released at least for 15 years.. And now I have all the Beatles albuns remastered at home! I cannot believe it! I am very happy!  The documentaries are short, but really nice!   I bought this box myself as a Christmas gift! When I received it at home, it was like Santa Claus was delivering a child's favorite toy for Christmas...
B0026P3G12|4.0|What an amazing voice! She makes me cry every time she sings \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\". I can't wait for the next album. I would like to hear more songs that do justice to that voice. This one was rushed to market and falls a little short in that dept.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul McCartney's concert Good Evening New York is absolutely amazing!!! There are some tributes to people who were part of his life and are now gone: Linda, John and George. In my opinion, the two most exciting performances are: I'm Down, in which the other Beatles participate by the screen (when they played at Shea Stadium), and Live and Let Die!   I recommend this product!
B000021Y7X|5.0|Very creative, high energy, and I wanted more. I was not a huge fan of the band but this video is amazing! It brought a different life to the music and the artistry. What a treat!
B002NXSRX4|1.0|There isn't a single positive note in this picture. Every actor is horrible, the script is pointless, and the directing is the most amateurish I've ever seen in a mainstream action/adventure film. To top it off, the PG-13 rating is wildly inappropriate; the violence in this film is clearly deserving of an R, but no one uses the f-word, so of course the MPAA rewarded it.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This flick is helped immensely by diminished expectations.  Going into it I felt this was going be a cynical effort seeing that the series promised to conclude twenty years ago with \\"The Last Crusade\\".  I was ready to tag the movie \\"Geritol Jones\\".  That said, messrs. Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford have revisited the series and have delivered a wholly satisfying entry.  While not as fast paced as \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" it has slowed down rhythms probably in deference to Harrison Ford's age.  Though not as quick with the whip as he once was Ford floats by on his familiar charisma.  It was great to see Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood, the only femme fatale worthy of Indy.  Allen doesn't seem to have aged in thirty years.  Cate Blanchett is deliciously villainous as a Russian baddy recalling Beloque from \\"Raiders\\".  Great closing shot that suggests the direction the series may or may not go.  Only sin is it doesn't reach the heights of the original but in the spirit of the season I'm giving it the full five star treatment.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I surprisingly liked the movie, I thought it might be dry but it was done really well.  A little over the top with demonizing corporations but still a good movie.  I may even change some of my eating habits now.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino since \\"Reservoir Dogs\\".  That said I was heartily disappointed with his previous grindhouse experiment.  I saw this effort in the cinema and though I liked it I wasn't overly enthusiastic.  My excuse was that I found the constant switch from English to foreign language with subtitles jarring.  Some films, however, deserve a second viewing.  Not since \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense\\" over ten years ago have I reversed my initial opinion of a film.  What I think these film's share are deeply layered scripts that contain alot of subtleties that if you're not alert you miss things.  This is a very ambitious effort by Tarantino.  I won't say he has matured as a filmmaker because he's always been one of our more talented auteurs but this is a progression.  In a nutshell I would describe it as a war film that seems to be a homage to Sergio Leone informed by a film geek's sensibility.  It's a true original even though Tarantino's influences would be apparent to the most astute viewer.  The film is anchored by two brilliant performances one by Brad Pitt as the commando leader and Christoph Waltz as a Gestapo officer.  If Waltz doesn't take home Oscar gold for his work here something's seriously wrong.  In the past I was hesitant to recommend some of Tarantino's work, usually for his penchant for extreme violence and language, and even though this film is harsh at times I wouldn't have as an extreme reservation.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I am in love with this album. My husband is currently deployed to Afghanistan. There are many songs on here that I enjoy. The song Distance and Time speaks volumes to me. I am so emotional when I hear it. She really describes how a long distance relationship feels. All of the army wives appreciate a song that we can relate to.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is the favorite Dream Theatre album for many lovers of this excellent inspiring band. Their music is heavy but ambitious and perfectly well executed which brought them to the forefront of a style of progressive metal rock which they dominate. There are plenty of reviews here and elsewhere devoted to and explaining really well the excellence of this concept and recording. I would like to offer a supposition concerning the genesis of this concept album. Only John Petrucci could confirm or deny the validity of my assumption, based solely on the intuitional feeling I am getting when I listen to this music. So, here is my theory. The concept for this album came after the fact and was designed to be able to share the fact with the broader audience in a way accessible to us. The fact itself is described by John in song number 11: The Spirit Carries On in his words 'I used to be frightened of dying, I used to think death was the end. But that was before, I'm not scared anymore, I know that my soul will transcend. I may never find all the answers, I may never understand why. I may never prove what I know to be true, but I know that I still have to try'. So, once again, my theory says that either John or someone whom he totally trusts had experienced the fact, which caused John to write the above words first, possibly this song, and later on to develop the rest of the plot for the story. The band ended up transforming John's experience of the fact into an unique concept for a progressive rock album titled appropriately Scenes From The Memory. So, what is the fact? It could be life after death experience so many of us went through. I went through it too, by drowning in the river at the age of 6. Someone had jumped after me and picked me up from the bottom. I will never forget that experience because when you go through something so life-changing you think about it first every minute, in the following days and weeks every hour, after a while once a day, and 40 years later probably no more but still at least once a week. However, when you go through the tunnel of death, although again there is no space for any doubt, there is a certain amount of haziness involved. You loose your fear of dying, you know there is no death, but still, all of the records of those facts do not sound and feel exactly the same as these lyrics make me feel. I had spent my teenage years researching those facts and often coming back to these records, and I don't think that we are talking about the experience of life after death.<br /><br />I think that we are dealing with the situation experienced by people during their waking hours when all of a sudden their universe opens up and they are finding themselves still exactly where they were in physical terms, inside of their room or in their hospital bed, wherever, but their consciousness transcends and becomes the superconciousness for a moment. Sometimes there are more people together and all are allowed into that cosmic field of superconciousness and in other times a person standing within your reach has no clue what, besides him, you are seeing and experiencing, and you have no doubt that your reality is real. The person next to you (most often there is no one there) exists in 3 dimensions whereas you found yourself within 4 of them. And that 4th dimension most likely would be undetectable by our scientific means, because it has more to do with the state of our mind and emotion and it is even much more subtle than that. It is a state of our soul. Our science doesn't even believe in the existence of soul and takes it for some derivative of an accumulated over our lifetime a brain function and product.<br /><br />Superconciousness seems to be the appropiate discription. Our awareness and understanding is 1000 fold greater. All of the sudden, within a second we can experience memories and feelings, and analyze our situation in a way we would need minutes or hours for in our normal condition. That state is so different from moments when our reality is altered by psychedelic or other drugs when the reality becomes shifted, but definitely not escalated on beyond of the laws of our earthly universe. You can find out more about that spiritual kingdom by going through records of life after death. There is a moment when you evaluate your life, go backwards through it, and feel what you had caused by your actions and thoughts, but the feelings you are experiencing are not your own, and they do not arise in a manner of how you would have felt if you were in their position, either. You simply experience the feelings of other people affected by you. You are in superconciousness then, but again, coming back from life after death involves crossing thresholds completely absent in the experience (I think) I am reviewing. What I find so fascinating when I listen to The Spirit Carries On is that overwhelming burst of euphoria or optimism coming out of the experience of the fact. Those coming back from the thresholds of death usually do not react in such way, because first, they had always expected that state of life, or at least knew it could have existed and must have given it some thoughts in the past. Second, the experience of death although quite incredible will be extremely challenging for most of us. No reason to jump for joy. On the other hand, to experience superconciousness during your everyday is to start living inside of the magical labyrinth from then on. At that moment your system of beliefs in the spiritual world out there which you expected to be surrounded by after your bodily death gets shattered. All of a sudden you realize that the spiritual universe out there is and must have always been within and right next to you. The realization of that proximity is shocking but in the greatest possible way (well, that really depends on your yesterdays, I guess). You feel safe (or exposed but even than you feel loved, I bet) and the realization that it only took one monumental thought (often in your moment of doubt) to let the kingdom come...overwhelms you. I think that either John or someone he knows really well had experienced that stage of superconciousness. This is my theory.<br /><br />Perhaps you will say, dude who gives a fact? I like Mike's drums, the bass, John's guitar lines, the keys and the way James sings, and you have just wasted my time. Well, I am sorry for that. However, if you have any interest in the subject I am on, you could research it further.... First you could download a song called Shine by Depeche Mode, and then another one called Suffer Well. Next, you could turn to chapter 5 of a book called Edgar Cayce's Predictions For The 21st Century (and by the way, do not dismiss his real time experiences just because some of his sleep induced predictions are wrong or late. Timing often is completely off in such situations anyway) by Mark Thurston, Ph.D. After that reach for Rudolf Steiner for the best explanation. By now you will know exactly what to search for and you will find it in a title of his book. Plenty of additional materials on the subject. Why bother? Well, don't.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is the best!  I got it for husband, a big Beatles fan and he loves it!
B0030DD9I4|5.0|The new songs are awesome.  Music Box is easily my favorite of the new ones and the third verse of that song is straight fire from Em.  There are no weak songs on this refill.  Dre holds it down well providing even more haunting beats.  Elevator reminds me of The Eminem Show which is my favorite Eminem album to date so this has me really excited for Relapse 2.

B002RVAOQ0|3.0|As action films go there is action.  That is fine for a big screen TV, but not worth the theater screen fare.  Honestly, T1 & T2 were the best in the series and should have stopped there.  All those that followed are just confused, inconsistent messes. Yep, the action is there but plot, story line, dialog, and acting are...well...never fluid.  This film with McG and Bale prove it.  If you want action it is here, if you are looking for rebirth of the franchise and substance...no it is not here.
0143116177|2.0|My guess is this book was partway written when the subprime crisis hit. In the early sections, there is good history to read. But then there is a rapid switch to the current recession, and the book ceases to be history and becomes a rehash of the news. This is clearly signaled by the author's assumption (in these later chapters) that his readers are financial experts. He becomes nearly incomprehensible. My goal in buying this book was to learn something about finance, since I firmly believe in the educational value of history. And I did learn a few things, but not nearly as much as I had hoped.

B000Q66PXE|4.0|Rome The Complete First Two Seasons is an excellent collectible. I almost like all the HBO series as they deliver a strong message. However Rome in particular is more appealing because of the context. I understand some of the contents in the series are not historically correct but they add to the dramatic flavor. The cast and crew is just scintillating. I would strongly recommend for all adults who have an interest in history to try to get this as part of their collection.

0802798225|3.0|Perfect Chemistry is one of those books that I first heard about on Twitter. The buzz was all good so I found myself picking up a copy one day at the bookstore. Then as with so many others it got lost on Mt TBR. Then a few weeks ago there was some chatter among friends on Twitter about Bad Boys - love them, hate them and just what makes a well drawn Bad Boy. There are two main categories of Bad Boy, you've got the creepy stalkerish boy of Twilight and Hush Hush and then there are the ones that do bad things but deep down they have a good heart. It's the later of the two that I prefer and its that later category that Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Fuentes from Perfect Chemistry falls into. I became intrigued with all the Twitter talk about Alex and so decided to move Perfect Chemistry up a few notches on Mt TBR and initially I was really impressed by it.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is life a modern day Romeo and Juliet or maybe West Side Story would be a better comparison. The two main characters are star-crossed lovers who have many obstacles to over come in order to be together - both outside influences and internal ones as well. Brittany initially reads as a bit shallow but as her story progresses you do learn that there is more to her then her perfect exterior. There is also more to Alex than his gang affiliations. Alex is different then the others in his gang he is smart, doesn't really mind school and has a secret dream to go to college. He's realistic and knows that the cards he was dealt won't really allow for that, but if it doesn't happen for him then maybe he can makes things just a little bit better for his two younger brothers. Both who see the gang way of life through rose colored glasses. They know their brother is in one and if its good enough for him then why not them?<br /><br />I thought that the way the relationship progressed between Brittany and Alex was well done and believable and I found that I couldn't stop reading their story. But as the book moved closer to its conclusion its like they became stuck on repeat. Brittany was only happy when Alex did what she wanted and when what she wanted was for him to leave the gang she couldn't understand that it wasn't as easy as say quitting a job. Its around this time that the book started to slip for me. The realism of the beginning started to wan and move into unrealistic territory and the end just became too perfect. Too sacchariny sweet and too much like a fairy tale. By the time I finished the epilogue I had gone from loving the story to merely liking it. I think my end rating may have higher if it wasn't for that epilogue. I had similar issues with the epilogue for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows. Both were unnecessary and both seemed as though they were trying to hard. Perfect Chemistry isn't a bad book and its not a waste of time to read it. I would just strongly suggest that the reader stop reading before the epilogue.<br /><br />As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywhere on 24 Dec 09sion its like they became stuck on repeat.

0517548232|5.0|Hazlitt wrote that \\"the whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single sentence. The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups. Nine-tenths of the economic fallacies that are working such dreadful harm in the world today are the result of ignoring this lesson. Those fallacies all stem from one of two central fallacies, or both: (1) that of looking only at the immediate consequences of an act or proposal, and (2) that of looking at the consequences only for a particular group to the neglect of other groups.\\"<br /><br />Throughout his work, Hazlitt provides tremendous examples for each of the common myths of bad economists and politicians. The beauty of this work is that Hazlitt explains concepts and observations that appear to be complex in such simple terms that even the US Congress could understand, such as:<br /><br />\\"The world is full of so-called economists who in turn are full of schemes for getting something for nothing.  They tell us that the government can spend and spend without taxing at all; that is can continue to pile up debt without ever paying it off because `we owe it to ourselves' [but] ultimately every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation.\\"<br /><br />Other truths that Hazlitt espouses seem to be common sense, unless of course you are an elected official:<br />- \\"Taxation for public housing destroys as many jobs in other lines as it creates in housing.\\"<br />- \\"The government spenders forget that they are taking the money from A in order to pay it to B.\\"<br />- \\"Government lenders will take risks with other people's money (the taxpayers') that private lenders will not take with their own money.\\" (e.g. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac)<br />- (Government lenders) \\"will throw the available capital into bad or at best dubious projects.\\" [e.g. A.I.G. and the Wall Street bailouts]<br />- \\"If the loans we make to foreign countries to enable them to buy our goods are not repaid, then we are giving the goods away. A nation cannot grow rich by giving goods away. It can only make itself poorer,\\" and losses will be paid by increased taxes on everybody.<br /><br />Hazlitt provides a terrific example of economics using initially Robinson Crusoe, then Swiss Family Robinson, and finally modern society concluding that \\"everything, in short, is produced at the expense of forgoing something else.\\" He provides a detailed, yet concise explanation of the supply chain, subsidies, unions, price controls, and wages offering great clarity in this statement: \\"In an exchange economy everybody's money income is somebody else's cost. Every increase in hourly wages, unless or until compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an increase in costs of production.\\"<br /><br />One of the final sections of this book focuses on the dangers of inflation and the theory of the Keynesians, who have contributed so significantly to the current fiscal mess in Washington D.C. \\"The more sophisticated advocates of inflation, in brief, are disingenuous. They do not state their case with complete candor; and they end by deceiving even themselves. They begin to talk of paper money, like the more naive inflationists, as if it were itself a form of wealth that could be created at will on the printing press. They even solemnly discuss a \\"multiplier,\\" by which every dollar printed and spent by the government becomes magically the equivalent of several dollars added to the wealth of the country.\\" Yet the fictitious multiplier doesn't.  It is merely results in a larger debt that must be repaid through heavier taxes.  And continuous injections of new money lower the purchasing power of everyone. Sadly, Hazlitt's observation that government has nothing to give, without first taking it away from someoneelse, has not yet been learned by the American taxpayer.<br /><br />Hazlitt's writing on secondary consequences of fiscal decisions is brilliant and as applicable today as it was when first written.<br /><br />[[ASIN:143274917X Tea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn:  The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government]]Hazlitt's writing on secondary consequences of fiscal decisions is brilliant and as applicable today as it was when first written.

0307346609|5.0|This book blew me away.<br /><br />This \\"oral history\\" of the genesis, spread, and eventual end of the Zombie War is skillfully written as a series of interviews with survivors.  It's a cute premise, and I looked forward to enjoying the book.  I've liked similar premises, like Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising or War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches, which show the unfolding of a huge series of events through small vignettes.<br /><br />This book is far superior.<br /><br />There's plenty of stuff for zombie lovers, but it's never too horribly graphic or disgusting.  It is, however, human.  The characterization of the dozen or more \\"interviewees\\" is done masterfully.  They are real people, who experienced this fundamental shift in the way the world works.<br /><br />And that world does work.  It is completely thought out, with a completely realistic (and therefore somewhat terrifying) propogation of events.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all but the most squeamish of readers.

B002VECLVE|5.0|George Falconer (Colin Firth), a British literature professor living in Los Angeles in 1962, is struggling to find meaning in his life. That's an awfully generic way to start a movie review, and I agree that many movies are about the struggle for meaning in life. But in the case of \\"A Single Man,\\" an adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel, the idea seems neither hackneyed nor overused; we follow George over the course of one day and actually see and respond to his struggle to find meaning. Ever since a car accident took the life of Jim, his lover of sixteen years (Matthew Goode), George has been on a desperate search for some degree of contentment, some sign that he can love again and will be loved in return. He hasn't found it yet. He may never again find it. So why not make use of the gun in the desk drawer?    This film marks the directorial debut of Tom Ford, the fashion designer and former creative director of the Gucci house. It would be brilliant even if it had been his twentieth film. It's a story of astonishing observation and poignancy, where beauty is found not only in the form of a face or the arc of an eyebrow, but also in the cold bleakness of a winter road, where pain and death give way to encounters of surprising tenderness. It's a masterpiece of character development and performance; every one of George's onscreen appearances, for example, is an opportunity for Ford to reveal him to us, which is to say we never see him in an empty or extraneous moment. The dialogue is a perfect blend of insight, contemplation, and wit - one of those rare instances where every word is carefully placed yet strung together as naturally as regular conversation.    George is far from an uptight, prissy cliché, although he does give the appearance of being neat and orderly; always nicely dressed, always articulate, always able to keep his things in their proper place. But within, he's an absolute mess, tormented by grief, loss, regret, and above all, fear - the fearof isolation, of growing old alone and forgotten. He finds some solace with his best friend and former lover, Charlotte, a.k.a. Charley (Julianne Moore), an aging, hard-drinking British beauty who seems determined to wallow in her failures as a wife and mother. She states at one point that, as wonderful as what George and Jim had was, it was probably just a substitute for something real. George asserts, with understandable frustration, that what he and Jim had was very much real and not a substitute for anything.    As the film progresses, a relationship develops between George and one of his students, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), who appears, at first glance, to be nothing more than an infatuated youth. But this would be a tedious movie indeed if their interactions were entirely motivated by sex; there's a definite physical attraction, no question, but ultimately, what they share boils down to the innate desire for meaningful human interaction, which works on a frequency separate from sexual orientation. Kenny, though young, is remarkably insightful and may in fact be the key to George's emotional salvation.    While symbolism is hardly new in the movies, specific images in \\"A Single Man\\" so thoroughly represent the main character's emotional turmoil that they cannot be dismissed as manipulative visual aids. Consider the use of clocks and watches, many ticking in unison with the sound of a beating heart; they tell time, something we're all caught up in and will eventually fall victim to. The second hand continuously moves in jerky motions, as if to reinforce the idea that George's life has been reduced to a countdown.    Also consider the use of color. George's memories of Jim - which pop up randomly, as they tend to do in real life - are vibrant and lush, warm and inviting, evocative of a committed, loving relationship. Compare that to the world George now sees: Faded and gray, cold and lifeless, dull and dreary. There are select moments, however, when the colors visibly amplify, as when he has a conversation with his neighbor's pleasant young daughter while waiting at the bank. As is the case with Kenny, this little girl gives George a much needed dose of social interaction.    In spite of George's orientation, \\"A Single Man\\" is not, as some would call it, a \\"gay\\" movie. Its focus is on humanity, not sexuality, and that makes it accessible, I believe, to all audiences; it reaffirms that within all of us is the need to make contact with other people, sometimes for love, sometimes for a shoulder to cry on, sometimes for nothing more than simple conversation. Of all the films I've seen this year, few have been this relatable, this touching, and even in the absence of big-budget visual effects, this visually creative. Its greatest achievement, perhaps, was the casting of Colin Firth, undeniably convincing as a broken man maintaining a façade of serenity and togetherness. This is one of the year's best films.

B001FB562U|5.0|The Road is a bleak and mournful film, and given this one may ask why seeing such a film is even necessary. I asked myself this very question as I drove home to my family after seeing it. Why bother with a film like this? Why put oneself through such a bleak experience? I concluded that it is well worth seeing and the answer, I think, lies in the emotion and the universal truths that the film explores.<br /><br />Most films we see have a a struggle in them. Almost all of them present at least a challenge to the characters involved. Many of our films today are bleak, but we have become used to the level or bar that was set long ago. We watch films about war, super villains bent on destruction, fantasies about horrible evil destroying good and pleasant people, cop dramas about criminals, mob films about criminals, sci-fi films about man and his destructive nature and on and on and on. We tend to not walk out of the theater thinking we just watched a bleak film because we have become used to a certain norm with established highs and lows. With a film like The Road the normal bottom has been ripped out and we experience the film through a dark cinematic cellar rarely seen in in American films these days. This film reminds me a bit in tone to Russian films like The Return, and Stalker. Now while those films are not exactly feel good films either, they do show us the human condition stripped down. When challenged the hardest we show our humanity the most.<br /><br />The Road speaks partially to me because of it's American sensibilities. We live in such a cluttered society here filled with all the most useless crap and trivial distractions and we often forget the few basics, the core, of who we are as a people. The Road is a metaphorical desert island and the father and son wandering through it have taken with them the last few absolute necessary moral basics that make up who and what we are here in America as a good and basic people. Even that moral core gets muddled in the father as he protects his son through the wasted landscape that has become populated, mostly, by cannibalistic survivors. The father seeks to protect the sons purity and goodness from evil and deliver them somewhere safe. Throughout their southern trek towards a hopeful warmth with no real clear destination the father nearly crosses the line or \\"the road\\" himself to the other side while thinking mostly, narrow-mindedly, only of his son and his purity. The son sees this moral lapse in the father and reminds him to stay on course and not get lost like the bad people have.<br /><br />Do the cannibals represent that aspect of society that often eat society alive today? Do they represent serial killers, mass shooters, child predators, drug dealers, child pornographers, corrupt scammers and tarnished souls that we see every day as the news unfolds? It may sound crazy but the film is most certainly not just about a dad protecting his boy, but rather a film about the very basics of what constitutes good and evil, i.e. the good people and the bad people.<br /><br />The idea of being eaten by another human has become a film genre all its own in the entirely whimsical zombie films of our times. While most may dismiss such zombie films as just another distraction, I suspect that zombie films represent a deep rooted fear of modern society that has nonchalantly bubbled to the surface in our pop culture. Cormac McCarthy explores our fears realistically at their very core. The idea that someday this structured society  we take for granted all around us will collapse, and that the worst elements of ourselves will be forced or driven out of basic necessity for sustenance to cannibalize what is left and eat one another is explored and depicted at it's very root here in The Road. Because it is so bleak, and because it is so frighteningly honest, like a horrible nightmare dredged up from our deeps psyches, we are compelled to not enjoy such a film. Certainly it can not be enjoyed assuch traditional fun distractions in cinema can but at the same time a bleak film such as this is all at once moving, emotional, and points a positive candle through the worst muck that humanity can be. Although rough to watch and not easy to stomach I came out of The Road reminded of the very basics that are important. Not many films do that any more.<br /><br />The Road also explores the soul, the afterlife, God, and the basic question as to whether or not absolute good does truly exist in this universe as a fundamental property, or is it just in fact something we made up like bluejeans, soda pop and nail polish. I came away from The Road being reminded that in fact, yes, those fundamental things such as he soul, the afterlife, and God do all exist. They make up our core as a people whether we all believe in them or not and they must be recognized by those who care to see them. We must be reminded of them even if we do not entirely understand them. It's similar to complex math, the language of the universe. Humans discovered it, we all know it exists, although many of us do not entirely understand it, we are still aware of its importance and understand what it has given us as a species. Concepts like God, the soul, and good and evil are certainly not tangible nor quantifiable in any traditional sense but The Road seeks to do so anyway and succeeds admirably I think.tions in cinema can but at the same time a bleak film such as this is all at once moving, emotional, and points a positive candle through the worst muck that humanity can be.

1416972242|2.0|Is what you'll want to say if you were expecting a well written urban fantasy. Busy teen readers deserve quality reads instead of a book this poorly slapped together. I struggled through this volume only because I purchased the boxed set. Book 2 notches up the pace a bit over the first installment and it's shorter length is an improvement that earned it the 2nd star.<br /><br />The whole shadowhunter concept is still so thinly fleshed out that when Clary and Jace begin to manifest new powers the reader is left wondering if this is finally an attempt at world building or a plot twist. Magic is tossed in willy nilly whenever cliched drama needs an explanation. In one scene Clary is talking to Simon on her phone when he hears someone smashing in his door. She rushes over to his house a page later and calmly unlocks the door that has just been smashed in. We're told it must be magic. Shadowhunter magic? Demon magic? Bewitched reruns?<br /><br />A large portion of this book takes place on a ship. However no attempt seems to have been made to research ships. The term is used interchangeably with boat, and terms for parts of the ship such as bulkheads and ladders don't appear until the last hundred pages.(Finally get around to using the library?)<br /><br />The action scenes are exciting mainly because Ms Clare seems completely unable to visualize them. Two men are backed into a niche fighting the demons in front of them. One of the demons spits poison at them. Does the poison hit the bulkhead behind them when they duck? NO! This is boomerang spit I guess because it goes right over the top of their heads and hits another demon! Amazing.<br /><br />Isabelle climbs over the rail to leave the ship just before Alex slips in the gore on the deck and slides over the EDGE of the ship. To get over the rail of a ship you either have to climb or be helped which is why when a sailor goes missing on a calm day in the middle of a harbour authorities tend to get a tad excited. Maybe this is Alex manifesting a new edge sliding magic ability?<br /><br />Clary is knocked to her feet by water pouring through a hole in the ship. A few paragraphs later she is sucked OUT of the ship through the hole with water pouring IN it. Is it possible this author is the only person left in the world who has NOT seen a movie about the Titantic?<br /><br />I could go on but you get the idea. If you're already a reader of quality fantasy don't waste your money. Click some Amazon links and you're bound to find something better. If you're already a fanbois or fangurl of the series, enjoy, then find a teacher or friend to recommend a really great title. Good books are out there.

1572816112|5.0|I love this deck! I really like quirky decks, but they have to talk to me. I have to look at a card and knew exactly what it is (without looking at number or name on card) and see the message right away. Very few decks really grab me like that, but this one did. It took a while to finally get my hands on it, but I'm glad I did. One of my favorite decks so far!
B001ADPMQS|2.0|The first half of the movie is charming enough, and great eye candy -- a real showcase for the set decorators, costume designers and prop makers. But by the time Santa reaches the 20th century, all the charm is lost. The movie doesn't seem to go anywhere, and Lithgow is just WAY over the top.  Too many segmented plotlines clutter up the story, although the film does have one of the greatest Santa and Mrs. Claus combos I've ever seen!<br /><br />Also, although it says it is close captioned, it is not subtitled, so most people won't be able to get \\"the words\\" if they have a high-def or blu-ray player.

B000063UR2|5.0|The movie is great, and all the other reviews will expound on it.  Let me just warn you though, this movie had about 9 different versions made and released, and not all are still available.  In general, the US version is an affirming love story with some very obviously traditional values, etc.  The European version is more of an ambiguos, life-is-more-gray-than-black-and-white, kind of movie (I actually prefer it more, makes it more interesting).  But even within those there's the theatrical versus home versus director cuts... which are all different.<br /><br />Now, you may not think it makes a difference, but subtle changes and the inlcusion/exclusion of one or two scenes can change this entire story ALOT.<br /><br />Ironically, I've purchased this movie like 8 different times (from different sources) and gotten 5 different versions, but there's a scene that I saw on a tv airing of it 10 years ago, that isn't on ANY of the copies I have (I have it on tape just to prove I'm not losing my mind).<br /><br />Anyways, point is, it's a great movie no matter what version you get, but if you're looking for a particular copy, be careful what you buy.

B001ILHY1I|5.0|Director Paul W. S. Anderson's Death Race (2008), is a brutal, over the top, balls to the wall, action thriller, that satisfies both the need for speed, and an appetite for destruction.  Reality is not a serious consideration in this futuristic fantasy set in the year 2012, where condemned prison inmates participate in the Death Race, a contest where the competition is so fierce, that drivers statistics include both wins, and kills.  Risking death for possible freedom, before a pay-per-view audience, the Death Race is the latest deadly evolution in reality entertainment.<br /><br />An extremely ripped Jason Statham (Crank, The Transporter), is Jensen Ames, a husband and father, who because of his experience driving race cars, is framed for the murder of his wife.  Sentenced to Terminal Island penitentiary where the Death Race is held, Ames is offered an opportunity by the hardass Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen).  Frankenstein, an extremely popular driver, has just died from injuries sustained in a crash.  Maintaining the illusion that `Frank' is still alive, would be very profitable, and also possible, since Frank wore a mask, and can't be identified.  Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson), the driver who sent Frank's car spinning down the track in flames, is eager to resume their rivalry.  With racing his only chance of reuniting with his baby daughter, Ames agrees to drive.  Headed by Coach (Ian McShane, Jesus of Nazareth), Ames's pit crew is in on the deception.  The final member of the racing team, is an inmate from a women's prison, Elizabeth Case (Natalie Martinez), the course navigator.<br /><br />The film's drive to survive premise, is straightforward and without many added frills.  The Warden concerned only with profits, arranges for the murder of Ames' wife, just to get him into Terminal Island.  The killer is Pachenko (Max Ryan, The Foreigner), a vicious convict, who is also a driver.  He and Ames have a spectacularly brutal battle, but are forced to settle matters on the race course.  Ryan shines, as the mangy guy you love to hate.<br /><br />The race consists of three stages.  With weaponized cars, and wicked hazards integrated into the course, each stage is more exciting and dangerous than the last.  Cars are destroyed, and drivers perish in the carnage, with no one shedding a tear.  Only the winners matter.  It is hard to get bored by the various racing sequences, as the action is extremely well staged, and realistic looking, with new stunts and hazards featured in each race, the results are breathtakingly awesome.<br /><br />No one seems to notice that Ames is never around during a race, except perhaps Machine Gun Joe, who was guessed that his hated rival Frankenstein, has been replaced by Ames.  With the two drivers set to compete in the final race, is any cooperation possible?  With Frank on the verge of winning his freedom, The Warden is prepared to blow him sky high, but an unexpected detour ruins her plans.<br /><br />Death Race is a gripping, high speed adrenaline rush, that is at the top of the fantasy action genre.  The realistic approach to action taken by the filmmakers, and the grungy, gritty industrial setting, creates a stark, tense, atmosphere for the contest.  Much of the backstory regarding the film is discussed by Paul Anderson, and producer Jeremy Bolt in their commentary track.  Bringing their experience from doing films based on the Resident Evil video games, the ultra-violent, breakneck speed, action scenes in Death Race display a video game quality.  Also covered is the role that Roger Corman played in the careers of the two men, and the making of this film, which is inspired by Corman's 1975 film, Death Race 2000.  Corman also serves as executive producer for this film.  There's more to look forward to as a sequel, Death Race: Frankenstein Lives, has been announced for sometime in 2011.course.

Death Race is a gripping, high speed adrenaline rush, that is at the top of the fantasy action genre.  The realistic approach to action taken by the filmmakers, and the grungy, gritty industrial setting, creates a stark, tense, atmosphere for the contest.  Much of the backstory regarding the film is discussed by Paul Anderson, and producer Jeremy Bolt in their commentary track.  Bringing their experience from doing films based on the Resident Evil video games, the ultra-violent, breakneck speed, action scenes in Death Race display a video game quality.  Also covered is the role that Roger Corman played in the careers of the two men, and the making of this film, which is inspired by Corman's 1975 film, Death Race 2000.  Corman also serves as executive producer for this film.  There's more to look forward to as a sequel, Death Race: Frankenstein Lives, has been announced for sometime in 2011.

This work, much like From Hell, presents another great satirization of Victorian culture. There are also a bunch of goodies in the back of this volume, not to be missed.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I didn't think the Star Trek franchise had anything left, but I was wrong. This ranks up there with my all time favorites: The Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home. This was my first Blu-ray purchase. Not a bad way to start. The sound and picture quality live up to the hype.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I own every recording The Beatles ever released. They are without doubt the greatest and most influential recording artists in the history of recorded music.     I love the Stereo and Mono box sets -- I bought two of each, but especially the Mono set and its attention to packaging detail. It's great to hear the version of the song Help that I grew up with and the energy now comes through on the entire With The Beatles disk. Also, you don't have to hear the vocal flubs that appear on the Stereo versions on Please, Please Me and If I Fell, or Paul getting winded when singing I've Just Seen a Face.    I hope that at some point in time, for the benefit of future generations, the CD's are released with the Stereo and Mono versions on the same disk. Since most people will buy the Stereo versions, it would be a shame if the versions with the vocal errors become the standard versions. It just makes The Beatles and George Martin come across as sloppy which they were not -- at least not with the definitive mono versions.      The only complaint I have is likely something that can't be helped. The track Michelle on Rubber Soul does not seem to be as clean sounding as the other tracks. I would stop short of calling it distortion, but it makes me wonder if the master tape has some slight damage to it. No one else that I know of has mentioned this. If others have noticed, please let me know.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This was a great movie.  loved it.  My son had told me it wouldn't be what i was expecting - a cutesy movie.  It actually had a lot of substance!  The little old man was adorable - even if he pissed you off at times!  Great flick!!!
6305511055|4.0|Recently watched this film again, decades after its release...and was quite pleased. Its interesting to compare this movie's mystery, action and suspense to present day thrillers! Blue work shirts and jeans---simple and sexy, worn very well by Redford, the cars, bikes, computers---fashion and background are nostalgic and fun! Redford's haircut is still better than John Edwards and I don't believe he paid the equivalent of $400--the Male Farrah Fawcett with his blond, feathered locks. Aside from sentiment and looks, the movie definitely shines, and you are rooting for the hero throughout. Quite enjoyable to realize that OIL, politics and power were entangled and continue to be; often the driving force behind present day suspense....

B001N26GFC|2.0|This movie receives all kinds of analytical accolades about Poppy (main character) and her relentless optimism, but truth be told, i wanted to kill her in the first 10 minutes. It was unnaturally gloomy watching this movie, so i could not even finish it...there are much more uplifting stories out there. Credit for the reality in cinematography....characters not glamorized, background very realistic...in fact, it seemed much more like a documentary.
B000002L9Y|4.0|I have only recently been introduced to Fleetwood Mac, and, so far, have only listened to this album and the exceptional 'rumours' album 10 years previous to this. This is a completely different album, more of an '80s style, and I feel that the three songwriters of the group could easily have written their songs for respective solo albums. My opinions on the songs has little bias, as I know nothing about the writers Buckingham, McVie and Nicks.     Buckingham contributes my favourite track to the album. From reading other reviews, my opinion is contentious, but I don't care. 'Family Man' has a catchy melody and I love the flamenco like guitar refrains. It is silly in a really joyful way and the track really uplifts me. His other contributions vary. 'Tango in the night' is a clever little ditty, with atmospheric verses and a fantastic chorus with really powerful guitar power chords. 'Caroline' didn't appeal to me at first, but I can't seem to get the chorus out of my head. Great melody line on the chorus.  'Big Love' I just don't like. I know I'm in a minority, but I just can't enjoy the stocatto sections and the melody and lyrics seem trite to me.    McVie seems to have that silken voice I really like and her voice is really suited to the ballads she sings here. I knew 'Everywhere' before the album of course, and I love the twinkly ambience produced. This is a beautiful track. 'Little lies' is more of a group effort with lots of harmony vocals from the group and I love the melody, it is timeless. 'Isn't it midnight' is more rocky, but only a bit, it is still dominated by McVie's melodic voice and has a great melody.    Buckingham and McVie also collaborate on songs and the results are always winners. 'You and I Part 2' (where is part 1, a b-side or previous album maybe??) is such a sweet song. It, like 'family man' has a simple feel good factor and Buckingham sings with great joviality. What a great tune. 'Mystified' is another ballad in McVie's style and she singsit beautifully. I love the harmony vocals on the title. I have to say the lyrics make me gag, too 'pretty darling' for me.     So that leaves Nicks's contributions. And they are diabolical. I am sure she was talented, and had a nice voice, as I enjoyed 'Dreams' which I think is her singing (?) Her voice sounds like it was ripped apart and shredded, then stuffed back into her throat. I understand from what I read, that she was in rehab, and therefore only wrote two songs for the album (and sings a third), well, with respect, I think she shouldn't have bothered, as she ruins an otherwise near perfect album. The chord progressions and backing tracks in 'Seven Wonders' and 'Welcome to the room...Sara' are appealing, but as soon as her voice comes in, it completely destroys the songs.  I left the song 'When I see you again' until last. Oh my Word. This really is the worst thing I have heard in ages. McVie should have sung it, and it may have been half decent. When Nicks starts singing over the acoustic arrangement, her voice is so exposed and it is foul. But when we get to the chorus and her repetition of 'what's the matter baby', it is so bad it just makes me wonder why they put this on the album, as it is so blatantly bad. I always have a good laugh towards the end of the track (if I ever get that far), when she seems to stop singing for no good reason and the repetitious guitar carries on and Buckingham finishes the song. I think she probably just walked off!   Most people who defend Nicks here are probably doing so out of loyalty to the band or because they are so familiar with the songs.     A lovely album with very catchy songs, marred by Nicks's songs, Best track: Family Man.  Worst Tracks: Nicks
B0000E1C73|5.0|I have to admit, Ska-P is one of my favorite bands of all times. This is a recollection of recordings done during a concert tour by the band in 2005, if I am not mistaken. The DVD is great, really fun to see their performances, as their spectacle is not only musical but also, somewhat theatrical. Although all the songs in this disc may be found on some of their studio CDs, I still think it is a great acquisition!
0385532458|3.0|This book did not really do a whole lot for me. He has certaiinly written better books.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I must admit that I'M NOT a pop music fan at all. Madonna, Nelly Furtado and Alicia Keys maybe have always been the only singers that I always buy their albums from. Why Madonna? I think that's pretty obvious. A woman with a career like hers doesn't need any explanations. Why Nelly Furtado? I have always said that she has this incredible talent beyond all the Timbaland and pop features a la MTV crap (listen to \\"Folklore\\" her second album and you'll see what I mean). Why Alicia Keys? She's this great singer with an AMAZING voice and it's so easy to tell that (in the opposite of many of her mates in the business... no names will be said) she sings from the bottom of her heart.<br /><br />With this said, let's move with Miss Lady Gaga. When I first met her I said, \\"Great! another Spears bad clone!\\". But then, in time after listening to her smash hits over and over again on radio and TV \\"Poker face\\" (my least favorite on \\"the fame\\" album), \\"Just dance\\" and \\"Paparazzi\\" (my favorites by far on the album) I realized that there was something different about her. She's clever enough to come up with all this weird wardrobe on her videos in order to mix the bizarre side of hers with the music she makes (a fact that I'm not buying to call her music \\"intelligent pop\\" yet... she still has a lot to prove). But, in spite these things, her music itself it's catchy, it's fun and, most of all, it's well structured. \\"The Fame Monster\\" ep is an album that if it had been released back in the early 90's it would've been a huge smash hit. Her influence from that decade it's more than obvious in the single \\"Bad romance\\" (an awesome song from any perspective you see it). On the other hand songs like \\"Alejandro\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"Dance in the dark\\" are meant to be singles like the first one I just mentioned. Then, the last ones like \\"Speecheless\\", and \\"Teeth\\" could be an experiment from Gaga in order to explore other lands that are not easy to attach with the fans' preferences. \\"Telephone\\" is not exactly a song I would listen a lot. The collaboration with Beyonce is kind of annoying for me because all this thing has become more like a cliche in music business, specially in pop music.<br /><br />Lady Gaga knows how to play her cards and she's talented in what she does. If she keeps on going like this, I'm sure she'll become the new Madonna just because she's willing to experiment and create something more than catchy tunes. I have NEVER cared about singers like Britney Spears (an AWFUL singer with a LOT of luck in her mediocre career) nor Christina Aguilera (eventhough her voice is great and her album \\"Back to basics\\" was awesome). So, with this said and the way I see it there are just two ways for Lady Gaga: if she follows Spears's steps in everything she has done (not Aguliera, she's much more intelligent than Britney) and if she lets the fame and pop business eat her up I'm ready to turn my back on her any day now or to admire her work for years to come like I do with Madonna. It's up to her.xactly a song I would listen a lot. The collaboration with Beyonce is kind of annoying for me because all this thing has become more like a cliche in music business, specially in pop music.

It's up to her.

These guys not only rock, but they have more accomplished musical skills on ALL levels, from vocal harmonies, to extremely difficult individual vocals, plus a complete range of instrumental accomplishments than most groups today or even the classic groups of yesteryear.  No wonder their popularity is ageless.

B0027BOL4G|2.0|This film was extremely disappointing.  I was hoping for a clear, riveting summary of the environmental and health problems created because of the food industry in this country.  I wanted an exposition of the inhumane techniques used to raise animals, the government policies and subsidies that contribute to the system, and the alternatives.  The filmmaker touched on these points, but I didn't feel they were clearly made (read Michael Pollen's The Omnivore's Dilemma instead).  Many of the people interviewed in the film are inarticulate and hence boring to listen to, and the pacing is very slow. If I wasn't already a \\"true believer,\\" this film would not have convinced me of the problem.

B002OFWG7O|5.0|This is a must have for any rock head. Foo Fighters have sure made their way into one of the greatest bands in these past 15 years. The DVD has all their videoclips, it's good to put on tv and hav eit on all morning like a FF special.  The cd has a pretty good selection of their best songs and comes with 3 new songs. Wheels has a new way in it, kind of like Tom Petty, it's a good song, softer than the usual rockier stuff they write, but worth listening to.

6305327084|5.0|Well this is the first review that I have ever written, so my grammar and punctuation are really lacking, my college days are far behind me. I have been watching movies for over 50 years(like a few other reviewers), and I felt I had to say something about this movie. How I missed this movie over the years, I do not know, but it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.I had caught the movie (Leon-The Professional) on television, and wondered who that little girl was that played such a fantastic part in what I thought was to be just a action flick. I did some research on the net and found out who she was, and ran across her name cast in Beautiful Girls, so I purchased the DVD just to see what part she played in it. Man how lucky I was to find such a goldmine! Definitely a collectible to be watched many times. I was able to relate to all of the characters in the movie one way or the other, and it brought back so many memories of my twenties life. Natalie Portman (Marty) and Timothy Hutton (Willie), knocked my socks off. I have had a couple of encounters of the same kind in my lifetime,and it is like two people have the same heart and soul, but the age and timing were always wrong. It left me wondering sometimes if I had been born at the wrong time in life. The way their scenes were portrayed was amazing. At first the scenes seemed too fast, and it was hard to understand every word. I had a hard time with the New England accent, being a southern boy, so I put on the closed caption, and played it in slow motion. Marty kinda started it off with her lines, \\"I'm 13, but I have an old soul\\",and \\"my name is the bane of my existence\\".She told Willie he was a \\"you're a dude in flux\\".Her intellect,personality, and perception were way beyond her age,plus she was a (beautiful girl). The scene with Marty and Willie at the ice pond was the best for me,when Marty wanted Willie to be her boyfriend, with lines like \\"but if your feelings for me are true, you will wait\\",\\"Yep,wait 5 years for me I'll be 18\\",and \\"we can walk through this world together\\". Awesome! Then Willies denial with the Winnie the Pooh, and Christopher Robinson, comparison was great. Their gestures and eye contact were realistic, heart moving, and sad, in all their scenes. I do not know if Willie really denied Marty completely or not. At the end of the movie he drove off with his girlfriend, still staring at Marty in his rear view mirror. Plus Andera(Uma Thurman), threw him a curve in the ice fishing hut. Surely wish there had been some kind of sequel, this is a movie that you did not want to end.  All of the characters played excellent parts, and would recommend for all above (R) rating age. A tremendous movie about real people, in the real world. Kudos! to all. I am sorry I missed the rest of Natalie's growing up, she has already graduated from Harvard. Well Done Nat! Okay, enough said.....Enjoy this Movie!
B00000253O|1.0|I've never received a poor-quality tape from Amazon before, but there's always a first time and this was it.  It's worse than my old tape. It's nothing I can listen to. Sounds like it's being played on a noisy old ferris wheel going up and down!  Thanks for asking!
B002VPE1AM|4.0|Was \\"Avatar\\" a three or a four star movie?  Dang tough choice, because this show has the best eye candy I've ever seen.  Spectacular 3-D effects, battle sequences, colors and shapes all fill the screen.  At the same time it's pure Hollywood formula and cliche.  Other reviewers have remarked on its similarities to \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" and we can mention the recently released \\"Battle for Terra\\" which has a similar theme.    That theme consists of a technologically superior western (or human) civilization, spearheaded by shoot-first militarists, come to exploit a primitive people who are naturally in touch with Gaia/Mother Earth/The Great Spirit/What Have You.  In \\"Avatar\\" Jake Sully is the crippled Marine who works with a science team as an avatarist studying Pandora's aboriginal tribes.  He, along with a few others, control huge bodies which resemble the natives.  He's also recruited by the military to ferret out the native tribe's weaknesses and possible negotiating points.  Behind the military is, of course, the obligatory heartless businessman there to exploit whatever resources are in demand at any cost.    Accidentally separated from his group, Sully is first spared his life by the princess of the local tribe (the Na'vi) when a seed of the Holy Tree settles on her arrow.  She later saves his life from a pack of hairless jackals-on-steroids and is eventually adopted into her village.  Like the Kevin Costner character in \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" Sully goes native.    Some might consider bits of the following to be spoilers, but if you know anything of typical Hollywood plots none of this will come as a surprise or twist.  Sully sails through his rites of passage while balancing his double agent act with the science team and the military.  He and the princess fall in love and mate, then there's the obligatory crisis where he falls out with the princess and her tribe when the humans gather to attack the Great Tree where they live.  But he later does something only thegreat Na'vi legends speak of, regains his prestige in the tribe and the love of his mate, and leads the counterattack against the humans.    The tribe has only bows and arrows and flying reptilian beasts to use against the modern technological juggernaut the humans have.  Yet it, apparently with help from the tribal deity Eywa, prevails.  It's an exciting war to watch with James Cameron's superb special effects, but entirely unbelievable that the tribe could overcome such firepower.  Every possible movie cliche is dragged out, including a final mano a mano combat between Sully's avatar and the military commander.  You can probably guess how that turned out.    Rating this movie depends on what you want to emphasize.  It has an entirely unoriginal, totally derivative plot revolving around hoary cliches and several one-dimensional characters.  There're the mumbo-jumbo earthy (in this case Pandoran) connections to nature contrasted with advanced civilization's cold technology.  But it was great fun to watch, entertaining as all get-out, and has the usual satisfying ending.  Catch this movie in the theater if you can.  No home screen can do \\"Avatar\\" visual justice.

0740785508|5.0|As an artist it us a struggle sometimes to paint exactly what I want from the image in my head. This book points out many many things that completly help in areas of realism for fictional images. Granted I'm not quite so into dinosaurs, but they are more about teqniques and examples (since the are no dinosaurs to draw from realistically) this book is pretty wonderful. I knew from just the title and description what I expected and boy did it deliver! Great book, great images, examples and technique.

B002SJIO5E|2.0|(since Im getting so many negative votes, I thought I'd rewrite this review for clarity)<br /><br />If you watch the making of District 9, the writer and director talk about how District 9 began when the production unit that was to make Peter Jackson's aborted 'HALO' movie were put to task by Jackson to come up with an original concept.  A film taking place in the nearby slums of Johannesburg would allow a lower budget film to have some really high end visuals, since there would be little to no costs associated with set creation or transporting the crew to a far off location.<br /><br />This is something that on the surface gives District 9 an exotic appeal to a western audience. The slums you see in District 9 are REAL, though you won't see real poor people in them, just CGI aliens.<br /><br />Using aliens as a prop to explore concepts of segregation and racism is hardly new in Science fiction.  Movies like the 1968 Planet of the Apes, the Outer Limits episode 'the Zanti Misfits', the Star Trek episode 'Let that be your last battlefield'... Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\", the Fuzzy books by H. Beam Piper... the books of Octavia Butler.  There are countless examples.  Science Fiction at it's best is a literature and cinema of social commentary.<br /><br />Rod Serling, creator of the Twilight Zone, once said that if he wrote a story about a black man being framed for the murder of a white woman, the TV censors would hand him his hat, but if he set the story in the future and made the black man a robot, they were fine with it.<br /><br />In response to Serling's comment, one could ask what a robot has to do with a black man.  The same could be said for the alien 'Prawns' who inhabit the fictional, yet very real slum of District 9.  When you 'explore' a concept, do you take any responsibility for the people that you generalize, or marginalize?<br /><br />The making of documentary explains that District 9's creation did not involve a story, but rather a sequence of short vignettes and ideas that were taken from a larger group of concepts.  This viewer found the film very much felt like this.  Random.  And I don't have a problem with the technical execution of the material, it's very well done.  It LOOKS very real.  The high definition is outstanding, one of the best blu rays Ive seen.<br /><br />To get at what doesn't work, and why I find this film more exploitive than enlightening, I need to get into the plot.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />Wikus van de Merwe is an employee of the MNU, a Multi National Arms and policy dealing organization.  He is portrayed as being dim-witted and apathetic towards the plight of the Prawns.  20 years earlier, the Prawns arrive in a stalled space ship, where presumably some virus has killed off their leadership caste, leaving only the workers, who are portrayed as being neither bright or outgoing, except in their hunger for rubber tires and cat food.<br />During a collection of legal signatures pending a illegal eviction of the Prawns from District 9 to a newer, more concentration-camp-like facility, Wikus seizes and is accidentally exposed to a vial of concentrated alien fuel compound, collected by one lone rogue Prawn scientist, Christopher Johnson, and his son.<br />Slowly Wikus begins to transform (ala the 1986 'the Fly', complete with a rehash of the fingernail removal gimmick) into a Prawn.  He soon becomes a valuable commodity to MNU, because he can now fire the alien weaponry, some possesed by the MNU, some scattered throughout the slums, which most of the Prawns have traded away to a Nigerian warlord for cat food. Humans can not fire the alien weapons because their DNA is not compatible.  Until now.<br />Wikus escapes his captors, forms an uneasy alliance with Christopher Johnson, who reveals that the fuel compound will power up the command module of the abandoned mothership, and that alien medicine will allow Wikus to be cured...<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the story, butthe main focus is the weaponry. You're supposed to be frightened by the idea of people getting their hands on it, yet you end up cheering everytime Wikus messily explodes a bad guy with the lightning gun, because it's a cool cracked out Monty Python effect.  You root for Christopher Johnson to escape with his son, even though he leaves behind all his people, saying he won't return for 3 years.<br /><br />As a black comedy, District 9 might well succeed, but it doesn't try to be one.  It seems to be more concerned with being 'hip' and not trying to fit itself into any genre.<br /><br />Which is probably a good idea, since the film has no point about racism, other than showing the cut & dried bits of ugly violence you expect from any film that says it 'explores concepts of racism'.  But this isn't a film about Dachau, or the Japanese internment camps.  It's not about real racism, it's about fantasy racism.  It's about people who are willing to kill eachother over guns, and it's about Wikus van de Merwe, a man who you pity more than you like, and an inscutable alien who's motives are never made clear.<br /><br />But while District 9 looks cool, and has cool weaponry, and titillates us with fantastic violent images, it exists as a facade over an all too real place that does not get a chance to speak.<br /><br />There are REAL people in District 9. They are not insects and they don't have a spaceship. They are living in cardboard boxes, they're hungry and tired of a government that doesn't listen.  And they are arming themselves.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is an excellent compilation of the complete Rome television series.  Well organized.  Very well done.
B00003CXC7|1.0|The image on this disc was cropped on the bottom, to convert the original 1.66 shape to the 1.78 shape of modern screens.    The still image from this movie that I see most often shows Grace Kelly facing the camera and reclining on the daybed in the foreground, with Stewart upstage in the wheelchair. On this disc, the portion of her figure closest to the lower edge of the image is cropped away. You can see that shot 71 minutes into the movie.    To me it seems that about every other shot in the movie is badly composed, and that's because the image was cropped along the bottom. For instance, Thelma Ritter's hands keep dropping below the lower edge of the screen while she's making the bed. Once you become conscious of this, it really spoils the movie.    Is mutilating old movies to fit modern 16:9 screens just a fad? Will there come a time when we can get genuine (not mutilated) copies of these terrific movies?    I really wish everyone who notices this on any movie would give the movie the lowest possible rating in online reviews. The people who make the DVDs might stop cropping movies this way if enough people complain loudly. Public cmplaint successfully brought about a re-release of the first season of Route 66, after the first release was cropped on top and bottom.    Come on, gang! Tell them we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more!
B0016BWACI|5.0|Wow!  Cannot say enough good things about this BD transfer.  Great movie, outstanding voicing and the PQ and AQ are as good as it's going to get.  Movie appears to start out a bit soft and subdued, but after the first 15-20 minutes or so, the picture seems to get sharper and brighter.  A pleasure to watch for adults and children alike.

B002BWQ6H6|5.0|interesting design of a heartfelt story covering several locales, different classes and emotional highs and lows.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|I've always loved this album, even more so than Sgt. Pepper.  I used to have this on 8 track tape when I was a kid, and listened to it constantly.  I'm glad they did the American album version so we got some extra songs like \\"All You Need is Love\\", \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\", etc.  Not a bad remaster, but when you listen to it with head phones, the back and forth between the right and left phone gets a teeny bit annoying (but all the remasters have that).  I can live with it.  I do like being able to hear the bass better and other sounds I never picked up on before.
0321544080|5.0|I love this book. It's stuffed with practical information and lots of fascinating and funny stories about the author's encounters with the famous and the infamous as he struggles to get just the right shot. This book should be required reading for aspiring photojournalists. You can also get this book online at the Safari database, check your local library for information.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This is the first of Dylan albums I heard. I had come home from college for Thanksgiving vacation. A friend had suggested I listen to this, and I then couldn't stop playing it. The hypnotic voice (yes, I liked the voice), the tumbling lyrics that seemed to project the thoughts in my head, the rallying cry of my peers--all were there. I can still recite the lyrics to these songs. They were, and remain, powerfully resonant.<br /><br />Dylan's venture into explicit political songwriting was brief, but this is a great introduction not only to that but in a wider sense to his incredible talent with language. The images on \\"The Ballad of Hollis Brown\\" are incredible. The story of Hattie Carroll, though not historically accurate, is moving. And \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" added a phrase to our language and provided itself as a rallying cry for the young. I think that rallying cry is for the young of all generations.<br /><br />--Lawrence J. Epstein, author of [[ASIN:0786448628 Political Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan]]
B002K0WBYG|5.0|This move is great!  I first rented this movie and thought this movie was so funny that I had to buy it in Blu-ray!  This is a really funny movie!  People might call this a chick flick, but it's not really!  Chick Flicks ALWAYS suck!  But this movie is very different because it is for guys and girls, that's what the producers' intent was.  It's a movie that both guys and girls would like!  I've unfortunately watched quite a few chick flicks and they all sucked, but yet I love this movie!  I would recommend this movie to anybody! It will give you a good laugh!
B00026WU9Q|5.0|This is the first of a trilogy of albums that rank as perhaps the finest trio of albums ever produced. From the first notes of \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" it is clear that we are in a strange land of language that has a raucous rock `n' roll soundtrack. It is the birth cry of folk rock.<br /><br />It's impossible to resist trying to interpret the lyrics, even though Dylan meant us to experience them first, to let them overwhelm us. Still, the language is clear but the meaning always seems just beyond your logical reach but well within our emotional grasp.<br /><br />The acoustic second side is wall-to-wall incredible stuff. The fact that they were written  over forty years ago and that they sound fresh and exciting today is a tribute to Dylan's enormous talent. It is also a clear sign that his work will endure because it wasn't aimed for and didn't speak for just the moment.<br /><br />\\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\" is a sad song of separation, perhaps from a friend or lover or the protest movement. It was a clear signal that Bob Dylan would not be confined by anyone. In many ways, this album is a complete declaration of independence from the folk movement. Though he had made the break on his previous album, \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan,\\" this time the break was made through the music as well. And the words not only declared his freedom but illustrated for all of us the importance of personal freedom.<br /><br />--Lawrence J. Epstein, author of [[ASIN:0786448628 Political Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan]]
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This move arrived in new condition. It was an excellent movie. At the very beginning of the movie you wonder how I can like the Clint Eastwood character because he seems so old and grouchy, but then you learn why he seems grouchy and you come to like him. The girl that plays Clint Eastwoods daughter is funny, charming and sarcastic and very lovable. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This is Martin Scorsese's magisterial account of Dylan's early years. It includes extensive selections of previously unseen interviews with Dylan. Izzy Young is a real standout, though at least one of his pungent comments was cut from the film. Allen Ginsberg is characteristically perceptive.<br /><br />Some of the Newport footage has been superseded by the release of \\"The Other Side of the Mirror,\\" but there is a lot of exciting concert material here. Scorsese's real triumph is in the editing. He makes the story exciting and moving. There is a mass of material to work with, so that kind of achievement is extraordinarily difficult. Using Dylan's tour of England as a framing device, the film is a drama of the rise and emotional collapse of a great artist. The film, that is, is more than a document. It is a moving human drama.<br /><br />--Lawrence J. Epstein, author of [[ASIN:0786448628 Political Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan]]
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This DVD was a Christmas gift for my Grand-son.  When he opened it, he was ecstatic!!!  If he is happy getting it, so am I.  The prices was great, very quick delivery!  Love Amazon!!
B00026WU7I|5.0|No one who listens to this album remains unmoved by the pain in the songs. This is Dylan's divorce album, but its anger, as in \\"Idiot Wind\\" generously goes to both partners. Historically, the album was important because many fans had thought he had lost his magic touch after his famous 1966 motorcycle accident. This album showed they needn't have had such a concern.<br /><br />It's not so much that this is an enjoyable album. The anger and hurt and despair are too palpable for that. But it provides an incredible artist showing how to take all those emotions and create an art that allows people to survive such experiences.<br /><br />Many people call this a break-up album, one they listen to as their own relationships crumble. It is that. But its an album about dealing with any pain or any hurt.<br /><br />Dylan does what great artists do. He takes life at its rawest, feels it at its deepest, finds words to describe what the rest of us can only sense, and in doing all that provides a way for his listeners to cope.<br /><br />--Lawrence J. Epstein, author of [[ASIN:0786448628 Political Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan]]

B00026WU82|5.0|This album is Dylan at his most despairing, at the bottom of a pit of confusion. The album has some of the greatest images ever put in songs. This album is about Dylan the poet. The lyrics beg to be interpreted and then run away from any single view of what they mean. Some people think they just convey an emotion and that is enough. For those who like to try to understand Dylan's lines, this album is the exemplification of his most inspired efforts.<br /><br />Just \\"Desolation Row\\" alone would make a songwriter's reputation. It's an incredible way to end an album, filled as it is with hopelessness. And yet Desolation Row also seems to be the best place to understand the world.<br /><br />Of course, the album begins with \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" with its insistent beat, its lyrics almost spit out, its raw emotion. The song rattles listeners with its mockery of its subject, whoever that might be.<br /><br />The album is an absolute must for anyone who wants to be literate about rock music history.<br /><br />--Lawrence J. Epstein, author of [[ASIN:0786448628 Political Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan]]
1416534784|5.0|This story has become an icon for Christmas.  The story is well known, but I realized sitting in the new movie with Jim Carrie, I had never read the story itself.  How could I judge a movie or play without knowing the written original?  There is no way a true critique of a movie or play could be done without having a passing knowledge of the original, especially, since the orginal was presented as a written story.   The new movie does follow the written word closely.  The plays do not, but they try and do a good job of getting the jist of the story.   As for the story, I find it a bit to goody, goody.  Scrooge would not turn his life around so thoroughly from such a night of dreams.  He is who he is and has been for a very long time.  'Old habits die hard'  is not just an old saying.  Scrooge has been thinking his frugal thoughts for most of his life and I just do not think he would be able to change so radically so fast.  Another problem is Tiny Tim.  He may be lovable, but what would move Scrooge to feel so sorry for him?  He sees him for only a moment, would it be enough in reality?   These questions are irrelevant, but I had them, so I thought I would voice them.
B00026WU64|5.0|Dylan's second album, the one that first made him famous, is filled with great songs, from the deceptively simple \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" to his first experiment at using poetry in his lyrics, \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.\\" There are some throwaway songs. Dylan's songwriting brilliance is made clear, but he hasn't yet figured out how to make the album stand as a unit, a characteristic he would have in the albums that followed this one.<br /><br />Freewheelin' has the first of his protest songs, the kind of music that would make him famous and from which he would rebel. Overall, this is an essential album for Dylan fans precisely because it illustrated how quickly he was developing and showed that even at a very early age he was already the best songwriter around.<br /><br />--Lawrence J.

B0009MAP90|5.0|His first album. He wasn't satisfied with it, but it holds up well. He seems to be stifling his own creativity--offering up only two original songs--and trying to say he was an authentic participant in an old tradition of blues, country, and folk--what today is called roots music. His voice sounds as though he's deliberately trying to age it sometimes. It is almost as though he didn't quite trust his own artistic skills either as songwriter or vocalist.<br /><br />Dylan himself was disappointed with the performance. But in the light of what happened to him, this album is fascinating for what it reveals about what Dylan saw as significant sources to his music and what themes would emerge that were important to him.<br /><br />--Lawrence J.

B000KJU1HI|5.0|This new edition is invaluable. The original film was fascinating, filled with intimate views of Bob Dylan's emotionally-charged 1965 tour, with Joan Baez being ignored, with Allen Ginsberg being overjoyed, with Donovan in way over his head, with Albert Grossman being the tough negotiator. There is a fascinating scene of Dylan composing while chaos goes on all around him.<br /><br />What the new edition offers is a different perspective on Dylan himself. In the original he can come across as petty. The outtakes that make up the additional material are extraordinary revealing a much warmer, more human Dylan especially in his dealings with children. The commentary is even fascinating.<br /><br />There are more outtakes from this film, and I hope they will be released as well.<br /><br />--Lawrence J.

Humanity is being eradicated by a deadly virus. The 4 people are running away through the desert to an empty beach on the West Coast in the futile hope to escape it...<br />Of course they run into logistical trouble: gasoline runs out and can be had only through complicated social acts like carjacking and murder. They have defined rules: if one falls ill, he will be left behind. The sick are dead.<br />Of course this will be one of the drivers of the conflicts.<br />This film is unusually smart for the genre. It stays on the small scale and shies away from murderous zombie hordes. It ends in a dead end, predictably, and no answers are given.<br />For the 'end of the world' and 'zombie' genre fans: an outstanding contribution to the available stock of movies.
0316166685|4.0|I read this book with a hook in my heart--a deep sadness, which pervaded my reading to the very end.  In this regard, I believe the author wildly succeeded in creating an emotional tale of loss and separation, in which the surviving family and friends of our dead 14 year old heaven-based narrator never quite reach happiness as much as acceptance.<br /><br />I was immediately drawn into the novel by the harrowing description of the rape and murder of Susie Salmon, our narrator, and kept there by the author's fine writing and unexpected plot twists.  Through Susie's eyes, the author alternated Susie's experiences in heaven, and those of a handful of families and friends, to move the story along.  I found the characters to be well developed and intelligent (these are smart people), and not stereotyped in the least.  Even given the fantastical nature of the plot device, with one exception addressed below, I found the characters' reactions to be uniformly realistic and reasonable.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated the lowkey manner in which the author presented the life and fate of George Harvey, Susie's killer.  Had I been the author, I would have been tempted to turn this lovely book into a standard detective story.  While the novel contains some elements of that genre, the author wisely steered clear of that treatment, instead opting for a much more nuanced (and may I say) realistic treatment of the killer's life and fate.<br /><br />My one quibble:  The novel requires the reader to accept that Susie has died, that she is in heaven looking down, and that she has limited interaction with family and friends.  Because the author presented her world (heaven and earth) as one governed by its own logic, consistency and rules, I was able to easily accept that premise.  Unfortunately, at a crucial point in the book, the author created a \\"device\\" to give Susie one more earthly experience outside of her heavenly bubble.  I found the author's decision to violate her our internal rules to be a serious misstep.  Not only did it come off as being a \\"Ghost\\" ripoff (yes, the movie with Demi Moore and Patrick Swazey), but it sacrificed some of the pervasive sadness and loss of Susie's eternal separation, in favor of a Hollywood ending.  In the preamble, Susie recalls her father's description of the penguin in the snow globe as \\"being trapped in a perfect world.\\"  Susie's fate mimicked that of the penguin, until the author lost faith in her own vision for the disappointing expedient of a \\"happy ending.\\"<br /><br />But even with this significant flaw, this is a truly extraordinary book which I would heartily recommend to all.erious misstep.

While the book is quite thick and I haven't read the whole thing, I have been attempting to apply the principals laid out in the book.  This therapy is not for the faint at heart, or for those not willing to conform to some pretty radical dietary (and other) changes, but I honestly would so much prefer to go this route to seek healing than try to find it in a pill or beneath a machine bombing my body with radiation.

I didn't realize that digital only meant for my computer or MP3 player.  Yes, it is great to have on my ipod, but I wanted a regular copy for all my other DVD players.

B002PAQEU8|5.0|The CD is really good. I love  their new CD but I still love some of the older songs more like Drowning and Superman.  Brother would have been the perfect song to be played on the T.V. series Vampire Diaries on the CW   The only bad thing is the DVD since made in England does not work well on American computers you have to change the region before you can watch it.  So that is bad.  But I love their music so much. I wish American radio would play their music. I stumbled on to their music while watching One Tree hill on the CW T.V. Network. I have loved them ever since.  I hope they keep on making music. Kelly Jones of the band is so handsome.
B001R0KH3W|5.0|You will not be let down.  The video and audio fidelity is flawless.  I have both the regular DVD an the Blu-ray of this show.  The Blu-ray has the added bonus of being in DTS like the regular DVD and also Dolby Digital 5.1  Personally, I like the DD better.      This is a long recording and usually will outlast a good party.  Stevie is a gift to us and he has overcome several personal challenges to remain at the top of his game.  I've never seen a crowd so come together as one as at his show.  He also has the uncanny ability to read a crowd, despite his visual impairment.  You'll notice that his band watches him carefully, because Stevie is notorious for throwing curves at them.  This recording is no exception including his deciding to change keys in an ascending modulation unrehearsed.  I know it was unplanned for a fact because I talked to one of his keyboard players.      Put the disc in and turn it up.    Dana Point, CA
0385334206|1.0|Kurt Vonnegut is a snake oil salesman. His writing is so pretentious, self-referential, and nihilistic that you can't help but despise Vonnegut personally and despise even more the intellectuals and professors who praise him religiously.<br /><br />Breakfast of Champions is no different than the rest of his work. He randomly inserts inane facts to be funny, like the size of male characters' organs once he introduces them. These can come at any moment, so you have to be prepared for them. The book is extremely vulgar in that the obscenities have no redeeming value. There is no genuine emotion behind them.<br /><br />The plot? There is none that makes any sense. Furthermore, Vonnegut partakes in America bashing for the first 10 pages and comes across as a Communist, which made me nearly put the book down, but I muscled through the rest of it on a long airplane ride.<br /><br />Completely unenjoyable. No redeeming value. One of the worst books I've ever read.
B000W1V44I|5.0|This is a great CD - not just for BSB fans, but for everyone. I say that because if people gave them a chance, they would change their narrow minds. I think everyone should subscribe to the church of Backstreet and I have converted many in my 10 years of fandom. This is the first album without Kevin and while I do miss him, you can tell that they tried very hard to ensure that we were not missing him vocally and they succeeded! This is my favorite of all the albums. I think it's shows how they've grown as people and artists. The opening a capella version of Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon will give you goosebumps on the first listen. They are truly talented and don't get anywhere near the respect that they deserve. They could out sing any artist on the charts today. I know everyone is up Justin Timberlake's ugly ass (though I have no idea why), but if you could crawl out and listen to this, you would change your mind and realize that this is real talent and that they are far superior to most popular music.

I have read all of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse novels and they are fantastic. Now people say that I will compare it to the books and that's not true. I just don't think it's any good. My first complaint is that Sookie and the vampires (Bill and Eric) aren't good looking enough. Sorry if you don't agree. That's also true of the Twilight movies, too. Secondly, the writing is so bad! OMG! There is not one likeable character on the show! And what is up with Tara? Why is she such a jerk? If you love vampires, do yourself a favor and read the books and forget about this show. They don't do the books justice by any means.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|The thing that makes this movie more mesmerizing and electrifying than the TV series is the incredible performance by Summer Glau. She completely and absolutely  dominated every scene she was in with a presence and intensity that brought you to that reality.  It is a shame that the TV series treated the character of River almost as  an aside.  I never get tired of watching this, and the more I see it, the more I appreciate how the movie is so much better than the TV series ever dreamed of being.

B0025KVLRY|5.0|\\"With the Beatles\\" was the band's second album released in 1963. As on the debut album well over half the songs are Beatles originals, while the rest are mainly selected from the group's live repertoire.<br /><br />There was not released singles from the album in the UK, although several numbers have clearly hit potential, not least \\"All My Loving\\", which in the U.S. inexplicably reached only the place at number 45 on the charts. it could play a role that the Beatles during most 1963 was a high ranking with singles like \\"From Me to You,\\" \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".<br /><br />Vocally is \\"WTB\\" is dominated by John Lennen who takes care of the lead on half of the songs. It is no wonder of Lennon was awarded the lead singer-status because his voice at this point was incredibly powerful, and his performance on tracks like \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" and \\"Money\\" is nothing short of a breathtakingly impressive.<br /><br />The ballad \\"All I Gotta Do\\", also sung by Lennon, is one of many highlights of the album - a beautiful song in Arthur Alexander / Smokey Robinson-style - but written by Lennon himself.<br /><br />McCartney sings the catchy \\"no hit\\" All My Loving \\"also is one of the disc's most memorable numbers. McCartney's ballad talent is also reflected in the melancholy \\"Till There was You\\".<br /><br />George Harrison sings lead on three tracks: his own (excellent) \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" Chuck Berry's \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" and the more obscure \\"Devil in her Heart\\".<br /><br />Compared with the debut album the group here took a big leap forward.<br /><br />A few numbers like the weak \\"I Want to Be Your Man\\", and to a lesser extent \\"Little Child\\" and \\"Devil in her Heart\\", appear a bit like filler - but on the whole, however, an excellent album.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|Rubber Soul will always have a special place in my music collection, perhaps especially because it was the first album I got, but also very much because the music is so good. The album actually has no weak tracks.<br /><br />The psychedelic wave has not yet affected the Beatles music very clearly, but it slightly distorted cover shows that something new is on its way.<br /><br />The acoustic guitars play great and important role on most of the tracks, and some songs, such as Lennon's \\"Norwegian Wood\\" could almost be called \\"folksy\\".<br /><br />The vocals are sublime throughout the album with tight harmonies on most tracks.<br /><br />Lyrically the album reveal that in particular Lennon have begun to show more personality, evident on \\"Nowhere Man\\"<br /><br />The Lennon-McCartney songwriting team is really at its peak on this album, but also George Harrison's two contributions \\"Think for Yourself\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" are strong.<br /><br />It is difficult to highlight songs as most are excellent, but among the ballads, I think Lennon's \\"In My Life,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Girl\\" are the strongest. McCartney stands out on the more up-beat songs like \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\".<br /><br />Beatles showed also in this period great flair for effective and catchy guitar riffs. Listen to \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"Run For Your Life\\".<br /><br />One of pop-rock history's greatest albums.

The more you read you are in disbelief that the band pulled through just to make it out of the 80s, let alone still today. Adventure, friendship, family and lots of lovemaking are all intertwined well in Scar Tissue, filling out the 400 page biography. When you're done you'll be well aware that the 'rock star' life isn't all its made out to be (at times), and you'll probably want to read it again.

B00000IQCA|4.0|You either like this movie, or you hate it.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy it - Robert Altman can do good satire, and this is a good one. Sure, you'll probably have to watch it several times (and possibly even do some studying) in order to get all the various jokes and scathing comments about the fashion world and about Paris... but it's fun.<br /><br />There's a lot of serious talent in this film - Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Kim Basinger, Stephen Rea, Rupert Everett, Forest Whitaker, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall... the list goes on.<br /><br />While it seems to be primarily a murder mystery set in the world of high fashion, it is a lovely satire on the industry itself, and what people find acceptable. The end sequence with the \\"emperor's new clothes\\" fashion show is highly enjoyable in itself - not just because of the nudity, but because of what it says about the fashion industry. Watching Basinger's character melt down on camera is interesting and quite enjoyable... and was one of the inspirations for [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]].<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone - you require a sense of humor and a good grasp of satire. But Robert Altman has pulled off another sleight of hand with this. Heck, it's just fun.

0385504225|4.0|Okay, it's Christmas, I feel generous so I give Dan Brown four stars. Robert Langdon seemed to have become a bit slower than he was in Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code. He is frequently sought for his knowledge, yet he often seems to think, 'No itt can't be, but then again, I guess it is!' The violence appears to be written for Hollywood. And yet, well, if there's a popcorn movie then there's such a thing as a popcorn book. And this is it. Dan, this must be more fun than teaching at a prep school.
0385504225|2.0|..the Da Vinci Code and even Angels and Demons. Maybe it was the pedestrian atmosphere of DC compared to the historical intrigue of Paris, London and the Vatican. Maybe the implications of discovering/revelation of the 'Ancient Secrets' in the Lost Symbol is pale compared to the fidelity of the ideals of Western Civilization or the destruction of the Vatican/RC Church. Prominent US leaders acting like drunken frat boys at a cult meeting? Maybe cable coverage for a week? And the role of Katherine is murky, as opposed to Sophie and Vittoria, who are intricately linked to the plot. She is a researcher in Noetics, the science of the mind, and the main plot is based on the Masonic tradition of symbols and codes, and why is Mal'akh so obsessed with her and her work? She had nothing to do with his past and her lab was unrelated to his quest, which is even murkier. What was his ultimate goal? We do not really know, even at the end, unlike Silas or the Carmelengo. Maybe the Masons (Ben Franklin and Harry Truman?) just do not evoke darkly mysterious images, like the Templars, Priory of Scion, Opus Dei or the Illuminatti. Maybe the Secret Word does not galvanize the imagination as much as the Holy Grail or anti-matter. Maybe the Melancholia cannot match up with the Mona Lisa or the Last Supper. So, Let's all 'hope' that DB and the professor earns a better grade next time, and especially, that Tom Hanks passes on this one.

B002H3F7F6|4.0|To understand the music and where Sting is coming from one needs to read the lyrics and Stings interpretative remarks.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|AVATAR will blow your mind.  See it in IMAX if at all possible; if not, opt for 3-D, but do not see the 2-D.  You need to experience this movie as a viscerally as possible.  At once a corny diatribe against war-mongering, and a not-so-subtle cry for \\"greenery\\" (aka WALL-E), this is so much more than a movie.  AVATAR transcends whatever your expectation might be - based on the somewhat baffling, weird previews, and based on your collective knowledge of James Cameron's showmanship at the movies (kickass movies that linger - and hold up! - but each with a distinctive look, and YES, heart!) The heartbeat of this wildly conceived story is what will make you remember it.  The palpable love story between the two lead characters, as well as the story of one soul's salvation from certain doom, are the things that make this Pocahontas-Jurassic Park-Aliens adventure work so brilliantly.  I've already said too much - you need to SEE this thing to believe it, and trust me - you WILL.

0385504225|1.0|I have read every Dan Brown novel and hence was eager to read this novel. Just finished it last night and it was a complete let down. It was unimaginative, the ending was extremely unsatisfying. Dan has one formula that he applies. A code to a clue which has another code which upon deciphering will lead to another clue etc etc. Thats fine with me but the problem with this novel is - you could literally ignore all the clues and codes as they have no relevance to the conclusion. Another problem - the objective of the villain was obtuse and Dan didnt really address that - which makes it a huge problem as 509 pages were dedicated to that objective.    Mr. Brown: the problem with this kind of writing is, you are going to have readers like me question our decision to purchase your work the next time - but you did get my money this time. A complete let down and a total waste of time.
0316001821|4.0|Rarely do I read a book so beautifully and effortlessly written. By now, everyone knows the story of Alice Sebold's novel--part exercise in dramatic irony, part benign ghost story, part family drama--but what affected me most was the very plausible and sympathetic way in which Sebold depicts the spirit of her narrator/protagonist, the brutally murdered Susie Salmon. The Lovely Bones is quite literally a spiritual novel. I almost want to call it a Spirit Story as opposed to a Ghost Story, because this is a story about haunting, but not in the sense that ghost stories are typically about haunting. It's about the knowledge that haunts the spirits of the dead, the sorrow and mystery that haunts the survivors, and the desires and hopes that haunt us all. I do hope Peter Jackson's film version does justice to the lyrical beauty of this book. Sebold has written a modern classic.

B002RSDW80|2.0|I am not sure what's with all the glowing reviews...<br /><br />I hit play and the movie started with a Child-like voice and a glowing, beautiful performance by Streeps. I was so excited, partly because I was about to watch the becoming of Julia into Julia Child, who made me love cooking.<br /><br />Lo and behold, the movie is cut off before it starts and there goes Child (or, rather, Streeps' beautiful performance of her). And she comes back sporadically, with very little information about what she is learning, what she is doing with what she is learning, or how she is enjoying it... Oh yes, she is trying to write a book after learning how to cook in Paris. Uhm, that's it. Bits and pieces that could have added texture to that bland summary becomes forgotten as, more and more, the movie hides Julia behind Julie...<br /><br />Yes, yes; Julie's story links to Julia's, but it is Julia's life that is significantly rich with texture (according to the movie that gives you bits and pieces --I didn't read about her life), not Julie's, which is (seemingly, according to the movie) a narrative of neurotic self-absortion (of self) and idolization (of Julia), overly salted with nervous break downs and peppered by Hollywood-style \\"relationship crises\\" (of Julie).<br /><br />One could do wonders with the story-to-be-written, but one did not.<br /><br />And where is the narration of Child's work? How do you sidestep the very content of someone's work (except how to bone a duck and sear meat) while \\"telling\\" her life?<br /><br />As a sidenote (in case someone knows something about Child's life), in the movie, Child seems to be using the same enamel cast iron dutch iron (available at Marshalls for $40) for the duration of the movie, which I think is ~10 years or so. Was that dutch oven something special to her, or was that just in-movie advertisement?<br /><br />If I had no expectations from this movie, I'd give it 5 stars simply for Streeps' performance. Unfortunately, I had :(

B002XUL85G|4.0|PARANORMAL ACTIVITY just opened here on the 24th as a nice Xmas present to any moviegoer. I didn't want to let one day pass before I saw this, specially after watching the trailer repeatedly.<br />Besides all every one can think or say about PA, be it vintage, modern or special-efx contemporary (overloaded) horror movie fans,<br />I can only say I didn't leave the theatre same as I entered. The sudden ending and lack of main and end credits, the very tense waiting for some expert to show up at the house, a ghost expert wanting to run away \\"or whatever is inside could get really worse\\" add up to well created edge-of-seat tension. I value this greatly compared to the cheap and massively abused special-effects overload of the last...say...10 years?<br />A great little device I loved here is the digital clock to the left of the screen shown during the sleep sequences, being  the only element that you can stick to when trying to judge how normal what the camera shows you every passing second really is. Accelerated display of passing time means a lot, too. Yes, it reminds of old great favourites of mine like the alarm clock close-ups on AMITYVILLE HORROR and other calendar or running clock time markers like in THE SHINING or the very great and must-see THE HUNTING , THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE or THE ENTITY (which great music score has just been issued on cd  after 27 years!)<br />Now, where I wanted to get to is you MUST make sure you see this either at the best sound-equipped movie theatre in your area or sitting in a well suited room for 5.1 or whatever the dvd sound format is. Sound post-production is possibly one of the most subtle and best accomplished I can remember and the grading of how the presence of the uninvited grows \\"sonically\\" more evidently each day is, to me, one of the best technical aspects of PA.<br />I would never change my beloved old THE EXORCIST as one of my Top 10 can't-stop-watching horror classics. But it's simply a different era in horror. PA might not become part of that top 10 list but it will keep me and many of you wondering for years to come, what really did happen in that house!.

0689829590|1.0|First off, I love Eric Carle's books and this is one of our favorite stories.     We asked for the board book version as a gift for our toddler because she's still pretty hard on regular books. We didn't realize that this board book has fold out pages made of heavy weight paper and a center fold out section that I can feel tearing as I look through the book. There is no way this book will withstand daily reading by a toddler.  I'm so disappointed because I wanted her to be able to enjoy this story on her own, especially when we already own the hardback book version of this story.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Bearing in mind that the movie is never as good as the book, (and that I have never read any of the HP books anyway) I found this to be the best Harry Potter movie yet!    This is the first I have seen in HD and thought the quality was very very good. The actors sure have grown up and do their parts well. The special effects are second to none, and the \\"how-it-was-made segments  are amazing! The other features were also very interesting, using the main actors to show us around the sets etc.    I can't wait for the final episode next summer, because this movie has enough possible endings to make it potentially tantalizing!    In case anyone is wondering why I have not divulged any of the movie details, it is because I would like everyone to see the movie. Just make sure you watch all the other movies first to understand the characters and the ongoing plot.    This gets two big thumbs up from a (Movie only) Harry Potter fan.

B002JCSWUW|2.0|Note: This review may contains spoilers--'Invictus' is designed to be a 'feel-good' movie about relationships between blacks and whites. The setting is South Africa beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and his subsequent ascent to the South African presidency a short time later. Morgan Freeman does a great job in 'channeling' the great man and you really feel as if you're watching Mandela himself. When the Oscars come up, Freeman has a very good shot at copping the Oscar for Best Actor.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's strategy is to depict Nelson Mandela's program for racial reconciliation through the narrow prism of International Rugby. While there are a few interesting glimpses of Mandela interacting with his main assistant and some of his counselors, little of his personal life is shown (there is a brief scene where he's depicted as being alienated from his daughter who regards him as something of a sell-out). By the second half, Mandela is reduced to being basically a cheerleader for the South African Rugby team. Still, the sheer humanity of Mandela is always at the forefront, with his emphasis on forgiveness.<br /><br />I liked the first half of Invictus better than the second. There's a good scene where Mandela tries to persuade a group of his constituents (a Sports Federation) not to disenfranchise the rugby team. Mandela, in Christ-like fashion, urges the crowd to 'turn the other cheek' and support the team despite their identification of the white players with the apartheid era. Despite their initial rejection, blacks in South Africa gradually come to root for the team. One way they're won over is after Mandela asks the team to tour the shanty towns and introduce rugby to poor black children. It helps that there's one black player on the team who becomes a national figure. But when Mandela visits the team before a big game and congratulates each player individually, he's sending a signal that he's for whites as much as blacks. And the white players (who are initially depicted as being quite alienated and angry after Mandela becomes President) gradually soften up too: in one poignant scene, they go on a tour of the prison where Mandela was held for 27 years. Later they're not afraid to sing the new South African anthem with their black countrymen.<br /><br />Less successful are the scenes involving Mandela's bodyguards. The tension between the black and white bodyguards at the beginning is quite understandable. But virtually none of the characters are ever fleshed out. It takes a team victory in the Rugby World Cup to get them all hugging one another. But the camaraderie seems quite superficial. One wonders if everyone will be so touchy-feeley once all the excitement has worn off.<br /><br />Invictus completely loses steam in the second half. There's virtually no suspense since the film's outcome is a forgone conclusion. What's worse is that the idea of an antagonist is lost as the film plods along. The tension between blacks and whites is palpable at the beginning but as the focus shifts to the rugby team itself, where is the conflict? Good movies have a moment where the protagonist faces a moment of crisis leading to a 'dark moment of the soul'. The best Invictus offers us is when Mandela collapses after being overworked. It's not enough!<br /><br />The awkwardness of the entire screenplay is embodied in the relationship between the team captain, Francois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon and Mandela. They have one scene together when Mandela invites Pinaar to tea. We find out next to nothing about Pienaar but maybe that's because there's not a lot to find out. Damon runs around a lot on the field but only briefly confronts his teammates who are initially reluctant to embrace Mandela's plan for reconciliation. Again, where is the conflict?<br /><br />As an American who is unfamiliar with the rules of rugby, I was bored watching scene after scene of grown men groping one another without protectiveequipment. Since Eastwood really had no exciting climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'. For rugby aficionados, this might prove to be orgasmic. As for ignorant Americans such as myself, I never thought I'd be desperate to tune into next Sunday's football game so quickly.<br /><br />Some have claimed that Invictus is just another film about race relations from the white man's perspective. Maybe so but I prefer to view it as primarily a mediocre sports film. On the plus side, if one wishes to feel good without thinking too hard, then one can indulge oneself in this rather superficial glimpse of racial harmony. While Invictus fails in the drama department, Morgan Freeman's performance as the great and inspiring Mandela will make you look at race relations from the glass being half full and not half empty.ng climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'.

Despite that, after reading it, i was left feeling a bit disappointed. In some ways it felt that while the plot was good, the actual story was a bit light, and possibly stretched too thin.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|(500) Days of Summer was one of the most acclaimed films of 2009, almost unanimously adored by filmgoers and critics alike. It's a romantic-comedy, one of the more repetitive genres of recent years...Yet, unlike many of the bigger-budget romantic-comedies, it actually succeeds at blending both romanticism and comedy together to create a smart, cute, and funny film. It also helps that (500) Days of Summer is not a love story, but a story about a broken relationship that wasn't your typical movie-like relationship in the first place.     The opening title card initially appears to be a disclaimer, but ends up being the film's first joke and it's actually funny. An uncredited narrator introduces us to Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), both completely different people. Tom is an idealistic, effusive romantic and lover of British pop music. Summer is a reserved, emotionally detached woman with significantly less ideals of love and things of that nature. The story jumps back and forth between the 500 days that Tom met Summer, fell in love with her, attempted to win her over, almost did, lost her, and then attempted to come to grips with that loss.    In the hands of lesser writers, the chronology of the film would have seemed like a gimmick but this sort of chronology really serves the story best. Roger Ebert said that it worked because we don't remember relationships in chronological order and no one has summed it up better. There doesn't seem to be any structure, as we'll see a day where Tom is completely heartbroken over Summer and then a scene where they're together and OK. There is structure here however and it works flawlessly, as we seem to actually be watching someone recount the details of a relationship.    Director Marc Webb, who previously directed music videos and make his feature-film debut here, handles this material remarkably well and only has one scene that sort of shows his credentials as a previous music video director. This scene, which has a choreographed dance sequence, happens at random but serves the spontaneity of the story, as well as showing how much joy was put into making this.    And, as I said, the humor here is actually funny. It uses the cynicism that would come with a failed relationship rather than go for cheap jokes and there's never a moment where the humor seems forced. While many have written about Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel (performance-wise), I feel credit is due to Geoffrey Arend as McKenzie, Tom's friend, as well. Arend provides many of the biggest laughs in the movie and is rarely mentioned in reviews. Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of today's finest actors and after seeing him tackle dark, violent roles recently it's amazing how easily his charm shines through as Tom. Deschanel, both beautiful and charming in her own unique way, is the perfect summer. She's previously used her monotonous, indifferent qualities as tools for humor but here she uses it to illustrate the coldness of Summer. It's easy to see how Tom could feel unrequited longing for this girl.    Being both a huge fan of The Smiths (whose music plays a relatively large role in the film overall) and finding Zooey Deschanel to be both talented and gorgeous, I was sort of inclined to love this movie. After all, the scene between Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel in the elevator is like a scene from my dreams. But, bias aside, (500) Days of Summer is a wonderful romantic-comedy. With the exception of the sappy and predictable, yet sweet, ending; the film avoids the typical clichés that come along with this genre. This is a work of true originality that is both witty and incredibly charming. I wouldn't quite think of this as a \\"bold statement,\\" but (500) Days of Summer is the best romantic-comedy of 2009 and if you like this genre with a little originality and genuine humor and pathos injected in from time-to-time, you won't want to miss this film.    GRADE: B+
B0026RHR6K|4.0|I have not viewed the DVD's yet, but I know the series and it is awesome!  The complete series set comes with everything including an action figure that thrilled my friend (who I gave the series to for Christmas)!  The box it comes in is very unique, albeit a tad squished when it arrived in the mail - not Amazon's fault!  Amazon always does a great job with the products it sells!  And I got a great deal on the box set!  Thank you!
B000683VI4|4.0|Nice old fashioned sappy love story.  None of the characters are truly unlikable except for one, but even she has a redemption of sorts. This is a good movie to watch around the holidays because it's really not based in reality, but who the hell cares? Definitely worth watching.
B0026P3G12|2.0|The CD was not what I expected. I thought she would have the same enchanting voice as she had on TV but it was not.
B002X20W2E|5.0|Rihanna has finally broken through that pop princess stereotype and has come into her own. Rated R, while not the best album I have ever heard, earns max ratings from me because of the innovation present. Ri-Ri leaves behind the cutesy pop tunes and brings in the funk, the hard rock, the trance, the reggae, the dancehall, the death rap...etc. The first song Mad House says it all \\"Warning: this isn't your typical pop diva album!\\"     Songs like 'Photograph' and 'Russian Roulette' bare Rihanna's fragility, while 'G4L' and 'Rockstar', show that her infamous break-up has made her a little meaner. And I like this new meaner Rihanna, unapologetic and pushing into new frontiers. \\"Firebomb\\" is the culmination of all this. While not my favorite track, I certainly thought the album should have ended with Firebomb because the song conveys this sense of finality.      Like I said before, this isn't a perfect album. Far from it. I understand why her pop fans would be turned off from this album but that said, it's the same reason that I love it. I hope Rihanna continues to dare to be different. She might lose her 'pop' following but I have no doubt that she will gain the admiration of others who appreciate her boldness...
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I am in debt to FX. for the creation of this show. It is finaly a great show for all of the hard core bikers in us all. Not only is it a great nonstop bad to the bone manopera but it has a storyline that flows verry well from the first show to the last. My only regret is that season 2 is not on dvd yet and i must wate till sept for season 3.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I listened to the excerpts of the songs on this C/D prior to buying it. The songs show the range and styles that Susan Boyle sings.  I was very happy to have made the purchase and hope that Susan will cut another C/D soon. For those who appreciate her voice and wide range of styles of songs, this C/D is a must.
B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts are great if you only have 20 minutes.  This video has three levels; beginner, intermediate, and advance.  The beginner is pretty tough and the intermediate and advanced are probably right on target. I like to work out for at least 40 minutes so I usually string two of these together.  These are tough workouts, the cardio gets your heart up and the stength training is solid.  The workouts do feel redundant with banish fat and no more trouble zones.  If you have those two workouts, you might want to skip this one. This is a similar circuit training workout.<br />Jillians workouts are fun to do and do not require a tremendous amount of coordination which is a bonus for those of us who like to workout early in the morning (I'm a 5:30 exerciser so learning complicated dance routines is not for me). I like a workout I can jump in a do without needing a long learning curve. This is relatively simple to learn but difficult to do.
B002I9Z8B2|2.0|The \\"Wrath of Khan\\" blue ray dvd is a very poor copy.  The movie has a greenish/cycan tint to it.   I am a professional film technician working for Disney.  It appears the blu ray was copied from a second or third generation  internegative.  The person doing the transfer did a very poor job correcting the grey scale from this internegative.   The blue ray copy should have been done from the original negative.  This copy was made from a second or third generation  internegative or possibly a release print.  There is a strong greenish/cyan mask on this copy.   The person doing the copy of this print did a very poor job with color correction.  When copying a movie from an internegative it is important to correct  the gray scale.  I saw the \\"Wrath of Khan\\" when it was released in the theatrs.  In fact, I was working for a movie theatre when this movie was released.   I remember the color balance, and it was perfect.   The blue ray disk is not accurate in color balance, I would  not recommend buying it if you want an accurate copy of this motion picture.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an awesome book from start to finish.  Marcus takes you from training to one of the most incredible battles.  This book is headed to Hollywood in the near future (this is in the works) and Marcus will preserve the integrity of the Seal team and the USA vs. Hollywood.
B001SN78JO|5.0|If you can just kick back, drop the adult age judgements, and relax, you'll be swept along by the outrageous and hilarious antics of Jim Carrey. There were some scenes where I was laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. Yes, it's at about 7th grade humor level -- and I don't care. It was great to play along and have a fun time. Thanks, Jim, for all the laughs.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I guess it's not noe of Tarantino's best films but still very entertaining and made in the classic Tarantino style.<br /><br />You'll like it if you like Tarantino's stuff.  Warning: Very violent!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I have viewed all (thus far) 103 episodes of Lost on DVD; I couldn't even tell you which day or timeslot the series runs on ABC. As far as building an immediate sense of memory, momentum, and continuity the DVD experience cannot be beaten. On the other hand, I can see an advantage in watching the weekly program in that there is a developing community feedback in the form of the intermediate office water cooler and/or internet chat rooms discussions with other viewers. However, by the time the DVD comes out (months later), most of the discussion has been honed to more realistic analysis of what the writers have actually created. Still, there's nothing wrong with discussions of inevitably incorrect conclusions about where the storylines are going. It's all grist for the mill and ultimately good exercise for the noggin.     Personally speaking though, I have to admit that having one weekend a year to yourself where you can hunker down in solitude and do the entire Lost season in two days in an all-out video blitz is one of the finer joys in my life, not the first mind you--but up there in rank!     It's good to control the flow with the freedom to stop and rewind (to use an old VHS term) a scene and recount the action or dialogue, or pause and go do something else for a few minutes (you'll have to if you're on a seven hour viewing jag)!     Thus, the DVD gives one time and freedom; the broadcast better gives one a sense of community. I guess there's room for both. For those who choose my method I recommend Wikipedia's various articles on the series; however, beware of spoiliers, or just read them after viewing. Also, an advantage of the DVD, Blueray eitions is that you can always sell them on Amazon and recoup your payment to buy the next season.    Finally, Season 5 was great. Many of the threads of the various storylines are coming together. If you haven't seen seasons 1 through 4 however, I highly recommend you go back and view them in sequence or you will be cheating yourself of one of the best sci-fi mind expanding experiences possible.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Some older movies made into Blu Ray and even new Blu Ray movies sometimes are not visually much better than DVD.<br /><br />Not with Shining!  I could not believe how visually spectacular the movie scenes were.<br /><br />The scenes of the mountain-sides were again nothing short of spectacular!
B002XSP16A|4.0|I ordered this book before its sale and anxiously awaited its arrival.  I love the album.  My favorite new discovery on her album which I had not heard her sing previously was the song, \\"You'll See.\\"  Anyone who has ever been betrayed in any way will relate to her singing of this song of survival.
B001NXBRJG|3.0|A great movie, but Blu Ray format is not much better visually than DVD.<br /><br />If you have the DVD version, don't waste your money on this Blu Ray
B0026P3G12|4.0|I DREAM A DREAM - a fine selection of pleasing sounds that take one to days gone by. The range and depth of her voice bring about a restful period in otherwise hectic days.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great SIFI. First I thought it was going to be a cheap show. Firefly is Awesome! well written story, actors are perfect for there parts, effects, CT image, you really get caught up in these episodes. I only wish they would have done more seasons. They ended with Serenity, that movie explains more of the players, Great movie also.
B0028K31CE|5.0|This is my first Maxwell album, while I've really liked some of his songs, Fortunate and This Woman's Work...listening to others Maxwell music, how many wasn't bumpin Maxwell through all of his cds, not many who like good music. Some say they miss the old Maxwell, well, this is on point, so soothing...it's the live instrumentation that's so different and very refreshing...his authentic heart and soul being shared. if Rnb is to return and take its rightful place, then we better get back to the basics and that's just what Maxwell has done. No gimmicks, computer generated empty music, tracks with vocals, this is what music is about...pure soul!    I can't wait for the next two installments, this franchise is sure to make other artists think and stop putting out crap, spend the money, time and respect and create some classic and profound music...bout time!    Thanks, Maxwell, my soul is all a glow!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Lovely voice and humble.  What a great combo! I cannot wait for her next release!!!!
0385340575|5.0|This yarn started out with a very intense scene on the subway in NYC.  It was detail but there was a purpose for the detail. Several people wrote that the detail about a suicide bomber was boring and the detail about who was in the subway car was unnecessary. However, seasoned readers of Child, like myself, understand why he is detail, Yes, he has made an occasional mistake - I don't know of a SIG 9mm, mine is 45 cal- but it is fiction.  When he mentioned the passengers in detail, they all entered into the story later.<br /><br />Jack is detail and it took him several pages to get the story going, it kept you turning pages. Jack has great reasoning skills.  The action sequences were great and the violence detail impacted.<br /><br />This is a good novel.  Finished it in two readings. Notice:  You cannot skim his novels.

0312370849|5.0|This book tells a story about the roundup of Jewish families in Paris by the French police.  The event itself was ignored for many years by the French who did not want to admit that their police were in league with the SS and Gestapo in destroying the Jewish population in pre-war France.  The story is told at two levels:  the first from the perspective of a pre-teen girl who loses her parents and brother to the death camps of the Nazis.  The second from the perspective of a modern journalist who is investigating the story for her employer, publisher of a newspaper.  The author is a magnificent story teller who provides many levels and surprises in the telling of Sarah's Key.

B001KVZ6G6|2.0|I had high expectation that was turned to disappointment. Great animation and Blu Ray picture quality, but no story. It did not touch me like other Disney movies have, i.e. Wall-e. There are scary and eerie scenes that are not good for young children.

B002RSDW80|5.0|I'm part French, took a vacation in France and came away with the opinion that there is nothing as delicious as French food. To me everything I tried was exquisite and unforgettable. In recent years I've tried some of Julia Child's recipes and adapted her boeuf bourguignon (beef stew) - I use less burgundy. So when I heard about this movie and decided to wait for it to come out on DVD I'm glad I did. It was much more cozy to watch it at home.<br /><br />My first impression of the movie was that it was brilliant mostly due to Meryl Streep's mind-blowingly-accurate portrayal of Julia Child's personality. I've been watching The French Chef TV shows and have gained a deeper understanding of her cooking techniques, mannerisms and vocal inflections.  Meryl Streep captures something of Julia Child's soul and allows the viewer to fall in love with the idea of Julia Child.<br /><br />Amy Adams is perfect for the role of Julie, she has just enough obsessiveness to get the job done. Making all the recipes in Mastering the art of French Cooking is a formidable task and she has a very small apartment kitchen. Her trials and tribulations, meltdowns and spectacular successes make the movie feel real and lets the viewer ride along with emotional upheavals and disappointments when Judith Jones (a famous editor) doesn't make it to dinner. The other upsetting part in the movie is information about Julia Child not liking Julie's Blog. This is devastating to her and she loves Julia Child and wants to meet her.<br /><br />This movie will make you run out to buy: [[ASIN:0307593525 Mastering the Art of French Cooking (2 Volume Set)]] so you can try all these recipes yourself. It is really a jumping off point for your own journey of discovery. I felt this<br />movie made cooking very exciting.<br /><br />As someone who has received a rejection letter from Judith Jones (she writes very nice ones) I felt a strange connection to the story. My cookbook had to be rewritten since she told me my recipe instructions were too truncated - so I changed the entire book. I think she would like the new version that I have published myself.<br /><br />I felt very emotional while watching this movie. It had so many dreams and hopes that eventually become realities. I love very few movies and this one captured me completely.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br />Author of [[ASIN:0595477747 Seasoned with Love: A collection of best-loved recipes inspired by over 40 cultures]]ated - so I changed the entire book.

B00138J4ZA|5.0|One of the best, most dramatic, most emotional concerts EVER! We totally enjoyed each and every beautifully arranged song. Each song was uniquely arranged to provide a wonderful listening experience. They did not overpower the songs and actually pulled back and delivered a performance that will inspire and entertain. Wonderful, wonderful concert!    One song that really knocked our socks off was Jingle Bells. When we saw that they were scheduled to sing Jingle Bells, we figured, there is no way that the Three Tenors can sing Jingle Bells and thrill us with their sound, in the same way that they have thrilled us with their other numbers. Well...... we were wrong! Their special arrangement of Jingle Bells was outstanding, and, as with their other wonderfully delivered songs, we totally enjoyed their version of Jingle Bells, and so did the audience who gave them one of the biggest ovations of the night after The Three Tenor's special delivery of Jingle Bells! For those who love good, quality, dramatic music, you MUST get this album!
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|This album (I'm dating myself) is one of the best. If you like even half the tracks from an album it's a winner. But if you like nearly every track, as I do in this case, it is FANTASTIC. I can't believe I'm the first review. This is four years old, and one of the best \\"new sounds\\" I've heard in a long time. Their latest album is also a winner in my opinion. Maybe that's the problem..............I'm 55 years old. This is hard rock like it was always meant to be.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Very good CD with a beautiful voice. Price on Amazon.com is no different than at other retailers or on-line.
B002MW50KY|5.0|I love Christmas albums. I have several in my household, ranging from A Charlie Brown Christmas to a Bobby Sherman Christmas. I also have Mitch Miller's famous one, along with Phil Spector's Christmas Album. And I can safely say that this album can stand with those easily.  Bob Dylan's Christmas in the Heart is one of the best Christmas albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />There is a tendency by people to mock this album even before hearing it. Bob Dylan making a Christmas album? Even as a Dylan fan, I was surprised at first, then delighted. This is a really good and heartfelt album.  It has excellent arrangements of Christmas classics, and it has a few tunes that I've never heard before (like The Christmas Blues).  The arrangement of Must Be Santa is rocking and phenonemal, to say the least.  Dylan even adds some hysterical lyrics at the end, and it totally works. On Dylan's last album, Together Through Life, the arrangements were a little loose and relaxed.  Sometimes that worked, other times it didn't. Here, Dylan's band is tight as they have ever been, and it really helps the music immensely. Sure, Dylan's voice is, to quote a song of his, like a \\"bullfrog croakin'\\", but it doesn't bother me that much.  In fact, on some of the ballads here, his ragged voice works wonders, like on some of the ballads on Modern Times.  The best examples of that are The First Noel, Silver Bells, and Hark the Herald Angels Sing.  I also love the tenderness of Winter Wonderland and The First Noel here, and the charm of Here Comes Santa Claus as well.<br /><br />This album has turned out to be one of Dylan's most polarising albums EVER, and I'm really not entirely sure why.  Some of the reactions are downright bizarre at times.  Maybe it's because Dylan is truly sincere here, paying tribute to Christmas songs he heard when he was a child, and that there is no condenscension towards the audience here.  No self conscious smugness.  Just a great record brilliantly performed.  Many people were polarised by Dylan's Christian period as well (which was much underrated in my opinion). Normally, I would recommend this album to Dylan completists, but I recommend it to everyone now. I'm not going to be an idiot contrarian by saying it's Dylan's best album ever (it isn't), but I like it as much as Together Through Life (his other 2009 album), and I have played it quite a lot since I bought it back in November 2009.<br /><br />Christmas in the Heart is one of Dylan's most memorable albums, like it or not.sed by Dylan's Christian period as well (which was much underrated in my opinion).

1582701709|1.0|A friend recommended this book, said it got her through a rough time in her life. I got the book, it was pathetic. Basically, the book says (and repeats ad nauseum) that if you want something, no matter what it is, wish really hard and believe it will come to you, and it will. It doesn't get more childish and ridiculous than this. \\"The Secret\\" was the secret to wealth for its author; otherwise, it's a waste of trees and whatever else went into the production of it.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie because of the very interesting premise, but I was sorely disappointed. The special effects and acting were good but in the end it was just a waste of time.  This movie was visually unappealing (just gross) and at the end there was no reason for watching (no redeeming quality).  At the end of the movie, I just felt \\"EWWWW\\".
B001FB4W16|5.0|I got quite addicted to the series after watching on recommendation of my friend. After watching season one I decided to read the books, which i must say is better then the series, but that isn't saying much because the series is quite good too!!! it looks and sounds great in blu-ray as well!
B0026P3G12|4.0|Since I first heard Susan Boyle sing on Youtube, I have wanted to have a recording.  This recording is satisfying.  I particulary love her  \\"I Dreamed A Dream,\\" but the other selections are also wonderful.  Thank you to Susan for singing and to those who were involved in the recordings.  This is one of the best gifts I have ever received.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|This is quite simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Ever.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|Ditto what the previous reviewers wrote.  When I removed the DVD's from my brand-new shrink-wrapped box-set, they were already scratched!  Not merely smudged but the deep NetFlix-caliber scratches that catch your fingernail and which not even the Blu-ray player could ignore.  And yes, I must now return it.<br />Otherwise... one of the greatest, most intense TV shows conceived.  Also, extremely well-cast.  I can't name a single weak link in the primary cast.  Unlike NYPD Blue.  (Ugh)<br />So five stars for the adrenalin-rush of the series, ZERO stars for unimaginably bad packaging.  Be warned.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|In Medieval India, Sanskrit was the spoken language and `AVATAR' is a Sanskrit word, meaning incarnation. Most of the Gods of the Indian pantheon had several Avatars or incarnations. I saw `AVATAR' the first day, it was released worldwide. Like most of the other reviewers have done, I will not spoil the suspense for you by narrating the story in detail. Suffice to say that it's a great extravaganza. A film that is seen only once in a lifetime. One has to see the film with a totally open mind. Erase all concepts and stories of films till this day and absorb this film into your heart. No wonder James Cameron had the idea brewing for such a long period and finally decided to make the movie in 2009. Needless to say that the film might even surpass BENHUR and TITANIC and go on to take to win 12 Academy Awards creating Motion Picture history. The film is truly awesome. I felt that I was being transported to another plane of existence.  The Visual Effects, Sound, Sound-Editing are all out of this world. The Make-up and Costumes are superb. It was heartening to see Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron working together again.  The negative character of the General, portrayed by Stephen Lang, is so realistic that audiences were literally cheering in joy whenever Lang's character took a beating. I have yet to see a portrait of a villain so uniquely done. Hats off to Mr. Lang and I personally think that he should be honoured with the Best Supporting Actor Statuette.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Ok, so I am biased. I am a 55 year old man who unashamededly says that Paul is his hero.  Finally we have a dvd that captures the McCartney concert performance in toto, both visually and aurally. Finally the viewer will not get vertigo watching this video, for the most part this video focuses upon the band. Sound quality on the DVD is outstanding, I am quite disappointed in the fidelity of the cds.  I really would like to hear from anyone who can tell me about another performer who deeply touches a more diverse range of individuals (in the world) and completely enraptures them concert long. It is his humanity, his openess, his creative brilliance which taps into universal emotions that makes Macca the most influential and remarkable performer in the world today.  And he is still creating and still performing with incredible energy and committment at age 67! To me, it is so touching how Paul seems to allow us to see his genuine emotions associated with music which is personal for him, but a part of all of us.<br />Yes there are a whole bunch of live McCartney dvds out there. As as person who has them all-- I can say with complete confidence that this is the best of all the McCartney dvds produced. This is a must have purchase. You will not regret it.
B001N26GFM|1.0|This film perpetuates the myth that a large percentage of the German population was clueless about the genocide taking place in their country. It diminishes the horrific brutality of concentration camp life. And it asks us to feel sorry for the one innocent German boy who was \\"accidentally\\" gassed, instead of the millions of others equally innocents who were systematically slaughtered. This film is insulting to the memories of all those persecuted under Hilter's reign.
B00001U0E1|5.0|From my wife Sarah: This is one of my all time favorite movies. I've got to admit I've watched it maybe 10 times, and plan to watch it again and again. It's one of the most beautiful, passionate and clever stories I've seen. The acting is amazing and real. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes hold nothing back. I've got to say that they were very brave to reveal their souls on the screen like this. It's mesmerizing.<br /><br />The script is not just poetic, smart and beautiful, but believable and very, very moving. I can just imagine that this is exactly what happened to William Shakesphere, and how he got the ideas for Romeo and Juliet. The characters in this movie are developed so well. Even the more minor characters. There's also humor, which adds to the film greatly. The costumes were fantastic, especially the queens. I actually gotten a chance to see one of the gowns on display and the detail is spectacular. When I watch this film, I'm transported to another time and place and I'm happy to go there. This movie is a great example of what movies can be and should aspire to. Clearly I strongly recommend this film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This lady can really sing.   All of the songs on this DVD were wonderful, as I expected.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I won't repeat the storyline because it's described in the other reviews. I just wanted to add that this movie is creative genius. Cameron created a new world, and it was amazing. There was no time that I thought I was looking at CG. It was completely believable and magnificent. He created planets, plant and tree life like you've never imagined, mountains that float in the air that couldn't have looked more real if they were real, a species of people that are visually beautiful (different enough to be alien, but similar enough to us so that we can relate to them), with a culture, language, spiritual life, biology and behaviors all their own. It was spectacular from that perspective. With the 3-D, the audience gets to walk through the amazing new world and discover the wildlife and plant life along with the lead character. We even get to fly. Wow.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting was that the film didn't rely on old 3-D tricks.  As a matter of fact, I forgot I was watching a 3-D film, because everything was so natural and flowed.<br /><br />If I had one wish and could have contributed to this film, I would have asked for more emotional development between the main characters. In Cameron's Titanic, the audience feels the depth of the love and commitment between Rose and Jack in a way that moves you as far as I think a movie can. There is a love story in this movie, and it's done nicely. However having experienced what Cameron COULD create in Titanic, I think it could have been taken up a notch. I also think that perhaps Cameron could have used a litttle humor to draw in the audience more.  But I don't want to be too critical here, because I believe that this was a breakthrough movie that everyone should see.<br /><br />We saw it at an IMAX theater, and in my opinion this is the optimal way to see this movie. There's nothing like it, and it's indescribably different and better than seeing it in a regular theater.
B002Q9MZF6|2.0|I certainly agree withj the five star reviews that the singing is fantastic -- particularly in the second act.  But the very obvious lip-sinking of their own voices destroyes the enjoyment for me; as does much of the camera work.  The editorial states that the director of the film wanted to stay with Puccini -- but the ending of the first act is definitely not Puccini.  For these reasons I did not like the first act, but remained to the end.  The second act almost saved it and alone is worth watching.  The rest is dreadful.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Dance-punk is generally not my forte, but SOUND OF SILVER blows everything else in that genre out of the water! Murphy's music stems from the awesome tradition of art rock legends David Bowie and David Byrne as well as other krautrock and disco influences. Just as layered with percussion and synth lines as Talking Heads' masterpiece [[ASIN:B000002KO3 Remain in Light]], SOUND OF SILVER is a must-hear for fans of that album's danceable and dense sound.     GRADE: A (97%)
B002VH7P4O|5.0|If you appreciate deeper bass, heightened treble, and want to skip the trouble of ripping you will love this.  The FLAV files, which are also included, are richer than the MP3 files if you don't mind iTunes' inability to play them.  I will get hours of enjoyment from this perfect Christmas present.
1440471045|4.0|A lot in going on in this short novel by Hermann Hesse. Within Siddhartha's 153 pages, a volume of big concepts and ideas are illustrated and boiled down for everyone to see and understand.<br />You have the idea that everything is a grand illusion and that time isn't real.<br />You have Siddhartha following his own path to self knowledge and follow him on the way to discovery. This is perhaps the novel's best plot element.<br />You have Siddhartha's childhood friend, Govinda, who becomes a disciple of Buddha and yet missing the greatest ideal of all when he is older and supposedly more wiser.<br />You have Siddhartha using the river as a teacher to discover greater truths. The best part of the book was the fact that Govinda followed Buddha and choose that path. Siddhartha followed self knowledge and went through a period of being in a love relationship with Kamala, making money with a Merchant, and embracing gambling and followed that path with a period of self meditation before and after. These material gains and objects of desires did nothing to further educate Siddhartha and he didn't really grow as a human being until he met the simple Ferryman and observed him.<br />The Ferryman is uneducated yet he contains more wisdom then Siddhartha and Govinda combined.<br />The Ferryman has a simple life and a simple task and has learned to tune into the river and his surrounding environment to become Siddhartha's greatest teacher and lead him to a greater understanding.<br />It was only when Siddhartha joined the Ferryman and live in his hut that his truly realized spiritual growth occurred. It is interesting to me that all his meditation, thinking, loving Kamala, making money, gambling, only got Siddhartha so far. It took the simple and the mundane to kickstart his spiritual journey and river reflections.<br />This is a good book for today's reader with great concepts like learning to love one another. My only problem is, even though the book is short, some of the passages in the beginning and towards the middle slow the overall pace down. In fact, at one point I wasn't sure if I could finish reading because I got so bored during those sections. Once Siddhartha meets Kamala and when he teams up with the Ferryman, the book got better and the ending was good and not the let down it could have been. I knocked off one star for the numerous slow sections.s the middle slow the overall pace down.

B002KAJ0AO|1.0|Sooooo... I asked my husband to get me the CD for Christmas since I had not even heard about it until a few weeks ago. I would consider myself a huge fan, I have loved their music (and the band) since they first hit it big in Germany back in 1995/96. I have spent a lot of money on these guys and loved even the records that I did not find as good as their old stuff, but THIS is ridiculous!! I honestly did not expect to find any good reviews at all, this record is totally below anything that used to stand for the Backstreet Boys. It is extremely ironic that the record's title is \\"This Is Us\\" because frankly, I don't see any of the guys that I used to love so much.  They are trying to do an upbeat record that sounds more like \\"the stuff that's in the top 40\\" now some of these reviews say... REALLY? Because they completely failed!! The beats on this (and the last, by the way) record are so terrible, they sound like some 80s fitness studio came up with them on their home computer! And I do not get the whole synthesizing their voices in EVERY song because that is what made them stand out - their vocal talent. Can't hear much of it on this one, sorry guys, you have disappointed me greatly, and I can only hope that (if there will be a next album) you go back to your roots and keep it simple - that is what you did best.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I bought the complete series because it dropped down to $114.99. I started watching the last few episodes and when I got to the second to last and last episodes, they wouldn't play! I'm lucky that I started at the end otherwise I might not have found that problem until months later. Since it was within 30 days, Amazon sent me a new one immediately. I didn't have to send the defective one back for a few weeks so I went through every disc to make sure there were no problems with this new set. There wasn't so I sent the defective one back. It would have been nice to get the perfect one first but everything is fine now. I recommend buying each season individually the day after Thanksgiving when they drop to less than $10 a season at other stores.
B0026P3G12|4.0|The magnificent voice of Susan Boyle is showcased in a very eclectic album.  I would give it 5 stars except that I did not totally relate to \\"Wild Horses.\\"  Her \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was as rich and thrilling as the Britain's got Talent one, and \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is just . . . GREAT.  It is well worth the money, and I hope to hear her on subsequent albums.  I want to listen to her rendition of \\"Memory\\" from \\"CATS\\" and I'd like to hear her sing \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\"  This first effort just whets my appetite for more, more, MORE.

0307454541|4.0|I thought this book was other but it turned to be the same as \\"Los hombres que no amaban a las mujeres\\". The English title is more appealing and I read the first half with doubts. I thought it would be a waste of time, but it turned to be very good.<br />When I finished I wanted to read more. So I went for the second novel of Stieg Larsson<br /><br />Parents should be careful before allowing youths to read this book since it has adult topics that can be sensitive
B0026P3G12|4.0|I've been taken by Ms. Boyle from the first time I saw and heard her on YouTube. This CD is a good showcase for her voice.  However, the CD's producer, Steve Mac, has some how found a way to overly restrain that wonderfully powerful voice.  Mac should have allowed Ms. Boyle to let go and belt it out, as she did, under her own direction, on her town hall performance.  I hope Ms. Boyle takes these remarks as a statement of this listener's belief in her, personally.  Sometimes a singer knows their own style best and this is the case with Ms. Boyle.  She is encouraged to take a lead role in the production of her next outing.    Technically the CD is top notch.  One last criticism.  The chorus on Silent Night is way to strong and crass.  It is out of place.
B002TF53DI|5.0|i heard of florence from my english girlfriend. she showed me the rabbit heart song. kinda liked it and for some reason, i started browsing her songs on youtube and i started liking most of her songs. eventually falling in love with it.    so i bought this deluxe cd/dvd set. most of the songs are really amazing. she has a really beautiful voice. i don't think anyone would regret buying her cd. i don't really know what or how to explain it but if you like a fine frenzy, you'd love this too. only difference is that florence is louder. more of a renaissance feel. expect harps, piano and drums like huge drums in most of her songs. her lyrics are beautiful too. mostly about... hmm... like guilty stuff? you can tell by just reading some of her song titles. and i'm pretty sure you know why she called her cd \\"lungs\\".    by the way, i love the dvd, it's so clear. or maybe it's just 'cause i play it on bluray. :) but yea. florence is awesome. :)
B0030C8D0O|4.0|While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the \\"King of Pop\\". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.<br /><br />The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.<br /><br />Overall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.

B000SJJCX4|1.0|I bought this thinking it would be a cheap (but comparable) alternative to the more expensive BOSS chromatic tuner.  Once I received it however, i found it almost completely useless.  I can literally strum on a string and watch the tuner sit there doing nothing while occasionally realizing a note is played.  This is especially the case for the low E string.  The only positive thing I can say is that if you have a good 2-3 minutes to tune your guitar this will get the job done.  If you need a tuner to use in a performance setting - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I would recommend the KORG or BOSS alternative greatly.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|What can I say that a fan wouldn't already know and agree with?  This is a great portrayal of how Logan became the hard, yet morally true, badass that has been a phenomenon for Marvel.  Now, the truists out there will say, with all support from me and all the other true fans out there, that the movie doesn't truly and faithfully follow the original story of Wolverine.  Yep, absolutely correct.  I am a firm believer in artistic license, however, especially when it is excercised with the enthusiastic approval of Stan Lee, one of the gods of the genre.  This is why I forgive the glaring lapses in content, lost in the translation to the different medium and find that I enjoy and re-watch this film.<br /><br />The BluRay format is awesome, although my TV is a dated 1080i max resolution and 60Hz refresh rate.  I can only imagine how much more awesome the experience would be for this film, as well as all my other BRD's, with a more modern display.

0307278255|5.0|When I finished the first story in this collection, I knew I was in the hands of a master short story writer. In just 55 or so pages, Jhumpa Lahiri tells the story of Ruma's father visiting her new home in Seattle for the first time. But in the course of those 55 pages, I felt like I received a fully realized view into Ruma and her father's past, present and future. I was stunned how Jhumpa Lahiri was able to fit so much into the story--Ruma's relationship with her mother and her grief for her unexpected death, the state of Ruma's marriage to her husband Adam, her father's new relationship with a woman, the family's dynamics growing up, the loneliness of being a mother in a strange new city. Yet the story never felt rushed, forced or jumbled; it unfolds naturally and eloquently. Each little detail is presented when it should be and gives you another piece to Ruma and her father. At the end, each little piece becomes part of a fully-formed mosaic--complete, colorful, shining and whole.<br /><br />And Jhumpa Lahiri's skill continued with the rest of the stories. Each one had the same sense of wholeness and completeness to it. At the end of each story, I felt full and satisfied--never wanting more, never needing more. Each story was a perfect fully formed pearl.<br /><br />The book itself is divided into two parts. Part One has five separate \\"stand alone\\" stories. Part Two, which is called \\"Hema and Kaushik,\\" has three stories--one for Hema, one for Kaushik, and one that brings them together.<br /><br />Although each story has its own feel and characters, Lahiri returns to and touches on similar themes in each story that tie the collection together as a whole. The experience of being an immigrant and coming from India to America is a common thread (specifically, a Bengali Indian). Marriage--arranged marriages vs. \\"chosen\\" marriages--is a theme that runs throughout each story. The \\"Americanization\\" of Indian children and parents is yet another recurring thread. In addition, Lahiri uses Cambridge, Massachusetts as the setting for several of the stories.<br /><br />Yet even though you might accurately call this collection \\"an examination of the Indian immigrant experience,\\" the truths and emotions of these characters are universal. I felt connected to each of Lahiri's characters. I recognized facets of my life in their lives. I heard my thoughts in their thoughts. I saw myself reflected in them. Although our culture, upbringing, location and families might be different, Jhumpa Lahiri's characters spoke to me and it rang true.<br /><br />The story that most affected me was the third Hema and Kaushik story, \\"Going Ashore.\\" This was a masterful piece of storytelling, and the ending just wrenched my heart out. The very last sentence of the story is so simple and stark yet reading it brought tears to my eyes, and I felt my heart ache a little bit.<br /><br />If you have prejudices against short stories like I did, do yourself a favor and read Unaccustomed Earth. To me, these stories are perfect examples of what you can do with the short story form. I know that they will be the standard by which I judge all other short story collections in the future--and the bar has been set exceedingly high.ge, Massachusetts as the setting for several of the stories.

B002P5XXR0|5.0|There are some reviews that say this is the best soundtrack since Titanic. Then there are others that say this soundtrack is to \\"Titanici\\". So I say that anyone who says such things are so off the mark that they likely know little about musical scores. I won't go into the details of how this score vastly differs from that of Titanic but there has been many epic scores by various artist that at least meets the technical quality of this score. By the way, when I say technical, I mean the actual complex usage of music theory in the writing of this score. Steve J's-Transformers(1st score), Michael G's-Ratatouille, Hans Z's-King Arthur and Chris T's and Michael G's collaboration on the second of the Mercenaries (video game) score, just to mention a few, are the only scores that have managed to create a unique but in many ways overbearing relationship of percussion based instruments with string or even brass instruments. What do I mean? Simply put, in these scores, with the exception of Ratatouille, the percussion family is prominently featured in these albums. For a near perfect example of such, listen to the second album of Mercenaries. Why is this so important. Time after time after time, in modern based scores, the percussion based instruments are usually never featured, in fact they tend to be drowned out by the strings or those blaring brass instruments. Avatar does just that. James H manages to feature the percussion instruments a little more and thus adds a feeling of panic at times starting from track 5 till the end. This score is very well done and not rushed. Perfect balance of many instruments. A definite must buy. ***Listening suggestion*** I strongly suggest that anyone buying this score or any of the ones that I suggested-you buy the physical disc. By doing this, you can import the music at 320kbps or VBR320kbps. Why is this important. All the scores that I mentioned in this review have very complex instrumentation that if listened to on standard import rates, you would be missing a lot. Of course if you import this album using itunes at my suggested rate, you would need a pair of headphones that can appropriately transmit such quality. Might I biasely suggest the Shure SE420's or higher. I own these headphones and they do a great job with this. However, if you can't afford such a high priced item, look around and see if you can find appropriate headphones that would do the job and is in your price range. Hope you enjoy listening to this wonderful music.

0143038419|5.0|So I realize I'm a bit late to the party on reviewing Eat, Pray, Love which has been out quite some time.  I believe some books grab you at a time when you need a pick-me-up and perhaps that is why I was moved to finally read this novel I had heard so many mixed reviews about.    I'd like to start off by saying it takes guts to bear your soul in a book like this and am surprised so many dislike it, but to each his/her own.  I found the soul-bearing nature of Gilbert's writing to be moving and refreshing.    I really enjoyed the details of travel, especially in Italy, and felt the toughness of the routine in India and then reflective on the Indonesia experience.  I can't wait to read her next novel, Committed, which seems to continue from where Eat, Pray, Love has left off.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Wow!! What a great Blu Ray transfer!  I'll get to that in a minute, I want to talk about the movie.<br /><br />What a fantastic movie! I didn't know anything about Iron Man, and didn't know what to expect. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did!  This movie has some very nice plot twists that will keep the viewer engaged.<br /><br />The movie is about a super smart guy, Tony Stark, who has enough money to be the typical playboy. He has a solid work ethic that has abled him to live the life that he lives and love so much.<br /><br />He's in Afghanistan taking a joy ride with the US Tropps, when all of a sudden his  humvee  his hit with weapons, weapons that he and his company made. He's taken POW and the baddies want him to make his super secret, super nasty weapon for themselves.  He works pretty much by himself (he has a couple of people helping him) by he's not making the weapon, but making a crude \\"iron man\\" to make his escape. He does that, then when he's back home he decides to close down the weapons part of his business. Not everyone is pleased. Tony then take all of his drive and energy and makes \\"Iron Man\\" and uses it against the people that held him hostage. Again, not everyone in the US Government is happy with him.  That's all I really want to say on the plot.<br /><br />This movie has a lot of strengths to it.  I love the way Downey has portrayed Tony Stark.  He gives Stark a lot of charm and depth that we can't help to love.  I honestly didn't think that Downey could pull of the character of Tony Stark, and I'm pleased to say that I was wrong. Downey does a fantastic job!<br /><br />This has some pretty neat plot twists. I don't want to say what they are, but they're very nice and will keep you glued to the movie.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is fantastic! The transfer is beautiful.  It has crystal clear images and very life like. A few times I was floored by what I saw. It was that good. The sound is outstanding. It will give the viewer the experience as if they're really there. Nice job. I loved all of the extras to it.<br /><br />****SPOILER START*****<br /><br />There is just one thing that keeps me from giving Iron Man 5 stars. It's the ending. I really didn't like it at all. I mean, Stark told the media, \\"I am Iron Man.\\" What?!  Why would he do that? He had someone write for him some alibis to prove he wasn't where Iron Man was. It was all set, so why would he tell who he really is? I was just stunned by what he did.<br /><br />****SPOILER END*****<br /><br />Over all, I'd say get this movie and add it to your blu ray collection. It has great visuals, great sound, great extras, wonderful story and  a great plot.  You need to add this to your collection. I can promise you, you won't be sorry. I know I wasn't.l of the extras to it.    ****SPOILER START*****    There is just one thing that keeps me from giving Iron Man 5 stars. It's the ending. I really didn't like it at all.

0385504225|1.0|I read this book in one continuous session - finished reading it at 5 o'clock in the morning.  I am a huge fan of all previous Dan Brown's works, as they were fairly well-written, sophisticated, and entertaining reads, with believable and reasonably well developed characters.  Somehow, for me, \\"Lost Symbol\\" was also impossible to put down.  A page-turner? Apparently, when nothing makes sense, it may resemble a puzzle. In reality, this book as a well-disguised pile of trash, rigmarole, and hallucinatory almost sick fantasizing on religion, history, and mysticism.     I regret buying and reading this book and would not recommend it even to the most faithful Dan Brown's fans.  No matter how much you may have loved \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Daemons\\", chances are, \\"Lost Symbol\\" will hugely disappoint you.      First, most characters are bleak, weak, undeveloped, and their motives and actions are poorly substantiated and rather irrational. Robert Langdon's character is so boring that it is difficult for the reader to feel for him or to care about his ordeals.  Moreover, the plot becomes utterly ridiculous at times. For example, I can't believe a person who has just lost a quart of blood, a person who nearly drowned, and a person whose hand was cut off several hours ago may engage in a long in-depth conversation on historical and philosophical matters while running for their lives several hundred steps up and down the stairs.      Second, the plot concept is so far-fetched and overloaded that the characters had to engage in numerous several-pages-long conversations to provide the reader with sufficient information about particular aspects of masonic history, legends, etc.  Without these history lectures inserted into the text to assist the reader in plot comprehension, reading simply cannot continue.      Third, towards the end, the ritualistic elements overwhelm the plot, and the story becomes completely idiotic and unbelievable.  The reader continues mainly in fading hope of eventually being able to make order out of increasingly chaotic mess of historic facts, legends, and sick fantasy.   Yet, the ending is so bad and anticlimactic that I felt intellectually insulted.      Strongly not recommended even to those who consider \\"Da Vinci Code\\" to be a masterpiece.  Dear Hollywood, please, don't bother with a movie version of this crap.

I do believe that some better use of the surround sound capabilities could have been utilized, still it is a powerful production and cinematography. As expected, Netrebko and Villazon are great in their music and acting. This is not for those wanting a classical staged production, but for those who want to love the music and be moved by this super romantic couple.<br /><br />I can only hope more productions will innovate and explore technology to make great opera art.
1595141715|5.0|When my ten year old daughter brought this home from her school library, I was a little concerned that the subject matter would be a little intense for her at this age.  So, I asked her to hold off reading until I had a chance to read it first.  I stayed up until I finished it.  I was right, it certainly is too intense for a ten year old, however... I will be buying the book to keep at home until I feel she is ready for it and will use it as an opportunity to talk to her about so many of the things that this book addresses.      (I will also be talking to our school librarian to find out how I can prevent this kind of material from going home with my child in the future.  I am not a book-burner, far from it, in fact.  But this book should not have gone home with a fourth grader.  Sixth grader, maybe, but fourth grader? No way.)    All that said, if you are a teen or parent (of any age child), you NEED to read this book.  Are you a parent of a teen? Read this then give it to your teen and TALK ABOUT IT.  Are you a teen? Read this then give it to your parent and TALK ABOUT IT.
B002SJIO54|3.0|This film had a great deal of potential and in many respects was quite good.  Loved the premise and setting, hated the style and nonsensical elements.  I thought the main character was handled poorly in fact most of the human elements were poorly done.  The aliens were well done as well as the CG.  A better and more engaging cast/characters would have made this film a must see.  I found nothing engaging about this film other than one alien and his child (6 min. total)  My grandpa should get in the movie business, theres a man that knows how to tell a story to all demographics.
B002R0F3Q2|2.0|I must say, I was very excited when Alicia Keys anounced her new album drop. I went to her As I Am tour and was blown away! She has always been my favorite R&B artist because she normally puts out quality music. Unfortunently, this album does not depict the \\"true\\" Alicia. It's commercial sound has got me baffled as to why she would let whoever she did influence her to go mainstream.<br /><br />There are actually two songs I like, Doesn't Mean Anything and That's How Strong My Love Is. I honestly don't know what she was thinking by doing a collabo with Beyonce/Sasha Fierce because that song is so WACK, watered-down, typical mainstream pop crap.<br /><br />Although the album wasn't complete garbage, I sure do hope Ms. Keys will come back into her own and satisfy her true fans and herself for that matter!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This will be brief.    Movie was pathetic, I lost two hours of my life.    The End.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What can I say?  With all the glitz, drama, screeching, overproduction--on and on--this is welcome change.  If you want to dance on the ceiling she isn't for you, but if you want to sit, relax, and dream a little--chill--Susan Boyle will do that for you. But only after you listen to the album the first time--that's when her gentle, crystal clear voice blows you away.  It's not often that I am shocked and smiling in the same sentence--and then I just want to listen, and listen, and listen.  I have played this for anyone who has come to the house and each has said \\"I have to get that\\".  You go gal!!
B002BFBAWO|1.0|This is a movie about a boy with a high school crush. It is not a comedy! If you want to watch a great teen comedy watch John Tucker Must Die. This movie should not be listed as a comedy.
1401323820|5.0|If you are a fan of the television show Castle, you'll love this book. Well written, it captures the witty banter of the show yet offers a different perspective than the tv series because it is written with the voice of the Castle character from the series not the writer(s) of the show. The book sizzles with fun and wit.
B000J0OANO|5.0|We've owned this game for many years.  It's a real favorite for us.  It's for up to 6 people.  It's trivia type questions, but the strategy is different because all the answers are letters/abbreviations or numbers, where whoever is closest and first gets the point.  And it's whoever's paddle slaps to the middle first, but you could be last but \\"most\\" correct.  Because someone usually gets a point, the game moves along and when we have company even people who dislike trivia will have a great time.  I should say sometimes the rubber bands that flip the paddles wear out, and at different rates.  Hasn't bothered us any, and we hardly ever replace them.  But some people may get annoyed.  You just replace them with regular rubber bands    Our other favorite part of the game is the personal questions, of which there are usually one or two per card.  For example, \\"how many times have I...\\" whatever the question is.  That way you learn about the other players.  We don't always get out games for company, but when we do this one often tops the list because it's easy to play, fairly fast, personal and has the right blend of knowledge and laughs/stories.    The only thing we'd like to see is an updated version.  The version we have has some questions that are no longer true.    Highly recommend just the same.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|When listening to the albums of Coldplay, I always get the feeling that they seem to aim for a profound and poetic meaning that the band never quite achieves. This remains true for Viva la Vida. Even though their new album is more structured and coherent than the previous ones, the uplifting spirit and positivism of the songs hasn't changed.   Not that there is anything wrong with this, I even consider it the band's strongest trait, but the songs could benefit from better lyric writing and more original themes. Some of the lyrics are just plain corny, such as 'you thought you might be a ghost, you didn't get to heaven but you made it close' or 'if you love me, won't you let me go'. Chris Martin's high pitched voice doesn't really help. It's a pity that the band doesn't experiment more in this area, since the instruments and structure of Viva la Vida is greatly improved and more original compared to X&Y.   However, it's hard not to smile when hearing 'strawberry swing', 'viva la vida' or 'lovers in Japan'. They are just that dreamy and uplifting. I hope that the band experiments further for their next album, while keeping their warm essence in tact. So that the next album will not only benefit from an interesting inspiration, nice coverwork or great costumes, but also from original music.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I recently purchased from Amazon.Com, the CD by Susan Boyle, \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\".  My order was processed immediately, and I received my CD within days.  Amazon.Com's price for the CD, was just as amazing as the music!  Thanks Amazon.Com!
0143117807|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B000001EAQ|3.0|Never really liked this album.  But there are some good songs here including \\"Gone\\", \\"please\\", \\"if god will send his angels\\", \\"wake up dead man\\" and \\"staring at the sun\\".  But I can't play discoteque without out laughing.  And I am forced to skip over \\"the playboy mansion\\", \\"miami\\", \\"do you feel loved\\".  Lot of better albums out there.
B00169N0BK|5.0|After seeing all the really expensive colorimeters out there, an artist friend of mine recommended the ColorMunki. It's super easy to calibrate my monitors! I calibrated my overhead projector, and I couldn't believe the difference in the color accuracy of my projector, yay!' Definitely worth the money!
B002VH7P4O|1.0|I got this at Best Buy for a gift.  The USB wouldn't come out of the apple holder.  The little stem broke trying to get it out.  I'm returning it...hopefully for one that works.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is one of the most amazing CD's I've heard in a long time and three cheers for Susan Boyle. I love the wide variety of songs she chose to sing, they showcase her incredibly full vocal range. Her voice is that of a much younger women in some songs and has all the emotion of someone who has lived a very long time. I must have listened to this CD at least 20 times now and It still gives me goosebumps when she hits certain notes. I want Susan to come out with 10 more CD's NOW. I can't get enough.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|i was walking through a bookstore one day when along the young adult section, ther was a postit saying &#34;if you liked the twilight saga then sink your teeth into this one!&#34; that is exactly what i did being a huge fan of twilight. this book was very well written. narrated by zoey a typical teen of native american descent full of magic. when she is &#34;chosen&#34; a whole newwold is opened up to her. the world of vampyres. she meets nefret and stevie rae and many others.   i found this book to be very good. my reasons? unique which is what i love. the authors of this book created such a new world, one which even i wish i could have becomea part of. the romance and intriguing love triangle. it was just great...  if you loved twilight this is most definitley the book for you!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has a great voice.  I wish there were some more interesting songs to listen to.
0756656230|5.0|Fun, informational, beautifully done pictures and descriptions. Easy to read, understand and share. My son has spent hours reviewing the info in this book and sharing what he has learned with us and his friends.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|I saw this film when it was playing in the movies. I enjoyed it so I thought my daughter would like it as a gift. She is away at college and they frequently watch movies in their down time.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just listened to this CD for the first time, after receiving it as a Christmas gift. Let me say first that Neither I nor anyone else in my family is musically inclined.  Therefore, I cannot comment on whether her voice is \\"amaturish\\", her vibrato or tremulo or whatever it is correctly called is perfect or not.  All I know is that I love her voice.    But what really inspired me to review this CD is that she managed to capture the attention of my two children, ages 10 and 13.  They are very much infatuated with the pop singers who are all the rage among their peers, and they have never before shown interest in this kind of music.  Both were mesmerized (as I am) by the hauntingly beautiful \\"Wild Horses\\", and began asking questions about Boyle: \\"How old is she?  I thought she was supposed to be old, but her voice sounds so young.\\"  Everyone in the family is now humming the song to themselves, as we prepare for Christmas Dinner.      The other songs did not grip us as tightly, but if Boyle can reach my kids with even one song, that alone is a remarkable accomplishment worthy of 5 stars.
0307454541|4.0|Very good crime / mystery adventure. The fact that it takes place<br />in Sweeden with all of the cultural twists that most of us are not<br />acquainted with adds dimention. The story telling is a bit repetitive<br />and therefore the story is longer than it needs to be which I think is<br />what makes it very good but not excellent.<br />The theme on the abuse of woman gives the over all story more significance<br />and is well taken. I highly recommend this book as a great light read.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|This is a great live, greatest hits set.  The band is great, he sounds good, the crowd loves it, and everything you'd want to hear is included.  The DVD beats the CD hands down, and go hunting for the deluxe version with the free show from the front of the Ed Sullivan Theater in NYC on a bonus DVD.
B002K74HJG|2.0|Product is a bootleg,  it has never been issued on VHS or DVD legally.  Buyer be warned of what your getting.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I thought i had already reviewed this.  The cd shipped quickly, was in perfect condition (sealed - brand new) and I absolutely love it.  No problems whatsoever.  I would highly recommend this seller.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|I think many people have touched on the fact that this should be looked at more of a Roger Water solo project, however, I think it's important to take note of that very important fact. If you go into this thinking it's going to sound like classic Floyd you're going to be let down. However, if you go into it with an open mind you will be stunned by songs that are contained within it. The writing here is absolutely beautiful and if this is the first Waters album it is undoubtedly the best thing he did. The ongoing themes give the whole thing a continuity that makes this truly an album. This is not a collection of songs but a collective statement.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Received the CD yesterday and I listened to it over and over again.  Love her voice when I first saw her on TV.  Glad that I can play her music over and over again.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this season it is really good! And I did read the books and I still really liked them.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am one of the millions who waited patiently for this CD to be released. If you love music, you'll love \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" by Susan Boyle. She sings a marvelous variety of songs. Her sincerity and audible humility make her songs very emotional and soul stirring. Bravo Susan Boyle! This CD is, and was, well worth the wait.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I Dreamed A Dream is a fantastic cd from this newly discovered talent.  What a Cinderella story.  Couldn't wish it to a nicer person.  Her voice will give you goosebumps.  Can't wait until she does another cd.
0385504225|1.0|But this book was terribad.   I read all the way to the last chapter just to see if it would improve at all towards the end but it did not.  I took a break from this book and had absolutely no desire to come back to it (I did, mostly just so I could tell people to avoid it with some credibility). Beginning was bad, plot development was bad, character development was terrible and the end was terribad.  Save yourself from this book, Thanks.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle will probably never \\"make it big\\", because the pressures are too great.  I think this is a good thing for her.  She has a beautiful voice not heard since \\"Kate Smith\\".  Most young folks don't know Kate Smith and that is too bad.  Susan could almost outsing her.  This CD is wonderfully made with some songs that could be improved upon just a little with a little redirection.  I look forward to her second CD actually.  This CD arrived as stated and in a very timely manner.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Ok, the movie is fun, and it's characters are spot on for the characters we have learn to love and see from countless reruns, movie releases, and of course, DVD packages.  I was slightly disappointed that Sulu's character was played by a non-Japanese.  Something for the 21st Century that still amazes me, (sort of like seeing Caucasian actor's play Native-American Indians, or Jewish-White vaudevillian's putting on the dark face comedy routines...unsavory).  I also couldn't understand the emotional relationship between Uhura and Spock, or the film's conclusion of Spock's mother...all which makes it disconnected from the original series and Gene Roddenberry's creation.  I cannot forgive the director and screenplay writer for taking such liberties (not casting a Japanese actor to play Sulu, Spocks response to Uhura (especially the transporter scene).  Overall, I give this movie a 3 because it is entertaining but not your father's Star Trek.
076532413X|4.0|I read a few reviews which panned the book for its writing or the slow pace of the story.  I am not seeing why some of the reviewers felt that way.  I read it and enjoyed the questions it asked.  Essentially, if you had a glimpse of the future, what would you do?  How would it change you.  I think the book asks an essential question which has been pondered by humanity for much of our existence.    That said, the writing was at times a little clumsy.  Did it detract from the story?  Not especially in my opinion.  I believe that I enjoyed the book for what it was: a decent piece of literature.  It will never be the next classic that will be read in literature classes across the nation.  It will provide you with a good bit of reading and was worth the price of the book.
B00018D44U|3.0|A good album and shows her versatility, but a little too country for me.  I prefer the jazz overtones and harmonies.
0316143472|2.0|To be blunt, I was disappointed. When you have reviews that describe Sedaris and this work as \\"All hail the king of comedy\\" (Sunday Times - London), \\"I sound like a laugh track\\" (Arizona Republic), \\"still make me laugh harder than anyone I've ever read\\" (Newsday), you expect more.<br /><br />While I can't say that it was boring, it was only lightly entertaining. The reviewers were spot on when they describe his humor as \\"dead-pan delivery\\" (Boston Globe). The often blase, wry, and subtle humor was more on the line of the highbrow or elitist humor that I experienced in the chic areas of metro cities. If you like upper-class New York City style humor, then you will probably enjoy it. A good number of the essays read like the meandering rants found on mediocre blogs where the writer suddenly realizes he needs to give it purpose and so tacks a few pedantic platitudes on the end. It's not all bad, the essays I found most amusing (such as \\"Adult Figures Charging Toward a Concrete Toadstool\\" and \\"Memento Mori\\") were those that seemed focused and the lessons on humanity's peculiarities were natural threads throughout.<br /><br />At first, I was surprised and impressed that he did not put his sexual orientation on exhibition as some gay authors do. Instead, Sedaris slowly brings it into the essays allowing it to come forward in the same way that a personality quirk would. As the book progressed, however, his gay lifestyle left its personality quirk status and evolved into, for lack of a better description, \\"look at me, I'm GAY!\\" punchlines that I find annoying and degrading to the work.<br /><br />I regret to say, that I feel much of the praise and hype around this book seems to be because of its appeal to the elitist urbanite and the promotion of an author because he is gay (rather than promoting a gay author because he is a good writer).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  24 kids have to enter the Hunger Games.  23 are destined to die.  There is a lot of suspense because you don't know who is going to die or when.  Happy Hunger Games!
B000G7PNAE|5.0|I think that this album and Frontiers are the two best works Journey ever produced with their most recognized members of the band.  I would say original but then Steve Perry wasn't an original member.  This album and Frontiers contain an amazing number of hits and to me the songs that were not hits just as easily deserve a listen.  I believe that this album and Frontiers provide enough good music to both Journey and non-Journey fans as to be highly recommended.
0375836675|4.0|Markus Zusak really has a way with words. I had read his other book 'The Book Thief' prior to reading this one, and I really enjoyed that one as well.  The story was gripping and beautiful...and the author has a way of just completely submerging you into Ed's world. It really made me think about my own life, and there are so many good messages to take out of the book - the power that one person has to change others' lives, how the right thing to do isn't always the easiest, and you may not know people as well as you think.  There were only 2 things that bothered me about this book: it does have a lot of swearing and vulgar language, and the ending...I still haven't decided whether the ending is clever/brilliant or just plain bizarre. I'll leave it at that :)  Nevertheless, I recommend this book, if for no other reason than the author's writing style.
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I first heard Susan Boyle sing on TV, I said, if she ever puts out an album, I will buy it.....and did.  It is awesome.  She sings from her heart with all the feelings that you just know are real.  You relate, you feel the love, you feel the pain.  It is a CD I never tire of listening to and Amazon was right there with it in stock at a geat price.Hopefully \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" will be followed by many more beautiful albums.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|When I first heard that AIC was making another album, I couldn't have been more excited.  Granted one knows it would not be the same without Layne.  I saw them live well over a year before the album released and they are AMAZING, both live and on the new album.
B0000Y2XLA|5.0|I am not a big fan of No Doubt.  I am very familiar with their hits over the radio, but until I bought this CD I did not own any of their music.  I went through Amazon to purchase the import version of this CD because I could buy it for about the same price as the domestic version and the import version includes two additional tracks.  I find the collection of hits to be very good.  Being no expert on No Doubt I cannot level any complaints on missing tracks or about the inclusion of hits that others may find objectionable.  Sorry.  I am quite happy with the songs, the sound of the CD and my purchase of the import version.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD was one I was waiting for and was not disappointed, it was great. I will enjoy it for a long time.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These triggers are AWESOME! They snap right on, they stay in place, and are very comfortable. They do not affect the range of motion at all, are the PERFECT compliment to the controller, and at $5, are a steal. Definitely buy these, you will not be disappointed.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|This is a fantastic cd/dvd.I don't thnk Enya music videos have been available like this before on dvd.Every Enya fan needs to add this to their collection.
0061689246|4.0|This book has a lot of Neil Gaiman's signature writing. It is a wonderful tale filled with fantasy, good and evil, and even a little love. It has wonderful truths about human nature. It is a wonderful book!
B002XSP16A|5.0|As so many thousands, I was gobsmacked by Susan Boyle's appearance on the UK's Idol tv program a few months ago.  Mesmerized by her story, she became the ultimate duckling-to-swan example of dream-fulfillment.  Finding her debut album as the deal of the day on Christmas Day has been a gift straight from Amazon to me, and  I am a happy person.  Her voice is clear and true and comforting and peaceful.  Thanks, Amazon, for the delightful gift.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|Forever 5/5  Drake, Kanye and Wayne are outstanding but Em just comes in and has one of his best verses in years.     Hell Breaks Loose 3/5  Great beat by Dre, and the lyrics are on point but I was expecting a little more from this track. The hook is what kills it for me. Still a solid track.     Buffalo Bill 4/5  Accent is perfect for this beat. Em's flow is crazy but I'm just tired of him rapping about serial killers even though it's entertaining. Great track.     Elevator 5/5  Great hook, this is the Eminem I love, poking fun at people and just killing it lyrically. Nobody in the rap game can see this guy right now.     Taking My Ball 4/5  A bouncy track, sounds like a first single on one of Em's albums. Much better than We Made You. Don't let the sound of this track fool you, his wordplay is crazy and it has a very catchy hook.     Music Box 5/5  My personal favorite on Refill. Great intro and Em kills it from start to finish, and the beat is on point. Love this song, one of Em's best in a very long time. He's rapping in his normal voice and he sounds hungry.    Drop The Bomb On Em' 5/5  This song could replace Music Box as my favorite on the album because this song is just raw. This beat sounds like its from the Chronic 2001 album and Em just murders the beat. Flow is insane and he is just telling every rapper in the game to watch out and beware because he's back and on top of his game.     I wish Em didn't put Taking My Ball and Forever on here because we all have these songs. But there still great tracks, and if your a huge Eminem stan you will pick up this album. He should of just put it out as an EP but Interscope just wants to make some money so they threw the original Relapse on there. This tracks are definitely not Relapse leftovers because every track on here would be standouts on Relapse. These tracks are definitely tracks that were slated to appear on Relapse 2 but since Em re-did Relapse 2 he could afford to put them out. If songs like Elevator, DropThe Bomb On Em' and Music Box are getting cut from Relapse 2, Em must have something up his sleeve.     Relapse 2 will be a classic, trust me. \\"I want to make songs people can play a hundred, thousand times over\\"- Eminem    Sounds like a man ready to make a perfect album.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|I bought \\"Legend\\" based on the raving comments it received here on Amazon. What a big mistake!     OK I hadn't seen it when I was a kid so I don't have any emotional connections with the movie, but what is there to like? A completely pointless story about good and evil (where the good guys are ignorant and evil guys are downright stupid) with horible songs (why, oh God, why are there songs?) and terrible acting (script is a nightmare, too). There is no grandeur you would expect in a fantasy movie. SFX are good for its time (yet I have seen a unicorn horn flopping on the poor horse's head) but can not make up for all the other shortcomings. When compared to such legends as The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth (even the Neverending Story is far better and it is really a kid's movie) from the same time which excel in several areas; this movie looks even worse.    I have this set so I own both the director's cut and the American version. I watched the director's cut but I am not going to waste 2 more hours of my life to watch the other version. Nothing can change the truth: This movie sucks.    Yes, I know thousands will find this comment \\"not helpful\\" but anyone who hasn't watched this movie should be duly  warned. Please first rent it and if you really like it (can't imagine why, but) then buy it.
B002UEW31I|5.0|This is not the history Channel! This is a \\"what if\\" Movie! My God.. It is one of the best, if not the best QT Films ever made....  Buy this DVD OR BLUE RAY. WONDERFUL! THANK YOU QT! OUTSTANDING!!! \\"A True Classic Here\\"  If Only WWII would have ended this way.. Well, you need to watch it to find out what I mean. The Bear Jew, I love it!  WT
B00003CX9W|3.0|Although there has been some ediing with the actual visual portion of Fantasia the dubbing of the narrator's voice ruins the vibe of the film. I understand portions of the original dialouge are missing (\\"newly discoved stuff\\") but at least give viewers an option. The new guys voice is nothing like the original. Imagine trying to dub Darth Vador or Yoda's voice? It would be a pretty bad idea. Disney please correct for blu-ray. There is no excuse for not correcting.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is such an amazing story. I was constantly in tears and stitches while reading, not to mention I coundn't put it down! The characters come alive and by the end you feel as if you have known them your entire life. This book is for anyone who needs a wonderful and genuine love story in their lives as well as a beautifully written tale of the messiness of humanity.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I did not like the CD as much as I thought I would. I understand she picked her own songs and that is fine. The producers groomed her and her voice to fit a mold they wanted rather than letting her sing more within her own range
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is one of the best gifted singers. In my opinion, she was the winner of the British Got Talent! Susan, Good luck with your dreams.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|This is the only blu-ray disc that I have ever had that will not play. The player I have is the slowest loader ever (Sony BDP-S300) so I just spent a half hour while it loaded previews then finally a screen with graphics and no play button multiple times. Then, it just sits on a black screen forever then says can't play. Man I wish HD-DVD had won. I never had a slow load with HD-DVD or any problems. The thing that sucks with sony as well is if your on a Mac they have to send you an update. Which means for me, buy another player just to see HD of district 9, or wait for an update to see if that works. Or, send the disc back. anyone else have problems? I will never buy another Sony blu-ray playr that's for sure.
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|I do not have the DVD but watched it on PBS, so I cannot comment on the DVD picture and sound quality. I agree with operamarty on the lip-syncing problems.    Both Rolando and Anna sing well. My biggest disappointment is the transposition lower of the \\"Che gelida manina\\" aria. Somewhere I read that a lot of tenors transpose lower to avoid singing the high C in the original score, singing B instead. Rolando also did not sing the act one final \\"amore amore\\" in same tone as the soprano, seemingly sang the harmony instead. I would think that with the recordings done in the studio, they should make the effort to sing the original with its high C's. It is not like you are taking risks in a live performance.    I watched the movie with a friend who is big opera fan. He did not notice the transposition of the aria. I noticed right away in the transition music from \\"cerce ..\\" to \\"Che gelida..\\". I am used to listening to the Gianni Raimondi DVD version which is sung in the original key. So the \\"Che gelida\\" in this movie does not sound quite right to my ear (my native lanquage is tonal, so I tend to notice these things). I still like the Karajan/Gianni Raimondi/Mirella Freni La Boheme DVD the best, despite its age. There is no compelling reason for me to buy this.

B002BSHXJA|3.0|I just wanna know why the mono box costs so much more than the stereo box set! The stereo box has more discs in it!! Hmmmmmmmmmmm......I bought the stereo set in the Box Of Vision set....but I am thinking of buying the mono box just to have it! Guess I will shop around after the holidays to get a better price!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Absolutely wonderful soundtrack, really immerses you in the emotions of the movie. I actually liked the soundtrack on it's own much more than in the movie, for some reason.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Nice to see Susan Boyle's interest in music is so wide-range.  Can hardly wait for what comes next!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|sorry to say but i actually expected better. it was a fast easy read though.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I say ditto to these fine comments:        I purchased this controller to have a second controller for my PS3 to take on my friends.   It may be a small thing but ording this controller for the price it doesn't come with the USB cabel to charge the batteries.   May not be much but when it's promoted as:   \\"Can be charged at any time through the PlayStation 3 system using the controller's USB cable.\\"     It's a bit 'CHEAP' Sony can't include another USB cable for $50+   Kind of like selling a $500 Playstation with only one controller in the first place.    Seriously? This thing doesn't come with a cord?! Thank you, Sony for finding a new source of revenue. And a special shout out to Amazon for never mentioning that THIS THING DOESN'T COME WITH A CORD. A USB cord is never even featured in the \\"Accessories\\" or \\"Buy With\\" or \\"Customers Also Bought\\" sections. Thanks a million.        My review focuses on only one aspect: Sony's self-destructive exploitation of its customer base.     Imagine paying nearly $50 for a game controller which contains a battery rechargeable only through a mini-USB port.     Now imagine a manufacturer so grasping, so greedy that they don't include a charging cable in the package with this $50 controller.     Imagine all that and you have the one of the answers to why, with its vastly superior technology, Sony's Playstation 3 is a distant third in the game console market.     Customers really don't like to be gouged.     Almost $50 for a game controller with no truly outstanding features, a controller that requires a cable for recharging. A cable that would cost Sony only pennies . . . and they don't include it because they want to extract a few more dollars from their customers.         Sony Sucks....and Amazon should be ashamed for playing along
B000001EXR|5.0|Carnival Of Souls is one of those controversial Kiss albums. While some reviewers have tried hard to link Soundgarden or the grunge movement and even Led Zeppelin's largely acoustic third album to this, the bottom line is that they are just terribly missing the point.     Recorded late 1995 in Hollywood and co-produced by Toby Wright and Gene Simmons/Paul Stanley just after the Unplugged session which eventually reunited the original Kiss lineup, this was a huge step forward from the more accessible and commercial Revenge. I myself bought it upon its release in 1997 and kind of refused it first time around and was so disgusted by that new Kiss sound I even swapped it a few days later saying to myself \\"this ain't Kiss!\\" But then about three years later I was given another chance at a friend's house who said it was excellent. I was suspicious to say the least but got greatly surprised and definitely hooked from the moment Hate kicked in. Then when Paul went \\"I think it's gonna rain!\\" I was like \\"God, that was great! How did I miss that???\\" So I dutifully bought it again as quick as I could and there it was: a fantastic, overlooked Kiss gem! It just had to be sort of unlocked. Very rooted, much darker but clearly forward looking. And though the Stanley-Simmons-Kulick-Singer line-up worked hard to update the Kiss sound, this is no grunge Kiss at all. I just don't buy all this hype... Kiss' roots go way before and beyond all that.    Bruce Kulick's input is much stronger and he sounds as if he's matured enough so there's not too much flash here as he's more focused on the riffs and grooves he lays down so well throughout the album. And the closer I Walk Alone written by him and Simmons offers his debut as a lead singer in Kiss which is something he managed to do quite well. But it's when Gene joins him at the end what makes the song a real winner. Eric Singer does what he does best which is to play in his style and definitely adds to it. Paul and Gene are in top form andtheir voices sound truly amazing. They've also managed to create much better lyrics here, full of interesting insights and thankfully far from the worn out cheap obscenities they seem to like. There isn't a single bad song on this album and even the slow one I Will Be There is a hauntingly tasteful acoustic number sung beautifully by Paul. The only Kiss album I can think of which is as different and daring as Carnival Of Souls is Music From The Elder.    In this year of Sonic Boom where songs borrow way too much from the seventies unsuccessfully and Kiss has become so controlled and predictable, Carnival Of Souls stands honest and strong alongside the Kiss catalogue. Had Kiss not stopped this in favour of the worthy but ultimately fruitless Reunion years - Psycho Circus is sadly not a legitimate classic Kiss line-up album as we all know by now - it would've been interesting to see where this could've taken this band.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I don't know what most of the other reviewers are talking about.  These Blu-ray discs look great!  They represent a huge improvement in picture quality over the previous DVD releases.  I was wary about purchasing this set because of some of the negative reviews, but I'm glad that I did.  I recommend this set to any Rocky fan.  These films have never looked better.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|My review is simple and to the point; I love movies like these to start with and found this movie to be fun, full of action and it delivered the intertainment I was looking for today.  Also watching it on \\"video on demand\\" for $2.99 was not bad at all.
B001HN697M|4.0|This actually should have been the first in the 3 Underworld movies. This one tells the story of how Lucian (Michael Sheen) was born and rises to power as the werewolf leader. It also tells the story of Sonja (Victor's daughter played by Rhona Mitra)and how she ends up being executed vampire style, at her fathers order. This is the main story line and is what started the vampire vs. werewolf war in the first place. Sonja is the reason Victor spared Selens's life (in the first movie)because she reminded him of his daughter. The story line and special effects are great. It really doesn't matter which order you watch the Underworld trilogy in. All three movies are entertaining. Especially so if you're into the werewolf/vampire thing.

B002SJIO5E|3.0|I went to the movie and liked it very much. It was the best SciFi of the year, superior to Startrek or Terminator. To my astonishment a lot of scenes were cut out in the BD version. The small child alien actually directs the war robot, but this scene is cut out. This really makes the movie not as good as the theatrical version, a bad commercial descision. I would recommend don't buy and wait for the extended version...
1594488843|2.0|While there are some good points in this book, there are also plenty of bad ones, and the irrationality will frustrate rational readers.  Some examples:<br /><br />- The book references studies where subjects are paid (or not paid) bonuses to solve puzzles - a far cry from the situation where one is getting paid a bonus to do work one has trained for and enjoys.  I don't see how the results of one are a good proxy for the other.<br /><br />- The book suggests companies should assign individuals and groups \\"Goldilocks tasks\\" (those that are not too easy and not too hard).  I don't know many companies able to pick tasks that way - most successful companies have requirements dictated by the market.<br /><br />- It extrapolated experiment results that showed a drop in participation of blood donation *from those who were interested in donating blood for free* when they were offered compensation to say that moving toward a capitalistic market for blood would reduce supply.  This completely ignores the sampling problem - the fact that it would encourage people previously not interested in donating blood for free (and therefore excluded from the study) to give blood.<br /><br />- Despite mentioning early on an interesting result that indicated ethics was a strong motivational force, the book did not follow up on it at all.  The study showed that if two people were told that they could keep $10 if they would both agree to how it was divided, no one would accept under $2 (allowing the other to keep $8), even though they would still be coming out ahead ($1 is more than nothing).<br /><br />- From a big picture standpoint, the book argues that traditional management is destructive to flow, and yet it cites a finding that \\"people are much more likely to reach that flow state at work than in leisure\\" - clearly a contradiction.<br /><br />Overall the book tries to say that there is a major disconnect between what business does and what \\"science\\" knows. But the author never considers that business is actually *working* while those in the ivory tower are just theorizing, often in a vacuum.<br /><br />In terms of the valid points raised:<br />- people perform better when given some autonomy<br />- narrow goals tend to keep people focused on that often to the exclusion of what's really important<br />- people are often motivated by ethics<br /><br />All of these are addressed by Open-Book Management (best described in [[ASIN:0887308023 Open-Book Management: Coming Business Revolution, The]] by John Case).

B001OQCV60|1.0|Seldom have I seen a movie whose grasp was so much less than its reach.    This was shown at the Maui Film Festival's First Light on Dec. 23, and MFF's Barry Rivers said it was the first showing in North America. Be warned. It's coming to a theater near you.    First, at least a third of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and not only because of the London accents. Sherlock, especially, mumbles.     Whoever wrote this script either failed to get Sherlock Holmes or was deliberately standing Doyle on his head. Although in the Strand stories, Holmes occasionally displays a surprising strength, he uses his head, not his fists, to get results. Likewise, Watson is occasionally advised to \\"bring your pistol,\\" but as far as I can recollect, he never shoots it.    The authors show a considerable knowledge of the Holmes canon but no understanding of it (unless they are being intentionally perverse for mysterious reasons). \\"Across the Universe\\" two years ago showed what creative people could do by reworking the complete canon of other creative people. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" shows how people without any creative imagination can take a high canon and rework it as a Saturday morning cartoon,    Third, director Guy Ritchie cut this like a music video, and not a good one, either. It was akin to watching a waterbug on crack.    The only good thing I can find to say about this flick is that Rachel McAdams has very nice lips.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Just when you are about to give up on music and musicians, along comes Susan Boyle and sings her heart out with a wonderful and varied repertoire.  This is a remarkable voice and talent.  Thank you, Ms. Boyle - we needed you.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|The first time I heard several of the songs from this album on Pandora radio and I was immediately hooked.  I told a friend how much I loved the songs so he bought the album for me.  Since I've had it, I can't stop listening to it.  Simply gorgeous!!

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Like so many others, when I started watching this show, I thought it was kind of cool but boring. However, as I stuck with it, the story began to unfold, the characters began to develop, and it quickly became quite enthralling. There are endless possibilities with a story like this. The first season may start off slow, but if you keep watching you will become engrossed and will thoroughly enjoy the end of the season. Also, the second season starts off with quite the bang and makes you want to know what happens next. Walter Bishop is really starting to become one of my favorite characters on television right now. So, give it a chance. Unlike so many other shows, this show begins taking chances and acting in the interests of the characters and the story rather than the interests of the viewer. That makes it its own world and sets it apart from those shows that try and do nothing but appease the masses.

B000HBKCDC|4.0|This is not Sarah McLachlan's best album, and it is not the best Christmas album either, but it is pleasant listening.  Some of the song choices are a little bit strange, but she manages to bring them together with solid vocals.  That being said, I would probably opt to purchase the downloads for the songs I like rather than buying the entire album.

The action was great, the actors did a great job, all of them.  Especially Ed Harris, and Viggo Mortensen, two of my favorite actors.   I would recomend it to anyone.  The delivery time was short as usual.
0375842209|5.0|I love this book. I've loved The Book Thief ever since I read it first in 6th grade, and I've loved the adventure of reading it and getting something new every time. This book has a very, very confusing beginning which might turn some people away, but I beg of you - keep reading, you will get hooked and you will start to love it!     Who should read it: I wouldn't give this book to anyone below 6th grade - that's when I first read it, and though I didn't understand parts, I was a very advanced reader and loved it. I'd say that so many age groups would love this, though the target range is probably 13-17. Even if you're not in this range, though, give it a try!
B001FB562U|5.0|\\"The Road\\"(2009) is directed by John Hillcoat (The Proposition), and is based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. \\"The Road\\" is a grim tale that follows a father (Viggo Mortensen) and his son across a devastated landscape after some undisclosed calamity. As they are trying to make there way to the western coast of the U.S. they come across remnants of humanity. There is talk of cannibalism and other atrocities as people have been reduced to scavenging for bare necessities. The movie is exceedingly bleak, and grey. There is no life to speak of. We don't see birds, or any animals, only rag tag groups of people, some who viciously exploit any humans that they run across. It is a harrowing tale of the bond between a father and son as they cling to their humanity and  their precarious existence.
B002R68U7K|5.0|nice box set for anyone who missed out on previous singles that were released..  the only 2 downsides i found are..i think the singles should have had exactly the same amount of tracks that were originally released on the singles instead of just having 2 racks each and on the last single \\"3\\" there seems to be either a mis-print or a missing song..casue on the cover it states it has 3 songs yet on the cd it self and when u play it it only has 2 songs.    but regardles of all that...if your a Brintey Spears fan id recommend buying it for your collection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a very nice album.  The first song Susan Boyle sings is \\"Wild Horses\\".  It is hauntingly beautiful and shows off her wonderful voice.  I love the ease of ordering from Amazon, and I had a very short wait for delivery.

I am extremely happy i bought this item..worth every single cent!!!!
1607961423|1.0|The best part of this book was the vibrance of the cover.  Joseph Murphy uses case and metaphor to make his point of what is possible with the subconcious.  The assumption is that we are having negative experiences that need changing. Sounds like a winner well maybe a page or two and after that you start looking for the possitive.  I found it to be a rambling presentation and after having it in the house for a week will recycle it to a free bin.  It is one of the best cover presentations I have seen on this type of book and I hope who ever finds my copy loves it.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I am of the opinion that LOST is the best show on television, and season five does not disappoint. The show over the past couple of seasons had been revealing itself as the sci-fi/fantasy show that it is and here in season five we deal with time travel. Doesn't get much more sci-fi than that.     There are a lot of twists along the way and there were episodes that I marveled at how the writers manage to bring so many elements together so perfectly and satisfyingly. They've always been good at this but the fact that they maintained it with the addition of time travel is a bit of a miracle. I also applaud them for bringing themes back that they set up early on in season one at the end of this season. In fact, there's lots of things from the past couple of seasons that are answered at the end of this season. If the writers didn't have a plan for this series from the beginning, they've done a hell of a job tying it together.     If there is a slight failing of season five, its that the show was somewhat less character centered than the previous seasons. A lot of this is due to the change in storytelling in season five. Gone are the character-centric flashbacks/flashforwards. When the show flashes, it's flashing back/forward in time. Still, some characters like Locke and especially Sawyer are given a lot to do and have interesting arcs this season. But for the most part, a lot of the old favorites are in a holding pattern. For example, what does Sun do in this season? Jack in particular is passive and almost unlikable for most of the season. There's also a fair bit of story/character motivations that hang on Jack and Sawyer being in love with Kate, and that didn't work for me. It seemed a bit lazy and unearned. The good news is that the dudes behind the show, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, have been saying in interviews that season six is going to be a lot like season one (whatever the hell that really means) and very character centric. I hope they're true to their word.     I'll end by saying the finale aired seven months ago, and my mind is still blown. I have no idea where it goes from here, and I think that's great. How many shows are this unpredictable after five seasons? I cant think of one. I'm excited for season six, but I am going to mourn the end of this show for a long time. In this world of American Idol and Dancing With The Stars that we live in, it's not very likely that we'll ever get anything as good as LOST for quite some time.     NOTABLE EPISODES: Because You Left, Life and Death Of Jeremy Bentham, LaFleur, Dead is Dead, The Incident.

It seemed to me to be fodder for Dungeons and Dragons nerds, comic book geeks, and phony macho musclemen and other unfortunate male archetypes.  To my surprise it works on a video game level.  There's no great acting here per se but the action is virtually non-stop.  A guilty pleasure for sure but I bit.  Great movie to drink beer with guy pals and put your brain on mute.
B002Q8GZ62|4.0|It's not easy being a legacy band.  Your fans want you, but they only want your old hits.  So what better way for Spandau Ballet to reform after 20 years than with a rejuvenated piano driven best-of album, with two new songs included.<br /><br />The truth is: Spandau sounds the same.  It's like they never left.<br /><br />Tony Hadley's voice proves that he's a better singer now than ever before.  My only complaint is that the album has too much of a dreamy, ethereal mix...everything seems to be floating and there isn't enough bass to ground the songs.  The sparse and laidback feel on some songs makes it sound like we're listening in on demo cuts and not final tracks.  It sometimes feels like the band is pulling their punches in favour of improvisation.<br /><br />Once More takes a jazzier, bossa nova kind of feel towards the older material.  It all feels slightly slower in tempo.  Gary Kemp's trademark groovy rhythm guitar hooks are largely absent, as in Lifeline.  Back-up vocals are also dropped from songs like True.  Some parts for me at least, even lapse momentarily into muzak because they felt a little too deliberately laid back.  But those are minor faults.<br /><br />The biggest question is: are the new arrangements any good?  Do they improve on the originals?  That really depends on the listener.  In my opinion, you could take out a scorecard and rate them one by one, but I won't do that here.  The originals for the most part, are still brilliant pop songs that stand the test of time.<br /><br />The two new songs are pretty good and give us some insight into the future, should Spandau decide to release new material.  But I'm betting that the tours are going to make more money than any new album.  Hopefully the tour will NOT include all new arrangements of the songs!<br /><br />A Big Welcome back to the boys nevertheless.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This still sounds good in 2016 - the boys really should make another album!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|heart warming i just fell into the book likeit was a dream.best book ive read in a very long time
B000GPIPSS|5.0|The artistry of the film is magnificent. Lugosi defined Dracula, and [i forget the actor] defined Renfield (tho they changed his character and merged him with half of Harker's original role. I am willing to say that the film far outdoes Stoker's book and also the German Nosferatu (Is anyone charmed by that ugly, sharp-eared beast?). The Victorian author's vivid description of Harker's stay in Dracula's castle was for me the majority of the book's brilliance. The genius of this film is that no character is anywhere near as illustrious as Dracula, and that is certainly not the sentiment most people have historically felt having read the book. Also, I think the actor that played Renfield was brilliant and is not talked about enough. Lugosi, stripped of his dignity, had the memory of his first (film) role, and one of the few with artistic merit, tho some others are certainly worth seeing. He was buried with his Dracula cape. I also credit Glass for recognizing the merit of this film and writing a full score for it. I recommend playing the film with the new score on, and do not believe it to be a deviation from tradition. The film, however well done, was a Depression-era film, and an original score was never composed. I feel that the film has finally received what it has always been worthy of. It is nice that a (relatively) widely accepted artist such as Glass recognizes this classic and has added to its legacy. The score is wonderful. As for this aspect ratio, it is the original. At one point, I thought that they had always used a wider-screen format. True that the film deviates far from Stoker's original vision. So much the better. The man actually had the gall to say that Dracula was partly inspired by Walt Whitman. And--after they leave the castle, it is a load of sanctimonious hot air justified by the hollow ideals of High-Victorianism. The reinvention of Dracula--much welcomed. By me, anyway. And I know that the book started a huge legacy that I admit I am indebtedto personally. Just a little personal sourness towards Stoker. But with me, it is really most all of 19th Century British fiction. The poetry, especially the Romantic poetry, I loved. And I really loved Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. Anyway, a personal prejudice makes me prefer this film over the original book, and incidentally, over any other film version of the story.
B002VECMAY|5.0|Jason Reitman has struck gold with \\"Up in the Air\\" a brilliant seriocomedy starring George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, a man who is always on the move.  Ryan's mission is to fly around the country, terminating people firmly but professionally.  He tries to avoid unpleasant scenes and messy lawsuits, and Bingham is very good at what he does.  He is handsome, suave, cool, and always in control.  Ryan is a professional traveler who hates coming home to his bare and unprepossessing apartment.  He packs very little baggage--necessities only--and is inordinately proud of the number of miles he has logged.  He is firm in his determination to avoid romantic commitments, and is delighted to meet his match in Alex Goran, played by the sexy and intelligent Vera Farmiga.  Alex is also a well-paid workaholic and a frequent flyer, who claims to be perfectly content with the no-strings relationship that she and Ryan enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" resonates greatly during this era of high unemployment.  Many companies do hire go-betweens to help them downsize their labor force.  Reitman's dead-on screenplay, co-written with Sheldon Turner, captures the misery of the newly out-of-work.  Many of the terminated men and women in the film are not actors, but ordinary people who have actually been fired and explain, with tears, rage, disbelief, and despair, exactly how it feels to be told that your services are no longer needed.  The scenes between Ryan and the men and women whom he lets go are genuinely heartbreaking.<br /><br />Adding to the movie's richness is a subplot featuring Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, a recent hire in Ryan's firm whose bold new ideas undercut everything Ryan has worked so hard to achieve.  The naïve Keener and somewhat jaded Ryan have some lively scenes in which they disagree vociferously, each one reluctant to give an inch.  Another slightly less successful sequence deals a bit sentimentally with the wedding of Ryan's sister, Julie, whom he barely knows.<br /><br />Reitman, the director, evokes magnificent performances from both his lead and supporting actors.  Clooney plays Bingham with an edge of cynicism tempered with a touch of humanity and developing self-knowledge.  Farmiga is perfect as Alex, a modern woman who can and does have it all and refuses to compromise.  Keener is appealing as the twenty-three year old Natalie, who finds out the hard way that she has a great deal to learn about life.  The veteran character actors J. K. Simmons and Sam Elliott are, as always, impressive in small roles. Special kudos go to the wonderful editor, Dana E. Glauberman, for the film's magnificent pacing.<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" has many deliciously ironic moments and some intriguing surprises.  It will engage those who are disheartened by the impersonal world in which we live, a world that is increasingly ruled by Blackberry-toting, texting, twittering, and cell-phoning electronic junkies who have lost touch with reality.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|Okay, I am not into \\"hyped\\" artists, but I am pleasantly surprised by this album. It features some good tunes, excellent production, creative use of synthesizers, infectious rhythms, humour, intelligence and a rather beguiling amount of cheek. All in all, this is THE album, Alison Goldfrapp SHOULD have made last year! (I still love \\"Supernature\\" and the other Goldfrapp albums!)<br /><br />\\"Pokerface\\" got me hooked. I danced to it in a VR club in Second Life and suddenly I \\"got\\" Lady Gaga.<br /><br />If you like the albums of Alison Goldfrapp (and I mean \\"Classic Goldfrapp\\"), Miss Kittin, Tommy February6, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Murphy and Peaches, then this Lady Gaga album is the next logical step!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0026P3G12|3.0|I thought the CD was good but it lacked the energy and impact of the first performance on 'Britain has Talent'.  It seemed to me that some opera singer teacher had had too much influence.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|With all the versions and different casts available, this is still the best version of LA BOHEME with the Covent Garden (Allen, Shicoff et.al) producton second due to quality of singing, acting, costumes and sets.  The chemistry and emotion is all there after all these years.  I recommend this version as far superior above all others including the new movie with Villazon and Netrebko.  This should be the first one in your collection!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I purchased Sons of Anarchy (season 1) as a CHristmas gift for my son.  He was very excited to receive it and is looking forward to the next season coming out on DVD!!  Thank you for having this!
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|I'm glad so many people enjoyed this presentation but to me it was a definite disappointment due to lip syncing out of sync; lack of chemistry; lack of sincere emotion due to lip sync rather than live singing; actors mouthing singers; almost every mistake that could be made with the direction of a film of this opera seems to have been made.  I much prefer the Met production of the early 80's with Jose Carreras and Theresa Stratas for singing, sets, costumes and acting. Even Pavarotti's is acceptable.  The pair, Netrebko and Villazon, are two of my favorite singers and I loved their La Traviata from Saltzburg but again, that was a live performance not a movie. I thought the Musetta \\"blah\\", as was the Marcello.  I bought it upon release but will not watch it very often as the Met's two productions on DVD are both better than this film.  Anna did come across well in the acting dept. but Rolando still was \\"too big\\" in gestures and singing for film - great on stage.  The emotion was flat through most of the film and the ending was unemotional.  The director didn't notice that the great emotion comes from Rodolfo's grief and heartbreaking sobs of \\"Mimi\\".  I did not tear up which is the test of any good La Boheme ending.     The Met is filming such great productions in HD for broadcast into the theaters and DVD release that a movie no longer holds the best technology for opera performance.  The electricity and chemistry of a stage production will beat a movie just about any time ESPECIALLY if lip syncing is used.  These are professional singers and they should be allowed to sing not lip sync and badly.  Sets and costumes were ok and traditional.  I really wanted to love it but just too disappointed in the overall effect.  I've seen so many La Bohemes on stage that were so superior to this film.  Just a big disappointment.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|Vicky and Cristina, two American college students, decide to spend the summer in Barcelona, Spain.  During their visit they meet a bohemian Spanish painter named Juan Antonio who's recently separated from his wife Maria Elena after a stormy relationship.  The plot thickens in several directions when both women find themselves attracted to Juan Antonio! Once again Woody Allen proves his mastery at writing and directing original and refreshing stories.  The three women: Rebeca Hall, Scarlet Johansen and Penélope Cruz look beautiful. Cruz won a well-deserved Academy Award for playing Maria Elena. Good show, don't miss it.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Charles Dickens is still entertaining readers over 100 years after his death!<br /><br />This story focuses upon New Testament teachings as espoused in Romans 13, Love, for the Day is Near:<br />8.  Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.<br />9.  The commandments, \\"Do not commit adultery,\\" \\"Do not murder,\\" \\"Do not steal,\\" \\"Do not covet,\\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"<br />10.  Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.<br />11.  And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.<br />12.  The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.<br /><br />Scrooge envisions his past, his present, and his future, and is given the choice between damnation and salvation.

B0016CTX1S|4.0|First off,  it was 1967 when this was released.  Who wasn't under the influence of mind-altering substances at the time?  This album has some of the most experimental music that the Stones ever attempted.  Though it doesn't get as much attention as other albums,  any fan who is serious about exploring the Stones music should add this to their collection.  \\"She's A Rainbow\\" and \\"2000 Man\\" are great songs!  You really need to hear them if you haven't.  I wouldn't start here if you are new to the Stones,  but at some point when you've digested the '68 through '74 run of classic Stones albums - give this a go!<br /><br />As Mick would say... \\"Pleassssse come see me in the Citadel\\"
B001DPC52C|5.0|I've been following Within Temptation for a while and I've gotta say that this is by far their best performance/recording. In my opinion, this is the best metal/orchestra combination out there and the live performance is better recorded than many bands I've seen in concert. Definitely worth the money even if you're not a diehard WT fan.

B002WDL534|1.0|This is a great album, musically that is.  Keep in mind that this review is for the VINYL LP and not the CD.  First, I usually give fair reviews and even when I don't like a product, I usually commend Amazon for its quick, simple and easy return policy.  This review will have criticism of both Amazon and record company itself.    First Amazon,  as with so many vinyl lp record album purchases, damage damage damage!  My first ever Amazon purchase was packaged so poorly that a brick would barely have survived!!  I have noticed with more orders that the packaging seems to be improving.  When I received this Lady GaGa Fame Monster album, I was very impressed to see a firm outer box, then a inner box used for album shipping, both boxes firmly intact.  Keep in mind this is a PICTURE DISC ALBUM and not a typical album that comes in a typical album sleeve, it comes in a thick plasic jacket which is standard for most picture albums.  Someone at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to put a rubber band along the length of this plastic sleeve to keep it from opening (if in the right box, which it was, this would NOT happen),  this rubber band made a permanent sharp fold in the plastic, a NO NO for album collectors.  Secondly, the bottom of the plastic sleeve, and BOTH sides are split open, allowing the album to fall out,  third, there is a section that the plastic is broken and  ripped.  Firm, intact shipping boxes but damaged product indicate to me a storage and/or  handling problem WITHIN THE AMAZON WHAREHOUSES.    Now for the actual album review:  Great music BUT if your ordering vinyl albums to avoide that crappy CD sound, forget this vinyl album.  It was very obviously mastered (made) from the CD!!  The sound is god awful, very over amped, (recording level set WAY to high) resulting in distortion, and nothing but distorted thumping BASS.  Many of you may be used to this with CD's and it's the very reason vinyl albums are coming back, \\"The Loudness War\\" (google search it)is  the process where sound engineers are cranking up the recording level SO  high (just because they can) that in the process they are actually degrading the sound and the result is very low, poor DYNAMIC RANGE (something that CD's are supposed to be superior to over albums) and have resulted in people from age 13 to 99 either discovering for  the first time or re-discovering just how great a vinyl album can sound.  Lady GaGa - The Fame Monster sounds like total crap! It is NOT music, it is PURE NOISE!!  You may read similar reviews about Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" - the distortion was SO bad that the company had to do a remaster of the CD and issue replacements and refunds.  Lastly, for those who do NOT know, vinyl albums are supposed to be mastered from the original studio TAPES,  yes tapes of studio recording quality that have far superior sound than CD's.  Most all CD's are mastered from studio TAPES.  It's the mastering process where the sound engineer can \\"over do it\\" on the recording levels.  Some studios are taking a \\"short cut\\" and mastering Vinyl albums from the CD!!  So that means that all flaws evident on the CD re-record to the vinyl!!      SHAME ON INTERSCOPE RECORDS!!!!  SHAME SHAME SHAME!!  Lady GaGa has a magnificant voice, her Vinyl \\"The Fame\\" is  brilliant,  YOU DESTROYED HER LATEST ALBUM  and  I can only imagine just how much worse the CD sounds!!  STOP THE LOUDNESS WAR PEOPLE!!  The music industry has fallen on it's ass with illegal MP3 downloads and I was starting to buy music again ON VINYL in large quantity just because the quality was coming back, plus the ARTWORK that you can NOT get with CD's.  Keep this up and I'll go back to free, illegal file sharing downloads,  I'm not paying hard earned money for CRAP whether it's on CD, Vinyl, cassette or 8 track.  STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385737424|5.0|Upon hearing Nancy Pearl's exceptionally enthusiastic review of \\"When You Reach Me\\" on NPR's Under the Radar for 2009:   [...].  prompted me to order it right away along with \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" and boy am I glad I did! I read just the first few chapters of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" and out of curiosity, picked up Snead's book planning to merely review the jacket cover, table of contents and perhaps the first few sentences. That was a mistake because I couldn't put it down until I finished. I tell all my reading friends about it with hesitation as I am a 41 year old woman and rarely purchase children's books for myself!

B000005E3K|5.0|For all the lovely recordings of the Mozart Requiem, KV 626 - and there are many fine ones that run the gamut of 'authoritative/authentic' performances to richly robust and romantic versions that ring the halls with operatic grandeur - this 1995 recording with William Christie conducting Les Arts Florissantes is one that is so richly rewarding to return to for its delicate yet soulful sincerity.  The instruments are in keeping with the instruments of Mozart's time, and the choral technique is more straight toned than other more modern choruses.  The soloists - Anna Maria Panzarella, soprano, Nathalie Stutzmann, alto, Christoph Pregardien, tenor, and Nathan Berg, bass - are all excellent, both as individuals and in quartet and combinations.  But the overwhelming beauty of this recording is the concept and conducting of William Christie. He crowns this magnificent performance of the Requiem with an otherworldly 'Ave Verum Corpus' KV 618. This is a collector's item and deserves serious consideration for including in the music library. December 09
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I am a fan of David S. Goyer's work and had the pleasure of meeting him in person quite some time ago.  \\"Dark City\\" has been one of my all-time favorite movies and finding the Blu-ray version made my day!  The quality of the picture, along with the sound, is fantastic.  I also like the added footage found within the director's edition.  If you like suspense and sci/fi then this version of \\"Dark City\\" comes highly recommended!
0385504225|1.0|The 'Lost Symbol' was a very, very painful read. I kept turning the pages hoping for something to arrest my attention and found nothing. About half of the book is absolutely unnecessary. Up to about a third of the way through the book, I still had no clue where we were headed. The plot was fuzzy, characters were shallow and the language was limp. It had no pace except that the author managed to but enough words together to fill page after page with nothing.  Mr. Brown needs to take a loooooong break before putting words in print again. This one was really horrible.

B00004XONN|3.0|Now that the decade is coming to a close, almost everywhere you look this album is topping critic's and fan's lists as the album of the 2000's. While I certainly respect all others opinions, I couldn't really be further from this thought.     This album seems very patchy to me, some absolutely outstanding songs mixed with some real clunkers. In the latter camp, the title track, while having nice drums and keyboards seems very pointless with an irritatingly distorted vocal and I feel would work much better as only an instrumental. Also Treefingers, which doesn't seem like music, just some random keyboard arrangement that (absurdly) lasts almost 4 minutes. Also a poor song and maybe the most annoying song I've ever heard, Idioteque. The drum beat in this gets old after about 20 seconds and yet seems to last forever and even though there are some nice effects, they're not nearly good enough to overshadow that insanely irritating beat. And there are a couple tracks that I find neither good nor bad. In Limbo, which comes across as some sort early morning studio warm up, and the closer, Motion Picture Soundtrack, which like the title track has some pleasing sounds to it but doesn't do anything for me.    And now to the good tracks, which aren't merely good, but superb. Everything In It's Right Place is an outstanding keyboard drenched opener while The National Anthem, with it's great bassline and horns sounds to me almost like mid 60's psychedelic Beatles. How To Disappear Completely and Optimistic are great guitar songs though they're very different from one another. Morning Bell isn't quite as good as the rest but still top notch.    So, apart from the hit and miss nature of the actual songs, I find another flaw in the album is the flow. The balance of the album doesn't really make me want to listen to it all the way through that much, I'd rather just listen to my favorites and leave it at that.     And with that in mind and seeing that Amnesiac (which I feel is a terrific and far better album) was recorded at the same time, I've come up with my own playlist, combining the 2 into a super single album. Here's the tracklist:    Everything In It's Right Place  You And Whose Army?  Morning Bell  Pyramid Song  I Might Be Wrong  The National Anthem  Knives Out  Hunting Bears  Packed Like Sardines...  Dollars And Cents  Life In A Glasshouse  Optimistic  Morning Bell/Amnesiac  How To Disappear Completely    I feel this makes Amnesiac even better than it is and gives the Kid A tracks better surroundings, but maybe that's just me.    So, all in all, Kid A the album is nothing too special to my ears, but is certainly worth hearing for it's occasional brilliance.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|So many people are leaving these negative reviews. It kills me becaue i absolutely love the entire Twilight saga, and Breaking Dawn was the best one of the saga.   Although i hate to say the word &#34;best&#34; because I almost love the entire saga the same. But my point is if you dont like the book just move on as if you never read the story. You really dont have to leave such negative comments. And lastly, as far as the graphic scenes go, Bella is 19 in this book so the readers shouldnt take the graphic scenes by surprise. Ok, so i wouldnt recommend kids under 15 to read this book, although if they dont read it they are left hanging. But above all the book is spectacular. I used to hate reading, but i liked the story so much that i started to enjoy reading, and the 4 Twilight saga books are the first novels i've ever read and *finished* and they encouraged me to read more books. Thank you Steph for creating these fabulous books! With love, Arielys, 17. =)
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that I am extremely cautious to give my money to anyone.  I wanted to fully research this headset and all its competitors before I handed over this wad of dough to turtle beach.  I'll be honest and say that I'm lazy and I don't feel like doing a full technical review because you can google it and find a really good one on some gaming forum under cod:world at war.  Long story short, I'm in college and when I go home gaming until 4am doesn't fly with my parents or my siblings.  This is perfect for my application.  However, I use these even when I'm at school because the surround is simply amazing.  If you are considering astro's a40s or those tritton whatevers (their nicest model), I would say go with these.  People complain about static and I was worried at first, but I figured Amazon is great and if I don't absolutely love these, I'll return them.  When I first got them....some static.  I didn't care because I was going to return them and get my close second choice of the a40s.  Well turns out that your nice new tv emits rf that will interfere with the transmitter.  I of course placed it right beside my tv, wanting to admire my new expensive piece of tech equipment.  Once I gave it a little breathing room, voila.  Perfect awesome sound.  I have had zero problems with this set at home or at school once I realized you can't place it right next to your tv.  Also a little mention towards gaming, my primary reason for this purchase.  To summarize their effect I can hear you reload from across the map.  When someone is around a corner and that mini face-off begins, I always win.  It's when you are pretty sure that someone is there, and you know they're thinking the same and you need to time that attack/defense just right to land bullets before he does.  I can hear my opponents footsteps so clearly, I don't need to consult uav or the heartbeat sensor.  I just relax and listen, as if I were there.  Needless to say if you know what is poppin' off and jets are flying overhead etc, etc, you can't discern such small things.  Also remember the surround effect is much, much better without the bass boost on.  Battery life is solid, I personally bought some nice rechargeable ones to do the trick to save money.  Anyway the title says it all, try em' out, I know you'll love em'.
0060512806|2.0|Having tried to get into this book, having read over 500 pages of its bloat, I give up.    Way too many poorly defined characters that do very little given the number of pages devoted to them.  There is potential here, but only if someone had taken the hatchet to about half the unnecessary text, and also put some life into the characters to distinguish one from another

B002TZS5GU|5.0|We've had \\"28 Days Later\\", \\"Zombieland\\", \\"The Happening\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and so many other viral pandemic movies over the last few years. In October, Paramount released this long-shelved project in theaters for one week. This is a thinking man's version of the viral story we've seen many times. Intense. Character-driven, practically no dead bodies in sight and no one getting chased or bitten. It stars four up-and-coming young actors (you've seen them all in other stuff since this was made). Unwavering in story, resolute in getting into your brain, unyielding with possibilities. I give this film a big thumb's up.  The trailer doesn't do the film justice. It's really about 4 people who are faced with a situation that changes each of them and the dynamics amongst them. Again and again. I literally stopped it for a few minutes I was so struck by it. I'd say it's in my top 5 movies of this year. And I see a lot of movies.  Fans of the psychological thriller \\"The Ruins\\" would adore this film.

B002UXRH10|4.0|I love Rihanna's new album! It definitely tells us what she has been going through and gives us a different sound that does not compare to her previous albums. I believe this is something that is the start of a breakthrough for her and will definitely being seeing alot more of her emotional side in her albums in the future. My favorite songs are Wait Your Turn, Hard, Russian Roulette, Rockstar 101, Fire Bomb and The Last Song. It definitely is worth a listen!
0143039431|5.0|I thought The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck was one of the absolute best books I have ever read. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. On the other hand, years of personal life experience helped me to truly appreciate a book of this nature.  It earned Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and I think it's well worth it.<br /><br />The story follows the plight of the dirt-poor Oklahoman sharecroppers who became victims of the great draught of the 1930's. The land literally dried up, turned to dust and blew way, so the banks and the landowners had no other choice but to expel the sharecroppers from their farms. Just like that, their services were no longer needed. The sharecroppers, in turn, were lured to California by a rain of colorful flyers depicting California as the land of opportunity with plenty of well-paying jobs and the chance for a brand new life. All they had to do was get there. So hundreds of thousands of displaced workers packed their eager belongings and headed west.<br /><br />The perspective of the story is from the Joad family's point of view. They were a typical poor family who managed to fix up their old truck with sweat and bailing wire and put together just enough cash money to make the long trip to the agricultural heartland of California. But, of course, something went wrong. Not one thing, but a series of misfortunes. And in my opinion, John Steinbeck did a brilliant job of writing a story that immerses you deep into the heart of the action, as if we, the readers, were sitting in that old broken down truck right alongside the Joad family, breathing the air they breathed, eating the food the ate, feeling their pain, and experiencing everything they experienced. And life on the road to California was tough beyond imagination.<br /><br />By some miracle, the Joad family eventually made it to California. But it wasn't exactly like the flyers had depicted it would be. It seems that the California farmers and landowners had send out thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs. If a farmer needed five hundred workers, he'd send out twenty thousand flyers. This tactic resulted in an all-out hunger panic, and forced thousands upon thousands of starving migrants to compete for a relatively few jobs. Thus, wages were negotiated lower and lower until it wasn't even enough money to feed a family. For instance, a man with a wife and children would gladly work for less than a man with no family. And the women broke their backs and worked their own fingers to the bone tending to their impoverished families, oftentimes feeding them nothing more than hot gravy made from a splash lard and flour. So the migrants basically found themselves in the same shape they were in before they left their homes in Oklahoma. They had no money, no food and no gas to go elsewhere. And on top of that, the locals didn't want them near their towns, houses, stores or children for fear of being overrun by thieves. So the police constantly harassed them, shot at them, threw them in jail, and drove them off the property and back onto the open road. Poor, starving, and marooned in a strange land, for the Joad family, as well as the thousands of other migrant families, California proved to be anything but the land of opportunity.<br /><br />John Steinbeck wasn't a writer known for using big bang endings, but to me, the ending of this book was exceptional and, in my opinion, can only be truly understood after you have read the entire book. You'll have to judge for yourself. I give Grapes of Wrath my highest recommendation.thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this sharpener intending to use it for sharpening broad heads.  This is a great touch up sharpener for knives and scissors, but it is not the best for broad heads.  I can only make good contact with about 50% of the blade surface.  For the price it pays for itself to touch up knives when skinning and dressing game but is still not as good as a full sharpening set to totally restore a ruined edge, but then again I don't think it was designed to replace a multi-stone sharpener.  I have seen this item at other sporting good stores for twice the price so I ordered two!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Admittedly, as other reviews have said, this device may have greatly differing effect as between different source devices.  So, I can only share my immediate experience with my particular hardware, for what it's worth.<br /><br />I recently purchased a nice set of noise-cancelling headphones... Sennheiser PXC 450s.  I use them with both a Sony PSP and an Ipod Touch.  Great headphones... I do a lot of recording studio work and one of Sennheiser's mics is my favorite mic in the world.  But I digress.<br /><br />I've tested these headphones with both units (and my Macbook Pro laptop).  My basic feeling is that they don't change the \\"sound\\" a whole lot...  Not a lot of color.  This is good, particularly for a device in this price range (a high dollar headphone amp would add color; the sort you would want, but color from a cheap device would likely be \\"bad\\").<br /><br />Most importantly, though, they just don't provide much in the way of added volume.  In technical terms i'd guess they add something in the range of 3-6dbu. It's discernible...  The volume does go up.  But it's not a lot.  It's not really sufficient, in my opinion.  I'd have preferred about twice the volume boost that this device seems to provide (at least with these particular audio sources).<br /><br />So... it's useful, but weaker than one would like.<br /><br />Besides that, the form factor is good (it's small and pretty unobtrusive), and the feature set is good (bass boost works well enough; the buttons make sense, and the USB charging works well).  Only thing I might have liked to see in terms of features is a volume level indicator (you just have to listen and see).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations for an alternate device at this point.  I'll probably hold on to this one for a while and see how it performs over the course of a few airplane flights.  If it's insufficient, I'll look for something else (and will probably have to go up in cost and size).  I suspect it will generally suffice, though, the majority of the time.  There will probably just be a few instances where I really need more volume and will wish that this one had it.<br /><br />To reiterate what others have said...  It's good, for what it is [but it's not quite a total winner due to the volume thing].rally suffice, though, the majority of the time.

B001E75QGG|4.0|Indiana Jones and his dad Henry, rode off into the sunset in Indiana Jones and Last Crusade, back in 1989.  As more time past, it appeared that we had perhaps seen the last of the intrepid archeologist.  And that might have been the case, if not for Harrison Ford's interest in doing a fourth Indy adventure.  Ford's persistence provided the impetus to bring Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas, together again after eighteen years, to produce Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull (2008).<br /><br />The result is another rip roaring adventure, full of danger, excitement, and fun, that while featuring more CGI, remains true to the grand tradition of Indiana Jones.  The film features a reunion with Jones's true love, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and should this be the final chapter, nicely closes the circle on the epic Indiana Jones saga.<br /><br />Set in 1957, the story begins in the Nevada desert, where Indy is a prisoner of Soviets disguised as American soldiers, engaged in a raid on a government facility, where classified material is stored.  The group led by Colonel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), and aided by Indy's friend Mac Michale (Ray Winstone), is after remains of an interdimensional being recovered from Roswell.  Indy escapes on a rocket driven sled, and then manages to survive a nuclear blast, bringing the preamble to a close.<br /><br />After being suspended from teaching, Indy is approached by Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), who informs him that old friend, Harold Oxley (John Hurt), has discovered a crystal skull in Peru.  After another tussle with the Russians, Indy and Mutt are off to Peru.  While clambering in a crypt, they discover a hidden crystal skull.  The pair are captured by the Soviets and reunited with Marion, who is revealed to be Mutt's mother, followed by the revelation that Mutt is Indy's son.  Exposed to the power of the skull, Indy deciphers some clues provided by Oxley, which indicate the location of the legendary city of Akator.  On the way there, Indy and his group make a bid to escape.  The film makes the jump into complete fantasy, with a wild and outrageous chase through the jungle, an encounter with fire ants, culminated with plunging over three sets of waterfalls.<br /><br />The entrance to Akator lies in a hidden cave behind a waterfall.  Indy and his band set about returning the crystal skull to its rightful place.  Miraculously, Spalko and her troops have somehow navigated the three falls, and are trailing just behind.  The skull is from an extra-terrestrial, and restoring the skull results in a cataclysmic event, the opening of a portal to another dimension.  Spalko becomes part of the cosmos, and her command is sucked into the vortex.  Returning home, Indiana and Marion are married.  Time will tell, if the story ends here.<br /><br />One of the true movie stars of this generation, Harrison Ford may be approaching the later stages of a distinguished career, but at 66, he is still one hell of an action hero!  While the intensity may have been tailored to lessen the physical difficulty, there are few at his age that would be up to the task.  The man is simply an inspiration.  Karen Allen has aged gracefully, and does a fine job in a physically demanding role.  This film brings the Indiana Jones saga full circle, and sets up the Mutt character as a possible successor.  The Indy-Marion romance may not be a cinematic classic, but this film certainly elevates its stature.<br /><br />Master filmmakers, Spielberg and Lucas, reacquainted themselves with the earlier films, and Crystal Skull successfully recaptures the same spirit, with a modern look.  Although use of current technology and techniques is evident, use of CGI was mostly judicious, and not terribly overdone, except for the finale.  With John Williams again providing the music, the film also has the same wonderful swashbucking feel.  Fans of the film should look at either of the 2 disc versions, special edition or blu-ray,which both have tons of extras.  Partially inspired by early movie serials, one of the most popular movie characters of the last 30 years, it can be said that 'If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones'.Partially inspired by early movie serials, one of the most popular movie characters of the last 30 years, it can be said that 'If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones'.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Aside from all the usual emphasis on historical events, acting abilities and camera techniques cussed and discussed in the reviews posted about this biopic, the holistic effect of the project is most satisfying and pleasant to my sensibilities. Can you tell that I have just finished a double marathon viewing of the HBO cycle, raw and then with the \\"Facts are stubborn...\\" annotations?<br /><br />Rather than the more journalistic review, I wish to share a few observations. The tapestry of imagery, through the costumes, sets, properties, sound and remarkable computer enhancement, was stunning and executed so brilliantly that these components became strong characters in the story. Buzzing flies, rooms poorly lit by candle, oxen slushing through snowy mud, practical wigs, ink stained fingers, lead based makeup, scrubbing stones, bad teeth, quirks of gesture and speech, historical tableau's set in motion, a chair that hears everything to the end - all the minutia of excellent film making. These things don't just 'not get in the way of the story', they add a texture, depth and realism, that I have never before experienced in films about this most precious time of our country's roots.<br /><br />Historical accuracy? Take a look at the last 20 years in the media and writings about the events we have witnessed. With all our technology and ability to record sounds, images, words, we cannot even agree on what happened last week, last year, last administration! Adams the lawyer would say that history is 'facts and evidence', not politics or 'spin'. But Adams the passionate patriot, constant husband, strict father, would also agree that persuasion through dramatic speech or exaggerated action, is sometimes necessary to portray the 'meaning' of history, rather than just the 'facts'.<br /><br />A man in love. John Adams the romantic? What? Look and listen closely to the words and watch the deeds, and the subtle cues outside the line of sight or range of hearing. Abigail and John, through their letters and writings, and their actions, have given us a brilliant picture of the strong and loving American political couple who sacrificed much for the duty to their country. None could create or report a more powerful testament to conubial love.<br /><br />That John Adams loved his country is undeniable, and the best oratory and discourse from him is when he is alit with the flame of patriotic devotion. His careful conversation with King George, his inaugural address, and many other speeches and writings show the passion he had 'for a country...that is free'. The third love that this story portrays, is the 50 year partnership with Thomas Jefferson. This singular relationship and collaboration between such two opposing viewpoints epitomizes the spirit and power of the 'grand experiment' that was, and is, our democratic government. Both Adams and Jefferson were pelted with political sneers and darts (a natural part of the American politic) all their lives, but none stung as those delivered about each other. But, like the true friends they were to each other, they connected and challenged each other, and never totally parted. Dr. Rush called them \\"The North and South poles of our Revolution\\". The fact that we survive today to tear into each other with venomous fervor, yet move forward with our way of life, I invest largely in these two.<br /><br />This film project sparkles and sputters with all the fire and ice that epitomizes our American experience, and the fact that it, like the story that it illuminates, invites such divergent opinion and criticism, is testimony to its success.writings, and their actions, have given us a brilliant picture of the strong and loving American political couple who sacrificed much for the duty to their country.

He obvious doesn't know what he's talking about, since it spawned the single longest running science fiction show in history.  It's an interesting premise with a new collection of technology from the warp drive and blasters we're all used to.  Well worth a viewing.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|Aim&eacute;e Duffy is another artist that I was first introduced to as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist. And although I liked the singles \\"Mercy\\", \\"Warwick Avenue\\" and \\"Stepping Stone\\", for some reason I never got around to listening to Rockferry in its entirety. Now I finally have and I'm wondering why I waited so long to do so.<br /><br />There aren't that many songs on here but it's quite all right because there isn't a minute wasted. The album does cover quite a bit of heartbreak, but Duffy does it in such a unique way that it doesn't all sound the same, as evidenced by selections like \\"Delayed Devotion\\" and \\"Serious\\". And \\"I'm Scared\\" might not look like much on paper, but it works.<br /><br />Duffy also excels when she delves into more standard fare, like the title track (I would call it the necessary tribute-from-your-hometown, but she isn't from that city); and \\"Syrup & Honey\\" is far from sappy. In short, Rockferry is a flawless debut, so cop it.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B002UXRH10|3.0|Rihanna started out as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jay-Z but now it looks like she's doing her own thing (Jigga isn't on this album at all; probably because he isn't on Def Jam anymore). And she does just that on Rated R, her first album to break the string of releasing one album per year.<br /><br />Looking at the album title as well as a certain sticker on the cover of the album, it should be clear that Ms. Fenty is trying to come harder with this album (especially with the single \\"Hard\\"). But there are two issues with that: 1) as often is the case, there isn't quite enough profanity after all to warrant the EXPLICIT CONTENT label, and 2) I'm not sure she's 100% believable as a ghetto girl (it's kind of like when you saw Bianca Lawson playing a ghetto girl in [[ASIN:B00003CXTS Save the Last Dance]]). Okay, maybe that's not exactly fair, but songs like \\"Rockstar 101\\" and \\"G4L\\" (Gangster 4 Life) don't really do anything for me.<br /><br />There ARE some good songs on here though, like the last song, fittingly titled \\"The Last Song\\". The will.i.am-assisted \\"Photographs\\" is okay, but I wonder if that song is really supposed to refer to photographs of HER after a certain incident; speaking of that, a song that works better along those same lines is \\"Cold Case Love\\". \\"Te Amo\\" is a decent track although that's what probably started the bisexual rumors; and even though I realize \\"Russian Roulette\\" is a metaphor, I'm having a hard time understanding what it's a metaphor FOR (by the way, why did MTV have no problem showing the title to this song but they blocked out the phrase in Lady Gaga's \\"Poker Face\\"?).<br /><br />There's also \\"Stupid in Love\\", which is pretty good until you get to the uninteresting chorus of: \\"This is stupid/I'm not stupid/Don't talk to me like I'm stupid\\". The sexual \\"Rude Boy\\" is dope as well except for that \\"I wa-wa-want what you wa-wa-want\\" part. And just to clarify, although I also gave her other three albums three-and-a-half stars, those were those kind of 3-1/2 star \\"it's okay; nothing else to it\\" albums whereas THIS is good with a few missteps.

The two main characters aren't particularly intersting (the thief is a non-entity with an overgrown sense of entitlement and no thoughts of other human beings), the crimes and the tracking down of the thief aren't interesting at all, and the author conducts herself with a sense of fear and trepidation as if she were following murderous druglords as opposed to a loser who uses stolen credit card numbers to steal first editions. I grew tired of everybody involved long before the end.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader is a novel written from the perspective of a young man growing up in post-World War 2 Germany. As the protagonist intimately recalls his formative teenage years growing up in Germany, the story elicits many familiar feelings of adolescence, but with an unconventional set of circumstances. The novel explores two experiences that change the young man's life. One is a romantic relationship with a woman twice his age during his late teenage years, and the second experience takes place in college, during a set of trials against Nazi war criminals.<br /><br />The first experience allows the author to probe the question of how our first serious relationship affects the rest of our life. Something most people can relate to of course, even though the actual relationship the protagonist is a part of is an atypical one and arguably an immoral one. This bizarre relationship makes for an interesting story, full of emotional storytelling that is beyond the complexity of emotion I ever felt as a late teen. The second experience involving the Nazi trials explores the social aftermath in Germany as a result of the Holocaust and the struggle experienced by the following generations of Germans.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, I wonder if the character also considers himself to be a victim of Hanna. Clearly, at the beginning, he attributes a lot of his success as a student and confidence as a young man to his romantic relationship with Hanna. However, her memory haunts him for the rest of his life, and precludes him from any chance at a successful, long-term relationship as a full grown adult - evidenced by his later marital problems.

Al also owns a toy store that advertises on T.V.  He needs Woody to complete a perfect \\"Roundup Gang\\" collection he wants to sell to a Japanese Museum Curator.  Al brings Woody to his apartment and has his torn arm fixed.  While there Woody discovers that he is a valuable collectible as a spin off from a puppet show from the 1950's, \\"Woody's Roundup Gang\\".<br /><br />Woody meets the toy versions of his old TV show - Jessie (Cusack), prospector Stinky Pete (Grammer) and his horse, Bullseye.  He has the choice to make of being behind glass and admired by old fans, or being part of a family with Andy; played with and loved.  Jessie reminds him that kids grow up and he will be tossed aside one day anyway.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the toys in Andy's room must rescue Woody.  There is an exciting crosstown adventure as they use the toy store's address to find Woody.  It is up to Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex and Slinky Dog to rescue Woody and remind him what it means to be a toy and belong to someone.  Jessie and Bullseye end up being part of the loving family in the end, but such an exciting, poignant adventure can't be missed.  There is also a lesson on enjoying and living in the present and not worrying about the past or future.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|This is only my second visit to Norah Jones' world, and it certainly will not be the last. Man, this girl is hot. Sizzling AND smoking. She has not only stayed true to her roots, but has pulled off a seamless stylistic transition. After trying out the country life in her second album, she returned to her bluesy jazz roots in her third, and is venturing into more of a pop/rock territory here in this, her fourth studio effort.    Music-wise, as with \\"Come Away With Me\\", the fidelity of the recording really shines through, and there is something for almost everybody stylistically. Coming from Texas with a jazz pedigree, her time in New York City has certainly widened her musical horizons. Overall, she is extending her reach a little more into rock n' roll, while staying true to the blend of bluesy jazz and pop that has defined her meteoric ascent into stardom. Reportedly, this is the first album that she has composed on a guitar, and it shows in a good way.    Many will no doubt love the first track, \\"Chasing Pirates\\", as it really shows off her pop music side; it may be the one to really get some top 40 airplay. For me the first one that really jumped out was \\"Light As A Feather\\", which presents a lush aural landscape to show off her bluesy jazz side, which is the aspect of her music that most appeals to me. \\"You've Ruined Me\\", and \\"Tell Your Mama\\" get more into bluesy rock, and she does this very well. Even though there are no mediocre songs on this album, the wide range of musical styles she presents tend to draw the album as a whole down with seeming inconsistency, while probably short-circuiting many potential 5-star reviews that she may have garnered as a more stylistic purist. It does, however, widen her appeal, and doesn't seem to be hurting album sales any.    After selling as many records as the entire recording industry combined (reportedly 36 million last year), she can try any style that she like :-)    Norah Jones has a voice for the ages, there is no doubt about that. There are many industry heavyweights \\"helping\\" her (or is it the other way around?) on this latest effort, which may have helped with this stylistic transition, but compared to \\"Come Away With Me\\", the album can sound a tad over-produced in some places. But the new rock n' roll edge really shines through elsewhere in the album without being overpowering, and I am looking forward to more explorations into those areas from her in the future.    This album is a good value for any Norah Jones fan, even if you only like a couple of the songs. But in my experience listening to Ms. Jones, the songs I like the most now won't be the same favorites that I develop over time; maybe I will really warm up to \\"Chasing Pirates\\" after all. One of my favorite songs on this album is \\"Man of the Hour\\", which is an ode to her dog(s). Neil Young should be proud!

B002PMV9FG|1.0|Being well beyond the targeted audience, I've never read the Harry Potter books so I don't know how this mess measures up with the original. Still, as a movie, it's damned boring and more murky than \\"dark\\". The characters wander around aimlessly until I reached the point where I not only did not know what was going on, but, more than that, I no longer cared. The principle child actors have not aged well. Daniel Radcliffe mumbles incoherently, Rupert Grint consistently looks like he needs a bath and detox. and Emma Watson, though quite a beauty, appears shallow and clueless. It's now very apparent that these three have no real future as adult actors.<br /><br />I spent most of the movie gritting my teeth over the horrendous miscasting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I can't believe that they couldn't find anyone who was closer to the style and demeanor of the late Richard Harris. Gambon, who was quoted as saying, \\"I just play me\\" appears incoherent and senile and apparently doesn't know that no one is really interested in watching him play himself. I suspect that Rowling killed Dumbledore off in the books because it was the only way to get rid of Gambon. He's really that bad!<br /><br />Even my 10 year-old, who should be within the target demographic couldn't sit through this. I recommend renting this if you're dead set on watching this drivel.
0385737947|5.0|I won't go into a long summary here, because other people have already done that, but this book is PHENOMENAL.  It gets off to kind of a slow start, with Thomas adjusting to the Glade, but quickly picks up speed and is so intense that you find yourself unable to put it down.  Never a dull moment, and great for fans of other books in this genre, such as the Hunger Games.  I have a hard time finding books like that that are really good, solid books, and this is one of the few.  If i could give it ten stars instead of five, i would.
B002VECMAY|5.0|Up In the Air mixes romantic comedy with a portrait of these harsh economic times; and it comes up a winner because it does a good job exploring both themes without being either superficial or maudlin. There is fine character development and superb acting, too. The plot moves along quite well and I was never once bored. The cinematography was wonderful--I especially liked those aerial shots of the cities and the plains as seen from an airplane above. The choreography works equally well, too. The script was very well written and its use of real people, not actors, expressing what they felt when they were fired in real life adds to the quality of this film.<br /><br />When the film starts, we quickly meet corporate road warrior Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) whose life is actually so empty that his only real relationships are with American Airlines, Hertz and the Hilton hotel chain. Indeed, Ryan's only real goal for himself is to travel so much that he's earned ten million frequent flyer miles! Ryan's job is to fly to cities where there are companies with bosses too afraid to fire their employees when downsizing; Ryan is the guy who gets paid to take the heat from someone who might become crazed or worse when they find out that they've been terminated from their job. Things are actually going well for Ryan who doesn't seem to mind his really rough job, but then his boss brings in a newcomer who wants to completely change the game plan. Young, snooty and recent graduate upstart Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) wants to do away with the road warriors--and save the company 85% of its expenses by terminating people using webcams! Of course, this jeopardizes Ryan's own job, so he offers to take Natalie on the road with him ostensibly to \\"show her the ropes.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ryan begins a relatively light-hearted, pleasure for the sake of just fun relationship with a female road warrior, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Ryan slowly but surely warms up to her; Alex becomes the first person Ryan's ever even considered reaching out to for a meaningful relationship. Ryan's emotional life has been so empty that when he mentions he's attending the wedding of his sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) he adds that he doesn't \\"really know her all that well.\\"<br /><br />Of course, much more happens to Ryan, Alex, Natalie, Julie and others in this picture but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that this romantic comedy gains strength and meaning from its simultaneous, realistic look at the serious unemployment at this time as well as relationships that aren't always what they appear to be; I really like that because it gives the film a type of universal appeal which drew me in more than a traditional romantic comedy would have.<br /><br />I hope that when this comes out on DVD they have good extra features! In addition, look for some great acting by Amy Morton as Ryan's other sister Kara; Danny McBride as Jim Miller, Julie's fianc&eacute;; Jason Bateman as Craig Gregory and J.K. Simmons as Bob--and more! I should also mention that director/co-writer Jason Reitman did a splendid job.<br /><br />Up In the Air offers a romantic comedy with meaning, depth and excellent character development. This is far better than your average romantic comedy and I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie. Of course, if you're interested in the road warrior experience or even a look at how the economy is costing so many people their jobs these days and possibly changing their lives forever, this is a film you should see.yan's ever even considered reaching out to for a meaningful relationship.

B001OQCV60|4.0|In late Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey) and Watson (Jude Law) are once again up against a criminal mastermind that confounds the well-meaning but limited scope of Scotland Yard.  In this edition an aristocratic black magic practitioner, Lord Blackwood, is confounded in the middle of a human sacrifice by Holmes. Blackwood is hanged and pronounced dead by Watson but is seen roaming the graveyard after his death. Meanwhile, Holmes encounters \\"the woman\\" Irene Adler, who engages him to find a missing person. Watson is moving out in order to build a home for his prospective wife and is trying to pull back from his almost symbiotic link with Holmes. Holmes is having difficulty adjusting to the loss of his faithful sidekick and as the Blackwood/Adler case become more dangerous, Watson is sucked back in to assist Holmes in saving the day.<br /><br />Downey performs Holmes masterfully, with the required panache, charisma and eccentric genius. He and Law have a marvelous chemistry which is mandatory for any Holmes/Watson actor team, and Downey keeps up with Law's native English accent with apparent ease.  There is plenty of humorous repartee between them which blends nicely with Holmes talents and detective skill. Eddie Marson completes the team as the always clueless Inspector Lestrade.<br /><br />In this film meticulous care is taken to capture the grime and excitement of London in this early industrial period, where the enormous Tower Bridge is under construction and the Thames is filled with traffic. Scenes are filmed on location, transforming modern London into a beautiful gothic fantasy. The muddy streets and houses smeared with soot are faithfully rendered taking the viewer into a different world. Other scenes utilize beautiful period interiors that convey the elegance of the period, and sets that reflect the poverty of the period.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie (recently divorced from Madonna) masterfully directs this gorgeous film. He is best known for his take on modern English gangster culture in films such as Snatch. He has fulfilled the promise of his earlier films, maintains the rapid-fire pace, and has developed a stunning aesthetic lavishly portrayed in this film.<br /><br />This is a wonderful holiday film filled with action, suspense, humor and mystery. A must-see for Holmes fans!sh gangster culture in films such as Snatch.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Although The Grapes of Wrath is certainly not the longest picture I've ever seen, the exceptionally fine acting combined with its emotional impact and careful attention to detail gives the film a truly epic quality. The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen--at the very end there was a lump in my throat; I was extremely moved and I won't forget this film anytime soon! The script could not have been better; the cinematography shines and the choreography is superb. The plot moves along nicely and covers quite a bit of action despite the fact that things never seem rushed. Of course, the film can't quite match all the detail of John Steinbeck's 450+ page book; but the way the filmmakers did this, including director John Ford, it is profoundly memorable.<br /><br />When the picture begins, we quickly meet Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), who returns to his Oklahoma home after spending four years in prison; and it is through Tom's eyes that we see the shock people felt during the Great Depression when they were driven off the Midwestern land they had harvested for decades. On the one hand, Tom reunites with Casy, a family friend who is now a disillusioned former preacher; but on the other hand the closer he and Casy get to the Joad house the more a nasty, ominous dust storm begins to blow up and when they discover an empty house the not-so-happy tone is set for the rest of the picture. Indeed, their once cherished home is merely a hide-out for a disheveled friend named Muley (John Qualen) who tells Tom that the Joads and other families have been driven off the land by big banks. Sharecropping, the only thing they know how to do to make a living, is no longer profitable. Muley then tells Tom and Casy that Tom's family is at their Uncle John's (Frank Darien) home; and Tom, again with Casy, arrives there for a family reunion. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell in an Oscar winning performance) is thankful that Tom reached them before they left Oklahoma; the family intends to move to California. In California, they believe, there will be good paying jobs picking crops and they want Tom and Casy to come with them.<br /><br />Of course, many things happen to the Joad family and Casy as the plot progresses; and I won't write too much about this in order not to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that the movie was brilliantly executed and the attention to detail remains extremely impressive, to say the least. The plot and the action are extremely realistic as well.<br /><br />The DVD comes with terrific bonus features. On one side of the DVD disc there is a commentary by film scholar Joseph McBride and Susan Shillinglaw (a John Steinbeck scholar). There is also a prologue that was shown to British audiences so that they would have a basic understanding of the issues in this film before they viewed it. On the other side of the DVD disc, we get a featurette biography of Darryl F. Zanuck, a restoration comparison--and even more!<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is so well done and packs such a punch that it should be required viewing for anybody when they're old enough to understand the issues explored and depicted in this film. The film accurately depicts the harsh severities of life for so many people at that time in our country's history; and that's for the best. It's educational, too! I highly recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie; and anyone who appreciates quality, classic motion pictures will not be disappointed.a.

1555928552|3.0|Creative, imaginative, yes, but also, scary for many. Illustrations are beautiful. The story content was not necessarily appealing to me or the children who shared the story with me. I am surprised by all the 5-star ratings.
0131479415|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It covers the planning, feature management, estimation, and schedule management aspects of agile in a clear and comprehensive way. The author does a great job of spending just the right level of detail on each section and I didn't feel that anything was missing.<br /><br />The book is aimed at individuals new to agile project management and is not aimed at developers or testers though I found it useful as a developer.<br /><br />The last chapter is a case study that summarizes the contents of the book as it applies to a fictitious game development team who is adopting agile for a new project. The chapter was a good read and I recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the time to enjoy the entire book.<br /><br />Very good book; glad I spent the time reading it and I heartily recommend it.
1881273156|5.0|This is a great book for someone who has a partner who desires to resolve issues.  This book presents examples which have been \\"me\\"....and I truly feel that when someone reads the book who need direction that it will help termendeously.  I could and would if the opportunity ever allowed itself to the same; to recommend to be used in a Sunday School Class of married couples of all ages...
B002T9H2L0|1.0|QT laughs all the way to the bank. He fools people into believing his movies are good.   He is sort of a George Romero with big budget films. He makes rubbish movies and people continue to flock to his crude, poorly made films to satisfy their blood lust.        Why the 5 star reviews for this movie? Let's face it ............ some people have to have bad taste in order to keep the world balanced.  GB is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Totally a waste of time to watch it.   Do yourself a favor if you must watch it....... rent a DVD and when you realize how boring & bad it is you can fast forward through it.
B000004286|5.0|I love this soundtrack, I bought it years ago and lost it well in England. I bought a new one to replace. I love it, the music is amazing.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This season is a good season.  It answers a lot of unaswered questions, and now we still have those pesky questions that make us want to watch season 6.  If you have seen the first 4 seasons, you will like the twist between the Sawyer and Jack characters.  Hope you enjoy if you do decide to buy.
B000002GBK|5.0|I've been listening to Wakeman's King Arthur since I was a teen. This album was released in the mid-70s and there's nothing like it. I highly recommend it, along with most of his other albums.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a wonderful CD of Susan Boyle songs. Very meaningful and handwritten insert by Susan giving her thoughts on each song she sings. I would recommend this CD very highly.  Pat
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Okay, so the story line is totally predictable and the violence boring to someone my age, but this movie is wonderful beyond words.  For someone who is an artist and sci-fi/fantasy writer herself, I was in a state of bliss watching the utter exotic beauty of this created world and the sentient beings who live upon it. This is old fashioned movie watching as in when you were a kid, eyes wide and shoving popcorn in your mouth.  The two and a half hours fly by.  And then you want to watch it again.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I heard these guys on the radio driving home one afternoon. They have been number one on 89.5 WSOU in Jersey for the past few weeks and I must say it is well deserved. They have a similiar sound to Life of Agnoy, who I thought they were at first, but after listening to the entire album, they really provide a wide range of great music. If you are a fan of Life of Agony or Danzig, I would strongly recommened this album.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I didn't see this when it was released, but I can say I wish I had. It was the most fun and really a well acted movie of this type that I'ld seen in quite a while. It will some day be considered a classic, cult or otherwise. Had the directors realized how great of a job the actors would do, they might have cut back on the excess CGI. Still that's not enough to keep this from rating 5 stars. Speed was outstanding. His little brother and the monkey couldn't have been more on target, and were responsible for some great laughs ( thank you it was needed ). The drama with Racer X was touching. Mom and Pops were of course more involved than ever, and Tixie was a bit, well, out there. I find myself wishing it had made enough for another adventure but this is a enjoyable experience and highly recommended movie.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Can't complain about this deal...3 Blu-ray's for about 1/2 the price?  Plus, these are 3 good titles to have a reference movies if you're showing off the clarity of Blu-Ray and your HDTV.  If you ever get see this deal again, get it!!!
B002OR18HQ|3.0|Hi ,I purchased this dvd thinking it was a cd along with other cd's for my wife for Christmas. Will it play as a musical cd ?Thanks for your help
B001DHXT6G|3.0|I bought this 3 set series for my dad, and although so far the actual show seems great, picture is wonderful, BUT the casing is horrible. i wish i had noticed it right away but sadly i didn't until we all sat down to watch it . the casing has a crack in it and the case inside holding the dvds had cracks in the top as well. the dvds were put in wrong to so when we put it in the dvd player it wasn't reading it.  luckily it hasn't seemed to skip but weve only watched part of the first dvd of season one. when we were putting it away though the box holding the dvds kept falling apart and took us forever to get the box clasped shut without falling apart. we are going to keep it but we may at least switch it to a better box. for the cost though the box should have been better quality since it stores the dvds.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|It is the year 2154, and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) arrives on the planet Pandora, which is home to a rare mineral needed back on earth.  Scientists there have created \\"avatars\\" which are a cross between humans and the indigenous blue Na'vi people; Sully is asked to use his avatar to befriend the locals and get them to leave the area so mining can expand.<br /><br />The movie blends live actors and computer-generated scenes and its story  reminded me a lot of [[ASIN:B000A9QK78 FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]; both have innocent Mother Earth-loving natives pitted against evil, nature-hating  industrialists, lush forests with a pleasing color palette of greens, pinks, and purples, and even a sacred tree.  This movie is lovely to look at and the 3-D effects are fun, even if much of it does seem like a fancy comic book.  The actors are all fine, the animation is well-done, and the script is predictable but exciting.  Recommended for fans of animation, action, and adventure.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|This CD is so good.  I can't believe America has not caught on to this guy yet.  Every song is great! Can't wait until he comes back to tour.  I didn't find him until after he was here last year so missed him.    Get the CD.  You won't regret it!!!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS HOTT!!! LOVE IT LISTEN TO IT EVERYDAY AND MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE WORTH IT MILLION DOLLAR BILL, HER VOICE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT STILL GREAT AND WORTH LISTENING TOO!!! i THINK NOW THAT SHE IS BACK LOVING HER CRAFT HER VOCALS WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE C`MON THIS IS WHITNEY HOUSTON FOR GOD SAKES!! HER NEXT ALBUM WILL BE EVEN BETTER TRUST!! SHE GOES ON TOUR IN FEBRUARY 2010 THAT IS WHERE SHE GET`S THE CHANCE TO REALLY WORK THOSE VOCALS.. DEFINITLY A MUST HAVE DISC TO ADD TO THE COLLECTION!!!YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|It is rather hard to contain my excitement and happiness with this album. All of the songs are beautifully woven together to make a brilliant quilt of art. I hate none of the songs. However songs like Bad Romance, Alejandro, Speechless, and Telephone caught my eye right away and let me realize that it was a great album. Monster quickly became a favorite of mine, and Teeth grew and grew on me. Teeth may take some time but trust me, it will not disappoint. After reading the lyrics to Dance in the Dark and So Happy I Could Die the songs became so much more to me , and I absolutely love them. Even with censored lyrics it still is possibly one of the best albums I have. Even with eight songs, Lady Gaga has now put herself in Pop music royalty.
1401322425|4.0|The book was sent very quick and was with us before Christmas, as promised. The book was in not sich a good shape as expected from the discription. The cover was more worn that discribed. But all in all a great purchase
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney Houston's new album \\"I Look to You\\" is a wonderful album. Great singing, catchy beat, and easily to sing along to. Songs like \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", \\"For the Lovers\\", and \\"Salute\\" show why we have always loved Whitney and why we still continue to. My reason for deducting half a star is the fact that it is not totally the old Whitney we used to know. Even though she keeps her old style in songs like, \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", \\"I Look to You\\", and \\"I Didn't Know my Own Strength\\" she often goes into the more modern R&B style like Leona Lewis. However if you ignore that factor it is a great album that you will listen to again and again.
1594488916|2.0|there is something appealing about a book about books. having once worked part-time in an used bookstore (in LA CALIF) i've dealt, worked with and met several breeds of bibliomanics, book collectors, book dealers, owners of used bookstores (verifiable dinosaurs), those with fetishes for certain 'types' of books, etc. so the textual collecting milieu was quite familiar to me. additionally, the southern california landscape of book shops, book dealers, antiquarian book shows, etc were all within my realm of first-hand experience and did ring true. however the central object of this work, i.e, 'the man who loved books too much' is nothing more than a self-delusional, ego-centric petty thief....so why did the author bother lending this pathetic loser good ink by quoting his pointless ranting self-justifications? it was a constant theme within the text...once would have really been sufficient. furthermore the author should have had the good taste to take herself out of the narrative.  the reader is unmercifully subjected to her incessant nagging conscience and questioning morality about a 'borrowed' antique book...then barrages the reader again by her own world-view on the sheer materialism of book collecting.  by this, the author elevates herself by mentioning (time and time again) the sentimental family value she attaches to certain books (from her childhood-handed down to daughter) rather than concerning herself with the base monetary worth of a collectible edition. okay, okay...we get the preachy drift she's NOT a book collector per se and morally superior to any gross materialism you or i might engage in....but do we really care?. what little interest i had (reading) was sparked by  her research into the prodigious and prolific book thieves of history.  unfortunately this potentially engaging historical thread was not further explored or expanded by her. the reader would be better served by other 'books about books' such as BOOK ROW, GENTLE MADNESS, etc. also thereis a witty and grabbing autobiography by a former professional book buyer....the title of which (alas) escapes me at this moment (she starts off as a young book clerk in the fabled B. DALTON BOOKSELLERS on hollywood blvd., her evolution and development as a book buyer, her multi-experiences in the book business, all the wonderful and eccentric characters she've worked with and met throughout the years, etc......a very worthwhile memoir).
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Okay when I first got this album, I was not incredibly excited. I thought it would be really slow, bland, and boring songs that would put me to sleep. However I was proven wrong. His voice is incredible and is quite close to the likeness of Pop legend Frank Sinatra. However at the same time he manages to keep his own signature style that makes him very unique. I loved ten of the songs, liked two, and i thought one was decent. If you love Sinatra definitely give it a try, but even if you don't still give it a try. It may surprise you how lovely and magical it really is.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughters and they both loved it,,my husband and I did to.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Absolutely love it! The set is beautifully packaged with lots of extra material added to each CD. The price from   Amazon was so much cheaper that anything I could get elsewhere. I'm very happy with this experience and product :)
0740785508|5.0|I wish they had made this book required reading at the art school I was going to.  I never really knew how to get what's inside my head onto paper, if you don't either, please buy this book.  What first impressed me about this book is the fact that James Gurney has done so many incredible drawings for books and magazines that he has plenty of examples to show you exactly what he's talking about.  Also, he shows you how to build a maquette to help you with your illustrations, instead of the other way around (I was taught that was the wrong way, but now it makes visualizing much easier for me), he also shows you the steps from sketchbook studies from real life to fantasy/sci-fi illustrations, and the steps themselves are incredibly inspirational!  This book is now a definitive part of my art library!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Hey, after being a big fan of Alice In Chains back in the day and as a guitarist playing so many of their songs... I fully support their decision to move on with William Duvall as a band. This record is like old school AIC but the decision to stick with it and keep the game going should be interesting on their next effort. I think we will see an entirely new and more mature band form out of these guys. They are grown up, have families and have the right to make music that isn't all depressing. And they rock it hard on this one, they will rock it hard next time.    John Coyle

B0009K8L5W|5.0|The original!   Before Shakira went blond. Before Shakira dressed scantily. Before Shakira sang in English. There was \\"Piez Descalzos\\", bare feet. Organic, true, and so far from Hollywood.   One of my all-time favorites. Brilliant lyrics that didn't have to rhyme or be translated to make some sort of sense in English.   This is still on my iTunes, love it!

B002SJIO4A|4.0|A mysterious alien ship appears above Johannesburg, South Africa. The aliens aboard are weak and dying, and are eventually moved to a shabby refugee camp where they are feared and misunderstood by the locals, and taken advantage of by ganglords.  Meanwhile their technology is being studied by a multinational corporation that hopes to take advantage of their advanced weaponry.  When the timid bureaucrat Wikus is charged with leading an operation to transplant the \\"prawns\\" (as they are called by the locals) to a new camp, he is inadvertently drawn into their plight.<br /><br />District 9 represents a truly inventive and exciting new voice in science fiction, that at its best tends to exploit the ideas and resources of the genre (aliens, futuristic technology, alternate realities) in order to explore present day issues, such as how we tend to fear, abuse and exploit \\"aliens\\" on our own planet.  Or how our fears can make us vulnerable, and our ignorance makes us weak.  The film challenges us to ask what it means to be human, especially when we treat other intelligent beings as \\"other.\\"  It's also a thrilling film, that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved that the main character was not an \\"action star\\" but a timid bureaucrat, both likable in his own way and betraying the prejudices of ignorance.  This is a cleverly written and intelligent film, that plays with the conventions of science fiction genre film by merging with documentary, but without quite falling into the \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Cloverfield\\" style shaky cam home movie realism.  A lot of fun to watch, and left me with lots to think about.
B001SN78JO|4.0|Jim Carrey at his best and Zoey Deschanel shines as an spontaneous, lively gal.  The perfect movie to give you a boost of positive energy while making fun of  the power (and consequences) of the word YES!!!.   The \\"Harry Potter party\\" sequence will be a classic.  I totally recommend this movie.     The DVD has some good additional language options (subtitles or movie in Spanish and French)
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Guten Abend,  Usually, these Star Trek films are pretty bad stuff. I turned my eyes up to the promos for this one. It looked like a \\"Kids of Star Trek\\" sort of thing. It's pretty good. A bit confusing to me the first time. I didn't realize how they were working the time line. I didn't like the mining ship (made by Gillette?). I find it questionable that they used such a technologically-advanced background (ships, primarily) for what was occurring in the past. The old Star Trek episodes provided many views of Commander Pike's days. The main plot was developed nicely, & plays well w/some surprises thrown in. Well done. Considering some of the crap they've put out in the past w/this franchise. I'll add: It's about time. See You next time;-).
B0026P3G12|5.0|I Dreamed A Dream is a phenominal album, especially in view of Susan Boyle's life. When she stepped out on that stage, she knocked the smirking self-appointed critics on their smug keisters -- and it was as if the whole world fell in love with her.<br /><br />I Dreamed A Dream would be every bit as phenominal, even without the knowledge of Ms. Boyle's background, because she is a mega-talent with the power to win over the most sophisticated audience with a talent that is pure gold.<br /><br />I am mesmerized by this woman's voice.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan boyle's voice is so easy to listen to. Her songs seem to have been picked for the meaning in the words.Very pleased with the cd. Looking forward to her next one!
B000JML7YC|5.0|This was the first of Austen's novels to be accepted for publication (although it wasn't actually published for many years after). It's every bit as clever, witty, and multi-layered as her other books, and if you enjoy _Pride and Prejudice_ or _Mansfield Park_ you'll like this one, too.  Austen wrote this book as a satire & parody of contemporary gothic novels and romances, and much of the humor in it comes from the heroine (a well-meaning, humble, honest, naive, and slightly silly girl) unwisely applying the conventions of gothic novels to real life. I recommend it especially to fans of Austen's wit, as it contains some of her most sharply-pointed writing.<br /><br />Like a lot of Austen's novels, there's an access problem; she presumes you're a member of 18th-century upper crust british society, and thus understand perfectly her references to carriage types, dress fabrics, etc. -- often, looking up precisely what different period terms refer to -- for example, what a \\"curricle\\" and a \\"gig\\" are -- will help explicate the jokes underlying specific passages. For similar reasons, it's often useful to watch a film or TV version of Austen novels before reading them, to help familiarize yourself with the socio-economic environment.<br /><br />Similarly, it'll help when reading this if you've read a lot of contemporary Gothic fiction. The Kindle makes this easy, fortunately -- it may be worthwhile to grab a Kindle version of [[ASIN:B002RKRS06 The Mysteries of Udolpho]] first (perhaps also [[ASIN:B002RKSXGY The Monk]]).<br /><br />Still, though, if you like Austen, this is one of her great novels, and you'll enjoy it regardless of whether or not you're familiar with the background she's drawing on. But doing some spadework beforehand will be richly rewarded.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|This is a good turntable for the price, especially if your intent is to convert your old LPs to CDs or similar. As others have described, the item is made of lightweight plastic. However, with some care, I hope it will last a good long time.    Physical connection to the computer via USB could not be easier -- however the software instructions are a little difficult to follow. Recommend using the 'quick start' sheet rather than the more longwinded descriptive directions, which are more confusing. As others have noted, the software contains a lot of bells and whistles. However, the version that came with my machine had a step-by-step instant tutorial, complete with flashing boxes and pointing hands, to get started with. Kind of humorous, but worked.    The one odd thing we did notice...and this would be a BIG thing if we wanted to listen to records 'live' with the turntable connected directly to the stereo...was that some albums seem to record at a speed slightly faster than 33 1/3. The effect wasn't quite \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" but a jazz album was ever so slightly more 'energetic' than originally intended. After trying various troubleshooting ideas to figure whether the problem was in the software or the turntable, decided it was the turntable...and perhaps the problem is with the lighter-weight discs. Example: a record from 1957 tracked at exactly the right speed, while a more flimsy one from 1981 ran a little fast. A variation of the old 'penny on the tone arm' trick (this time pennies taped to the record label) was inconclusive.     In the end, however, the Sound Forge software offers an option called Time Stretch, under the Process menu, which allowed the addition of just a few seconds to the total playing time, to the already saved mp3 track. This fixed the problem marvelously. I have no idea what it did -- am guessing that it inserted micro-seconds throughout the affected musical selections, so minute that individually they are un-noticeable but taken alltogether, producing a very slight slowing down of the tempo. It may be a bit of a pain to have to 'finesse' either track by track or album by album but, heck, I'll probably only have to do it once, and it is looking like a long winter here!    Turntable is a good value, relatively easy to use, and it is fantastic to listen again to music that I thought was lost forever. A dear friend babysat my record albums for over a decade and then drove 1,200 miles round-trip to bring them to me this summer -- I'm in heaven!
B002MW50KY|5.0|I bought Dylan's \\"Christmas In The Heart,\\" a wonderful bit of personal fun between the bard and his fans. It's a great repertoire of fifteen Christmas favorites you can sing along with, drowning out the now-gravelly voiced Dylan, if listening's a problem for you.   \\"Must Be Santa\\" is a true treat for kids to learn, with clever repetitions of key lyrical elements from previous lines, building to a raucous end. It's fun for children and childlike fun for adults! A joke is thrown in for the cognoscenti among Dylan contemporaries.   I got the Limited Edition Deluxe Package with five blank holiday cards with the 'Currier and Ives-like' CD cover on the front.   A host of musicians and singers join Dylan in the work, making a delightful holiday album to enjoy in years to come.   All proceeds go to feed hungry people, a splendid gesture by a splendid fellow, which was a bonus in this tragic American winter of 2009. Some 3 million homes have been foreclosed on so far, putting millions out on the cold streets desperate to find other accommodations, dependent on the rentier class. The social implications of that many people and their families thrown into crisis by the predatory land-grabbers, the banksters and their politically-positioned co-conspirators are complex and will be long-lasting. Hungry people do desperate things to feed themselves and their families. People crowd into houses with relatives, friends, strangers. Conflicts and abuses take place in that crowding that may never heal. Spirits get crushed and may never recover. Some move out to escape it, moving in with other relatives, friends, strangers, and more problems ensue. It's a quietly violent economic and social war on people all over planet Earth. The casualties are mounting as we speak.  Find a food pantry in your town. Share a little of your good fortune. You may save a life, and strengthen a soul, especially your own.
B001993Y2C|5.0|This review is a little premature as I havent seen the the last half of season four. I had previously watched the three and half seasons on dvd but on receiving the blurays have decided to start at the beginning. I am half way through season one and could complain about the non bluray type grain on certain scenes and perhaps the lack of extended versions that could have been added to get away from the tv like fade ins and outs (more movie like presentation) but I'm not. Form the very first second of the pilot I was drawn into this story both sonically and visually, this series is the bench mark for all sci fi/drama, Star Trek 2009 being the other. The bluray adds the imperfections of an ageing Galactica, its almost aircraft carrier look, the battle scenes loose their cramped tv like feel and most importantly Caprica 6 is perhaps the most beautiful/sexy bad guy ever.  This the ultimate box set of the ultimate sci fi in the ultimate format.

1594489505|5.0|\\"Afghan-American novelist Hosseini follows up his bestselling The Kite Runner with another searing epic of Afghanistan in turmoil. The story covers three decades of anti-Soviet jihad, civil war and Taliban tyranny through the lives of two women. Mariam is the scorned illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman, forced at age 15 into marrying the 40-year-old Rasheed, who grows increasingly brutal as she fails to produce a child. Eighteen later, Rasheed takes another wife, 14-year-old Laila, a smart and spirited girl whose only other options, after her parents are killed by rocket fire, are prostitution or starvation. Against a backdrop of unending war, Mariam and Laila become allies in an asymmetrical battle with Rasheed, whose violent misogyny is endorsed by custom and law. Hosseini gives a forceful but nuanced portrait of a patriarchal despotism where women are agonizingly dependent on fathers, husbands and especially sons, the bearing of male children being their sole path to social status. His tale is a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan, but also a lyrical evocation of the lives and enduring hopes of its resilient characters.\\"--From Publishers Weekly    I read the Kite Runner and found out the author had written another book. I checked it out and found it to be a terrific book.   It's set in Afghanistan and depicts the tough lives that women face.  You really feel for the 2 characters and what they go through.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you have any reservations about watching this show, drop them now. It is amazing. If almost 3000 reviews saying that it is amazing do not convince you, obviously you need to check it out for yourself. Trust me. Thank me later.
0385339089|5.0|The Client is, overall, an enjoyable book. Although it does drag in places and some of the \\"lawyer-ese\\" is too much, the characterization and plot are quite interesting. It is a very suspenseful novel with twists and turns which kept me up till 4 am reading. What makes the book so good is the complex characters. Mark Sway--an eleven year old, trailor-trash, kid is brilliant and foolish all at the same time which keeps the book moving well because every time he gets himself out of a situation, he always manages to get himself into another. He talks like he's 45 and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He also questions a lot about society and the legal system in such a childlike matter that it really makes you stop and think about your position on the topic and what you would tell an 11 year old kid. Reggie Love is definitely the most complex character. After a painful divorce, attempted suicide, and commitment into various mental facilities, she begins a new life as a smart-talking, witty, clever, and absolutely crazy lawyer who you just have to love. They call it her \\"second life\\" and she lives it to it's fullest. Only a 4 year lawyer and shes able to outsmart the FBI. She cares so much, too much, about her \\"little clients\\" and although she denies it, is willing to risk her life for some of them. Shes a very strong character, but still very vulnerable, which makes for a great story. Foltrigg (sp?), is the opposing, big-headed, stuck up, U.S. prosecuting attorney who is absolutely determined to win the case no matter the extremes. Completely engrossed in his job, he really helps display the infamous view of the lying, cheating, snake-like lawyers which we all hate so dearly, yet, Grisham also makes it seem like he is just trying to do his job. The plot, which is outlined in every other review, therefore pointless for me to elaborate :), is either full-blown action, or boring, drag along lawyer stuff and mob talk. Basically, at some parts you can't put the bookdown and then at others you are just waiting in agony for something exciting to happen, but its well worth the wait. Overall--I'd only read it if you have a lot of time becasue you might not be able to put it down. Then rent the movie. The movie has a great ending too.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is the best Star Trek movie I've seen in a long time.  The actors stayed true to the roots of the original characters while still adding some new twists.  The screenwriters/director deserve major props for re-booting this franchise.      The plot keeps moving along and you're not bored for an instant.  Plus, the original Spock makes a cameo.  I think Trek and non-Trek fans will enjoy this simply because it's an entertaining movie.  I hope they make another.

0156027321|5.0|\\"A fabulous romp through an imagination by turns ecstatic, cunning, despairing and resilient, this novel is an impressive achievement \\"a story that will make you believe in God,\\" as one character says. The peripatetic Pi (ne the much-taunted Piscine) Patel spends a beguiling boyhood in Pondicherry, India, as the son of a zookeeper. Growing up beside the wild beasts, Pi gathers an encyclopedic knowledge of the animal world. His curious mind also makes the leap from his native Hinduism to Christianity and Islam, all three of which he practices with joyous abandon. In his 16th year, Pi sets sail with his family and some of their menagerie to start a new life in Canada. Halfway to Midway Island, the ship sinks into the Pacific, leaving Pi stranded on a life raft with a hyena, an orangutan, an injured zebra and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After the beast dispatches the others, Pi is left to survive for 227 days with his large feline companion on the 26-foot-long raft, using all his knowledge, wits and faith to keep himself alive. The scenes flow together effortlessly, and the sharp observations of the young narrator keep the tale brisk and engaging. Martel's potentially unbelievable plot line soon demolishes the reader's defenses, cleverly set up by events of young Pi's life that almost naturally lead to his biggest ordeal.\\"    I read this book, and at first you wonder how the author is going to make you believe this plot.  But he does, and it's very imaginative.  I read this on a plane and couldn't put it down.  Awesome.
B000HIVOI2|1.0|This is a review of the blu-ray version, not the movie itself.  If you already own the DVD version of this? Don't even think about buying this one.  Why?  Because its not a very good HD conversion. Way to grainy and dark  and colorless.  My dvd version actually looks better than this one on the 55 inch lcd.  This version has horrible picture quality, even at the sub 8 price I paid, I feel I got ripped off.  Off all the blurays I have purchased , this is by far the worse transfer I have ever see.  Save your money and wait till they do a real HD transfer.

B002NOAF9W|2.0|I'm still wrestling with the concept of adding 20 minutes of \\"bonus material\\" from the same concert(s) to a 47 minute album (disc #1), and putting it on a separate disc (disc #2), rather than combining them on to a single comprehensive disc (with room to spare).    Still drawing blanks.    OK - on to disc #3. We get the support acts from the shows. Good stuff here, but ... why ? Coulda been worse - what if they applied this treatment to other live Stones albums like \\"Still Life\\" ? Would we get the complete Henry Paul Band set ?    On to bonus DVD (disc #4). We get the concert video. Of just the 20 minutes of \\"bonus live tracks\\" (see disc #2).    WTF ?    I love the Stones and always dug \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\", but this is a mess.
B00003RQNJ|1.0|I was disappointed.  The CD was loose in the case and scratched when I rec'd it.  Also, it appeared to have been reshrink-wrapped and not \\"new condition\\" as advertized.

B001U0O8H0|5.0|Depeche Mode's new album \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is their new album on a new label, Capitol Records. Produced by Ben Hillier, who also did their final album for Reprise Records- 2005's \\"Playing The Angel\\". As always, Martin Gore handles the songwriting, save for \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Miles Away/The Truth Is\\" which were composed by the lead singer Dave Gahan. The songs \\"Hole To Feed\\", \\"In Sympathy\\" and the first single \\"Wrong\\" sound like vintage Depeche Mode. Pretty much all of the the thirteen tracks (Twelve, if you don't count the brief instrumental \\"Spacewalker\\") sound like vintage Depeche Mode. This album is a great effort for the guys who are legends in the world of synthpop and electronic music. Welcome back, guys.
B001OQCV60|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, and it was okay, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I would. The biggest problem I have with \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is that it isn't the clever, witty, intellectual detective comedy I thought it was going to be. In fact, it really wasn't much of a detective movie at all. Instead, it's more of a guy-oriented, buddy-cop action movie disguised as something else. Don't get me wrong: it's great for what it is. I was just expecting more. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are hilarious as Holmes and his sidekick, Dr. Watson, but I would have enjoyed seeing more clever banter between these two instead of just one fight sequence after another. Rachel McAdams has a supporting role in the film, but I didn't enjoy her part at all. I think that was more the fault of the script than the actress, since I always enjoy McAdams in movies. Overall, I didn't really like the plot of the film, and I thought the story was kind of choppy throughout. I just expected more from this movie than I got.

B002Q4TKAY|5.0|If you don't feel sheer, unadulterated joy numerous times while watching this video, you must be dead. I have seen the Killers twice and this DVD gives me the same wonderful feeling as a real live show. Not only is just about everyone standing throughout any Killers show - they're moving, often bouncing up and down with vigor. They are just incredible. If you like them, you'll love this. And Royal Albert Hall is a great place to film a show. If Brandon Flowers does seem winded at times (I didn't think he did) it's because he puts every ounce of himself into his performance. This CD/DVD combo is also a \\"killer\\" deal at this low, low price. Really. The CD is great, too. Take a bite out of life and get this DVD and CD!
0802130208|1.0|I read voraciously; I almost read for a living in almost every genre there is. I'm not one of the majority of Americans who read an average of one book a year. At least you know where I'm coming from when I say that I barely made it through the first 30-40 pages of this tome. It reminded me of old high school friends who constantly tried to make faces or hoot out tiresome jokes or recite plays on words that left the rest of us either groaning in disgust or avoiding the person entirely.<br />I have no idea how this won a prestigious award or garnered so many positive reviews. Maybe our tastes have sunk this low that Toole's suicide somehow places him in that rarefied air of the great \\"misunderstood\\" writer who was really trying to communicate complex truth in seemingly ridiculous narrative. No, I think it was a foolish man writing foolishness.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|Well, why bother? The overwhelming opinion is that this film \\"rocks\\" or whatever exclamation seems appropriate. Yet, its financial numbers are that it barely broke even with domestic ticket sales. I can't help but wonder what is really going on? Is it hype, spite or...? Does it matter? maybe not. What does matter to me is that this film is Star Trek for the masses and it shows. Filled with typical Hollywood \\"predictable irony\\" and even \\"cute\\" characters, to me this was simply nothing more than Hollywood schlock. Star Trek has been many things and Roddenberry's disagreements over certain movies and their tones is well known to fans. It is a fact that Star Trek as \\"Action Film\\" (ala Wrath of Khan) helped re-spark its popularity in the early 80's and maybe that is what is happening here. Chiefly however, Star Trek has mostly been Science Fiction wearing the guise of Action to sell it to the viewer, this film is the opposite; an Action film wearing the guise of Science Fiction. The differences may be subtle but are important. Whatever ST:The Wrath of Khan was, it was at least loyal to the ideas and characters which created it. This movie is not. Gone is the sense of technological fetishism so pervasive in earlier incarnations. Gone is the framework of common-sense/logic based technologies, gone is any sense of realistic interstellar Navy. Gone is well... do I really need to go on? What is left is (like far too many Hollywood blockbusters now-a-days) Cotton Candy, colorful, sweet and fluffy but not much really there. This films looks somewhat familiar but for the wrong reasons. Watching it, I can't help but feel that everything was designed by the same company that designed my MP3 player. The battles felt far more like Star Wars than Star Trek. Is this Dawson's Trek or Star Creek? I had trouble deciding which. Maybe Alpha Centauri 90210 or Melrose Trek or ...    Back to my first line: Why bother? Because I (a huge fan of TOS) can't help but feel there is something wrongwith this re-boot. That this is not the direction I would like to see it go. That J.J. Abrams (primarily an action guy)is the wrong person for the franchise and a feeling of regret that J. Michael Straczynski (a sci-fi guy) was not given the opportunity for his interpretation (you may or may not know he was in the running for handling this re-boot at one time).    With all of this said and because of the aforementioned Wrath of Khan, I must give any further Star Treks at least the chance of success but this one will not be in my collection and my hopes for any sequels remain dubious.
032147404X|2.0|I didn't give it 1 star for 2 reasons.      Reason 1 - I like quirky humor.  I liked the douglas adams reference of 42.  The dark humor relating to the profession. ect.     However, I found myself quickly annoyed by the running jokes.  I've been known to yell at a movie I'm watching on tv things like \\"come on, get on with it!\\"  This is the first time I've done that reading a book.    Reason 2 - The book gives equipment suggestions and what you can expect to spend.    However, this becomes outdated quickly.  By the time someone decides to invest in better equipment, it will be outdated equipment, but hopefully cheaper.    The rest of the book is junk.  Filler.  The value stinks.  This is an expensive book for what it is.    There are only two \\"secrets\\" of photography that are not secrets.  And not worth [...] bucks they want for this book.  Here they are.  Use a tripod/bipod/monopod and a remote trigger.  Lighting, shoot at dawn or dusk, and only at dawn and dusk, (or diffused light)    All the rest of the tricks in the book relating to composition ect, are common sense.  And not because after you read them you say \\"oh, yeah, that makes sense\\"  Many newbies will have these same concepts from the beginning.      I'm ashamed of buying this book and contibuting to the writers/publishers pocketbook.

B001PKHS68|5.0|The 1955 Hitchcock drama/thriller \\"To Catch a Thief\\" gets the high hat treatment as part of Paramount's two disc Centennial collection of movies.<br />The movie filmed in Vistavision(Hitchcock's first in this format)stars the suave,debonair and very much tanned Cary Grant and the soon to be real Princess of Monaco,looking stunning I might add,Grace Kelly.All outside footage was shot on the French Riviera in and around the Nice area...and beautiful is the scenery we see throughout.<br />The film concerns itself with a famous pre-WW2 thief by the name of John Robie(Grant).During the war he was part of the Maquis and became quite famous for his heroic exploits with them.After the war he went legit and is living a contented life in a wonderful villa over looking the Mediterranean until some 15 years later when another thief starts to pick up where Robie left off;copying Robie's style to a tee.<br />The local constabulary of course suspect him right away.When they come a-knocking Robie leads them on a wild goose chase and for the first while stays barely a step ahead of them.He seeks out an ex-Maquis friend named Bertani who runs a restaurant and who offers his assistance.However his staff,who are also all ex freedom fighters,view Robie as persona non grata,think he's guilty and want no part of him.<br />Bertani hooks him up with the local Lloyd's of London agent(John Williams) who is the insurer for many of the victim's of the thefts.Robie figures the best person to catch the thief is himself as no one would know the thief's next moves better.The agent supplies him with a list of individuals and their insured property so Robie can get a better handle on what and who might be next.<br />The police eventually catch Robie but release him on a short leash,so they think,in order for him to prove his innocence.Robie meets up with a rich American widower Jessie Stevens(Jessie Landis)and her daughter Francie(Kelly).It is inevitable that Kelly falls hard for Grant's charms but Francie knows from the start who he really is.She is a headstrong girl and won't take no to helping Robie play out his scheme.She gets him invited to a masquerade ball and it is at that event that Grant finally manages to get his man,er crook.Through a lonely vigil on the roof,while the police think he's on the grounds dancing with Francie(it is really the Lloyd's of London man in disguise),he finally comes face to face with the real thief and in the end catches and exonerates himself.The film ends with Grant and Kelly in a passionate embrace.....ahh,viva la romance!<br />The film,though not a great film,is still very enjoyable throughout and typical Hitchcock.(Watch for his cameo a short way into the film on a bus-Grant looks at him,then out the bus window to a fade out).It has a lot of plot twists and visual turns that keep you guessing throughout.The scenery in the film is just wonderful and is almost a travelogue in itself.It is of no coincidence that the film was shot where it was.This was a favourite spot for the Hitchcock clan to vacation at and Kelly herself about a year later would become the reigning queen of the principality of Monaco in this very region.<br />I would give the film itself four stars but in the technical department and with the features supplied in this set,I have added another star to give it full marks.The picture has been remastered wonderfully(as have all the films in this series)and the colours are crisp and rich looking.The second disc of this set contains a real bonanza of riches.Here are some of the things included:A short bio of Hitchcock,a short film on the censorship code prevelant during the /50s,a short on the writing and casting of the film,a short on the making of the film,a short look at its' two main stars,an \\"appreciative\\" look at the film,a short on costumer Edith Head,the trailer,several still galleries and an interactive map of the the French Riviera and the actual spots at which the film was shot.I think you will agreethis is a stunning array of extras which makes overall for an even more enjoyable experience.<br />In conclusion,the film gets a solid four stars and the extras contained therein push it all the way to the max.An intriguing and interesting plot keeps one guessing throughout the films run.With this restored print the scenery is shown at its' magnificent best,as are its' cast and two main stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.This is the only way \\"To Catch a Thief\\".extras which makes overall for an even more enjoyable experience.  In conclusion,the film gets a solid four stars and the extras contained therein push it all the way to the max.An intriguing and interesting plot keeps one guessing throughout the films run.With this restored print the scenery is shown at its' magnificent best,as are its' cast and two main stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.This is the only way \\"To Catch a Thief\\".
1416550542|5.0|This is an outstanding book; an enjoyable read all the way through; I just couldnt put it down. The characters are revealed vividly and robustly through smooth and eloquent prose. The time sequencing forms an early rhythem, helping to build the suspense which carries the story.  My only (mild) regret is that I think it could have been a little longer, to help explain more about some of the secondary characters (such as Linus).  I enjoyed reading this so much that I am considering reading it again! I hope there will be a movie.

Up's greatest trait is how it uses animation. Pixar Studios continue to amaze me with the extreme detail and color used in their films. Lush, vivid palate of colors pop and shine through the film. The crisp animations put in Up are truly a site to see. Using wilderness to their advantage, Pixar paints beautiful vistas with their South American backdrop.     Thematically, Up's story keeps Pixar's wonderful reputation of giving strong social comentary and overarching alligories. Matching the strength of Cars and Wall-E, Up holds more than its own  in depth. Up's message turned to be more entertaining than the plot was. Pixar delved into the absurdity realm one too many times for me to think of Up as a true masterpiece. As enjoyable as it was, Up transformed into more of a \\"Saturday morning cartoon\\" at pivital points where it could have achieved greatness. The opening third of the movie was some of the best story-telling and direction I have seen the company produce, and the ending was very heart-warming. It's a shame that the middle section could not keep the same greatness in story. It was a par movie, plot wise, but I couldn't help but think Pixar mixed to many concepts together.     Pixar Studios has produced fine film. Up meets, and pushes past, many of Pixar's renown movie making qualities. Animation? Brilliant. Concept? Fantastic. Story? Janky in the middle, but superb on the inside and out. Exicution? As you've came to expect. This may not be Pixar in it's prime, but missing any Pixar film would be tragic.
B00110K62U|5.0|This concert style of presentation gives us viewers the best of the best from around the world.  I love the musical and I love this DVD.  The quality is near high definition; excellent.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This is easily my favorite album. The songs are fun and uplifting and work well together. Jason Mraz is a brilliant artist. While he is best heard live this album epitomizes his energy and his humor. \\"I'm Yours\\", \\"Lucky\\", \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mess\\"... songs I never tire of hearing.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|If you have read the MPAA PG-13 rating for \\"intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking\\" and you are still asking \\"should I take my younger child to go see this movie,\\" this review is for you.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, my husband and I took all five (ages 8, 7, 6, 4, 3) of our children with us to see Avatar. We live in Japan, and the dialogue was in English with Japanese subtitles.<br /><br />True to the rating, there were a few fecal matter related swearing instances, nudish blue humanoid Na'vi decked in strategically placed beads and loin-cloth size clothes, kissing and implied sex. The fibril linking between the Na'vi and the beings in their world was brilliant but erotic. The kids didn't notice.<br /><br />Children younger than 13, especially those who are acquainted with video games and sci-fi, should be fine with parental supervision.<br /><br />All of my children enjoyed the movie. My six year old, who has a tough exterior, a tender heart, and kicks butt on [[ASIN:B001HWB68K Halo 3: ODST]], held my hand during one of the battle scenes. He did not cover his eyes, he just wanted to know that I was nearby. He will kill me someday for sharing this with my readers.<br /><br />While the MPAA was fretting over cigarette smoking, the strong focus on pantheism was the most malignant aspect of the movie. Today (Christmas morning here) I intend to talk with my children about praying to the spirit of the earth versus praying to the Almighty God. We have had a similar conversation over G-Rated [[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)]]. Keep in mind, in a country where less than 1% of the population are Christian, my children are exposed to the worship of false gods from the moment we step outdoors. We are sensitive to this, as we should be.<br /><br />The movie is gorgeous. I have never seen such CG. The creatures, plant life... the whole world of Pandora... was amazing. I am in awe of James Cameron's ability to capture a glimpse of his genius and share with us creative plebeians. The bioluminescenct plants in the forest were so other-world beautiful, I wanted to touch them.<br /><br />I cannot wait to see the pictures my children will draw for the refrigerator gallery after seeing Avatar.<br /><br />While I did not experience Avatar in I-MAX with 3D glasses, I have a feeling it would have been fun. Without these enhancements, I imagine my viewing experience would compare to walking through an iridescent-on-black-velvet Ocean City, NJ, boardwalk poster shop without the UV lights.<br /><br />Jake Sully, the film's hero, is a paraplegic There's-No-Such-Thing-As-an-Ex-Marine. His twin brother was a doctor set to work on planet Pandora as a driver for a DNA-personalized avatar. Through mind control, drivers are able to safely operate their avatars from a distant base while they interact with the Na'vi aliens in the forest. Shortly before the mission begins, Jake's brother dies. Jake's biochemistry was a match and, despite lack of scientific training, he is offered his brother's job.<br /><br />When Jake's mind was reborn into his perfect new avatar body, he couldn't contain his overwhelming joy at being able to walk again. It was very moving.(There is one other moment that grabbed me by the heart. I won't spoil the moment, but when you hear the line, \\"My Jake,\\" remember this review!) I loved the character's determination despite his bum legs. He kept up and never made excuses or complained. He did not allow others to treat him delicately.<br /><br />I am looking forward to revisiting a dialog on with my children on disabilities, and asking them what they would do if their legs stopped working.<br /><br />Cameron captured the details of the world and the characters very well. He underscored the clashes that occur between corporate interests, a private military company, and scientists on the ground who are all working on the same project for different reasons, and how eachgroup interacts with each other and with indigenous inhabitants.<br /><br />The storyline, albeit entertaining, was a recycled one. While I was distracted by the gorgeousness of the animation and the how-did-he-think-of-that creature concepts, deep down I felt like watching a sequel to [[ASIN:B000A9QK78 FernGully: The Last Rainforest (Family Fun Edition)]].<br /><br />FernGully is a magical rain forest inhabited by fairies. A logging company harvests trees from the forest and threatens to destroy the forest environment and the fairies' world in the process.<br /><br />One of the loggers, pure-hearted Zak, gets lost in the forest and is accidentally shrunk by one of the FernGully fairies. Fairy-sized, he can view the world from their perspective. Like Jake, Zak comes to understand the symbiotic relationship between the forest's inhabitants and the beautiful environment around them. Things are going well between Zak and the fairies until the logging crew knocks down a huge, spiraling tree, nearly identical in appearance to a large tree at the heart of the forest in Pandora that is also destroyed. When the tree is destroyed, an ancient evil is unleashed and the fairies realize that, although Zak looks like one of them, he is still a logger. Zak must chose between his job in the human realm and helping the forest fairies he loves. Can you guess what he does?<br /><br />Avatar was a movie that went well with popcorn. We enjoyed seeing it as a family, but we also enjoy the discussions that come from watching a stories unfold. Sexuality, violence, stewardship and praying to false gods are things we have talked about before, and I felt comfortable allowing my children to view instances to the degree portrayed in this film while sitting next to me.<br /><br />Do I think that children should be exposed to worldviews other than their own?

B000TDIDTI|3.0|There is no escaping Deva Premal when you are looking for meditation/yoga music by a female artist, so I keep giving it a try.  Many people call her voice \\"angelic,\\" but I just don't agree.  I would call it \\"syrupy.\\"  There is too much trying to sound sweet, there is that vibration in the voice which I never hear in other kirtan songs, and the background music is just too much elevator music.  All of Deva Premal's albums are like American Idol style kirtan, it may work well in spas, but I wouldn't consider it to be spiritual music.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Nikki once again stay true. The music is so intense and goes straight to the bones. Would recommend to anyone who has already seen the book.
0060763280|5.0|I've read hundreds of self help, wealth and money management books and I have to say this is one of the absolute best! From the second I started reading I couldn't put it down.  Just finished the first reading, I might read it a second time right away, it's THAT good.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|cd would not play (\\"unreadable\\" was displayed) nor eject. cd was stuck in our bose cd player so we had no christmas music. we were afraid we would have to take it to the bose store for removal, an hour and a half drive away but finally researched removal tricks on the internet. now we see the disc is severely scratched and smudged.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|An incredible motion picture that captures the Passion in a way no one else has. Highly recommended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|\\"I Dreamed A Dream.\\"  What a sucess story.  Beautiful songs with a range of themes.  Susan seems to speak from her heart of joys, sorrows, disappointments, challenges and remarkable accomplishments.  I listen to it everyday while driving too and from work.
0307460444|5.0|As an avid baker, I've found that Martha's recipes are usually pretty good - if you follow the recipe exactly, the result will look just like the photo.  This book is no exception. The recipes that I've made so far have resulted in some delicious desserts!    The major value in this book over others is that there's a large variety of recipes (not just the same basic recipes with a few add-ins, lots of photos and decorating ideas/tips. Most of the recipes/decorating are do-able for even a fairly novice baker.  I recommend this book to all cupcake connoisseurs and recreational bakers alike.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|Excellent audiovisual material from U2. With songs that marked an era, and especially with a great DVD extras, with performances not seen before. It is unmissable for fans to have him
B0009MAO46|5.0|dvd was in perfect playing condition, it arrived much faster than advertised, maybe 3 days after order was placed. i highly recommend this seller
0385737424|5.0|This book is amazing!!!! The plot is suspensful and intriguing, and the author is a phenomenal writer. The book gives you enough \\"clues\\", but you just can't figure it out. When it finally wraps up, the ending is perfect and a great close.<br />Not to long, not to short, enticing and one of the best books ever!!<br />This book seems is great for almost all audiences (maybe not tween and teen boys, but I can't imagine other people not liking it- there are no 1 and 2 starred reviews).<br /><br />A great read worth your money and time!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|when i first saw this book i was expecting the normal fantasy YA book. the main character has to find out about her magical past and fight evil but on the way she runs into some hot guy that she is destined to be with.     well i got that but it was not what i expected. the author pulled me inot this creative world that was so different then anything i have read. similar...but different. the polt was unique and always kept me on my toes. i couldnt stop reading it. the relationship that clary and jace are in is very different then other YA books. clary wasnt swooning over jace the whole time but yet after you read a scene with the two together u felt warm inside and at the same time you wanted to shout at the two. it was also the perfect lenght. good ending. strong characters. and a magical world of werewolves. vampires. and nephiiam to get lost in. enjoy
B000PDYVVG|3.0|It's enjoyable. I love reading that invites you inside people's heads which this certainly does; combining it with a travelogue makes it even more entertaining.  Having said that, there is nothing terribly original or impressive. it's enjoyable but not a literary feat, as should be expected.    Yes, she talks about herself a lot, but Hey Now, it's her memoir! More power to her.
1421532255|4.0|I liked reading this book a lot better than watching L Change the World (movie). The book is almost totally different. It is more action packed and adventurous. I found the movie a bit dull. Part 1 and 2 of the whole movie series are good, but part three is a bit dull movie wise. The book is really awesome and will make up for a dull movie. If you have never seen the anime series , than you should definitely watch that. The anime series is the best and most interesting. A lot is left out in these movies from what you see when you watch the anime. I actually read this book before I watched the movies and anime, and I understood what was going on with no problem. It was action packed and interesting from the beginning. But it definitely wasn't worth the near 20 bucks I spent on it at Barnes and nobles
B001FB55M6|3.0|3 of 5 stars for the comedy movie Yes Man staring Jim Carrey.Yes, it was funny and had some great situations. In general, I don't much like Carrey's work, this one was OK. Imagine a cult that teaches its members to say Yes to everything. \\"Can I borrow lots of money?\\" \\"Yes\\". Well, that is the basic idea of the movie. How much trouble can a person get into by always saying yes? Ah, go jump off a bridge; Yes. That leads to a bungie jump from a local bridge. Zooey Deschanel plays Carrey's girlfriend and is very impressive (and cute). This movie is easy on your brain, fun to watch and well worth the time and efforts. So, did I like the movie? Ah ah ah, YES. Do I recommend it? Ah, YES. Will I give you money? Ah ah NO WAY.
0691142165|5.0|It is hard to over-praise \\"This Time is Different\\" by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.  Sweeping, factual and accessible, this book will complement, if not replace, Kindleberger's \\"Manias, Panics, and Crashes\\" as the first stop to understanding financial crises.  You have to like reading tables and charts to appreciate this book, although its ability to say so much with simple descriptive statistics is enormously appealing.       \\"This Time is Different\\" explores many themes: the pervasiveness of financial crises, including among countries which we do not normally associate with crisis.  Development and crisis have never been as closely linked as in this reading.  Banking crises are omnipresent in advanced and emerging economies alike and have been so for years.  There are striking similarities in the build-up to a crisis, whether in emerging or advanced economies: increased public and private debt and asset bubbles in equity or real estate.  And the clean-up costs are universally high, not only in direct costs but also in increased assumed liabilities by the state.    The book will have an ever greater impact in at least three ways.  First, it is pregnant with ideas.  One can see dozens of doctoral theses emerging to complete or revise the data in the book, to test and re-test its hypotheses, and to provide answers to the many puzzles raised therein.  From personal finance to sovereign risk rating, from economics to political economy and international relations, this book is full of threads to pull and nuggets to mull over.    Second, the book's direct and continuous assault on the paucity of data on several vital economic indicators is refreshing to those who have spent any time tracking data that is impossible to find.  If any effort to get better data springs from this book, driven by governments or intentional organizations, the debts we will owe the authors will be enormous.     Finally, there is the \\"This Time is Different\\" lens.  At first, I thought it aclever attempt to give the book an angle, which it does.  But as you read the book, you sense something more: it is an argument that when things look like they are out of control, they usually are - even when there is no one on earth who can say when the bust will come or what will trigger it.  If during the next run-up to a crisis, there are policymakers who say we need to act even though things looks good, this book of 460-odd pages may save us all billions if not trillions of dollars.  And how can you beat that?
0060558121|1.0|I'm sorry, but after the first 100 pages I became apprehensive about my chosing this book.  I enjoyed the character of Shadow until he began to morph into a bad acid trip.  Guess I'm really just not that into the \\"gods\\" or mythology.  I'm sure those who DO enjoy Celtic and Native American mythology would be the ones to really get into this book.  As far as the other \\"gods\\", I haven't a clue as to what that's about.  It gave me a headache.
B001TWT0A4|1.0|The only reason to keep this very very poor re-write of Rio Bravo is for the maganificent Olag wieghorst oil paintings and the wonderful title song and Ms Holt who is quite hot and delivers the classic line 'I am woman enough for both of you'.    James Caan and the costumes are bad especially his stupid hat.    Even Olag and Ms Holt could not persuade me to keep this dvd or watch it again.    How can Hawks make such a good film as Rio Bravo and then this nonsense ?
031606792X|5.0|I didn't think that me being 43, I would get into this series. However, after seeing New Moon, I just had to read the books. Stephanie Meyer made a comment that her first book, \\"Twighlight\\" was slow. I agree, it was. Just because it was a slower read than the rest of the books, it didn't mean, to me, that it was not heartfelt, warming and suspensful. I look at the character's in \\"Twightlight\\" as a way to warm up to them. I am glad that she put more action and romance in \\"New Moon\\". After \\"Twighlight\\", I read through the rest of the series with a furious, manic and an insatiable speed. I could not put the books down. Reading the Twighlight saga was like a drug addiction. Each book had more and more romance and suspense; more to anticipate and look forward to.     I fell in love with Bella and Edward. Their love for each other was such a magnitude of passion that I have never experienced in a book. I carried them with me throughout all my day.     I really, really am hoping that Stephanie will someday write a fifth book just so we can revisit these characters again. There is so much she can expand on, such as, Jacob and Renesmee's relationship and future dealings with the Volturi. A fifth book would be like a reunion with old friends and family.    \\"Breaking Dawn\\" ended well. However, I still wanted more though. I will miss these characters and the euphoric and elated feeling I felt reading about them.     Stephanie,    You did well!!!!!!
B002PMV9FG|2.0|Like many others who saw this movie on the first available showing, I was dismayed by this film. All films adapted from books make changes and this is especially true in the Harry Potter series where so many characters exist and the story is both a coming of age teen book and a minor fantasy epic. The problem with the Half Blood Prince is that it does neither well as a film. They added utterly nonsense scenes like the destruction of the Weasley home while doing away with so much of Harry's interactions with his peers like Luna, Neville and even Ginny. Additionally, the way they filmed the movie it makes an incredibly poor showing on home video as it is very dark, not just in setting and tone but the picture as well. Playing it on my smaller television left me utterly incapable of even seeing the picture at times, something that does not happen with any other movie in my collection. All in all, while Half Blood Prince was one of my favorite of the books it is easily the worst of the series and should really only be purchased if you are, like me, the sort of person who has to have the entire collection.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I got introduced to the series at the end of season 3. Couldn't wait for the reruns for season 2 so bought it. LOVE THE CHARACTERS. Can't wait until season 3 goes on sale and I'm there!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince is one of my favorite books in the series and it was with great expectations that I went to see it this in July in theaters. I left somewhat thrilled AND disappointed. Why? For a few reasons, just look at the other reviews here and you will see that about half of them are positive and half negative. They left quite a bit of what I would think is important material from the book which is sad and ruined the experience for many fans and it could have been one closer to the book. It's going to be hard to make the last two HP movies because of this. On the good side the special effects were great and the scenes that were present from the book are great and besides HP 6 being very dark it's also very funny at times and the movie looked amazing. The acting was mostly good I've got no complaints here. It seems each year the movies get darker and this one is really dark, I think it's great and it makes a progression from a movie to another. They clearly didn't follow the book enough like a fan would have wanted but I want to make it clear that didn't prevent me from liking this movie and even buying it. When watching the excellent special features, you may notice how some deleted scenes should have made it to the final cut. Besides all that, there is only so much time in a movie that can't include everything they might have wanted to. I'm not only a fan of the books but a fan of the movies as well and I don't think this one is bad at all, it should have stuck more to the book it's true but the result is still a great movie.

This is truly a great cd and the DVD portion is a great treat from single ladies to sweet dreams beyonce layed down her mark and stamped her position as a true diva.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|We, a German-American family, saw the movie. We agreed that the actor who played the main SS officer was the real star, because he exhibited the awful core of psychological terror in so realistic and seductive a way that we as audience felt the horror. A second German actor played a similar role in a cellar bar equally well. The movie is otherwise intended and comes across as a complete farce. Brad Pitt plays a hillbilly from Maynardville, Tenn., who leads a group of Jewish brutes (no doctors, lawyers, professors in that crowd!) into France to commit acts against the Nazis that are at least equal to those committed against the Jews. Pitt plays the Tennesee hillbilly role to a T, especially with the local dialect, so much so that he more or less plays one of my in laws (I grew up across the border from Maynardville). See it, it's a farce interspersed with the awful terror of that era. To the producer's credit, this film is played in English, German, French, and Italian, a wonderful development! Nothing more silly than an actor portraying an SS officer speaking English (or, vice versa, than a German actor playing an American soldier). The languages are spoken by people who really speak them, aside from Pitt who did a damn good and funny job of simulating Hilliebillie language.<br /><br />Note added: 'Hillbilly English' stems from an old Scottish English dialect (\\"I recken hit'll rain ta'mar\\".), the German immigrants in the Appalachians in the early 19th century were taught English by the Scotish immigrants. Both groups migrated down the Shenandoah Valley from Pa. and Md. into southern Va., Tenn., Ky., and the Carolinas. See Klaus Wust's 'The Virginia Germans'.
B0028Y4UOI|5.0|The Lord of the Rings movies have the perfect combination of emotional acting, fantastical scenery, and thrilling plot twists. Peter Jackson and his team did a superb job and deserved every single Oscar they got. The movies are a wonderful tribute to the books.

If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the greatest adventure in cinematography during the past decade.<br /><br />Two Towers is well done, but probably my least favorite of the trilogy. However, the battle scene at Helm's Deep is very emotional - probably the most realistic and emotional war scenes I've seen in a movie outside of a World War II movie. The 10,000 Uruk-hai marching on Rohan is a sight you'll never forget.

The telling of this story was a real treat as I am always searching for the ways in which we connect, and we are all connected in one way or another.

B0025KVLT2|4.0|I've seen Rubber Soul marked as the time when the Beatles started really coming into their own as musicians, creating songs that went beyond simply ditties about love (although that's still a common theme), and beyond that, crafting cohesive albums and popularizing the idea that they could be more than a group of singles with some filler holding them together. It's only their second studio release featuring no cover songs, and for the most part the praise seems to hold true. While I don't think it's quite a great album, it's a very consistent song, it's just that the songs tend to be good to very good rather than outstanding. That's not to say that there aren't standouts, because there are, whether they be among the band's dozens of very famous radio hits or just damn good compositions that I'm hearing for the first time. It doesn't impress me quite like the other albums I've heard, but it's still darn good, especially when you remember this came out in 1965.    The song I'm most familiar with is \\"In My Life\\", which I remember best from being the theme song in covered form of Providence, a show my mom used to watch a lot. I didn't realize it was a Beatles song for a while, but that doesn't prevent it from holding up as a very nice, nostalgic little tune. \\"Drive My Car\\", with the most traditional rock sound on the album and some nice piano in the chorus, and \\"Nowhere Man\\" are the other ones I'm sure I've heard before. The other ones that stick out tend to be primarily Lennon's work, though McCartney's \\"Michelle\\" is very nice and the two Harrison songs make me continue to wonder why his presence was so limited on these albums. Not that much though, because he was working with, uh... Lennon and McCartney. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" has its own thing going for it, and I really like \\"Girl\\" a lot, and I especially think the way the backing vocals during the bridge are later mimicked by guitars is something of a stroke of genius. Rubber Soul is a really important release in the band's history, and a fairly enjoyable one as well.
B0019DCDOS|5.0|The Lord of the Rings movies have the perfect combination of emotional acting, fantastical scenery, and thrilling plot twists. Peter Jackson and his team did a superb job and deserved every single Oscar they got. The movies are a wonderful tribute to the books. Fortunately, they've been made so well that they can be enjoyed by all, from the Tolkien aficionado to kids who haven't yet read the books. If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the greatest adventure in cinematography during the past decade.<br /><br />Two Towers is well done, but probably my least favorite of the trilogy.

B002T45VX6|5.0|I was totally disappointed with the UK version of this album that only has 10 tracks and plays for just 34 minutes. I bought it then sold it when I found out there was a European version with 12 tracks. So, I bought that one and then sold that when I discovered a Japanese 13 track edition which I then ordered. Selling my 12 track European edition and the Japanese edition, can you believe I then found out that the US version had 16 tracks on it. I just had to have it as it was the best value version for the money. I ordered it from Amazon.com and they delivered it very quickly to my address here in the UK without any kind of delays and well in time for the Christmas holidays. The US version is by far the better version of the album as it contains extras not on the UK/European/Japanese CDs. Well done to Amazon.com for this great CD.

I must admit however the DTS track on the DVD is hard to beat and far better sounding than I expected. I would love to see this kind of remastering work done on the entire Beatles collection, but this was exceptional remixing work in it's own right, \\"The Beatles like never before\\" is a very conservative statement.    I don't normally do reviews, but this was a clear exception.  A very well done piece of work.

0977326403|4.0|I work in church ministry and found the original Good to Great to be an amazing book. However, it definitely felt like there were parts of the book that either didn't apply to my setting, or needed to be changed. This very short addition is perfect. It really compliments the book well and is exactly what I felt was missing for those working in the social sector. Good stuff.

1400064287|4.0|As someone who has to prepare a sermon every week, I found the ideas in this book to be really helpful. If you feel that what you have to say is important and has the potential to really help someone, it's pretty important that what you say sticks. The book was full of great examples and very practical ideas. Highly recommended.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is just incredible. Here you have the album both Megadeth and Metallica have been trying to make for years. This is a tremendous return to form. I wasn't particularly impressed with United Abominations, but this shows that Dave definitely has it left in him. Great production, great riffing, and the signature Dave Mustaine snarling vocals. The only thing not very great about this album is the soloing. Chris Broderick is an incredible guitarist, but the soloing didn't impress me here. It's really just playing as fast as he can. I'd rather listen to a Friedman or Poland solo.    If I were to break down this album track by track I would give every song great reviews except for the last track, the Right To Go Insane. The verse riff is basically the take no prisoners riff played 8x slower. Still great and contains a great variety of songs. From fast and brutal (This Day We Fight) to melodic (44 Minutes) to the Youthanasia/Countdown hard rock style (How The Story Ends) and even a ballad reminiscent of A Tout Le Monde (Hardest Part Of Letting Go).    Stunning album. I got it the day of it's release. I spent 14 bucks on it and I think it was 14 bucks well spent.
B00000I07Q|5.0|I was kinda scared when i ordered it for so cheap, it got here fast, and was exactly what i wanted.  i thought it would be a single but its the whole album.  I AM VERY VERY HAPPY with my purchase.  i will be making more purchases from this sellerr in the future.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Was looking forward to this CD since first hearing Susan Boyle and have not been disappointed.  This album is not over produced and is not flashy and I was glad for that as I think part of Susan's appeal is her earthiness.  My favorite songs are actually the hymns on the album.  This is a very good CD and I would strongly urge people to buy it.

B000RO9VJK|5.0|I have been following the principles and ideas outlined in the emyth for many years. Over the last 6 months (06/2009 to present) I have been to a conference in Chicago, San Diego, Massacussets and Rhode Island and have heard the book referenced as a must read.  I liken the book to \\"think and grow rich by Napolian Hill\\"  Even though the book was written in the 30's it is principle based and is as powerful today as it was when it was written.
0440242576|3.0|With the Kranks only daughter, Blair, in Peru with the Peace Corps, they find themselves not feeling very festive this holiday season.  Nora is always thinking about Blair and on the verge of tears, while Luther, an accountant, starts looking into how much money Christmas costs them every year.  Luther gets the bright idea to skip Chirstmas this year - no tree, no gifts, no Christmas parties, etc. - and take a cruise instead.  They would actually be saving money considering Christmas cost them over $6,000 the previous year.  Their friends and neighbors don't take too well to their idea, however, and many hijinks ensue.<br /><br />This is only the second book I've read by Grisham.  I didn't like the first one (The Appeal) at all, but I found this one rather enjoyable.  It has everything you want in a light holiday read.  It's charming, funny, and manages to get the point of the holiday season across very well.  I can see me recommending it to my friends in the future.

It's barely OK.  Spend some extra cash and get the full version starring Colin Firth.  He is the best Darcy ever and that version is nearly a carbon copy of the book.  Very well done!
B001QWBM62|5.0|It does everything it says it does. I'm just wondering why the built in mic's have no protection. I don't want to try and snap them off, but they do look rather vulnerable. This is the only thing I can fault about the H4n.[[ASIN:B001QWBM62 Zoom H4n Handy Portable Digital Recorder]]
B001U0D786|2.0|I have always liked this movie. I bought it on Bluray in part because it is beautifully photographed. The print however is terrible. You would think that they could have run down a reasonable copy and perhaps even cleaned off the link off before digitizing it, but apparently not. Lots of white spots and random black crap on the print. The disc does not support 24 fps playback and doesn't even have a top menu. Save your money and stick with the DVD until someone can be bothered to make a reasonable transfer.

B0018CMJSU|4.0|Their was a problem, and its gone, and their was nothing they could do about it, and that's that. What ya gonna' do?  We had nothing to do with it, It was between the directors.<br /><br />Forgive my mixing of mob movie metaphors.<br />Their has been a lot of talk about the results of this restoration.  I think it can be split into two categories.  Image quality, and Image color.  The extras disc claims the movie was a victim of its own success, in that many more film prints for theaters were made from the original master than were expected.  This caused deterioration in the original master, and forty years later some of the frames in the original master are just gone and beyond repair. Can any of us say we haven't experienced some physical deterioration since 1970?  So they had to fill in the holes as best they could. This process is explained in detail on the extras disc.  In a nutshell, you can't fill in something with nothing, and the filler had to be consistent with the entire film or visa versa.  This is why it has been digitized, normalized, and has a bit of a video game look.  Given current technology, this is about as good as anyone could do.<br />Now about the Coloring, and blown out whites. This was a personal choice of the editors and director of photography who worked as a team during the restoration process.  According to the extras disc, Coppola signed off on the final copy but wasn't directly involved in the day to day restoration process.  The team claimed this is as close as possible as to what was seen at the theater when the film opened. The key words here are AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.<br />So, in a nutshell, the Coppola restoration is that in name only, but still is as good as any team could do given what they had to work with.  Pixel peepers won't be happy with it, but seldom are anyway, and since Mr. Peabody and his Wayback Machine hasn't been able to retrieve the unharmed original master from 1970, this is about as good as it gets.  If your looking for the resolution, and sharpness of Avitar, then you will be disappointed because it was never there in the first place.  It's a great film, so sit back and relax and Forget about it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Omigosh!  What a voice!  What a CD!  What a GREAT Christmas present!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|The action scenes in this film go on for quite some time and are rather frequent. However, one can't help but feel sympathy for both the unfortunate aliens and for the hapless human who gets caught up in matters he never thought he would be involved in.  One can detect many implications and ideas here, from racism and xenophobia to the problems of refugees, to the status that would be given to aliens who are stuck here, to the morality of using them for medical experiments, and much more.  You don't need to be a sci fi fan to understand the deeper meanings of what the filmmakers are getting across.  They also have done a fantastic job with the aliens--their look, their movements, and even their expressions.      It's also telling that they set the movie in Johannesburg, South Africa--I don't need to explain why.  Definitely worth a look and may be worth further discussion even in a classroom setting.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I ordered a copy of Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog because I'm a fan of Joss Whedon's work, especially with the actor Nathan Fillion. I found that it lived up to my expectations and I find it thoroughly entertaining. I have watched it at least ten times in just three days. Am I insane? Perhaps. But it is a musical after all, and you don't buy a new album and listen to it just once. My only regret is that I bought only one copy, as it would have made a fantastic holiday gift for pretty much everyone I know. I can highly recommend Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Do yourself a favour, order a copy and support an independent production.
B002Q9MZF6|1.0|I bought this film on blu-ray from Amazon but it was defective and I returned it for refund. My library had the dvd and I brought it home with great expectations.  What a disaster! The video quality may be o.k. but it takes someone who is definitely not an opera lover to put up with a production where the singers are OBVIOUSLY lip-synching. (Pavarotti's Rigoletto with the incredible Victoria Vergera as Maddalena is an even worse example of a production rendered unwatchable because of the apparent idiotic presumption that the viwer would accept it because of the star power involved)  Shame on everyone involved in this mess. Zero stars if allowed.  Save your money.

B002XTBE8I|5.0|I have listened to this album at Least a dozen times before posting this review. From the Start to finish this has got to be the best rap album to come out in the last several years.

The Rap and the Beats are going to be the next \\" new sound\\" for all other Rappers (and producers to follow). Eminem once again has proven that he is the best rapper walking the planet Earth today. And Dr Dre is of course Two steps ahead of the rest!! A flagship album that Directs the future of music!!!

B002NXSRVG|1.0|While it's obvious you can see what they were trying to do, and what they took from the cartoon and everything, and not a half bad plot to start, it just becomes convoluted and full of horrible plot holes.    Generic training montage, generic characters, pointless twists in the plot and even more pointless fight scenes. The main hero, Duke, is played by someone who really doesn't act at all. There's no real emotion, there's no caring about this guy, and (no hyperbole) there's rarely any changes in his facial expressions.     Then his sidekick is a generic 'hey I'm the funny non-threatening Black Guy who makes an ass out himself randomly' archtype. And the geeky 'If I spit out random technobabble it will sound plausible' foreign guy.     There are complications to the fight scenes added for no real reason other than to make explosions, or to drag out a fight scene. Or to make it look like a giant toy advertisement.     It's mindless, empty of anything resembling acting, and does nothing but provide explosions and shiny CGI to distract people from it's lack of a plot.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|There are some reviewers who are disappointed that Shapespeare himself didn't write the script, or that Johnny Depp didn't play the lead role.  To them I say \\"Be happy with what you get!\\"    This is a warm, amusing tale of a scandalous young man accustomed to using his rakish reputation to bed as many admiring young ladies as possible, and his efforts to thwart the authorities' attempts to control him.    It has the singular virtue that the viewer actually CARES about ALL the characters in the film, with witty dialogue, appropriately period music, and the stunning backdrop of Venice.  There are worthy performances by all involved, the comedic foils of  Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons being outstanding.    Heath Ledger has a superficial resemblance to images of Casanova, and has an easygoing charm that is heartwarming.    The beauties he pursues are perhaps less engaging than the lively Sienna Miller, who plays his main love interest.    In real life Giacomo Casanova was an extraordinary man.  He was highly intelligent and managed to mix in the loftiest circles in Venice, and later Europe as a whole. He was handicapped by an aversion to boredom, and perhaps might have been classified ADD in the modern era.  He was later to say \\" I have insufficient character for my intelligence, and insufficient intelligence for my character\\".  He saw no inconsistency between his Catholic faith and his life long dedication to the pursuit of sensual pleasure.  His early career in the church enabled him to sidestep the moral censorship of the day, and he was always one step away from prison in his travels.  He travelled the length and breadth of Europe as an entrepreneur, spy, and diplomat, seeking adventure and romance wherever he went.    Many of the episodes in this film reflect actual events in Casanova's life, including a rooftop escape (from the Doge's prison, not a nunnery as in the film) and show an interest in science (he rode in a balloon later, and had a career as an alchemist), music (he was a professional violinist, and his conversations with Mozart resulted in \\"Don Giovanni\\") and international diplomacy (he was frequently employed as an agent by authorities in Venice and Rome).    While being a man of many parts (one in particular being well endowed and in regular use), he was also a man attractive to men for his persona, and to women for his attentive wooing.  He considered intelligence to be a woman's most lasting attribute, and in fact his one true love most delighted him by her conversation. Tragically, her death required him to continue the search.    After gaining and losing several fortunes (he introduced the lottery into France, and was an inveterate gambler), his retirement as a Librarian enabled him the leisure to record his autobiography. This, like Pepys' diary, gives us a fly on the wall look into his life and times.  Though voluminous, it gives only an overview of his amatory career, as he refrained from causing offence to the many patrons whose generosity had supported him in his prime.    All told, this film gives a small glimpse into the younger life of Giacomo Casanova, and most importantly, everything in the movie COULD have happened, and probably did!  Though the real man was no doubt more outrageous, the character portrayed by the late lamented Heath Ledger is much more to our liking.
B002X20W2E|5.0|I never thought much of Rihanna until this album came out. The girl's got major talent! Wow, this album is just stellar. It's been on repeat on my iTunes for almost a month now. There are one or two low points, namely the track \\"Te Amo\\" and the album-ender \\"The Last Song\\". But Rihanna hits enough high points on this album, the lesser songs are easily forgivable. My hands-down favorite track is \\"Cold Case Love\\"; jeez, what a beautiful song and what beautiful instrumentation!! Another stand-out is the latest single, \\"Hard\\". I love the cocky humor in its lines! \\"G4L\\" shows us the Rihanna you don't wanna mess with, while \\"Firebomb\\" tells us the passionate story of the end of an all-consuming love affair. I could go on and on raving about this album and all of the amazing music on it, but instead go find out for yourself. Buy this album today! You won't be disappointed!

1439163855|5.0|I read this book in just a few days, and I'm in college! I love how each chapter is in the voice of a different character, which helps you relate to each one. The story was beautifully written and extremely enjoyable, I couldn't put it down. The book also had the best ending I have ever read, which was both surprising and heart wrenching.
0307454541|4.0|This is a great page-turner of a crime/detective story. The story is intelligently woven and has lot of twists. I like the book, but the writing is too much based on cliches and probably what's taught in a creative writing class. The author thinks that a hacker can access the information on any computer. This plot solution is used far too often.<br /><br />I have read the book in the original langauge, and it isn't really the translation that introduces the bad prose. Thus it is not a five star book, but a solid four star book in terms of entertainment value.
0312323867|2.0|I read Something Borrowed and found the story entertaining. I wasn't interested in reading the story of the spoiled friend; however the reviews changed my mind. I should have stuck with my original opinion. Darcy is never redeemed. She is the spoiled rich girl the entire book. She never stands on her own two feet. She goes from one guy to another. She is always being cared for by some guy. She never matures in my opinion which made the story boring and annoying.
0452289963|3.0|\\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" is a much more convincing and actionable presentation of eliminating the ego, though Tolle's writing is certainly interesting.

078322608X|1.0|Dystopian, but in an angry and pointless way. Great acting by a stellar cast. Brad Pitt should have won an Academy Award. But Gilliam ruined it with his trademark film noir style, bleak, sarcastic, and dull. Tediously dull. Cheap production values. And to call this science fiction insults all real science fiction movies. Avoid at all costs. Hang with some bums under an overpass in the winter and you'll have a sense of what you missed plus you will have a better time.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Through this whole book I cryed. Its very depressing and written in a way that makes you feel that you are  clay because you feel his pain. It made me appreciate life more knowing what just a couple of people did to a girl that can make her so depressed for her to commit suicide.I now after reading this book treat people better and have more respect for myself. I don't allow people to upset me. This book is full of meaning and i recomend it for young girls like myself.

630542845X|5.0|the first time i saw this movie, i enjoyed it and thought particular moments were quite powerful.  the second time i watched it, i was floored... my reaction was so much deeper and more profound than the first time.    my only difficulty with the film is how hard it is to watch the scenes where jeremy is being bullied, but that's only because they rang so true that they brought back painful memories of my own youth.  but that's just me, and i think that response actually speaks well of power of the film!    the one disappointment i had was that the film comes with no special features.  i would have loved to have a commentary track and perhaps a behind-the-scenes doc.  i guess it's out of print now, since it's not available from amazon directly, but hopefully it will be reissued in a more robust package at some point.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I was quite skeptical that Susan Boyle was going to be a \\"one hit wonder\\" coming off of her absolutely stunning performance back in January 2009.  I'm NO longer a skeptic.  Susan's voice is superb.  Her vocal talent is not manufactured in LA or some other recording capital.  Instead what you hear is a woman who is driven by a passion to sing--and sing well.  I remain absolutely impressed.  If you like true talent give Susan a listen.  I assure you this CD will NOT disappoint.  I sincerely hope she returns to the recording studio soon.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The first time I did this I thought I would die. After a few days it was much easier and I did feel alot stronger. I like that it is only 20 minutes. No excuse for not exercising because I don't have time. I travel alot so was able to do it in most hotel rooms because it does not take a lot of space.  Only thing I don't like is not being able to skip the intro into the exercises. Others say it gets a bit boring but don't most exercise tapes after a while?
0812973992|5.0|I typically am not one to leave reviews, but I felt the need to do so with this book.  The characters in this novel really speak to the emotions in all of us.  This is not your easy beach reader but instead is layered and complex.  I think that this would be great required reading for a university literature class.  It's a beautiful novel and I feel more enriched for reading it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A wonderful written book with interesting intrigue and well-developed characters that keep you turning the pages. Can't wait until the third book comes out!  Larsson has done it again!

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I did have trouble getting my CD's to play thru my computer.  With the help of some nice people, they helped me figure what I was doing wrong.      Great collection.  I love this Christmas present.
B001KR0BDI|5.0|This book was a wonderfull thrill ride from start to finish. Most books I love, but this was far out of my normal zone. Watching Katsa grow and change was one of the best experiances of my life, and this book holds a special place in my heart (and my Kindle). The idea and writing was wonderfull. By all means, read this book and expect to fall in love. Enjoy :)
B00005AREQ|5.0|Of all the Jeff Beck music that I have heard, this is the best album that I have heard.  Admittedly, I have not heard all of him, but I have been listening to this album for over 20 years. It has stood the test of time.  As a former guitar player, I have a very high appreciation of the guitar work on this album.  Both the foreground and the background.  So subtle and yet so tasteful.  Anyone who is attuned to artistic guitar work should appreciate this album.  And the drumming is also excellent.  The keyboards and bass are just sort of so-so, but the guitar orientation and tasteful drumming have made this a long time favorite.    I also think that a previous review was incorrect in suggesting that Jeff uses a \\"wah\\" pedal.  To my ears, it is a \\"volume\\" pedal, which can be easily mistaken.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|this book is so captivating! its hard to put down. you will have no regrets about reading this book. its quirky and will change your perspective on life. definatly five stars!
B0009HAHD4|5.0|I lost the original stock eye cup from my Nikon D70s when I was Italy a couple of years ago.  As expected, as this was a replacement part from Nikon, it fit perfectly.  It appears to be constructed in the same quality as the original and has a snug fit.  Because it's removable in order to clean it, be careful if you just sling your camera over your shoulder without a case (as I do) because you're likely to knock it off and leave it on the cobblestone streets of some European city (or in the jungle of Costa Rica).  Since it's so cheap, just pick up an extra and throw it in you bag.  It stinks to shoot in the sun without the eye cup.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Better than Rise of the Machines but lacking any impact From lead actors .  A movie by the numbers relying on CGI and explosions like Star Wars 1 2 & 3.
0810983915|5.0|Dog days is a good book, it is good for kids and adults too. It has so hilarious parts in the book. Greg melts his summer into a indoor winter.    This summer is going good on the outside but inside Gerg is watching TV, Playing Video games when everyone is outside doing activities. Greg's mother starts a reading club with her friends' childern. Everyone in the reading club comes out of the reading club because Greg's mother does not pick violent books to read.The reading book club left over with Greg and Roley.    It is a good book to read in Summer alongwith other books. It is a good series, anyone can read it.

B0001I55SS|2.0|I remember seeing this movie as a kid and enjoying it probably because it was science fiction. I do remember thinking the ending was a huge disappointment and in that respect the movie didn't change for me.    Now, as an adult (and I use the term loosely) I found this movie to be wanting in so many areas it is hard to keep track of them all. Any kid under 8 may enjoy it (anyone over that age will be disappointed by the special effects) and adults who remember this movie may like it for nostalgia's sake.    I'll skip over the special effects - a few scenes are well done, but on the whole they leave you with more questions and distract you from an already lacking story to be annoying.      As for the movie itself, it tries to do too much in too short a time - I can see this movie as a re-imagined mini-series, however. (The story has potential to be compelling and even inspirational.) However, the characters lack development, the story is rushed and the dialog leaves you asking yourself, \\"Now where did that come from?\\" on more than one occasion. The actors either over-act their parts or go through the motions and seem to be waiting for scene to end. Even the robots appear to over act.    Pick up this movie for nostalgia's sake, but don't watch it. Your memories will be much better than the real thing. Trust me.
B002NPCSJG|4.0|This book was written for people who enjoy the genre and don't require a lot of description.  The reader needs to bring their own since of imagination.      The best part of this book was the dialogue.  I'm a big fan of quick and witty dialogue.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I did not see this movie until two weeks ago. Now I know why I did not see it in 2002. The story line was the typical guy trying to forget girl and moves on (with some unwanted help) through time encountering one global disaster after another and finally when the rest of the human race is a bunch of pansies our pansy traveler becomes the half hearted macho guy to the rescue. That's another thing about the movie that stinks- pansies don't build time machines! None of the characters were very interesting except for the mutant people eating underground dwellers but that angle has been overdone beyond belief.   I guess I was expecting much more and disappointed myself. The story line had far more potential than was allowed. Hopefully nobody is purchasing this movie except from the $1.00 bin at fine retailers everywhere.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have ever witness. Tarantino attempts to clumsy generalize German soldiers by identifying them as Nazis so that the audience will feel no compassion to the German soldiers being scalped and having their heads bashed in with a club. Such a sadistic use of violence is what I would expect from directors such as Eli Roth(Who is in this movie) but after watching Kill Bill I suppose Tarantino is also a lover of Torture Porn as well. The actual \\"basterds\\" in this movie would be hung for war crimes for their treatment of POWs. Something I had hoped the audience would have denounced instead of praised. Rather disturbing to say the least...........     The main problem I have with the film is the historical \\"liberaties\\" this movie takes. I really do not want to elaborate as I would spoil the movie. Such a complete generalization of German soldiers as Nazis disgraces honorable German officers and soldiers such as Erwin Rommel and actually dumbs down the audience. There was a big difference between the Waffen-SS the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel. Taratino clumsily throws all three groups into one giant evil Nazi group. Poor taste and completely disrespectful to what really happened.    If a your definition of a good movie is one with good plot, makes you think,violence that is actually useful and is used to advanced the plot, and a decent dialogue then I would urge you to stay away from this movie. Unfortunately the hype and the over rated status of Tarantino is honestly clouding peoples judgement of this film. Nothing more then a B movie with Tarantinos name on it.     Stay Away!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Great CD that all ages.  Her voice is beautiful! Great to get this at your door shortly after ordering on line....
B000001ELD|5.0|I've always had this album on vinyl, and now I finally got the CD.  I think this album is the most inspired one out of the 4 solo albums Kiss made.    This is a very special album, because it doesnt really sound like Kiss, or something you'd expect from Gene, but the songs are great.  Some of the songs sounds like a Beatles tunes (see you tonite,always near you,man of 1000 faces).  I rated this album 5/5 because i simply love it. my least faves are 'wish upon a star' and 'living in sin' but the rest of the album is amazing. my favorite songs are probalby Mr. Make Believe and See You Tonite.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Guaranteed to make you laugh and cry, this is the best Disney movie I've seen in a long time.  Sweet story that's a bit sad in the beginning, but sets the stage for the funny and touching story to follow.  Great animation, but even better story - there's something here for all ages.  Personally, I couldn't stop laughing whenever Alpha issued his commands...too hilarious!
B000001ELF|5.0|This is probably the best album out of the 4 solo albums Kiss made. even though the Gene Simmons album holds a special place in my heart, i think this one is the most -kiss-like album.  all the songs are great. stand outs are Rip it out, Snow Blind, New York Groove & Fractured Mirror.    In this album, Ace doesn't try to break any new ground or do anything special, he's just being himself, doing his own thing. Ace hold a big part in Kiss' sound and has a great voice. the production though, is somewhat lacking.  i gave it 5/5 cause i love all the songs and think its the best solo album kiss made. if you want to have just one solo albu, get this one.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and I patiently waited for them to release it in widescreen. Just got it for Christmas today.(My girlfriend rocks!)The 2-disc \\"Special Edition\\" has a double sided disc with the awful Pan & Scan version on one side and an awesome Hi-Def remastered widescreen version on the other. They did a great job. It looks super. And for a 1968 film the 5.1 audio is not half bad. The 2nd disc has some decent bonus features. Maybe not as great as I remember it when I was a kid watching it on TV in the 70's but still pretty fun. Dick Van Dyke is the man!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|We absolutely loved this tape and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to hear good music.  Good selection of tunes.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Went and saw Bon Jovi in conert last year for the Lost Highway tour. Did not know any of the songs and loved them and the concert. Had to buy the cd. Not liking the new Bon Jovi The Circle cd so much. Bought it because I like the song played on the radio and that is the only song I like on the cd. Wanted to go see Bon Jovi again this year but not going now that I listened to The Circle.
B000AS4L16|3.0|I have only seen part of the first DVD and the author asks the translator in French a question for the interviewee. The translator then asks the interviewee in German, Yiddish, or Polish etc. The interviewee then answers in his native tongue while the audience is awaiting the subtitles to tell us what in the world is going on. Meanwhile, we can see the anguish and tears on the persons face as they are reliving this horrible nightmare but the words are very slow in coming in a subtitled fashion. Truthfully, it wore me out watching the film. The subject matter is very critical for all of us to hear and understand. The editing was very poor in the sense that I lost interest in awaiting responses.    I will watch all of the rest of it, but hope I get used to the slowness of the dialog. The author had a very low budget but could have saved a considerable amount of time, money, film and effort by cutting out some of the stages from question to response. The subject matter and people in the film are real and important, as they are the last generation to know first hand what really happened under Hitler's vicious murdering regime.    I am disappointed as I wanted to learn and for others to learn and \\"take in\\" subject matter that I felt was so very important and necessary for the world to know. Maybe it's just my impatience and others can learn and not be distracted as I have been. I am not ADD just the kind of person that needs emotions and words to coincide in a timely manner. The film is very good from what I've seen so far and I guess I have to realize the author is not a Spielberg.Watch it and lets us know what you think.
B0029O08WA|5.0|With this soundtrack, music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas has outdone herself yet again. The woman who was behind the wonderfully refreshing \\"Music from The O.C.\\", who earned a Grammy for \\"Grey's Anatomy\\", and who is also responsible for the highly successful (and well-chosen) soundtrack of the first \\"Twilight\\" film, has assembled an eclectic mix of previously unreleased songs from numerous Indie-gods. With this, she strikes home and absolutely nails the tone and feeling of the story - maybe even that of a generation.  Those who know the heartbreaking tale of loss, friendship, sacrifice, and love, will suffer with protagonist Bella immediately upon hearing the melancholic songs. Even most of the lyrics mirror the story exactly and take the listener on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.   But this CD also creates a very unique and autonomous tone of its own that emotionally carries the movie further. It is one of the rare gems which prove that soundtracks can be much more than a random, insignificant musical underscore of motion pictures. This is why I strongly (and without hesitation) recommend this compilation also - or maybe especially - to those who have outgrown their teenage years and who do not know or like the books or movies, but who merely treasure good music.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|Just a quick comment. I've read a few reviews and was a little apprehensive about watching this one because I didn't want to waste a couple hours. Turns out I actually really liked this one. I liked how it was filmed as well as the acting. Christoph Waltz did an outstanding job. This movie really did pull me in. In Blu-ray HD and a good surround system it was hard not to be pulled in. I had a little problem with Brad Pitt's accent, and I'm talking about the southern one. Actually sounded like a northerner trying to talk in a southern twang. Overall a heck of an entertaining movie.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Usually when anything is over hyped, like this movie was, I tend to avoid it.  However, I just got around to seeing The Lion King over the past few days and I enjoyed it a lot.  Of all the modern (post 1990) Disney movies, this is my favorite.
B000025XKM|5.0|There are three eseential Nick Drake albums: [[ASIN:B00000064E Five Leaves Left]] with its chamber folk, [[ASIN:B000025H0Q Bryter Layter]] with its huge arrangements. and Pink Moon.<br /><br />Pink Moon is bassically Drake on solo accustic guitar. But Drake was no strummer. His complex composing and full guitar playing--he could strum, pick, and almost orchestrate with a simple accustic--make these full songs, rich in sound like jazz classical minitures.<br /><br />The sad Drake alone is a whisful, poiniant experiance, and listening to the beatiful music on Pink Moon is a trip like few others--queiting and disquieting, sad and comforting.<br /><br />Essential
B0026P3G12|5.0|This ablum is the most beautiful album I have purchased. Susan has an exceptional voice and I have played the album over and over again. Enjoying each minute. Her voice is so clear and so angelic. I will be waiting patiently for her next album. All the songs in the album are so impressive and meaningful. It was such a heartwarming album. She desearves to have the number one album the past  four weeks. I hope the album continues to do well.    Gerry V.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Nice music, mice songs, very romantic and rock at the same time. I love it
B00006ADD5|5.0|if you've paused here to read this than you already know what i'm talking about . this film as well as AVATAR is filmaking on an epic scale . sans computers . i don't need to compare and contrast these two films . you'll either agree or not approximately a paragraph ago . LEAN was the man .
B000EGFVQS|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in the story.  This book leaves you wanting more of something substantial.  Like your really hungry, you've tried everything in the refrigerator and you still aren't satisfied.  It's not badly written, it's just unfulfilling.  I bought this book because they are making it into a movie and was curious about the story.  Maybe the movie will be better.  ***This is not a book for young girls, I wouldn't recommend it to even my teenage girls, it has a disturbing and graphic rape/murder scene.  I guess that's my biggest issue, the author put more emphasis on developing that aspect of the story.
0439023491|5.0|This is a wonderful continuation. I know some people are complaining that it is about the hunger games again. But think about it...in the world that the author created, the hunger games are annual. It is inevitable that there is going to be another hunger games. But Suzanne Collins has found a clever way to incorporate Katniss into it again. It is NOT the same and a lot of events occur before the games even begin. The games are very different this time around and even more heart wrenching than the first. The author is very very good at creating these twisted games and she has definitely outdone herself in the second book. Give it a chance. If you enjoyed the first book and are really excited to find out what happens, then I suggest definitely reading this book. It is hard to put down! This is by far one of my favorite series and I intend to stick with it until the last word of the final book.
B000026156|5.0|This is 1973 free jazz, which may have been more risky than doing this in the 60s. A few die-hards expanded the genre while most hopped the fusion bus.<br /><br />Those die-hards are Sam Rivers, Anthony Braxton, Dave Holland, and Barry Ashtul. All veterns of the 60s revolution.<br /><br />But there is a big differance between this work and the 1960s Blue Note and Imuplse classic, avant material. That work was about blowing free and streaching out over long spaces. The 1970s school, perhaps epitomized by this album, is more concise and spacious.<br /><br />A lot of the time these musicians are not even starting with chord bases, although they do at others. But it is quick and clean and then time for take off. The drumming is generally lighter, and here, there is no panio. The players also have a far more ecconomical and disciplened approach. Sharp little abstract statements as opposed to maximus solo rides.<br /><br />If the 1960s work is a jet airliner  taking of, this is a bird set loose in an empty room.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Wow!!  That is all I can say.  What a voice!!  She doesn't have much stage presence yet (she's an amateur) but when you listen to her on CD her voice comes thru loud with pure notes.  I loved the CD.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Great DVD, Great Performance, Great Visuals.     Love how Paul plays all of the old Beatles Classics as they were played back in the day for the most part. Best songs in my opinion are \\"Here Today\\" (tribute to John, very sentimental), \\"Something\\" (tribute to George), \\"Jet\\", \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"Get Back\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"I'm Down\\" because of video AND ORIGINAL SOUND from the Shea 1965 performance of it spliced in with the 2009 recording and video, which is very nostalgic. For anyone who is truly a McCartney fan, I'd recommend it.     Also, the 2 dvd 2 cd set has great packaging, great for those who enjoy collector's items.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Ok, I know this wasn't one of the grand scale, high dollar sound tracks like The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast, but this is one of my all time favorite Disney movies and sound tracks.  As a kindergarten teacher it is really fun with the kids.  I love Sebastian Cabot and Phil Harris is at his best.  You will want to dance with King Louie, and appreciate the bare necessities of life with Moglie and Baloo.  It is a must have for any Disney fan and collection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's voice is breathtaking.  In every song you listen to one can feel and hear the emotion, the humbleness, the sincerity, and the genuineness of the person singing. She is awesome and this listener looks forward to enjoying her next CD when it comes out.  I hope it is soon!
B002IYEQR4|5.0|If you haven't picked up Watchmen yet this is easily the best version to get. You get not only the Director's cut which is superior to the theatrical version but the Tales of the Black Freighter is also inter-weaved in the film as it is in the original graphic making it just that much better. The film also features two commentaries from Zack Snyder and Dave Gibbons.     As if that isn't enough the special features disc includes some really great mini-documentaries including the Under the Hood retrospective (with cheesy 70s commercials included) and a documentary on how truly groundbreaking the graphic novel was, not just to the comics industry but the literary and entertainment industry as whole. There are just too many special features to list, enough to easily spend hours pouring over.     The final piece to this magnificent collection is the inclusion of the motion comic. If you've ever listened to the graphic novel vs. film debate but can't bring yourself to read the graphic novel this is a great way to make your own decision.     The packaging is excellent as well. Could they have included some more gadgets and literature with it like other special editions? Sure, but it doesn't spoil what is in the box. The Blu-Ray version is so beautiful visually and audibly. If you have only had the chance to see this in standard definition you truly haven't seen this film. For all the criticism regarding the writing Mr. Snyder has done an excellent job putting together a visual masterpiece.    The only negative to this set would be the lack of inclusion of the alternate ending which has been confirmed as being filmed. As a fan of the graphic novel I would like to see the original ending as Moore had written but I do feel the new ending is much more believable and lends itself well to the story. With the inclusion of the motion comic you can view for yourself and draw your own conclusions.     That is the only flaw (and a very minor one) that I can see with this package. I would highly recommend this as a must have for any film aficionado.
1592401791|5.0|I've read a lot of Beatles-related books and this is one of the best ones.  You'll discover info you probably never knew from someone who was at many recording sessions.  I was amazed to discover how some of their songs were actually recorded.  A must-read for a Beatles' fan!
B001OQCV60|4.0|This marks my umpteenth Sherlock Holmes movie and my first Guy Ritchie film...Firstly, let me qualify Nobody can compare to the Jeremy Brett & Basil Rathbone's  portrayal of the film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great detective...with that out of the way... Few American actors have undertaken the part, fewer still with such success. Downey owns the part as does his Watson, played by Jude Law. The report between the two is easily worth the price of admission. The ineffectual Inspector Lestrade and the severe Mrs. Hudson are played straight, maybe a little too flatly. Another major inclusion from Doyle's original works is Irene Adler from \\"Scandal in Bohemia\\" the only villain to escape the Detective...Rachel McAdams plays a tweaked version of \\"the Woman\\" as Holmes considered her the embodiment of her sex, and the only thing that comes close to a love interest for the original character. There is a shadowy cameo by another major character created by Doyle...but that story is for another film...apparently. Doyle wrote 60 adventures starring his famous detective, that's 56 short stories & four novels, the film contains multiple nods to this material for Holmes fans.  Like many of these stories this film has another laying theme of the occult, as it was in interest of Doyle himself, this time a criminal Watson himself has decreed deceased turn up alive and finishing his murderous spree. Ritchie's high energy pacing may be unusual for a Holmes outing, but very satisfying, the fight sequences are a blur, but like some moments of discontinuous exposition revealed by Holmes himself retroactively...even in hand-to-hand scenes the audience is privy to Holmes' lighting intellect as he evaluates his opponents, the weaknesses then the consequences of his actions...then we see one of those blur of a fight sequences satisfyingly witnessing the outcome of Holmes internal deliberations. The same goes for other reveals, following Holmes' explanations, some unseen; others follow his quick-disguises and conclusions.<br /><br />The movie begins with the apparent endgame of a case to be the last with Watson and Holmes as a team. Watson is preparing to wed his beloved Mary, only mentions in the stories, this time she not only has lines, but a meeting with Watson's best friend and 221B Baker Street sometimes roommate. Downey's Holmes has the brave brilliance of the character in the text and the mad genius of Jeremy Brett's BBC Holmes, and what he adds to the role is his sometimes shirtless, slovenly charming energy. Robert Downey Jr. executed a perfect tone and an equally perfect British accent. I'm happy to add Downey to the list of actors who've played Sherlock Holmes. May Ritchie and Downey continue towards the sequel  they have laid the groundwork for in this film.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's theme for the the great detective is as catchy as one John Williams might have created with what might be a harpsichord and violin. Other music choices are wise ones the inclusion of the Road to Dublin by the Dubliners in the boxing-brawl match is inspired...and I will be buying the soundtrack CDhis quick-disguises and conclusions.

B000069HJM|3.0|The album, 'Free as a bird' by Supertamp, from 1987 is quite a good mix of light-jazzy pop. I like it's airy, easy-listening feel.    The keyboards keep it interesting and generally the songs deviate enough from the norm to remain interesting. The album is quite melodic and is very pleasant, and the lyrics are romantic. The title 'Free as a bird' refers to being out of a relationship. There is a good addition of backing vocals and they are really nice on the beautiful soft-disco 'I'm begging you', one of the highlights along with the dramatic album close, 'An awful thing to waste'.     All in all 'Free as a bird' is a good album with good music and enough diversity to make it well worth the listen.
0800141660|5.0|Thsi version of Sense & Sensibility is wonderful!  Emma Thompson did a great job on it.  The choice of actors was wonderful. The ensemble cast did a great job. Personally, I would have preferred Colonel Brandon over Willoughby anyday but then I adore Alan Rickman. The ages of the actors in this movie didn't matter because they were so in tune with their characters.  Being a Jane Austen movie I didn't have to worry about excessive nudity, swearing, or gratuitous sex. This was a nice look at a slice of life from a bygone era. I could show this movie to others without having to fast forward through some scenes ( which has happened for some newer movies).
B002VPE1AM|5.0|****Review is for 3-D version only. Can't IMAGINE it any other way****<br /><br />OK, this is the most astonishing movie I have ever seen. First word I heard leaving the theater was 'amazing!' No doubt about it.<br /><br />I won't discuss the plot. Suffice it to say the plot is good, but nothing, I repeat NOTHING can match the special effects of the 3-D. Plot aside, this movie is a visual feast for the senses. The flight and fight scenes are magnificent.<br /><br />Here's the least you need to know:<br /><br />1. It's the best of all the action movies rolled into one. Sort of like Lord of Rings meets Jurassic Park meets Dances with Wolves meets Tarzan meets Transformers meets Narnia meets Rambo meets Eragon meets Apocalypto meets Dragonslayer--meets the most realistic video game you ever played! (You get the picture? You're IN the picture!)<br /><br />2. It is 'new age' all the way. Christians will sneer at the Earth Mother, reincarnation, tree-loving motif. The 'we are all one with nature' theme isn't pushed ad absurdum, but if you aren't into it--better get used to it.<br /><br />3. It's a long movie--nearly three hours, and the parking lot was packed here in Lexington. Be sure you have your snack in hand and your 'business' taken care of.<br /><br />4. There's a lot of cursing--somewhat overdone in my opinion--so keep that in mind when you take the kids. The only thing remotely sexual is the 'hair-bonding' ritual (now THAT was interesting...) so sexuality is not much of an issue. There is a lot of creature 'death' however.<br /><br />5. The ending is as predictable as it is inevitable in this 'nature versus machine' extravaganza. Sort of makes you empathize with how the Aztecs must have felt when they saw Cortez coming with the  metal! The last hour of so is truly the Armageddon scenario for the world of Pandora. If you're not worn out from being pounded with the visuals and Dolby super-sound, well--just buckle your seatbelts and enjoy the final ride! Nevertheless, I couldn't help joining the applause at the closing credits.<br /><br />6. Finally, the special effects are astounding. You'll be reaching for the floating jellyfish 'tree seeds', dodging the flying dragon-birds, marveling at the rare mineral unobtanium's anti-gravity effect on the Hallelujah floating mountains, choking in the underwater scene, and cringing at the drops (and falls and jumps) off cliffs! This stuff is so good you quickly stop asking yourself how they did it, and simply sit there and experience it. You really are IN the movie!<br /><br />There you have it, without giving away anything. Bottom line? Just pay the extra bucks and get the glasses, appreciate the creative mind that could come up with such a story, and get lost for three hours in a world of sight and sound you cannot imagine (only the smell is missing!). If this is a preview of the future of TV, I'm reserving my 3-D model right now! Wow!6. Finally, the special effects are astounding.

B0030CIAQQ|4.0|Even the long-running BBC TV series failed to capture the period and character so perfectly as Hans Zimmer's theme for the the great detective. It is as catchy as one John Williams might have created with what might be a harpsichord and violin. Sweeping hauntingly Victorian you can almost feel the cobblestone beneath your feet listening alone, but at the same time modern and quirky. This is very much and example of Zimmer's best work so far since Gladiator....loved it! Loved it! One complaint I have about the soundtrack is not an evaluation of Zimmer's work, but the film includes the Road to Dublin by \\"the Dubliners\\" in the backstreet boxing-brawl match, which is inspired...but was not added to this Download/CD. Look that one up.
B002VPE1AM|3.0|I am sorry for all those over enthusiastic Cameron fans who get crazy about this film. I suspect their average age is about 15. The film is spectacular but I would say no more than your average 3D film made for Imax. The script/story is full of cliches, predictable, naive and disappointing for a film that took allegedly 12 years to  make and was so expensive. I especially \\"loved\\" how the US army pushed from the plane, literally, using several soldiers, the gigantic bomb to drop on sacred site. So the equipment they had for this was from the I World War?? And why the bomb looked like 1000 coke cans tied together with an adhesive tape??? Ridiculous. Of course if they were to use the normal way of dropping the bomb the natives would have stood no chance, so Cameron went for this rubbish. And so it goes in this movie, for ex. how on earth did they manage to steal the battle helicopter from the US military base?? Cameron is supposedly full of respect for \\"native\\" culture but in the end it is a former US Marine who has to save the natives and lead them to a fight. What a condescending, mediocre tripe of a script. In hte end, could this one battle decide the outcome of the war?? Of course not, so why make the entire movie about it?? If the survival of the US super power depended on it surely they would later return with more firepower?? And I wonder why the scene in which the hero \\"conquers\\" the dragon to ride him looks almost like a rape, without sexuality of course. Was it on purpose or just so? He subjugates a less intelligent creature by brutal force and since then it \\"will serve him for ever\\" Was Cameron \\"drinking\\" to religion here? And later in the film the hero abandons the dragon anyway, when he has to upgrade his ride. If Cameron really aimed to hide some deeper general sense in this it would be interesting to find out. And the music score could and should have been much better, more memorable if they had so much time to do this. I give 3 stars, for \\"spectacular\\"and for ambition.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Best of all the Fast & Furious movies, and way better than the third, this one goes back to the original story in a well-written, well-acted way.  actionpacked way.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|24 bits is heaven.  Whoever did the audio work on this package did a great job.  The difference between these 24 bit versions and the 16 bit CD versions is instantly noticeable.  It will be more than a few years before we will see a higher resolution format available for consumers so till then, this will do the job and it won't be wearing out or picking up any surface noise.      To own thirteen pristine records of the most important and influential group of the last century for under $300 is a real bargain.  For an audiophile this is sheer joy even if the CD's are not..the difference here is breathtaking.
B00026ZG10|1.0|This is a good movie.  Don't get me wrong.  It is deserving of no awards, but it is very entertaining with great action and lots of humor.  Widescreen presentation here is terrible. The hard coding of the black bars at the edges do not allow for proper wide screen TV and Blu-Ray player up conversion.  The onscreen image in ½ the size it should be.... Wait for the Blu-Ray.
B002QW7AJY|1.0|The thing that pisses me off most about this movie, is that all of the money wasted on this could have been used to finally make a Rendezvous with Rama movie. Instead we have this pimple on the face of real science fiction.<br /><br />Pandorum smells like a made for TV movie that snuck into the theater, maybe another crap movie propped open the back door with a trash can so it could sneak in. I have NEVER found myself critiquing camera angles in a movie.....<br /><br />The monsters look horrible in this, it's as if the rest of the movie is serious and the creatures are jokes, it would have been so much better if they said \\"hey instead of cheesy dead space rip off monsters, lets just make them regular people who were desperate and resorted to cannibalism once in a while, maybe more of a political theme here\\". If I was sitting at the holywood round table when this happened I probably would have been promoted.<br /><br />The surprising thing about this movie is that the special effects regarding space, flash backs, as well as the detail put into equipment, are actually tolerable.<br /><br />I have only walked out on one movie in the theater, and that was the sequel to dumb and dumber, this would have been the second one but my wife wanted to \\"ride it out until the end\\".<br /><br />If you have any desire to buy this movie; DON'T. I don't know if its even worth renting to be honest, instead, buy dead space (the video game) for xbox or ps3,  or better yet, watch the original alien, or maybe even event horizon.... or... wait for it.. read a book.

I hope this album isn't forgotten when it's time for awards.  I'd love to hear Susan on a movie soundtrack-something equal to Titanic or The Bodyguard.  I just can't say enough about this cd.  I purchased it for my mom, never expecting to love it myself.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I purchased this headset about 6 months ago, and was never happy with the way they fit. While the earcups are soft and comfortable, they tend to push harder on the lower portion of the cup which results in a headache after an hour of play. If you spend the time adjusting them to the point that they don't push on the bottom portion, then the top is too tight.    After only 6 months they broke at the adjusting point on the left side. No warning, just went to put in on my head and before I got it over my ears the left side completely snapped off. Poor quality.    Mic works fine, sound quality is good (not great, just good).    This is what you get when you buy cheap. Spend the extra money for a good headset, especially if you're a gamer. I'm going with the Senheiser PC 166.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What an amazing voice! It was well worth the wait for this CD to arrive so the whole world can share in this marvelous woman's glory. The song selections are wide - Blues, Broadway, a Spiritual - and serve as an autobiography - be sure to read the accompanying notes as you enjoy the music. What a delight to have this on my iPod.  Hope Susan makes another CD soon!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar deserves a 5-star rating not merely because of the technical accomplishments which are myriad, but for the coalescing of film, science, adventure, space exploration, and religion.    3-D was experimented on first when this reviewer was a child, and shelved because of an outpouring of objections from petty to real.  The field was considered to be worthless and forever abandoned.    Advancements in film, under the aegis of CGI in particular, meld with this present age to flower the perfect day to reintroduce this course of media to a world waiting for an exponentially advancing vision to keep pace with the surging knowledge explosion.    Observations as critiques suggesting shallowness in the storyline of Avatar are not unlike the initial reactions of many seeing the first 'Rocky.'    Subliminal wars such as intellect versus brawn, sensitivity against perceived reality, and the ever-dominating challenge of loyalty battle throughout the frontlines of what has become perhaps the first of a genre of experimental epics that will shove past the frontiers of concious acceptance, racing for the ends of time.    Recognition of borrowed beliefs from religions across the eras grind into status quo foundations, demanding what is right from wrong.    Only the initiate traverses the crest and grasps the skyline of nothingness made bare with the skeletons of man's failures.      Through the actors in play shall be revealed the border crossings.    Casting to the wideness of space one rests in this, \\"But as it is written; Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man, The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.\\"  {I Corinthians 2:9, NKJV.}     TL Farley,  author,    When Now Becomes Too Late,  { The imminence of the Rapture }    &     Distant Reaches,  { The unseen hand of God }

B0030CIAQQ|4.0|This version of Sherlock Holmes is apparently the 223rd occasion the ubiquitous detective has been portrayed on either the big or small screen, but as far as I'm aware this is the first time Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary character has been a traditional Hollywood action hero. A succession of actors - from Basil Rathbone to Peter Cushing and Jeremy Brett - have portrayed Holmes as a thoughtful, cultured, albeit rather eccentric English gentleman, and although Doyle's novels have often spoken of his prowess as a bare knuckle fighter and swordsman, as well as his drug use, Holmes was never an `action man' in the traditional sense. It seems the filmmakers have made a rather unfortunate misjudgment of character on this film, making this Holmes a young, bare-chested hunk rather than an analytical mind.    The film is directed by Guy Ritchie, the former husband of Madonna and the director of such popular hits as Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Holmes' faithful assistant and confidante, Watson. The plot revolves around the dastardly Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), an occult-worshipping aristocrat who, following a series of brutal murders, is captured, tried and subsequently executed, but seemingly rises from the dead to continue his reign of terror. The film also stars Rachel McAdams as Holmes's American paramour Irene Adler, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and Geraldine James, Kelly Reilly, Hans Matheson, James Fox and William Hope in smaller roles. For the film's music, Ritchie turned to composer Hans Zimmer, who began his career in London with the late great Stanley Myers, and as such has an affinity for the city and its cultural heritage.    Zimmer's score is not what you would expect from a major Hollywood studio's key Christmas lynchpin film. The composer describes it as `the Pogues in Romania by way of an East End pub', and rather than being performed by a standard symphony orchestra, is instead a cultural mishmash of gypsy fiddles, banjos, cimbaloms and an out-of-tune piano, which Zimmer said was intended to illustrate both the \\"chaos in Holmes's head\\", as well as the film's period setting at the turn of the industrial revolution. Zimmer was also apparently inspired by the folk sounds of Kurt Weill's Threepenny Opera, which explores Victorian London's criminal underbelly in much the same way as Holmes does. Taking into account the obvious thought put into the creation of a unique sound, the resulting score is surprisingly easy to listen to and enjoy on its own terms, mainly because of its unashamed and unrestrained strangeness, and because it sounds so unlike most of Zimmer's most recent work.    The first thing listeners will find upon listening to the Holmes score is how much like the Jack Sparrow music from Pirates of the Caribbean it sounds. Like Sparrow's music, Zimmer's Holmes theme portrays the character as a comedic eccentric, but whose peculiar outward demeanor hides an inner strength. The spiky, slightly-drunken theme for fiddles, cimbaloms and accordions dances above a thrusting rhythm in the opening \\"Discombobulate\\", an energetic opening that certainly sets the tone of the score, and reoccurs later in the slightly more conventional \\"My Mind Rebels At Stagnation\\", the action-packed \\"Marital Sabotage\\" the stirring \\"Panic, Shear Bloody Panic\\", and the conclusive (and rather peculiar) \\"Catatonie\\". What's interesting about this theme, and about much of the score in general, is how off-kilter is all sounds. Instead of a smooth, constant sound, the strings have a scratchy, scrappy coarseness to them, while the accordions, banjos and various percussion items have a slightly broken sound, as though their pitch is a little off, or as if they are not being played properly. This is clearly not the case of course - scores such as this are intended to sound exactly the way they sound - but the cumulative effect of this is to make the scoresound more than a little rough around the edges.    The tinkling cimbaloms are used in a more sinister manner in cues such as \\"Is It Poison, Nanny?\\", which have an unusual, scratchy electronic sound design element under the solo instruments, and which combine with deep bass chords to present a sense of impending menace. The second half of \\"My Mind Rebels At Stagnation\\", as well as cues such as \\"He's Killed The Dog Again\\", are similarly threatening, with an increased brass presence, dark electronic chords, buzzing violins, and multiple appearances of the famous de-tuned piano, which Zimmer personally detuned by throwing it down a set of stairs in the parking structure on the 20th Century Fox lot. At the other end of the scale, \\"I Never Woke Up In Handcuffs Before\\" is a crazy Romani-style dance for fiddles, accordion and an oompah tuba that picks up an exotic percussion beat half way through, and ends as a frenzied whirligig dance piece that would not sound of out place in a Turkish bazaar.    The main set piece of the score is the 18-minute \\"Psychological Recovery... 6 Months\\", into which Zimmer combines all the specific acoustic and electronic elements, the prancing Holmes theme, the banjos and fiddles and cimbaloms, and the cranky piano, but beefs up much of the music with some of the engaging action rhythms for which Zimmer is much more famous. He even finds time to work Irish pipes into his sound mix, which briefly recalls the work Zimmer did no An Everlasting Piece back in 2000. One absolutely wonderful touch comes 8 and a half minutes into the cue, when Zimmer works the Westminster Chimes melody (which precedes the hourly chimes of the clock of Big Ben) into his robust string ostinato. It's all very entertaining, and builds up to a thoroughly rousing, orchestrally-enhanced, and unexpectedly emotional conclusion as Holmes and his nemesis fight atop the still-under-construction Tower Bridge.    While Guy Ritchie's reworking of Sherlock Holmes might dismay the literary purists, and while Zimmer's score will likely make younger Zimmer fans scratch their heads in confusion, I personally found the score a refreshing change of pace, and a new sound from a man not known for breaking with convention that often. It took me a while to warm up to the score and to appreciate its nuances, but once you get past the initial reaction of \\"what the hell...?\\", there is a great deal of engaging music to be found. This is the kind of Zimmer music I like the most; the music that reminds us why he, above all his `underlings', is capable of writing genuinely good music, and why he continues to be held in such esteem.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|If you are a devoted fan of the great traditional war films, this movie will drive you nuts.  If you have an open mind to a non-traditional approach which takes extreme liberties with WW II themes, you might find this enjoyable.      Chrisoph Waltz is the best movie villain ever!
B0015T7Q98|4.0|I see what everyone is saying when they say \\"Easy listening\\" but hey this is ALTERNATIVE easy listening! Your grandma doesnt listen to this ok guys so calm down. This is so damn poetic and beautiful. It touches my heart it truly does. The best song in my opinion is, \\"When The Day Met The Night\\" BEAUTIFUL song!!! At the very least you should download it.     Now is this very different from their first album? I dont think so lemme say why before you crucify me! This is a slowed down nostalgic alternative view on mellow music. It's the Panic! view on mellow songs. I'm proud of their work. I think it's very melodic and just beautiful and yet still very much Panic! They simply slowed their tempo a bit and I think they as artists have a right to explore different styles as long as it still has Panic! flavor, and this album definitely has that!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first CD seems to suffer from unrealistic expectations from her fans. Like many great performers who draw energy from the response of a live audience, nothing could hope to compete with the energy and excitement of her first performance on Britain's Got Talent.  But that said, this is an altogether lovely album that Susan Boyle fans will cherish. Yes, there is a rather odd mix of songs and one could hope that in the future that there was more Susan and less orchestration, but the sweetness, power and expressiveness of her voice shines through. Because of the release date, I wish it had been a Christmas album.    I'd also like to see another side of Susan Boyle, as the woman I saw on You-Tube was funny and optimistic and not nearly as sad or serious as the songs on this album.  The great performers of the 30's-60's (such as Connee Boswell, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, Elsa Fitzgerald, Streisand etc.) always had their voices showcased with very sparse orchestration. When there's an orchestral interlude, the singer is not trying to compete with the instrumental and vice versa. Only in the last 40 years has the individual voice been of less importance that the studio mix of sound which often enhances and disguises less than great voices of songwriters and would be singers.  From comments I've read on You-Tube, I think many of the younger generation (under 30) have a real appreciation for singers that truly had great voices and talent and I would count Susan Boyle among their company.    I hope Susan Boyle will continue to draw her inspiration from some of the great performers of the past. I would love to hear Susan's interpretations of classics and here's my playlist of what I would love to buy:    Look for the Silver Lining  The Rose  Young at Heart  Smile  April Showers  Loveliest Night of the Year  You make me Love You  I can't give you anything but Love  I don't want to Set the World on Fire  Pretend  But Not for Me  Dream a Little Dream  With a Smileand a Song (from Snow White)  My Own Home (from the JungleBook)  What a Wonderful World

B002NOAF9W|3.0|I saw the Stones on this tour in Nov. 1969, and was particularly anxious to see the DVD.  The DVD has only 5 songs on it - not an entire live concert as I had expected. It's a short video and has a lot of filler from backstage. While it is interesting to see a clip of Hendrix backstage with the Stones, IMHO, the video is not worth the extra money over just buying the downloaded edition.    My second gripe is with marketing it as a 3 CD set.  CD #1 is the original album release with 10 tracks. CD #2 has 5 bonus tracks.  Why not just add the bonus tracks to the first CD? I believe there is room - but this is typical Stones marketing to make you think you're getting more than you are.    The best bonus material is on CD #3, which contains two sets by BB King and Tina Turner.  The BB King material was some of the best live cuts I've heard. I'm not such a fan of Turner, but it was fun to hear her in her prime.
0425166805|1.0|This book is full of it.  This book appeals to the scientific illiterate, the easily fooled, and the new age mentality. Please do not be one of these. I do not know if the author believed in what he wrote, but it would not surprise me if he did not. He and his estate (this book was available in the 60's) have profited immensely from this book regardless of motivation. The thesis of this book have been shown to be false by serious archeologists, but that does not seem to have have made much of an impression on this book's popularity. This book is really fantasy masquerading as science. The hypothesis is not true. Why do people still buy it? Von Däniken has been after all convicted of fraud. Why would anyone want to believe him?

B00005RDRO|4.0|Mr. Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) has called together the greatest detectives of all time for a weekend of murder at a remote estate.  (Naturally, it includes thunder and lightening).  These five detectives consist of Milo Perrier (James Coco), Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), and Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith).<br /><br />The guests arrive to find themselves served by a blind butler (Alex Guinness) and a deaf/mute maid (Nancy Walker).  At dinner, their host appears and announces that someone at the table will be killed at midnight.  But preventing the murder will be hard since rooms seem to come and go at will.  As do bodies.  Can these great detectives figure out what is going on?<br /><br />As a mystery lover, I have to love this movie.  And I do.  The spoofs are spot on, especially Peter Falk's Bogart impression as Sam Diamond.  Since Neil Simon wrote the screenplay, the one liners come fast and furious.  Both times I've seen this, I've been laughing hysterically multiple times.<br /><br />The movie does have a couple of flaws, however.  The first are some rather racist comments and the stereotypical accent by Peter Sellers.  Of course, that is part of the spoof, so it mostly works.  The other is the ending.  The mystery fan in me cries out for something better.  But that's a minor complaint.  There are parts of the denouncement that are pitch perfect as a spoof.<br /><br />Those who aren't familiar with the classics of the mystery genre might not find it nearly as enjoyable, but mystery fans will eat this up.
B00006J3WH|5.0|As the title of the review states, this was the only worthwhile episode in the entire last two seasons of what had once been a fantastic series.  The songs are great fun, the episode crackled with the kind of excitement you used to be able to depend on from Buffy.  Unfortunately, even the good can't totally erase the fact that it started that abomination known in the fandom as Spuffy, where Spike, showing what a true monster he is, takes advantage of the fact that Buffy is suffering from PTSS (Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome), and in no way shape or form in her right mind, rapes her for the remainder of the season.  Of course, Buffy isn't the only character who was badly mistreated in the last two seasons, none of the characters, except Tara, come off really well, and we all know what happened to her!
B00003CXB4|5.0|I was very pleased. My order was mailed out promptly received promptly and in excellent condition. I would recommend them highly.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I really wanted to like TERMINATOR SALVATION.  In fact, after the first few scenes, I thought I would.<br />But fate was not going to be kind to me on that count.<br /><br />First, what went right (there will be spoilers):<br /><br />[a] Future War - you get to see what it is like for the survivors of J-Day to actually fight the machines.<br />[b] Opening sequence - from Marcus getting the needle to the attack on the R&D facility, the image quality, action, characters and plot actually started to work for me.<br />[c] Warthogs - any movie that includes the A-10 is worth watching.<br />[d] Skynet Central - it looked both technologically advanced, as well as kind of primitive.<br />[e] Human Prisoners - the reaction of John Connor to the prisoner issue was believable and worked as a motive for insubordination.<br /><br />Now, for what went wrong:<br />[f] The War Against the Machines - viewers did not get to see many details about this all-encompassing conflict.  Did you see any soldiers' banter during down time?  Burials? Chaplains? Did you see any of their supply chain? I mean humanity was nearly wiped out.  Where do they get their food, fuel, ammunition, spare parts and communication gear?  I mean, the amount of screen time needed to clarify this is minimal; a couple of conversations between characters about such things could make all the difference between plausible and hard-to-swallow.<br />[g] Arnold - did we really need to see CGI Arnold?  I mean, the story has to stand on its own, and inserting him was a waste of time and effort.  He could have been in a background shot of the management of Skynet before J-Day and that would have worked; but he did not need to be in the movie.<br />[h] Marcus - he should have been driven to the brink of insanity by all that happened.  He was on DEATH ROW one minute, and then in the middle of what looks like a cross between Antietam and the Tet Offensive.  I'd be nearly bonkers.  Wouldn't you?<br />[i] Marcus' plug-in - When Marcus connected to Skynet and learned all about J-Day, why didn't he react more visibly than he did?  Why did Skynet take the personae of Connor, Reese and Dr. Serena Kogan, when it could have taunted him w/ the memories of his dead brother?<br />[j] Skynet is Omniscient, 1 - how in the world could Skynet have known that Kyle Reese should be targeted for elimination?  It seemed like a distraction to me, making ONE KID the focus of their efforts.<br />[k] Skynet is Omniscient, 2 - why did Skynet develop an obsession with John Connor so early?  It would be like making the focus of World War One not to defeat Germany but to take out Corporal Adolf Hitler.  Had the writers any common sense, Skynet would have targeted Connor FOR HIS EXPLOITS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  A bit of dialog could have covered that easily.<br /><br />Try this on for size:<br /><br />General Ashdown: \\"You really got their attention hitting their factory two years ago, and the ammo dump last month; now all I see on the intel reports is that they want your head on a stick\\"<br />John Connor: \\"It's what I was born to do\\"<br /><br />[l] The Signal - too easy, and Connor should have known this; if Ashdown had said that his boys put together a VIRUS that MIGHT shut them down, and it needed to be tested, that would have been a bit more believable.<br />[m] John takes a dive into treacherous waters - Although it worked for me that the Commanders were on a sub, did Connor really have to take a dive into the Perfect Storm?  Did anyone on the production team ever hear of hypothermia?<br />[n] White Hat Wipeout - In many movies and TV shows, it seems to be a popular notion to kill all of the hero's forces, to reinforce the hopelessness of the situation.  In TS all of the Resistance fighters get waxed (except for Character Shield Connor) NEEDLESSLY.  Had the writers put in a big gun battle that would have been much more enjoyable, and advance the notion that the war is WINNABLE.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Connor's team gets pinned down by two groups of T-600's, calls in an air strike, and a medevac.  In the middle of it all, the hackers get their data, and fight their way back to beaten-up Huey with Common as a door gunner mowing down any metal that came their way.<br /><br />After dropping off the wounded @ the infirmary, the hackers then PRESENT their findings to command, with Connor ready to add his two cents about the new machines.<br /><br />See how simple it is to describe an action sequence and the aftermath?<br /><br />[o] Marcus meets Connor - who in the world wrote that dialog?  Why even mention Kyle Reese? I found it to be too Deus-Ex-Machina for my taste.  They did not follow the 'show don't tell' rule of film making.<br />[p] Climactic battle - only ONE T-800 was available for action?  I mean this is SKYNET; they have countless machines available for use.  Oh, and I didn't know that John Connor's heart and lungs had WOLVERINE'S mutant healing power.  I mean a few gun shots could have more believably imperiled his life, and it would have made Marcus's sacrifice needless.<br />[q] Heart Transplant - the notion that a heart transplant can be performed IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT is a bit of a stretch for my small, reptilian mind.  But not the geniuses behind their Clark Novas.<br /><br />All in all it was good, but not up to 'Terminator' or 'T2' standards, but better than 'T3.'  And, don't get me started on Fox's cancellation of the TV show 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.'  Arguably one the best Movie-to-TV adaptations EVER but it had ZERO continuity w/ TS.<br /><br />Now if only James Cameron, or Joss Whedon were to actually obtain the rights, and do something worthwhile with the franchise.  There's still life in it, but it needs to be nurtured.<br /><br />I have ranted enough - please rate my review even if you think I'm a complete idiot.<br /><br />moneybagzz out.of it all, the hackers get their data, and fight their way back to beaten-up Huey with Common as a door gunner mowing down any metal that came their way.

B000A2RRF4|4.0|The video is great when it focuses on Michael, however, there are too many fan shots.  I don't care if girls are passing out, I want to see Michael sing and dance.  Also, sometimes it is difficult to hear MJ over the constant roar of the crowds.  Otherwise, MJ is brilliant, as always.  He will forever be the King of Pop.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|Everyone knows that content-wise, you can't beat this stuff. That's a given. The debate about the changes are of interest to me. I don't mean to bitch, but the fact is they shouldn't have done it. I really don't care what some CGI \\"artist\\" thinks will help update the show. He or she is probably just trying to justify their job. Did these people not learn anything from the backlash Lucas got trying to \\"update\\" stuff? I totally understand cleaning up the film, but re-recording the opening theme? Why? If these big corporate conglomerates are going to muck about with this classic stuff, at least offer an alternative set without all the unnecessary revamps!!
B001N44BW0|4.0|Probably one of the better movies I have seen this year, a real sleeper hit with no doubt. I didn't hear too much about it when it came out, but glad I picked it up.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Every selection in this album was outstanding and in many respects even better than her appearances on Britain's Got Talent Show. The background music added a tremendous quality and I can't wait for her next release. I admit that I was a little disappointed that they didn't chose some of my favorite songs like Time to Say Goodbye, Wind Beneath My Wings, etc. but all in all this was an awesome purchase for which there are no regrets.    Susan Boyle is FNTASTIC!
1416914293|5.0|The book was in fantastic condition, hardly any wear on it. I recieved it quickly. I would buy from them again.
B000M341QE|5.0|Real movie buffs will really want to have this movie as part of there collection upon viewing this. Great cast for one, good plot, good acting among the stars, and lastly a good ending.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Myrl Streep & Amy Adams are really great in this movie. We enjoyed it very much!
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Something is seriously wrong with this movie. Arnold/Bruce/Mel don't shoot bad guys. No monster trucks, bowling alley, deer stand or even a grilled cheese sandwich. So why do I sit watching this movie with a stupid, Cheshire-like grin on my face? Because this is the feel-good movie of all time. I hear about horrible acting- that doesn't register. Choreography-light...looks great to me. Inane arrangement of songs. Nope. And the cast, perfect. This is a musical that rouses the spirits. I don't care about accents. I don't care about age. I don't care about missed singing lessons. What I care about, is grinning ear to ear when I watch this. And a special thank you to Meryl Streep and Stellan Skarsgard. They looked as happy as anyone I've ever seen in a movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Beiutiful album, can't wait until she records her Christmas album next year, Shipping was super fast and arrived in great shape. I will order again soon.
0937381888|5.0|A fantastic wealth of information. Everyone should start with this book, and amateurs won't need another.
B001C4CI8A|3.0|To reveal the answer to this question would spoil the film which probes the topic in digit-crunching detail!  As a CIA agent in the field, the talented Di Caprio, plus the crystal-clear transfer of Blu-Ray, brings the pain a bit too close for comfort, as far as I am concerned. And Russell Crowe, as Di Caprio's boss, does nothing to relieve his agent's ongoing agony.<br /><br />If Ridley Scott's intention was to have Crowe portray the CIA chief of ops as both nerdy and callous, permanently attached to his cell-phone earpiece, issuing death-dealing orders from thousands of miles away without regard for the consequences, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams--precisely because of Crowe's own considerable talent. There is nothing to love about Crowe's character.<br /><br />As for Di Caprio, I spent far too much time feeling for him--in the worst possible way; and I didn't think that the story was suspenseful enough to make it worth the vicarious pain.<br /><br />Huge \\"ouch factor\\"!
B0026P3G12|5.0|From the first moment I heard Susan Boyle sing, I knew I would be buying her cd.  Now I can listen to her anytime I want!  She is incredible!  This is an excellent cd and I would recommend it to anyone.
0375413405|5.0|I recently have been cooking a lot more than I used to. Seems the older I get the more I enjoy it. Mom knew a lot of these recipe's but never taught them to anyone, her idea of teaching me to cook was to sit and watch her....talk about boring, and not learning anything!<br /><br />I got this book originally from the library, just to try \\"Boeuf Bourguignon\\" recipe. WOW is one best word to describe it. While I had the book in my possession, I have tried a number of the recipe's and the outcome of all have just been mouth watering. I never thought that I would be preparing and eating fantastic French cuisine.<br /><br />This book is one of the best cookbooks that a person could have as part of their library. You won't be sorry that you tried it.<br /><br />Like Julia's cooking show, her humor is in the book as well, in little info tidbits. Anyone that loved Julia Child would appreciate this as well.<br /><br />Upon returning the book to the library myself, I ran out to buy a copy. My philosophy is that you cannot have too many GOOD cookbooks.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I received the cd and immediately played it. She has a beautiful voice and does a great job with all the songs. I am glad I ordered it.
B002JODV3S|5.0|I saw this concert in person, and it was amazing! Owning it on Blu-Ray is a way to never forget the special moment. For those that didn't get to see this concert, it isn't your typical Steve Vai concert. Yes, you have the amazing guitar virtuosity of Steve Vai, but you also get the amazing musicianship of AnneMarie and Alex. The only thing really missing from this concert was Billy Sheehan on bass which for some reason leaves the concert feeling slightly duller than some of the other Vai concerts. The audio quality of this concert on blu-ray is quite amazing having seen the concert in person I can say that they really captured what it was like to be at this show, and brought it home to those that could not attend. All in all if you like Steve Vai this is a must have!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Product is in great shape, true to the description that was posted before buying product.  Arrived in timely manner, very glad I bought it, works great!

B000FC2PKG|4.0|Good suspense story.  Well written.  Exciting!  I've read two books from this author.  Will read more.  This was my first book read on my Kindle.  You have to buy a Kindle.
B0026P3G12|4.0|If you like vocals in your music collection, you will love this CD. Her voice will blow you away even if you know what's coming! Probably not for the younger set, but stop and listen beautiful.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|The Curios Case of Benjamin Button is a fantastic film that anyone will enjoy. It is about a man named Benjamin, who ages backwards. He is born as an eighty year old man, and gradually grows younger until he is an eighty year old person who looks and acts like a baby. Along the way he meets his true love, works as a sailor, and has many wonderful adventures in a world that can not keep up with his aging. The plot is fantastic, and so is the acting. The special effects and music are wonderful as well. The film is rather long, clocking in at over two hours, but it does not seem to drag on as other films of similar length do. The rating of PG-13 is just right. I would not let small kids or preteens watch this movie, because there is some language, war violence, and several mild sex scenes. However, any teen or up can certainly watch the great film with no problem. If you want to watch something great, pick up The Curios Case of Benjamin Button, you will not regret it.
B002HWRZH0|5.0|If you are a Star Trek collector, you must own this new collector's edition replica ship.  Beautiful and well done.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love this CD and I love Susan Boyle. I am looking forward to see what she will bring in the future.
0385504225|2.0|First, the pros: the book is a reasonable page turner, and some of the historical concepts are well researched. Also, it is probably the only known book that glorifies Washington, D.C.    The cons:   1. Dan Brown's writing style - he writes a novel like a screenplay, almost like he is visualizing the movie that will (inevitably) be made from the book.   2. I won't get into details here, but the reason for all the action in the book (CIA involvement, et al) left me cold at the end of the book. Dan Brown really needs to think long and hard about what exactly constitutes a \\"National Security crisis\\".  3. After all the criticism he got for going against one cult-like organization in the Da Vinci Code, he seems to have decided to go hog-wild in favor of another one in this book.
B0017YZIL4|5.0|Wes has to be the all time great player. Great album. A must for any collection
B002IVLH60|3.0|This is my first review on Amazon and, although I appreciate reading comments by others, I never thought I'd contribute. However, after reading some of the incredibly misguided reviews left by others, I feel compelled to add my opinion. I've been a huge fan of Eddie and the boys since day one; I've seen them live over two dozen times, including four times this year -- Outside Lands, ACL and a couple of local shows. One of the things I've always loved about Pearl Jam is their focus on the integrity of the journey with the music as soundtrack. But this album is just that -- music. This is easily their most uninspiring and commercial record ever.     Don't get me wrong: it's a decent album. But PJ has been releasing such high quality work for so many years that I think us die-hard fans are spoiled rotten and my suspicion is that even the band would admit this isn't their best work. Speed of Sound, Johnny Guitar, The Fixer and Force of Nature should have been saved for More Lost Dogs or ditched all together. Amongst the Waves is vintage Pearl Jam, a song that builds in tempo and crashes with inspiring vocals. Got Some and Supersonic are quality rock songs and Just Breathe (a leftover from the Into the Wild soundtrack) is difficult to not appreciate.    If you are new to Pearl Jam nation and want to hear their best work, I recommend almost all of their previous albums before this one. Ten, self-titled, Yield, Vitalogy and Vs to name a few. If you've been a fan for a while, be prepared for a let down.
B00002Z88D|5.0|My sister wanted to get this for my brother.  He had lost his.  We love it!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|As a movie, Paranormal Activity FAILS.  As entertainment?  FAIL.  As a complete waste of time?  I'll give it that.  Characters were HORRIBLE.  There was no real story or development. These people had no jobs.  Wow.  This was Blair Witch but filmed in 4-5 different rooms of a boring house.    If you have to use your imagination to enjoy a movie.... then don't.  The sound of music was scarier than this.  Even the Blair Witch Project had some type of story.  This SUCKED.  These people should be barred from making another movie again.  If you download it... it's not worth the bandwidth.    If you really got scared by this... I feel sorry for you.  A drive thru at a fast food joint is scarier.
B000003TA9|5.0|This is one of those albums you listen to over and over and it completely alters your definition of what constitutes good music.  It's catchy and melodic enough that you want to hum or sing along with it but it's never cheesy or sappy.  There's also some really heavy, thumping, ass-kicking riffs and plenty of angst.  Often it's all of the above in the same song.      In my opinion this is not only one of Sonic Youth's best albums (along with Goo), but one of the best alternative rock albums ever.  I like a lot of Sonic Youth's material but honestly, some of their experimentation and noisy wanderings can be a bit much at times.  While Dirty still has plenty of the feedback and noise that you'd expect from Sonic Youth it's also much more melodic and catchy than any of their other albums I've listened to.  Dirty is also probably one of Sonic Youth's best albums in the sense of being consistently good from start to finish.      Concerning the reissue/remaster: That's a tough one.  I wouldn't call the remaster a waste of money but I also wouldn't call it essential.  I've been told that the sound quality of the remasters is a significant improvement over this album but I haven't heard both together back-to-back on a good quality stereo to able to comment on that personally.  I think this album is perfectly strong enough on its own without a remaster but I'm also never opposed to improving sound quality.  As for the bonus material on the remaster, it was mostly recordings of rehearsal sessions prior to the album recording sessions.  I didn't think the bonus material was that spectacular although it was pretty cool to hear the different working versions of what became \\"Wish Fulfillment\\" (one of my favorite songs from the album).  Personally I wouldn't say there was anything on the remaster/reissue that you simply MUST own.  Factor in the price difference and whether or not you've even got a good enough stereo to tell the difference and how interesting you think listening torehearsals would be for yourself.  But one way or another, \\"Dirty\\" IS essential Sonic Youth.
1400049628|5.0|My son's girlfriend is REALLY in to zombies.  Once she opened this package at Christmas we lost her completely except for tidbits about zombies and how to fight them.  Definitely a hit among the young zombie crowd.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Very good condition when received and viewed. My husband was psyched!   Everything was as I expected. Delivery was faster than expected and packaged well. The series are in good condition, and no scratches from what we can find.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Love her rendition of Wild Horses.  Susan's voice sends absolute shivers up my spine.  This music will move you and would be a good selection for funerals.  This is probably the best CD purchase I've made in a lifetime.  The price was unbeatable and shipping was fast!
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Will not play with my player. This is strange sice the disk is a sony product and so is my Player.
B00001OH80|4.0|I've been always an occasional David Bowie fan. Alot of his stuff is really eccentric and out there, but there are a few good albums worth listening to. Like Diamond Dogs, Let's Dance, and Space Oddity. I decided to check this album out after I saw an interview with Bowie, in which he said he wanted to go in more of a pop direction. And Im more of a pop music kind of guy(in case you can't tell by my other reviews). I actually found all the tracks enjoyable to listen to, and I thought God Only Knows was a some what of a darker,cooler cover of the beach boys. I liked the duet with Tina Turner. I was really surprised that she worked with someone like Bowie. I never would have thought those two went together.(it works unlike Madonna and Prince). Blue Jean is a pretty fun and upbeat workout song,too. Plus the video kind of reminds of something Lady Gaga would do. (Even though she totally copies off of Bowie). Loving the ALien was unique but i liked it. Overall, this is kind of an underrated 80's album(for those of us young people) along with some albums from donna summer, chaka kahn, and eurythmics.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this series and loved this final book. I think some of the negative reviewers are forgetting to see this book for what it is - entertainment! Get over yourself and enjoy!

6304806434|5.0|Cameron Poe, who is a highly decorated United States Army Ranger came to his home of Alabama to his wife, Tricia. only to run into a few drunken regulars at where Tricia works. Cameron unknowingly kills one of the drunks and was sent to a federal penitentiary for involuntary manslaughter for seven years. Then, Cameron became eligible for parole and can now go home to his wife and daughter, Casey. Unfortunately, Cameron has to share a prison airplane with some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, who somehow took control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country with the plane. Cameron has to find a way to stop them while playing along. Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin is trying to help Cameron get free and stop the criminals including, Cyrus \\"The Virus\\" Grissom. \\"Con Air\\" is an action packed movie.  There are remarkable actors, and yes, while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top, nevertheless, I think anyone can enjoy this movie and just have fun watching it. It's a great action movie.
1427201439|5.0|Dune is a wonderful book.  Hearing it told on audio cd's allows you to use your imagination to create the world you're hearing about.  If you are reluctant to buy this set because you saw the awful film version of Dune put that out of your mind.  The movie had nothing to do with the real story of Dune which is artful, exciting -- thrilling really. This audio book is suitable for teenagers to adults and would be appreciated by any lover of classic science fiction.
B000EQ5TSI|5.0|Dazzling spectacle in high-tech and hand-to-hand combat, compelling romance between gorgeous leads, and well-crafted story makes this a highly satisfying action film.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White is an excellent classic film that is really enhanced in the Blu-Ray edition.
B000FGGE68|5.0|The story was exciting; the action scenes were gorgeous; the special effects and scenery were lovely. Yes, it was all rather surreal, but that quality was well-maintained throughout the movie and therefore seemed consistent and natural. The thrill of watching the fight scenes, which were obviously designed not to be a gorefest but a sophisticated, synchronized and deadly dance. I recommend this to anyone who likes to see a movie that is beautiful, stunning and also leaves the watcher with something to think about.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar has once again created a wonderful movie with an unusual and interesting plot line.  The Blu-Ray technology brings a new level of enjoyment and the extras (especially the film about the trip to S. America) enhance the understanding and enjoyment of the film.
B000EQ5SR0|5.0|This is a real film about choices that could only be made because of the future and the technologies of the future. The film is beautiful and cerebral but also with great acrobatic action.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Purchased the regular DVD's a few years ago and absolutely love it.  Thought it may be overkill to buy a whole new set on Blu Ray.  I was wrong!!  It's like I'm watching a whole new series.  THe picture is amazing.  I can see all the tiny pores in the actors skin....it's that clear!!!  WOW
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Hellboy delivers a welcome addition to the superhero club. Big-hearted but derivative supernatural adventure. This movie is occasionally quite funny.
B0019LZJD2|5.0|This is a terrific, highly intense, set of passionately played music.  While some complained about not including the entire concert, um, that has always been quite common with regard to concert albums.  Very few sets ever came out on vinyl that included the entire concert.<br /><br />Neil Young not only personally overseen the archive sets that have bee released.  He's also a fan of the sound of vinyl.  My guess is that he has envisioned these sets to be released on vinyl, making sure that the music length works well with a release on LP.  On the other hand, he released his Archives box set knowing it was designed for digital playback.<br /><br />In any event, those with a good enough vinyl setup will appreciate the richness and musical flow that the vinyl version offers.  All of this stuff was recorded analog and it sounds amazing.  Those that think that analog is an inferior recording medium needs to listen to the releases in this series.  If well recorded and well produced to vinyl, LPs can sound amazing.  The vinyl here is quiet, heavy and pressed flat.  The music jumps off the groove here, and the large format allows the album photos to impact.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|A surprise package of fun, fright and untamed imagination. A movie that delivers plenty of inventive thrills.
0385504225|5.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books, I would say this is probably tied for my 2nd favorite.  My favorite is Angels & Demons, T-2nd is Deception Point.  In addition to being entertained, when reading his books, I feel like I'm learning something.  The Lost Symbol continues in that tradition.  I always find myself Google-ing things from the book to learn more.    Though many of his books have had some religious components, the component in The Lost Symbol is truely unique!  If you're a fan of Dan Brown's, you must add this to your collection!  If you've yet been introduced, this is a must read as well, but I would start in the order of their chronology: Angels & Demons, The Davinci Code, and then The Lost Symbol!    Happy reading!!!
B000YPUF9W|5.0|The story was good. This film was the best out of the trilogy. The acting was great. Milla delivered a great performance, so did Ali Larter. Spectacular visuals.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan is a real star and I hope she will continue to record lots of music.  All kinds.  Gospel,  romantic,  pop,  classics, all of it.  She is fantastic.  A duet with Andrea Bocelli would be fantastic!!!!
B000NJVWTQ|3.0|The late Eric Woolfson states that it was his fascination with architect Antonio Gaudi that led to 1987's \\"Gaudi,\\" the 11th and final proper Alan Parsons Project album. And like Gaudi's famous La Sagrada Familia, a cathedral that remains under construction to this day despite Gaudi's death in 1926. Gaudi designed and built colorful, spiraling and imaginative buildings throughout Spain, but it is his cathedral that remains the best known of his works.<br /><br />It is that cathedral that provides the best moments on \\"Gaudi.\\" The opening track is a near nine minute epic, \\"La Sagrada Familia.\\" Then the finale, the instrumental \\"Paseo De Gracia\\" (Path of Grace), with Spanish guitar over lush orchestration, is vintage APP. Other than \\"Closer To Heaven, though, the remaining tracks do not seem to have much to tie them together thematically. The production values are still flawless, and the sound of this remaster is fantastic, but the album itself is weak.<br /><br />The usual team provides highlights, with Wolfson, John Miles and Lenny Zakatek giving the solid vocals. On the rockier song, \\"Standing On Higher Ground,\\" it's Geoff Barradale (who was the lead singer in cult faves Vitamin Z) who gives \\"Gaudi\\" its punchiest moment. The rough version of \\"Standing On Higher Ground\\" shows up as a bonus track with Wolfson showing an uncharacteristic silliness, along with a demo of \\"Too Late,\\" where the vocal is just the melody song in la la la and do do do. Not exactly essential, but interesting. \\"Gaudi\\" also lacks the in-depth liner notes that the earlier re-issues had, like Parsons and Wolfson commenting on the demos and bonus material. Which makes this, the last of the Alan Parsons Project re-issues, one of the lesser in the pack.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Loved this CD.  Susan Boyle is a star!  Want to hear more from her.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian kicks your B-hind! Don't get scared though! This dvd it TOTALLY worth buying, and for 1st timers I HIGHLY recommend it.  Plus the price makes you feel like you totally got an awesome deal, which you do!
0385333846|5.0|I re-read this friend after twenty-five years or so, and it's as wonderful  and terrible today as it was then. Vonnegut's style is original without trying to be different; it's a natural voice that is as easy to read as it must have been fiendishly difficult to write. Of all the book's wonderful qualities, perhaps its finest asset is its brevity. You will rush from beginning to end in a flash, and at the conclusion will be surprised that so much could have been packed into so few pages.<br /><br />Although the book's comparison between Dresden and Hiroshima/Nagasaki is oblique, it nonetheless hits with great force. Vonnegut's derision towards the official Air Force history, and his portrayal of the military's discomfort with this act of terror against an unarmed city contrast with the self-righteous justifications of those who trumpet the use of atomic weapons on Japan in 1945.<br /><br />This book was, and remains, one of the seminal English language antiwar novels.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Directed by newcomer Neill Blomkamp, District 9 opens with an introduction of the character Wikus Van De Merwe (played be another newcomer, Sharlto Copley) and a series of mock news footage compiled together imitating a documentary. The footage shows that during the 1980s, an alien vessel landed (sort of) in Johannesburg, South Africa and was unable to leave. It is never explained why the aliens are here, only that people hate and fear them. The aliens are referred to only as \\"Prawns.\\" This is something of a derogatory term and they were labeled this because of the way they look. Anyway, these Prawns were quarantined in an area isolated from humans. This area quickly became a slum complete with crime, extreme poverty, and militarized security. Wikus is a field operative for a organization known as Multinational United (MNU) and is promoted to a position where it becomes his responsibility to inform the Prawns that they are to be evicted to a district 10, which is even smaller and more isolated that the current living conditions; while doing so, he destroys Prawn eggs and smiles to the camera. A little over half of the film is shot in the manner of a documentary and is incredibly reminiscent of footage of real life refugee camps. The film's commentary on the conditions is obvious and it becomes incredibly easy to sympathize with the Prawns, especially when we are introduced to Christopher Johnson, a Prawn who is considerably smarter than the others we are introduced to and displays more emotion than many of the humans in the film. His plan is to repair a ship that will allow him to rescue his people from the hellhole that they are forced to live in. Things get complicated when Wikus gets infected with a special fluid that slowly, in a manner reminiscent to Jeff Goldblum's transformation in The Fly (his teeth fall out, etc.), begins changing him into a Prawn.<br /><br />District 9 works incredibly well in a number of ways: The documentary style portions of the film are easily the strongest, as they create a scenario that feels real and is all too comparable to actual historical situations, more specifically, the apartheid system of racial segregation that was in South Africa for many years. The title is even a reference to District 6, which was one such location in Cape Town in the 60s. The visual effects are very impressive, but with Peter Jackson (Director of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) credited as a producer, this should come as no surprise. The film loses a bit of its steam towards the end however, and becomes more of a typical action sci-fi film, complete with robot suits (that use the inside the helmet view from Iron Man) and laser guns. It's no surprise that the governments keep the aliens on earth because of the desire for their weaponry. After seeing them in action, it becomes obvious how useful they are at killing people. This begs the question: Why haven't the aliens been using them? Granted, this would be a different film if the aliens willing to fight back, but with such awesome weaponry, you have to wonder what's been preventing them from doing so.<br /><br />The action scenes are spectacular and dramatic, but cinematically, it contrasts greatly with the documentary footage than dominates the first half of the film. The action scenes and most of the film after mutant-Wikus goes on the run are shot more traditionally and this is clearly intended to personalize the story. But what it causes is a bit of a disruption. It feels like Neill Blomkamp was trying to have it both ways: a meaningful sci-fi commenting on a real world problem and at the same time, a blockbuster with people exploding and giant robots. Both of these things are fine, but together, in the way that the film is structured, it comes off as a bit uneven. That being said, District 9 is still a great film with a message, which is a lot more than can be said about other films this summer.

1416524290|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite of Stephen King's novels.  Everyone should read it.<br />I read it many years ago but still remember how much I enjoyed it.  I don't always enjoy his novels, but this is one I kept to re-read.
B00192IV0O|5.0|This is my first purchase of the Black Eyed Peas and I love it.  What a unique sound. So upbeat. I needed to learn my grandkids music likes and I'm glad I picked this to start with.  I would love to see them live!
0307454541|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years. And I read 8- 10 books per month, usually from the library. With this kind of reading habit I could go broke buying all those books! But this is one book I had to own. I knew I was going to want to read it more than once. The characters and plot are unusual, interesting and addicting. The book was a thriller with plenty of suspense and no way to predict the outcome as the characters themselves are not predictable. Great read. I was shocked and disappointed to find out the author was deceased, but then relieved to find out there are two more books in the series, one of which has not been released yet. It's like finding gold, hidden in the floorboards! Love, love, love!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Once I played the CD, I immediately ordered one each for my daughters. I look forward to her next CD or DVD. Her versatility of different music styles is outstanding.
0307341569|2.0|The thing that stands out in my mind about this book is that you are \\"inside\\" the minds of these totally dysfunctional characters.  We all \\"talk\\" to ourselves when we're alone ... in our cars, rooms, shopping ... wherever.  But here you know what they are thinking and feeling in situations that make one squirm.  All of this character revealing is a slow-go ... you just want to get to the heart of the story and that is what pushed me along, to reach the end.  And here's the thing, I thought I had it figured out but I wasn't prepared for the ending!  That's why 2**'s; otherwise 1*.  I am still thinking about that ending a day later.  This book is not for everyone.  It is definitely dark, detailed, rambling and irritating, but if you can make it to the end, you'll get your pay back.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|after reading all of Dan Brown's books i didn't know i could still be impressed.
0786868724|5.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and think this is the best yet even though the others were great.  I think he is a great writer and very easy to read.  I would recommend this to any one with a heart.  It caused me to tear up a few times and not many books have ever had that effect on me.
B001QOGYBS|5.0|This is in regards to the Theatrical Release not the Blu Ray edition<br /><br />It is always interesting when your favorite directors take on new material that you would never associate them with. It shows versatility and their unique style to a genre they haven't explored in the film medium.<br />Wes Anderson has done that with Fantastic Mr. Fox. A wonderful stop motion animated film, something you do not see in these times with CGI dominating the animated world.<br /><br />Anderson is known for his eccentric characters, wry humor, witty one liners,  and always his themes with family and the rifts that go on in one's family's unit. All his characters in all his films have weaknesses, flaws, fear, ego maniacal, and humble.<br /><br />So we are introduced to Mr. Fox voiced by George Clooney who is egotistical, sly, conniving... well just like a... Fox! He robs chickens, and he's good at it, it's an adrenaline rush to him, but he gives it all up when Mrs. Fox announces she is pregnant voiced by Meryl Streep. So Mr. fox trades in a life of chicken snatching to Fatherhood/ Domestic life and he is restless, because always thinking always coming up with crazy plans he hasn't soothed that itch to go out and snatch chickens. To satisfy this urge and not let the Mrs. catch on who isn't just some bored housewife who is quite smart and knows what her hubby is up too, Mr. Fox goes for the trifecta and robs three farmers one dealing in chickens, one in hard apple cider and one goose farmer, all ripe for the picking. Anyways as the story progresses Mr. Fox and his ally which animal it is I forget, make way with quit a load of stolen goods. This doesn't bode well for the farmers or Mr. Fox and family and eclectic mix of animal dwellers in the forest, one friend is the badger voiced by Bill Murray. So moving on the three farmers want to exterminate Mr. Fox and family.<br /><br />Meanwhile as this is going on, Mr. Fox's son voiced by Jason Schwartzman is vying for his affections of his dad by his rival cousin, who is much more athletic, a ladies man, more smooth, and Mr. Fox is smitten with the cousin and this causes young Fox to feel jealously. Where Schwartzman's young fox is just trying to find his niche in the family and a sense of belonging. Then there is Mrs. Fox who is trying to balance the family, keep Mr. Fox's ego in check, but yet putting trust in him that he can save the family and friends in this dire time.<br /><br />So we go on an adventure as Mr. Fox and family and friends must flee underground from the farmers.<br /><br />The film has Wes Anderson written all over it even though adapted from a story. Wes Anderson uses all his film techniques you've seen in his previous films, the movie is broken in chapters, close ups of the faces, quick pans, the humor, now Anderson has replaced the curses with the word cuss... it is pure genius, one scene that got a good laugh from the adults in the audience when I saw it was when Mr. Fox is lying in bed and says, \\"We are cluster cussed\\".It stays true to the PG format yet you still feel you are in an Anderson film, he doesn't make it all cutsie for the kiddies, yes the kids will like it because of the animation and some funny scenes but as an Anderson fan you will like it because of what I have mentioned.  I don't think kids will understand the story. Just like how parents took their kids to see Where the Wild Things Are... great movie but not for kids, even though it got the PG label and parents blindly took them to go see it because they thought it would be \\"cute\\" and they remember the book... WRONG, first of all Spike Jonze made a great movie with deep underlying themes that most adults would understand not some 6 to 10 year old would.<br /><br />Anyways I thought the character Mr. Fox had a little Dignan, a little Steve Zissou, and Max Fischer in him, as you remember Dignan was a character is Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket, Steve Zissou in Life Aquatic and Max Fischer in Anderson's great Rushmore.<br />And in any Wes Anderson film you get a wonderful soundtrack, from the beach boys to the rolling stones among others played out in the movie. Only thing missing from this movie as in all Anderson films is the slow motion shot, all his movies had scene that plays out in slow motion, I don't remember such a scene in this one. I thought the film had a nice 60s vibe to it and a British feel as well.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film, a must see for any Wes Anderson fanerful soundtrack, from the beach boys to the rolling stones among others played out in the movie.

B0026P3G12|5.0|If you have been waiting for a legitimate 'feel good' story for 2009, your wait has been worth every second.  Susan Boyle's incredible journey from obscurity to international stardom has touched the hearts of millions around the world.  Now you can share her vision with the hit CD \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\".  The selections are varied,  her performance will exceed your expectations, and with a touch of simple humility she has won over even the most discerning music critics.
B002I9Z89Y|4.0|Everything about this set is fantastic, except that for some reason the episodes \\"Amok Time\\", and \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\" (both enhanced and original versions) won't play on my machine. I don't know if it's a problem with the discs or with my player, as I haven't tried to play them on a different one. But all other episodes from the Season 2 set play fine... as well as those on both Season 1 and Season 3 sets, so I'm inclined to think it's a problem with the discs.
1582701709|5.0|This is also a great book to read. I love every pages. Thank you for writing this book.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|My husband and I both qualify for senior discount meals. And I am a life time fan of the beautiful old time watercolor cartoons that Disney used to make. I also wish I could find the cartoons that Turner network used to show on tv a long time ago. Anyway my husband and I both were delighted with this movie. It's quite entertaining and compelling to watch. The writers are very clever in the lines the canines say. The blu ray technology really dazzles you in this too. This is one of the better Disney movies. Shrek for instance was ok the first time, but the second and third were deplorably void of quality content. A children's movie? No wonder kids can be so rotten these days with this kind of output seeping into their young minds that their parents allow them to consume. Shrek is garbage. Even Happy Feet, though cute moments, had sexual overtones that was that should never become 'normal' viewing for young minds!
B002VKE1K2|2.0|and it never happened. If you like loud noises and lights turning off you will probably like this movie. If this movie scares you then you scare way too easy.    Maybe it was just over hyped and I expected to see something different. Two stars because I did watch the entire thing in hopes that something would happen. If it was one star bad I wouldn't have been able to stick with it.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|If you're a huge fan of all three of these guys you might love this film. But if you're just a big Page fan you may find it a bit less than awesome. This is a film not about great guitar playing but about three of the most famous musicians of their respective generations. Whether or not the Edge or Jack White is a great guitar player is a matter of opinion. One thing is obvious. These three have almost nothing in common and it shows. There's lots of biographical clips but no complete songs. The fact that Page isn't going to sing on any of his bits explains their brevity. Fortunately a deleted scene shows Page playing a new two minute piece on acoustic and that is the musical highlight of the dvd.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I liked Robert Langdon in A&D, but in Symbol, I find my self bored by him. My main problems with Dan Brown and his writing is this (and really it's not as bad in these latest books of his but if you have ever read DP or DF by him, you will know what I am getting at): He will imply something, then he will tell it to you, then he will tell it to you in more detail, THEN he will go in to torturous amounts of detail explaining every little deduction, analysis, and fact as to why what he's showing you is what is happening. I didn't mind as much in A&D, perhaps because I was actually extremely fascinated by the science supporting religion theory, but in DP, DF (especially DF!), DVC and LS, all I could think is why am I reading this?
B002Y5210G|4.0|Alicia Keys has some very nice songs on this album. I think its a winner. Also if you like Alica Keys music you might also like \\"Sophisticated Man\\" by elishema it has positive words, dymanic singing, and is similar in style.
0385532458|4.0|writes with ability to put you right there with the people he's writing about.  a great writer, albeit some of his material is jaded (about people in church, etc.), but, then, that is to be expected of most of us.  i really liked the innocent man,especially.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Delivery time was excellent, I believe that I got it one day after I ordered!  Thank you so much!  It is in excellent condition and I got it for an excellent price.  Thank you so much!
B002LMV7TS|4.0|I've watched this movie several times over the past few years, it's a cute movie overall, although at times a bit over acted.  Kids should enjoy this and it is true to the original animated version and storyline. However, a few concerns of the Blu-Ray edition:  First, the imaging is good, but not fantastic- a bit dull for blu-ray. Secondly, there appears to be a few missing scenes-----The \\"lighting contest winner announcement\\" is not in this version, nor is the congratulations you've \\"maxed out your credit card scene.\\"  Anyhow, it is a cute movie that appeals to all generations.
044654146X|5.0|START-UP NATION is a \\"must read.\\" I've suggested it to several friends and purchased two copies for family members. The authors offer an introspective, detailed look at what makes Israel tick.  Among their many contributions to readers' craving for a better understanding of this amazing country, the authors prompted me to conclude that American business leaders should take a page from the Israeli playbook by hiring many more of our combat veterans--men and women--to jump start U.S. companies. For far too long, corporate recruiters and in-house human resources personnel in our country have failed to fully value the talent, innovation, maturity and drive reflected in military resumes.  As the numbers of U.S. Representatives and Senators with prior military experience (not to mention working media and corporate executives) continue to decline, perhaps this fact is not surprising.  Nonetheless, as Israel's success demonstrates, U.S. businesses have not fully tapped the leadership expertise of our war-tested service members.    Ritch K. Eich, Ph.D.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I just happened on this David Garrett CD, not knowing anything about him, but after reviewing a couple of tracks decided to get it.<br />I am just WOWED by this man's vitality and could not stop playing it. I love his versions of Carmens Fantasie and Pirates of the Caribbean, but was also touched and moved by his own composition of Chelsea Girl (a melancholy love theme). I shall definately keep my eye on this young musician.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Definitivamente es una obra maestra, no cabe duda del talento de Lady Gaga, se nota perfectamente la evolución de un disco a otro. Vale la pena tenerlo en nuestra colección.
B001DUMHA2|5.0|I got this album for my son for Christmas. He was thrilled as he had it in CD form, but wanted the vinyl. He is really \\"into\\" jazz and recommends this album highly. Miles is the absolute best in this genre'. He and his two-month old daughter listen to \\"Kind of Blue\\" together. She seems to love the mellow sound, especially in the middle of the night.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|There are performances and music that are enjoyable and some that serve as distractions. Then there are a few that are in an elevated category that touch one's soul in a very deep way. Such is my reaction to much of the content of \\"Nights from the Alhambra.\\"    This is in the context of someone like myself who is not versed in Celtic folklore and spirituality. While I do not adequately appreciate the lyrics of some of the music (nor understand their meaning) based in this setting, I do feel very moved by the romanticism expressed in much of the lyrics, the melodies, and the haunting delivery of the music by Loreena McKennitt.    The only song in the performance that doesn't speak to my preference for musical style is \\"The Bonny Swans\\" (which may be a favorite of many of her fans!) which tends to be delivered in a primarily \\"rock\\" sound. I can accept the presence of one such song amidst the many others that consist of a large variety of styles ranging from such a song like this to the extremely slow-moving \\"She Moved Through the Fair.\\"    Instrumental pieces like \\"Santiago\\" and \\"Marco Polo\\" were invigorating.    The concert consists of what seems like a \\"best of \\" from her collection up through 2006, including Celtic ballads, instrumentals, and literary narratives put to music.    The literary narratives are the ones that touched me the most deeply. My favorites included \\"Penelope's Song,\\" and \\"Dante's Prayer.\\" The final song of the concert (penultimate actually, as that song demanded an encore) for which applause seems so inappropriate due its quality is \\"Never-Ending Road.\\" The first time I heard this song I thought, \\"it can't get any better than this.\\" That song impressed me as of the kind that needs no further performance statement.    This was the first time I had experienced Loreena McKennitt in a visual media form. I was introduced to her music previously only by way of audio. I was struck by the exact treatment and pacing she used in phrasing. There are singers, performers, musicians, and then there are artists. Experiencing her in this form increased my appreciation for her artistry.    I watched the DVD on an average television monitor and heard the audio through a tv's stereo speakers (versus using a surround system, which is one of the audio options to hear the audio of the DVD) and was still very pleased with the recording, particularly of the audio engineering and sound range of instruments, such as from the different drums that was captured (like the \\"boom-boom-swish\\" capturing the sound of the movement from the bass drums to the cymbals!) on cuts like \\"Caravanserai.\\"    Video shots of the concert were adequate giving the viewer various views of the concert hall and musicians. Particular care was given on focusing on a musician whose instrument dominated the portion of the music at the moment. Shots were of various distances throughout the concert - distant from the back of the concert hall (including the ceiling and back/side walls to half way back, to the front row, to extreme closeups (good thing that LM's makeup was put on perfectly!!)     I would have liked more features as options on the DVD, such as subtitles (onscreen lyrics available during her singing - one must go to the quinlanroad website to get all the lyrics), a short feature on the symbolism used in the lyrics.     The packaging design of the DVD/CD is very stylish, very elegant, perhaps in the same theme as the Moorish subject of the concert. Even the design placement of the CDs and DVD inside the package is very elegant.    I urge anyone who is not familiar with her music to watch the DVD first - then listen to the CDs. Getting exposed to this music combined with the visuals is a much more powerful experience than simply taking in the audio. Some of this music I had never heard before, and it was a very powerful experience to experience it in the manner it unfolded. Such a case was with \\"The Old Ways,\\" (one of the most powerful pieces in the concert, particularly by the way it ends), and of course, \\"Never-Ending Road.\\"    This is a concert to watch on DVD with no distractions for full impact. One of the most moving, enjoyable, and soul stirring concerts I have watched. For any LM fans, a must-have.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Inglorious Basterds is one of the worst movies and for sure worst movie from Quentin Tarantino. Totally a waste of time to watch it and talk or write about it.   At the  end silliness is a theme that runs through the movie  and a remarkably bad film.  I do not give not even one star.

B002SYXCVK|4.0|If you relish Sting's \\"Ghost Story\\", you will likely enjoy much of this album as I do.  Sting always seems at his very best when he is moved to present what is meaningful, confessional and/or beautiful.  He stumbles when he tries too hard to be clever as it seems to have happened on \\"Songs from the Labyrinth\\".  Thankfully, \\"If On a Winter's Night...\\" is much more courageous and heartfelt than \\"Songs from the Labyrinth\\".  It seems as if he really wants us to hear these songs, not just the fact that he has learned to play the lute. Much of this album is quite sincere and the artistry is, as a result, felt rather than merely given testimony in most of what you will find. At its best, \\"If On a Winter's Night...\\" is quite marvelous.  In fact, if you listen to Tracks 1,4,5,7,9,10,11,12,13 & 15 you have an incomparably honest, raspy, and moving 10 song collection - - perhaps the best thing Sting has ever recorded.  I humbly recommend that you make this collection of tracks your version of \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\"     Much of this album reminds me of the image of the candle melting an arc of an opening over the flame in the frosted glass of David Lean's windows throughout \\"Dr. Zhivago\\".   \\"Gabriel's Message\\" is sparse, elegant, and inspired.  \\"The Snow It Melts The Soonest\\" is wonderful with threadbare honesty and reaches its pinnacle in the unpretentious bridge. \\"Christmas at Sea\\" is intriguing with its organic lilt even if it suffers a bit as a less melodic reinvention of \\"Why Should I Cry For You\\".  \\"Cold Song\\" is beautiful, haunting and emblematic of the best ambitions of the CD.  \\"Now Winter Comes Slowly\\" is a gem.  \\"The Hounds of Winter\\" arrangement is inspired and the whole song has great feeling and depth that far exceeds its original \\"Mercury Falling\\" exposition. \\"Balulalow\\" sounds like Winter wind outside the window with a striking use of background vocals and Mr. Botti's trumpet.  \\"Cherry Tree Carol\\" is neat, efficient, and uncluttered like a Bento box lunch.\\"Lullaby for An Anxious Child\\" should never have been lost to obscurity with \\"Pirate's Bride\\". It finds more depth with the context of these songs and the musicianship of the additional parties. \\"You Only Cross My Mind in Winter\\" is nearly perfect in conception and execution and leaves you wanting to listen to the whole CD again (or at least my 10 song unofficial version) if only to be present for the ending it creates one more time.            If you are wondering if the praise above are the rantings of a rabid Sting fan as you weigh the value of this review, I should note that I do believe that along with these resplendent achievements there are some fundamental blunders on this CD.  \\"Soul Cakes\\" seems to be an attempt to say something important but presents a startling lack of lyrical or melodic interest to do so. Note to music historians: some folk songs remain obscure for good reason.  \\"There is No Rose of Such Virtue\\" is strangled by unconnected percussion that must be a left over sample from \\"Desert Rose\\".  One cannot help but wonder if Tracks 2 and 3 are meant as peace offerings to those looking for an \\"uptempo\\" Police album.   \\"Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming\\"  - - a beautiful choral song - - is absolutely ruined by one verse with gratuitous, stuccato strings and voice over movie narration theatrics that seem as if Sting is channeling his \\"existential cowboy villain\\". \\"The Burning Babe\\" seems to have been included more because of the interesting imagery of the lyrics than because it is a complete, compelling song. It's like \\"Strange Fruit\\" without any bitter reverance.  The awkward parroting of a Marsalis sax solo at the end confirms that something went terribly awry on \\"The Burning Babe\\".  \\"The Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" seems like a contrived opportunity to reclaim the melodeon from the French and to press Chaucer's analog to the obligatory country song every Sting album suffers through.     \\"If on A Winter's Night..\\" marks the promise of a reinvention that is at once unique and meaningful and moving.  Hopefully, we will see it reach its full flower next time around.  In the meanwhile, Tracks 1,4,5,7,9,10,11,12,13 & 15 make for something quite special.   I highly recommend two-thirds of \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\".

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great fun,excellent CG and a really good way to forget reality for a few hours.Yes,I watched it twice.Well written,answers some questions.
B00006RT56|5.0|For fans of the Rolling Stones, this is an excellent collection of their pre-1970 singles and B-sides (both US and UK).  If you are just discovering the Stones, here is a good place to start.
0385737424|5.0|This book is just note-perfect.  I could not have been more won over by the storytelling, characters, and plot. It's hard to talk too much about it because so much of the joy is watching the mystery unfold, but there is such a wonderful sense of mastery in the writing that really makes you more than happy to follow whatever twists await. It's an absolute must-read particularly, but not exclusively, for anyone who's a fan of A Wrinkle in Time.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|There are already lots of reviews posted that rave about this \\"fantastic\\" movie Avatar. I won't re-hash most of what has already been posted... but, wanted to put my 2 cents worth in.  By far, Avatar is one of the best SyFy movie I have ever seen. The new CGI Technology is nothing short of spectacular. To fully experience the spellbinding quality of  this movie, you must see it in Digital 3-D. (Preferably iMax 3-D). WARNING!!!! Some theaters are showing this movie in 3-D... but not Digital 3-D! Which is stupid... and the equivalent of eating Pizza with no sauce or cheese. Or buying an HDTV, then using an analog box with it.    My husband and I saw it Christmas night and were blown away!   What I don't \\"get\\"... are the \\"So-So\\" even some \\"deeply negative\\" reviews I read before seeing the movie. I can only conclude that the unflattering reviews are based on what is \\"PC\\" (in their eyes)... and personally, I'm sick of it.  I don't care that Sigourney Weaver smoked a couple of cigarettes on screen. I don't care that the U.S. Military was made into the \\"bad-guy\\".  This movie did not make me want to smoke, or hate our military.  It's a Damn good Movie! Lighten-up!   I loved the story line. No, it's not the \\"deepest\\" or \\"most complex\\" movie I've ever seen... but you will find yourself REALLY caring about the characters in the movie.   Over the past few years, the vast majority of movies (especially SyFy movies) have been boring. Mostly because \\"they\\" paid too much attention to the special effects and almost none to the story.  Avatar is so visually astonishing (and heart warming) ... you will enjoy this movie regardless if you are a SyFy fan or not.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These are incredible! The sound is amazing, but that's only part of the story. The surround sound pulls you into the game in a new way you've never experienced. I'm playing COD MW2 with them and I know where my opponents are by their footsteps. I had no idea gaming could be so much better by adding surround sound.
B002YVAT72|3.0|I'm upgrading this from the one star I gave it soon after we hooked it up.    When I first hooked it up to the stereo receiver, it sounded terrible. I sent an email to Ion tech support and never heard back. On a day off from work, I was able to actually CALL tech support, which turned out to be good. I didn't have to wait to get a customer service rep; he figured out the problem in a couple of questions; and he waited while I moved the plugs around. The turntable has a built-in preamp and so, DO NOT PLUG IT IN TO THE PHONO JACKS ON YOUR RECEIVER. PLUG IT INTO THE TAPE 2 JACKS INSTEAD.    The turntable sounds good now. I haven't tried digitizing any records yet, so that part is not included in this review. If it does that well and easily it might earn another star.    Like many electronics nowadays, it is very lightly (cheaply) built and does not have the heft of my 25-year-old Technics turntable that finally gave up the ghost.
B00129H7VS|5.0|hands down, best war movie I've ever seen... and I've seen a LOT.  I own the standard DVD set and just picked up the blu-ray set last week.  very significant upgrade in picture quality even on my 32\\" 720p LCD screen.  if you are a fan of this series, the blu-ray set is a MUST HAVE at this sale price!
0375701427|5.0|I learned more about the glove industry and glove making from this novel than I ever imagined I wanted to know.  There's a tradition of American novels centered on a trade or industry.  The most notable of which, of course, is Moby Dick.  I also treasured Sometimes a Great Notion by Ken Kesey (logging in Oregon). This is another great one. It is centered on glove-making.    The main theme of this difficult and brilliant novel by Roth is the debacle that can become of decent moral lives.  All the other themes we expect from Roth novels are here as well:  Sex, but less of it than usual for Roth; intense scrutiny of secular Jewish New York lives and families; Newark, New Jersey--its streets, history, and sociology; and Jewish boy-shiksa girl.      Jewish boy marries darling shiksa girl and therein seems to be the origin of the debacle of their lives.  Jewish boy--Seymour Levov, aka The Swede--is the true blue opposite of the nerd.  He's athletic, blond (thus Swede), kind, as square and straight ruled as a chess board.  He's hard working, considerate, intelligent, a good father and husband, friend to the oppressed, and to the powerful.  The Swede's wife Dawn was Miss New Jersey, although she is embarrassed about that.  Catholic, pretty, sweet, a good mother and wife.  (Roth uses a lot of sentence fragments also.  This seems like a cheap trope to me--not worthy of Roth.) Their daughter Merry turns into a demon who ruins their settled, prosperous lives.     Merry is the enigma of this novel.  She is not like other Roth characters.  Merry seemed to me to emerge, rather, from a book by Ian McEwan or John Banville.  She's a twisted and incomprehensible person.  She's a fantasy, a nightmare.  Her terror seems to come from nowhere to torment her fine American mother and father.  Maybe the gods hate the goodness and well-being of The Swede and Dawn.  They've got to be tested like Job.  I think they failed the test.     Roth cleverly tells the story from different angles.  The beginning is a first person recollection by Zuckerman of his childhood hero, The Swede.  Then the narrative switches to fantasy or imaginative reconstruction of Swede's life.  The transition is a bit jarring, but it enables Roth to get different angles on the main character.  If this were Conrad at work, it would be a story within a story within a story told by gents sitting around a card table late one night.     The Swede's brother, Jerry, is the complete nerd--the direct opposite of Swede.  He stumbles and lurches through life and seems to do OK.  Indeed, he's a successful doctor with several divorces to his credit. Their father and mother, Lou and Sylvia Levov, are hard-working stolid second generation Newark Jews.  Lou started the glove business in Newark.  Made it very successful.  Swede now runs the business.  All but Jerry seem to be dismantled by Merry and her sinister ways.
0385504225|1.0|All the pre-release hype influenced me to buy The Lost Symbol the day it was released. After an interesting and inviting start, the story plunged rapidly into an incredulous and predictable yarn, clearly written with \\"Action Movie\\" in mind. As a novel goes the story lacks all the elements to make it a good read for an adult who appreciates being taken on a journey that is credible, interesting and suspenseful. This is my last Dan Brown book.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Heart... yes, this making cd took a lot of heart and it is truly from the heart. The songs Bob chose are all the ones I've always enjoyed. It would take a very small-minded, petty person to criticize this effort. So what if his voice is coarse & gravelly? When I sing along with him, I sound good!  And Bob has again shown the size of his heart by donating money from this cd to help feed hungry people.  Thank you, Bob Dylan, for making my Christmas just a little more merry.
B001OQCV60|5.0|My apologies to Harry Eagar and his scathing review, but he must have seen a different SHERLOCK HOLMES than I did.<br /><br />I'll say this: This isn't your Grandmother's Sherlock Holmes. No plodding Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce plot pacing here. This is very definitely a 21st Century reimagining of Holmes. I suppose purists might dislike it, but I've never cared for the snoringly slow interpretations of most prior performers.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr., by now the 214th person to play Holmes, brings him to life with a curious admixture of brilliance and slovenliness that nevertheless manages to capture the true essence of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's consulting detective with panache.<br /><br />When we first see Holmes he has eremetically sealed himself in his room and is distracting his bored mind by inventing a gunpowder neutralizer. Bullet holes scar the walls. \\"It isn't working,\\" he laments to Dr. Watson (Jude Law) his sidekick, who is in the process of moving out and into happy domesticity with his wife-to-be.<br /><br />Holmes' most recent case has put the nefarious Lord Blackwood, a black magician, onto Death Row. After his hanging, he somehow resurrects himself, and his killing spree begins anew. The panicked authorities turn to Holmes.<br /><br />Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), Mistress of All Criminals and Holmes' former lover, is put up to distracting Holmes, but nothing distracts him when the game is afoot.<br /><br />This is a very action-packed movie. Holmes is adept with weapons, with techniques of unarmed combat, and in creating all kinds of havoc in the London of the 1880s. Like most action movies of our time SHERLOCK HOLMES tries to out-do itself with inventive disasters, massive explosions, and rapid-fire plot twists. To be honest, I find most movies of this genre hyperactive, but this film's solid grounding as a \\"period piece\\" tends to keep it well rooted, and it is inventive. It never flies out of control as (for example) [[ASIN:B0002KVUKM Van Helsing]] did.<br /><br />SHERLOCK HOLMES does sample Johnny Depp's [[ASIN:B00006JDU8 From Hell]] just a shade too much, but part of that is unavoidable as both took place at literally the same time in the same setting. Less forgivable is this film's nod to Vin Diesel in [[ASIN:B00005JL3K XXX]].<br /><br />Given the richness of the Holmes canon, some of the derivatives here were just not necessary. Other than that, I strongly suggest we all make Robert Downey Jr. OUR Sherlock Holmes. And you may well ask, \\"Where is Professor Moriarity?\\"<br /><br />Where indeed?  ;)hnny Depp's [[ASIN:B00006JDU8 From Hell]] just a shade too much, but part of that is unavoidable as both took place at literally the same time in the same setting.

0060557818|4.0|Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman<br />3.75 (Rounded to 4)<br /><br />Richard Mayhew, engaged to Jessica and working in Securities finds what he thinks is a hurt, homeless girl on his way to a restaurant, and by helping her his life changes drastically.<br /><br />The London that he knows gives way to a different London \\"London Below\\" where people who fall through the gaps and cracks end up in. Deep down, beneath the sewers and underground, people and other creatures reside. And once you enter London Below, you can never get your old life back, or so legend has it. Richard has no choice then, except to look for Door (the girl he helped) as she tries and solves the mystery revolving around her family. Along with two others, they sidestep dangers and face challenges in the many ordeals of London Below.<br /><br />Didn't know there was a series by the same name and author (the book is an expansion of the series). And a movie might be in the making. Might check them out.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Well I am a superman fan, and I have loved the show for past some years. And I got this season at a great price during the Thanks Giving Sale on Amazon. Great Stuff
B002T9H2LA|2.0|While there were several very good performances in this movie and some memorable scenes overall the film was very slow and way too long. The movie is based on a fantasy and at times is so thoroughly unbelievable to the point that I felt like I was watching a cartoon spoof flick.  The movie could have used an injection of humor, with the subject matter this would have been a much more enjoyable film if it hadn't taken itself so seriously. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the commander of the Jewish comandos was the only part of the movie that hinted at humor and it was unintentional.  Looking back at all of the WW II movies over the last 50 years fictional or not this film rates fairly low in my book.  That is a shame, it could have been much better.
B000MG1YC0|3.0|Sirenia's Nine Destinies and a Downfall is a solid album with good songs, but it suffers from being too repetitive.  The songs blur together even after repeated listens and though it seemingly is a concept album (listen for a particular musical theme to be repeated in some interlude in each song) the music falls into a very formulaic pattern.  Again, it is not bad, just predictable.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I think this is the best book EVER written. This is easily a 4 star book. Im only 11 and Im smart enough to know the greatest book ever is this one. I enjoyed this book and I hope you do too. ENJOY!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" is a brilliant, well-written and superbly crafted look at life on Pandora, a mining outpost manned by ex-US servicemen. The problem is that the locals, a blue-skinned band of \\"savage\\" cat people, is sitting right on top of the planet's biggest lode of mineral wealth. What's an imperialist power (with investors demanding a fat quarterly bottom line) to do?<br /><br />This is one of the most visually exciting and innovative movies I have ever seen. The scenes in the primeval forest are breath-taking. Phosphorescent plants illuminate the night. Tiny animals -- a cross between jellyfish and downy seedlings -- float about, like blessings from a beneficent deity. The people live in the Home Tree, an enormous elaborate self-contained habitat that is of a piece with the rest of the planet. The animals are terrifying and thrilling -- 6-legged horses, blue and orange variegated pterodactyl-like birds, packs of sleek,black dog-like animals. The scenery is equally astounding -- full of floating mountains, cascading waterfalls, tendrils and gigantic plants. Avatar is a visual feast that outdoes even \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy in raw beauty and inventiveness.<br /><br />I also loved the \\"plausible enough\\" premise that the Earthlings needed to develop inhabitable bodies to try to communicate with the ferals in the forest. Sigourney Weaver was terrific as chain-smoking Grace, a no-nonsense scientist who wants to study Pandora's habitat. Sam Worthington was fine as Jake Sully, a wheelchair-bound Marine who finds freedom from his injuries when controlling his own Avatar.<br /><br />But the film's message is as hard to miss as the gigantic Home Tree itself. Avatar pits militaristic, spiritually-bankrupt and greedy exploiters against a warrior-shaman race that lives in harmony with its surroundings. The film's extraordinary special effects and it weird, terrifying creatures aside, it is almost impossible to see it as anything but an elaborate allegory of the history of the Western powers over the last few hundred years. The cat people are modeled physically on African and American Indian physiognomy, culture and body decoration. Their spirituality is entwined deeply with the natural world they co-inhabit. And if you fail to get the parallel, there no mistaking the African-themed music that pounds out of the theater speakers. Anyone doubting Cameron's critique need only read the histories of the Caribbean under the Spanish, the Philippines and the US West under the Americans, Vietnam under the French, the Congo under the Belgians, and South Africa under the Dutch and the British. It's astounding and fairly courageous for Cameron to have conceived of such an attack against the dark side of his own culture, and to make it into an appealing blockbuster at the same time.<br /><br />Though movie fans will note borrowings from \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Star Wars,\\" Avatar stands as an extraordinary achievement on several fronts -- artistic, technological and political. It will likely be a huge contender at the next Oscars.rn powers over the last few hundred years.

B0000DJE9R|1.0|It was a gift. Someone else asked for it. But when I hear it, it just reminds me how bubble gum pop simply gets recycled. Nasal singing, twangy, synthesized nonsense. Nothing that would- or should- ever be considered classic or timeless. Save your money or buy 6 packs of gum instead- the flavor will last longer.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|My son, who is four, loved this gift.  He loves to watch the series and because we don't have cable he would watch the episodes online with my husband every week.  He is sooooo excited that he can watch the these whenever he wants.

B002C6K7N0|3.0|I love Megadeth, but they've been a band that has rarely lived up to what they could be, in my opinion.  Rust in Peace, Countdown, and YOuthenasia are my personal favorites of mine.  I\\"ve always thought they had a great sound, except for Cryptic Writtings, and Risk, but very few of their albums grabbed me.  That's not to say they didn't have their good songs.  Even Risk had one or two songs I liked, but most of their albums as a whole just didnt' do it for me.  Musically this might be Dave's best album.  There's decent variety in tempo changes.  The sound is great.  Probably my favorite sound of a Megadeth album.  The vocals are good, but unfortunately the songs just don't grab me.  They're ok.  There's not a bad song, although Headcrusher comes close.  Thankfully, unlike hero and UA, we get no more remakes of past Megadeth songs.  Those should be reserved for b-sides.  This Day We Fight - 7/10 - Very fast song.  Great music, guitars drums, everything.  The only thing keeping this one from being a stand out, for me, is the lack of a hook.  Still the music more than makes this song a good one to listen to.  44 Minutes - 9/10 - Very Countdown.  Somewhat mid-tempo song.  Great chorus.  Great bass line.  1,320' - 6/10 - Faster than the last song.  Good riffs, but the song lacks something.  Great bridge, and solo.  Bite The Hand - 5/10 - Faster song.  The vocals are pretty good on this one, and there's more of an attempt at adding a hook to the chorus.  The only thing that bugs me are the lyrics.  Dave has done much better, in fact lyrically htis is one of his weakest songs.  \\"When it's dog eat dog you are what you eat\\"?  Seriously?  I could write better lyrics than that.  Still the music is good.  Bodies - 7/10 - Mid-tempo song.  It's ok, but it sounds too much like 44 Minutes.  It does speed up a bit, into a good solo at the end.  Endgame - 8/10 - The intro reminds me of a bad sci fi movie.  The song starts out slow, but heavy, and gradually picks up speed.  It ends upbeing a pretty fast song after the first chorus.  I like the chorus, especially when the song picks up speed.  For me this song could've been a brutally fast song straight through, and I would've been happy.  Actually I'd have given it a perfect 10 if it had been.  The Hardest Part of Letting Go. - 7/10 - Acoustic intro, with strings in the background.  Very atmospheric, and the most experamental song on the album.  The song picks up speed midway through, and I love the strings in the background during the heavier part of this song.  Headcrusher - 4/10 - Every point I give this song is based on the music.  Very fast paced song.  I love the drums, and love the guitars.  The vocals are only ok, and the chorus is awful.  Still I'll listen to it.  How The Story Ends - 8/10 - This one's an up-tempo song, slow in comparison to some others, but fast enough.  Great chorus, although it lacks the great riffs the rest of the songs on here have.  Still I like it.  I like the acoustic bit in the bridge.  The solo's good too.  The Right To Go Insane - 8/10 - Slower paced than most of the album, solid riffs in the verses.  Dave's vocals are as are very fitting for the lyrics in this song.  Solid chorus.  This is a fine closing song for the album.  Still this is another gradual step in the right direction for Dave and co.  It's a decent album, just could've been better with a hook or two throun in there.  I can't wait for the next album, and if you're a Megadeth fan definately check this one out.
0307269760|5.0|I've given the collection 5 stars because the stories are still masterful:  never afraid to explore what they are, unafraid of time, bold, brilliant, etc.  However, I do not think this is her best at all.  Someone else brought up \\"Hateship...\\"  and I agree--that collection was far better, as were some earlier ones.  Why?  How to quantify?  I think these stories sometimes suffer from not enough complexity, or an easy way out, a simpler narrative line, not as much depth.  Exceptions, in my opinion, were Child's Play (I think the best story in the collection), Deep Holes (also very well done)and the first story (I'm forgetting the title, the one about the woman with the murdered children--although I have to say that this couple has been done before, and better:  the story she wrote some time ago, opening with a woman vandalizing a house with her timid boyfriend, and then peeling back the layers and discovering that as a child she'd been molested by the father, who skins animals; hope you know which one I mean.  That story was much more complex, dared more, and covered more, than the opening story in this collection, and yet the characters of both abusive men as well as the marriage are very similar.)  Still those three stories were quite good.  THe other ones, in my opinion, are just less complex and dare much less than her earlier stories.  Her final story, I thought, was terrible.  I really disliked it.   I mean, she did dare by writing about a Russian couple from a century ago in Europe--but, having Russian ancestry myself and remembering my own grandmother, I felt this one was very off, not real at all.  The characters were almost caricatures, derivative, and the story was really slow and not very deep.  So that last story sort of ruined the collection for me as usually the big, long story is her masterwork, as it has been in several other of her collections.    However, she is Munro, and her stuff is still extremely well done and highly worth reading.   Others maydisagree with me about their favorite stories, and that's great. To those who complain about 'depressing,' I have no response.  Some things are depressing, that's life.  To ignore a story because it's unpleasant is to ignore life and art.   Watch Disney then.
