B004BTHYUU|5|Good tools
B00BJ5W0GC|5|Awesome gloves, run a little small but very comfy. Great grip and  flexibility.
B00Q3SF4LS|5|I work out a lot and sweat a lot. This leads to me sweating on my seat belt and leaving salt residue. These keep that from happening and look cool. V ery comfortable and adjusting when getting in and out is not a deal at all. The covers slide allowin the seat belt to contract when needed and nothing is needed to be done or adjusted when you take off your seatbelt. Good construction. Nice buy to keep your car nice.
B005VHN8JC|5|good
B003CK75LC|5|Its been over 30yrs since I needed to patch a tire.  It was like riding a bike, you never forget.  Easy application, liquid cement was quick drying.  Took about 2 minutes for everything to dry and I placed the tube back in the tire.  Still held air the next day.
B000AM4ZOU|4|just as ordered fits fine thank you
B0051UR9VW|4|Not so much WeatherTec but does the job. Surface is a bit slippery. I purchased this for my 2010 Toyota Higlander. When using my third row seats I have to leave this at home, does not fit in the space behind the third row seats and I didnt wanna fold it for fear of of being damage.
B000FGESN4|1|Specifications state that this item is &#34;Product Dimensions 4.9 x 2.9 x 0.9 inches&#34; and this is not accurate. These are the dimensions of the packaging. The actual level is approx 1&#34; in diameter. This makes this item very hard to see from any distance. I am using this for a RV and there is no way to see it from the controls so there is a lot of back and forth to get the coach level.
B008IK7GOC|5|Good product
B001GJ9JPQ|5|Very good water nozzle. feels sturdy to the touch and built to be very durable. Only down side is that the water pressure in my building is not to strong for this type of nozzle. be careful if you drop it though, as the nozzle can open easily and start spraying water all over.
B00HVHMCXI|4|Good replacement,for broken remote, at a good price.
B00TYZLEJ8|5|Fits well as described, not the easiest to roll up in the car but does exactly as described and saves the interior from sun and heat.
B0045XRK06|5|I like these little goose neck lights however i wish the gooseneck was a little stronger.
B00JXW0S5S|5|Goes on nice and easy with a little heat. Looks great, I did my fog lights and was so pleased with how it turned out I decided to order more to do my headlights
B00NJRGD70|5|Perfect!
B0018F1DNE|5|I've been seeing these slipons for quite some time and decided to buy them. After installing them I had to go to the local harley stealer and buy new muffler clamps. ( at 16 bucks a set my advice is go ahead and have them before you start) These freakin things are LOUD ( which is nice)  so it sounds like a harley now and I'm happy with the deep rumble and the awesome growl when you open it up. Installation is easy and will take about 45 minutes. Another 15 on the fuelpak and your riding thanks to the fuelpak site which has the program for these &#34;mufflers&#34; Performance isn't greatly improved and there is a slight loss of low end torque but when you hear the rumble all is forgiven. Well worth the money.
B00KH3W7U6|5|i originally had hot bodies flush mounts, but after getting this tst industries halo i clearly knew that HOT BODIES was NOT flush mount, but i gotta hand it to bart here, this product is a true flush mount and it looks amazing! very happy with this product.
B00080QHMM|5|Very Accutate
B00SBZRR8O|1|UPDATED 9/28 (Originally purchased on 8/11, only 48 days):  Okay, so I do not know what happened within the last 2-3 days but today ended in CATASTROPHIC failure.  I returned home from my commute and grabbed my gas can with the TRFA01 pump installed and went to fill up my tank.  Turned the pump on and.....nothing.  I initially thought it was the batteries but after a fresh set, realised something else was wrong.  While trying to problem solve the issue, I found out that while the pump nozzle was out of my tank, the pump would work filling the hose with fuel.  As I turned the nozzle back down into my tank, the pump would shut off.  Also while I was attempting this, the sensor at the end of the nozzle fell out and just dangled there...UGH!  So, with no choice, I waited for the gas to leave the line and attempted to insert the sensor back in...this is when I knew it was a design flaw.  As I went to grab the sensor (with 2 fingers I mind you) it was like melted plastic and deformed within my fingers... Now, I don't know what to do.  Amazon will not let me return it due to the 30 day period and there is no warranty info on TeraPUMP site. I will attempt to contact via email and will report my following experience.  Original review:  &#34;Pump is great but could use a 2.0 version.  I really debated on whether or not this product was worth the high price tag, but after using it for the first time yesterday, I am happy with my purchase.  I like the fact that unlike the other TERAPUMPS, this one stays attached to the gas can.  This is HUGE for me as I use this every 2 days to fill my motorcycle during the week; saves time and backache from the new EPA cans which do not have a second vent to allow air into the gas can for faster movement of fuel.  Anyway, my only gripe is that the on/off is on the can instead of on the nozzle end.  The company already designed the pump to have a wire through the tubing, why not add an additional wire to have the on/off at the nozzle end?  Other than that, the flow rate of 2.5gal per min is correct as my tank is exactly that when I need to fill her back up; it takes me about 45 sec to a minute to fill.  The auto shut-off is a great feature however, you will need to understand how the sensor works and make sure that the end of the nozzle does not move during filling.  I recommend using the pump a few times just to get the &#34;feel&#34; of when the pump will shut-off and the amount of residual fuel in the hose that will flow into where ever you are pumping (residual over fill after pump stops).  IF you use you gas can multiple times a week, I suggest this due to not having to remove the original spout multiple times.  If you want to use this for filling up your lawn mower every other week, I would opt out for the cheaper version that does not stay attached to the gas can.  Hope this helps and thanks for reading.&#34;
B00008RW9U|5|Love this! Haven't washed my car in a month and half and it looks like it came straight from the detailer. No scratches here on my black car.
B0041TJP3Y|1|Looks fine, installs in the factory location.  The grinding noise it makes when it turns on is pretty awful.  Spend the extra money on the oem replacement.
B009KYYUJE|1|It exploded when it was being inflated so my granddaughter is still without her bike.
B000L9AD2K|4|This seems to be a good (carry in your car with you) air pump. It is sold by Pep Boys. They actually sell it in my local store but for $11 more, so this is also a good price here on Amazon. I like the screw on adapter on the end of the hose. It makes for an easier and better connection to the tire valve. It is definitely better than those $10-$15 air tire pumps. I gave it 4 stars because there are probably better more expensive models. But, for the average individual, this will be good.
B0007A2AH4|5|I put this on my 2003 S10 Crew today and WOW!!! It wont break your neck but you hear and feel the response.  Sounds like a 4 barrel opening up when you get on it.  Great for low RPM response..<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
B00UM9X2HW|3|nice gauge easy to install,however when you step on it and boost to 5psi it makes a annoying buzzing noise. my car is supposed to push 8psi don't know if gauge is inaccurate or my car just not doing what it should
B004DRPG8M|5|They're great, made a huge difference
B00BITIEOG|5|PERFECT! Besides the fact that this price was the best online, it arrive very quickly and well packed. After finding a 'how to' video on Youtube, I was able to install this ignition lock cylinder with my dad (For the 1995 Corolla, you have to remove only part of the steering column/dash component) in about 15 minutes. The part is new and not used or rebuilt and even though it is not the original steel color, I like the black just as well. The best thing is the TWO keys that comes with it. They are a must.
B0057V3ZEA|5|Fit perfectly and look awesome on my Honda Shadow. Very low-profile. Only complaint is that you can't make adjustments to them without using a tool. Once you have them set, you can't adjust them on the fly.
B00GPUIZ42|5|Fantastic
B002008O7O|5|Works great!
B000C02DVW|5|Worked for me, did not come with the banjo bolt gaskets.  Carter was on the box, can't remember if the pump itself said Carter, I thought it did?
B002GYQXZO|3|Sure worked a treat just reused the internal part and all good.
B00IAIPAHM|4|Works great easy to use
B00IK2MNZK|5|The part arrived before it was expected. It didn't look exactly the same as the one I was replacing.But I installed it and the unit fired up up on the first attempt. It is running like new. Couldn't be more pleased.
B006DS4J6Y|5|pain in the butt to put on ,once its on its the best for towing cars
B0043M68E8|5|Can never go wrong with dynojet products! Thanks
B001GJ3DZS|5|works as advertised
B00JHK81X2|5|This kit has everything I think I would need in a car emergency.  I'm going to add extra emergency blankets because I'm prepper OCD like that.<br /><br />I comes in a great carry case for storage in my trunk AND it has a cool &#34;I am the Stig&#34; window cling which will be the envy of all who see it!<br /><br />I think this was the best thing I got on Prime Day!
B007J7E4K4|5|HUSBAND LOVE THE MATS
B007EEXIXG|5|Used this to wrap the chrome trim on my sonic. The paint matches exactly to this which makes it look really good, cant even tell what is wrapped.
B000EH0ORI|5|This works so well I had to get one for my friend and he loves it! this will emty a 5 gallon feul can in less than 5 minutes the new feul cans they have now takes 20 minutes to emty by pouring with the spouts!
B00ZOKJVAG|5|I love the way the sun shades look. And i recieved my package as expected. Thank you
B0002SRCKG|5|Fantastic little sidekick, made pulling all the gears and doing maintenance on the axles a breeze.  the handle can slide off though.
B00ACXO8ZI|5|Love it. Old school style!
B00EL1K9CS|5|Better than the picture shows
B00LFPVZMQ|2|They rusted really fast I guess you get what you pay for.
B004HMBK5G|5|These clips are a must for everyone.  Just be sure that this is the model you order as there is another that is 2-part and does not stay together. Delivery and price were great.
B000C1LLPA|4|I was replacing the brakes on my FJ cruiser and decided to go with these pad. I was going to order the ebc pads to match the rotors I was installing, but read reviews that they put out too much dust. So I decide to go with the Akebono's.<br /><br />They were a breeze to install, and work great. Stopping power is much better than with oem pads. Have not had them on long enough to attest to wear.  The only thing I am not happy about is they do put out quite a bit of dust.
B008NMWQ6I|5|Installation was a breeze... even the one part that I read about that could be a problem, was easy with a helper.  The little tabbed nuts that go inside the frame were easy to align and get in with help from my son and a flashlight...maybe took a total of 1.5 - 2.0 hours.  I chose to combine the two sides into one line and used the Air Lift 21838 Union Tee... worked perfectly.  I air it up to 50 lbs to tow my boat and it levels the truck nicely, rides better overall, better control and keeps my headlight pointed where they should be.  With no load, I deflate down to 5 lbs and it's back to factory feeling and ride.
B001GN6YTG|5|These were awesome and fairly cheap.  Bought a few and used them all over.
B002MD5EL8|5|great package and product
B0002SR4AO|5|anything from Lisle has always been been a good product
B00VUWC38O|1|Works like a used part, not a new one. You lost my business.
B0015S0JB6|1|These rotors are junk. My originals lasted 118,000 miles. These warped in 16,000.  2008 Toyota Avalon, family sedan. Gently driven. Beware of American companies that source their parts from China and use their American name to make you think you are buying American quality. If it does not specifically say &#34;made in USA&#34;, you can bet it's from China and it's junk.
B00R6GU5WY|3|I ended up returning this, but I still gave it 3 stars. The quality seemed very heavy duty and we'll made with sturdy material. The problem was the part that locks onto the contour of your steering wheel so the arm could project out over the dash, ISN'T contoured. It wouldn't clamp onto the steering wheel properly. I tried it on a 96 accord, 98 subaru, and a 2013 subaru...it didn't fit the steering wheel on any of those vehicles.
B0096BZH5C|5|Simple good, genuine VW.
B0012TUFQM|5|Perfect for out ATV- nice size.
B00OM5XTNY|5|Good fit on my 2015 SRT. Easy to get to the release as well.  It does drag pretty easy though...so just be cautious of that...but if you own this car you already plan for that.
B006S61V80|5|WORKED PERFECT
B001GN1LQ2|5|It's a fuse. It works when I connected it.
B0000AZ89Y|3|Wish it was bit stronger
B004I0DTOC|5|It fits perfectly
B00J62UHWO|5|Just received today, took about 10 min to install. Great product, just as advertised. I have nothing but good things to say about quality, they are worth the money.
B00CFHKU4W|5|Don't expect what's in the generic picture. It is a complete kit and easy install. Shipping was a bit slow from my seller but don't think it was their fault.
B00Z89I2OY|5|Just ordered these and they took all but 2 minutes to install and look great on my 2015 JKU.  I put my full body weight on each and they don't budge!
B0006305MY|5|These fit perfect. They are exactly as described by seller. Very happy with these.
B00U8DH142|5|High quality,
B000HEBR3I|5|Works great makes refueling a breeze.
B008G2ZK2W|5|excellent for OEM replacement
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very  good product nice and cheap! Does the job
B00QKT5AI2|5|easy, nice stick to window...
B00TI616ZK|5|ideal
B00UULX2ZE|3|work good but a lot of money for what you get
B00L2NF1XA|5|Heavy duty, fit perfectly in my 2002 acura rl. I like the ridges and especially the nonslip feature. The color was a perfect fit for my shoreline mist metallic. Price is well worth it to improve the look of your car and protect your floors.
B0012FD5J0|4|Very quick to arrive and just want I want
B00HJ6TZ54|5|Product works well to remove moisture.
B00DPVCQ5S|5|Almost a dead ringer for OEM.
B0042J9RJU|5|Works perfectly.  Seller awsome.
B00RN1ZXRO|5|I installed these on some customer fenders I made of my tractor. They look good, perform good, and have good brightness. They appear to be sealed well against the elements.
B00B4EAV8M|5|Yes! I needed to show the front end of my car and with the original plate being too big just didn't help, this half plate made so much of a difference plus looks pretty awesome! Very happy with this purchase !! If you want your Mustang to show off the front just get this plate!!
B00Q5CT9VI|5|Seem like good locks. Wish they could have been keyed like.
B00317DXXA|3|Pretty
B000RTAYE6|4|I use this code reader a lot. Best thing I have purchased. Saves money when you fix it yourself
B00COYNWOQ|4|I put my keys on it and I love it. It's just itchy if you wear it
B0051D3MP6|4|This works just fine to keep the battery charged on my 30 year old Porsche that gets driven about twice a month.  The several different connection elements is a great part of the price
B004K6HZFS|5|This item came very fast bolted it on fired right up great carburetor.
B006L93EDY|5|Looks great!
B000C44DKC|4|back to squealing tires!
B003ULYGZQ|5|No issues till today, fits well
B00N52TU56|2|too small for my fat head
B0006HPA0C|5|Good quality, good improvement, looks fantastic.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.  (2003 chevy S10 crewcab)
B003BHR0MK|5|Does fit 2015 F250.
B002PR8ZXK|5|nice
B0018MVK9O|5|Fits perfect, easy to install. Just like original handle, so that being said, I don't know how durable, but they do feel just like stock
B000FPXV5G|3|Will only fit pop cans
B000W7F2GI|4|Good price..
B00J632K0U|5|Easy to install.  Looks great. Dont foeget to wax after installing.
B00ML7DIJA|5|Lights are crazy bright! I love the projector, makes a huge difference in the light pattern! Would highly recommend to someone else.
B00BXMRP4I|1|The pump arrived on time ,it appeared to be good condition.I hooked it up to a small chamber and ran it . It had a good vacuum on the gauge , ran for about 30 min.seemed to work okay.But I found a puddle of oil under the pump,it was down about 1/4 in.site glass. I looked for info. on who to call or what to do if defective nothing! Not sure what to do, can't give it a very good rating.
B00R8LARUC|5|Fit perfectly. My leak seems to be gone.
B000K0045G|5|Awesome, exact quality as original and fit was precisely the same!!
B00MRHKHDY|5|Good
B00VDQNELW|5|Best $25 or so you can spend on your jeep. Keeps you from melting your arm skin off and adds a little cushion.
B00075XCCG|5|This thing is a piece of ART! Amazing quality fit and finish was perfect. Bolted right up, had it installed by myself in 15 minutes. I will never ever buy any other brand receiver than a Curt. period.
B0044FQSY4|5|worked perfectly. Installed in about 6 minutes
B003NBFKDK|3|Too much expense to make it one piece?
B00DUHQA3Q|3|Leaves quite a lot of lint, even after washing. I wouldn't recommend them for using on interior of windows, but they are sufficient for exterior use. Not a show car quality product!
B006B20WOK|5|We just love it!!  Big Rich attached to our Polaris Ranger with Velcro.  It keeps our drinks cold for a couple hours of driving.  Easy to get into each side with the full zipper which starts in the middle.  It moves with the vehicle so there is no fizzing over when you open a can.  Our friend called it a quiver as it looks like one so that's our name for it.  We got him one for his birthday and they attached it to their Kawasaki Mule.
B004YD1F0I|5|This finally has enabled me to remove the seat belt from rubbing on my neck! Those cover thingies offered some relief - but they'd foul up the seat belts ability to self retract when not in use - and the problem of having something on my neck remained. These clips make it possible to change the angle of the shoulder belt. Much more comfortable.
B006DA34VI|4|Meh, never have to buy another. Nowhere near the &#34;punch&#34; gains like from when I put K&N individual pods on a Yamaha XJ1100J years ago. Maybe a little bitty dab better on performance. No improvement on mileage. It'll do.
B0009IQXG8|5|Good Product. Have used this for over a year now. Use this on the leather seats in my car and boat. Can defiantly see a difference. Is like lotion for the leather. Seems to help from it drying out and cracking. Am very pleased with the results I have seen.
B003JXU0JQ|1|It was easy to install for my first time. The Shock sensor only works half the time if I'm lucky. After 5 bumps shock sensor doesn't work any more... you can get it going again later sometimes.  Also, every time I arm the system I get the notification beep and then it goes off.. every time. Super annoying.  It does work in a half azz way.. however,  you get what you pay for.
B00ELASYIA|5|I put these in my son's car.  I hope he never has need of them, but I feel better that he has cables if he ever needs them.
B004O1S7F6|5|Fits just as expected.
B008CLLLKC|5|Awsome product, quick delivery.
B00IMUES4O|5|just as listed
B00JL1QC3S|5|Fits Perfectly in my 2016 Fusion Titanium. Amazon says it wont fit, but they need to update their product info. These are the mats that should have come from the factory. The only thing I don't like is the 3D logo. I would be nice if they said Fusion or didn't put any logo there. Other than that I'm happy!
B00LZLR6XW|1|Tore after one week of use. Sent back and given a full refund.
B000F5LJ7S|5|Great tool
B00BNX79RA|5|good
B00N8NBJPG|3|Put these on my 2011 328i., they look cool however, tonight after checking them, one logo has vanished, so I now have 3 cool caps and one chrome one the is very uncool, great looking for the first 700 miles after I installed them!  Don't loose the Allen Wrench or you will be in trouble if you need air!  Like them but disappointed with how fast a logo cap popped off!  Cheap enough to replace but doubt I will!  Will look for something a little better made perhaps....
B00WV7N12Y|5|Excellent product..Looks great..have bought these before as gifts to friends..<br /><br />They look good and last for years..
B001TXWNLQ|1|WIll not work with many devices.  This item is much smaller then the picture implies.  It will not work with American made GPS systems.  It will not work with other type of DC devices such as inflating compressors.  The adapter too shallow for DC Auto plugs to fit in and stay in.  This item is NOT save because the DC auto plug will pop out or the contact points are above the upper edge of the adapter.  The device puts is labeled as putting out 500mAh, however it does not come close to that, which means this adapter could damage your electrical devices by not providing proper electrical power.  The low price of the item makes it a &#34;throw away after disappointment&#34; device, because the return shipping cost is more then the price of the item.  I would suggest that you not waste your money on this &#34;Generic Unerversal AC to DC Car Cigarette adeptor. .Hope that helps.
B0002TDUW4|5|Great product!
B000C9QV8O|3|Works well. This would be a better product if the wires were colored like the original plug was.
B002RV0JR4|4|2 months and looks great so far - will see after a long New England winter if it still shines
B003XGYDE2|5|Great tool at a very good price delivered on time. What more could you ask for?
B001DZFZPG|5|GREAT PRODUCT!<br />My none of cars have a spare, this little kit has saved my butt several times!<br />Owned this device for over 3 years now, plenty durable.<br />PS: Better than the stock version that came with my BMW too
B00SG7XMCC|5|Looks great on the tinted rear windows of my truck! Stout decal that transferred flawlessly onto the glass.
B00HQSU4DW|5|Good product
B00W8QO5ZU|4|Took a long time receive the lights, they didn't ship until the day I was suppose to receive them. When I got them the mounting bracket for the ballista that was shown on the video was not included. However, once I installed these in my Equinox, WOW, is all I could say. I forgot about the few little things that would have given this a poorer rating. The lights just made it look like daylight outside. I couldn't believe the difference.  The first pic is bright and the second is dim. Wish I would have taken pics with the halogen bulbs,
B002UC144M|4|This looks good in my trailer, works very good like it should, but it did not come with the contacts needed to connect the wiring. Luckily we found some contacts and wired it up, works like a charm, thanks!
B00BITIE2I|5|Ok
B0049MX76O|5|This hitch was a super-simple 1/2 hour installation. Having done two--on another Rendezvous and my little Ford--the process was very familiar. The only drudgery was drilling four holes through the rear metal of the truck to accommodate the smaller bolts. NOTE: Thank goodness I saved the threading wire from my previous installs to pass the main bolts through the holes of the chassis beams; I don't know if it's possible to do without that and it wasn't included in my kit. Otherwise, it was a very valuable addition. I've used it to mount my 4-bike rack and we're looking for a small trailer for weekending. I have no doubt this hitch will endure all its expected tasks!
B009XA8IP2|1|did not fit on my 95 saturn clutch pedal
B00HJ1592C|3|i guess it is as shown however in reality it looks rather tacky ...looks beeter in pictures ..
B00WSCKUW6|5|Works great!
B00L81BPX6|5|works great!
B000CMDE1S|5|Looks great and fits well...
B003VSO4BY|5|Worked great
B000CCMMSE|5|good for final stage before paint! this primer holdout pretty well no dieback yet!  this is not a high-build primer so it wont cover deep scratches!
B005JU5X6M|2|Was only a few weeks before they started leaving streaks.  After reading the reviews, I am very disappointed in these.
B009Z1M8W8|1|One broke as soon as I got them out of the box
B00U5ICZPA|1|Well its fine but the wrong one I wanted black an silver but got a all black one now I got 2 different mirrors but it fit an I can see now so
B00TORH40E|5|If you detail your own vehicle; these microfiber towels are a must have!  Super soft. Work great on exterior or interior!
B004GC44AK|5|GREAT
B001F02NCW|5|Awesome looking cover!!  Good quality and color. Shipping was extremely timely as well. Please discontinue this cover as I don't want anyone else to have it!!  Have received several &#34;thumbs up&#34; on the road
B009DJSP4C|4|I've only replaced the 2 that were bad.  Both are working very well.  Get a set for the price of a single coil.
B00NVBW5EY|5|Awesome product.  I was amazed at how perfectly they fit.  And they do the job so well.  Within an hour of inserting the catchall, I had dropped something down there and I just reached down and picked it up.  Amazing idea.  I have a 2010 Mazda 3.
B00FP0LHA2|2|I bought 2 of these and they worked great for about 6-8 months, but in the past 2 weeks I've had to throw both out. One wouldn't stay plugged in (electrically, not physically), and the cord ripped on the other and stopped charging. Terrible! These should last much longer.
B00UZVC2NW|5|The perfect addition to any Potterhead's laptop! Easy to apply and looks great.
B000AMLWH8|5|I've used the Armor All and Turtle Wax interior sprays and they've always left a certain aroma that I disliked.  And when you're confined in a car even with the windows down, the smell the builds up is quickly.  They also tend to leave this greasy weird film on my hand that I can't get rid of unless I wash my hands with soap.  Using Meguiar's, the smell is much less harsh and not so much a kick in the nose anymore.  It also doesn't leave a residue as previously mentioned.<br /><br />It wipes and leaves a clean look very easily with some microfiber cloths.
B0057YJMEY|4|i thought it was black. had to reorder. my mistake i will use it on a different project
B005KOZ25Y|4|MS310 is simple to use and is a good tool to find out why the &#34;check engine light&#34; is on before you take it to a shop. It boots up as soon as you plug it into the ODBII connector on the car (whether engine is started or not, but you have to put the key in &#34;On&#34; or &#34;Start&#34; position for MS310 to read the diagnostic fault codes). I used it to read the diagnostic trouble codes for the &#34;check engine light&#34; from a 1998 Toyota Corolla,  a 2001 VW Passat, and a 2002 Honda Odyssey. After copying down the diagnostic trouble codes (all related to emission control), I erased them to turn off the &#34;check engine light&#34;. All diagnostic trouble codes displayed on MS310 were erased together; you cannot erase one at a time. Any fault code not displayed on MS310 cannot be erased. The 2001 VW Passat had other warning lights for the brake system, but MS310 does not check them and cannot erase them. BTW, erasing the diagnostic fault codes will reset everything and then restart the diagnostic test cycle; some or all of the diagnostic fault codes will soon return if the underlying problem is still there. The length of the cable that came with MS310 is adequate for the 1998 Toyota Corolla and 2002 Honda Odyssey, because the ODBII connector on these cars is close to the driver seat, and you can put MS310 on your lap. The cable is stretched a little to reach the ODBII connector on 2001 VW Passat because its ODBII connector is farther away from the front seat. Overall, I find MS310 a useful tool for finding out what may be wrong with the emission control system before you take the car to a shop.
B001FAGKDU|5|EXCELLENT!! I had bought other seat covers that fit loosely. This are a little tough to get on but the fit tight. No sagging. Love them. Would recommend them to anyone and I would buy again.
B00449GGHO|5|My husband installed them on his 2000 Porsche 996.  They fit perfectly and had a nice finish that didn't require cleaning before installation.<br />Great German made rotor for the money!
B00GORDBLI|5|Perfect!!!
B003MB4NUC|4|Does the job at the right price.
B000EQB752|5|I've used this for about a year now, and since changing the filter the airflow in my car has increased tremendously. I'm starting to think about changing it again, and I will probably just buy this filter again if I check and it's dirty enough.
B0096U253U|5|Works great...not as bright white as I wanted, but works good.
B008YEP6G2|5|Best oil I have tried yet - shifts are smoother, the bike loves this stuff
B002E3Z3L2|5|Perfect fit for 2009 Ford Flex.  Includes radiator fan, AC compressor fan, and control unit.  It took exactly 28 minutes to swap out the entire assembly and the instructions are available on the Ford Flex owners forum.  Dealer quote including parts and labor was over $1300.  Save the money and do it yourself. It's an easy job and this part worked perfectly.
B00D2QKZUE|5|Works like magic. Let it sit for hours...concrete may still appear stained after removing but will improve. I applied a little Purple Power after picking up the chips and next day ...nothing...could never tell there was a half qt spill the day before.
B000BYGD2O|5|Good replacement, fits perfect in 2003 Chevy S10 Crew with 4.3 v6<br /><br />Definitely recommend
B00RK27ZRM|5|just as listed
B00CHDNYG0|4|Fits perfectly.  Better than original.
B007PAHHWM|5|Nice product!
B0002SR8AK|5|Easy to use... does at intended!
B003L31RK0|5|BEST OIL FILTER YOU CAN BUY WILL GO 15,000 MILE BEFORE YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT AND THE OIL WILL BE CLEAN ALL THAT TIME.
B000GZV2ZG|5|Great oil, for a great price.
B008VM0TLO|5|Excellent and exactly what we needed
B005N77198|1|Everyone is right about the sizing! Get 2-3 sizes up! ! Terrible.
B001A0J2JO|4|Unit fit my 2000 Durango very well and is a big help, but was unsuitable for a track car due to high-speed vibration (not a problem with Durango and greatly reduced by addition of rubber bands on outside of expanding mounting clips).
B0087WS4MO|3|it is not the usual metal material but plastic. seems strong but it is more flexible and susceptible to vibration
B004XMBXRU|5|This item perfectly fit my 2005 F-150.  Installation was very quick thanks to photos showing step-by-step directions that I downloaded.  Less than a half hour to remove/replace.
B000ALDQDC|5|Excellent worked well
B000JIGF4S|5|Fits perfectly
B000CNAV1I|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B00D8E0SRA|5|Fast shipping! Awesome product, theses are boss wiring for big boy systems! I'm powering 4 15 L7s, 2 mech man alternators big four and 2 SSL 5k.1 amps. This is a most product! Using as a inline fuse for my alternator & another as a inline for my batt wire going to the rear & 2 on each Amp
B00FBKWBIS|5|The product is definitely worth more than what they sell them for. Their customer service is phenomenal. Highly recommend this seller.
B005C973JU|2|Don't know how they got it to stand on its own in the picture
B00LNOK4E4|3|The products are as described but it produces error with 2013 Cooper S Countryman as fog light replacements
B00GSAUHB8|5|Wonderful product!I It  helps keep the heat down!!
B00BLAG3D6|1|Not happy  they don't stay in place an don't fit the window properly
B00FEAJK2A|4|worked well, great price, changed one month ago
B00LHNYO9M|5|Fits perfect, does the job well and adds that nice chroome look
B000BUU5XQ|3|To small for our plates
B00I5054M6|5|Easy install
B00A7MKZFQ|4|Fits perfect! But arrived with one broken mount. I used it anyways because I needed it the next day. My coolant reads about 5% lower now. Impressed!
B00SR03LI8|5|Nice auto part and reasonable .
B00IGZQGAY|1|These were purchased for a 2012 Subaru Impreza WRX. The only mat that fit the car was the front passenger side. Extremely dissatisfied with this product's fit. Otherwise they seemed thick and durable.
B00DKDFVVC|5|It done a good job of doing what it was sold for, I would purchase it again
B007D082YG|5|Very good and worth the money.
B009DJQY7M|5|Just what I needed
B008W1NYPC|4|Well made product.  Works as it should
B0016C3STQ|5|no reason to spend more
B006DB0UVY|3|regulator is made well but wouldn`t spread far enough to mount both rails on a 2008 f150 but it works
B000BGJWA2|5|Replaced two of these on a 20 year old pop up i bought used. Colorado sun had turned the old ones yellow and they were cracking. Fit wasn't perfect but very close, just clicked it a little bit.
B009P7694K|5|Works great ( Neatsfoot) away's did!
B00AO7BHME|5|Excellent product; reasonable price.  Fast shipping, actually received product before projected delivery date.
B00Y13C866|5|Great kit would buy again if needed.... But it's not.
B0010E3JUI|5|Got the job done for a 2005 Honda CRV SE. Packages comes with 2, which you'll need as the vehicle takes 2. Very satisfying pulling out the nasty older filters and replacing them with brand new ones.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Great mirrors.  Took 2 weeks to get here.
B00L1EKGBM|5|Very good product.
B00SOPDDAC|5|I love it!! Arrived on time! Easy to put on! 5 stars!
B001DIECCK|5|Well built kit. I hope I rarely have to use it. Never realized you didn't need to goop rubber cement on if you bought good quality plugs. Rock solid with spare insertion tool.
B00MBA9K1M|1|It is the worst  product I have ever received. Only one mud flap  said that it was for the R. Fr. The other 3  had nothing. No paperwork in the box, no explanation how to install, not enough screw holes.
B003K2Y4ES|5|Ok
B0009JB7GI|4|I have used this product for six months now.  It meets my expectations.
B00LCBGQEU|5|These work great.
B00Y5KD86Y|5|These fit perfectly!!!!! Now I can drive my 2000 Acura Integra in confidence.  I was able to tighten them down to spec. I will be checking out more of their products. The shipping was also quicker than expected. As of now, I am 100% satisfied....
B001TI1F5Q|5|Leaves a matte finish to the surfaces which I prefer over shiny armor all type products. Where this product really shined was on plastic trim. This restored my air conditioning knobs back to like new. Next is to try it on the exterior trim pieces that are sun faded.
B00M5FMA9W|4|This works better than the original fuel pump, but it does make more noise while it is running.  Maybe that is why it works better.
B00RH3AMIS|5|Excellent straps, heavier duty and stronger than most other brands
B000VWK4UI|1|I would not recommend this product.  I purchased this product for my Jeep Wrangler and it totally disintegrated within 4 months.  They claim it has a 4 layer protection.  They only warranty the product for 90 days, therefore that is a sign that the product is not durable.  I wouldn't waste my money.  When I contacted the manufacture, they were not helpful.
B00T6JENUY|5|94 sportster easy install sound great thanks
B000VB6606|3|Item arrived damaged and my mechanic installed another part.  Amazon swiftly credited my credit card with no problems.  Thank you.<br />The mechanic installed another Spectra 7-3557 and it has been working great since.
B002E56Z1C|5|Installed fan assembly in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 142,000 miles in July 2011.  Now in August 2015 vehicle has 190,000 miles.  Assembly has been functioning properly for four years and 45,000 miles.
B00S1OD4AU|1|Does not fit in the Tow eye of BMW F series cars.<br />Bolt is too small<br />Does not fit my 2013 F30.<br />F80 is built on literally the same frame/chassis, (exact same towing eye)  and is pictured in the product image.
B000765MHI|2|I rarely post bad reviews but I am going to regarding this fan. First, I reside in Florida and it gets very hot and humid during the summer. The issue I have had with this fan is that it blows purely hot air. It is very loud and it is not easy to clamp on to anything in a regular vehicle. I could see how this would be helpful in a mail truck or if you were driving a delivery vehicle. For a regular car, I would not recommend this.
B00LEX5MGY|4|The reflectors looked right but one of the didn't fit. I had to grind off a portion to fit. That's why I only gave 4 stars.
B009K6NSL8|5|Exact replacement from the original. Fits a little lose, but nothing that can be noticed unless you are super knitpicky like i was.
B003NI15E6|5|I received the pair of lift supports in a timely fashion as per delivery details from Amazon. The installation was simple and straight forward. The supports seem to have a stronger lift than the originals that came with the vehicle and the price was very fair. Thanks guys for an overall good experience.
B0050SFVO2|5|Great tool for every toolbox it there. Allows you to verify the spark. With today's advanced system or even older ones in automobiles this will help verify spark.
B002XL4X66|5|Thick material unlike the last ones I had. Fit perfect.
B000C7YQ9M|5|Fits my 2006 Mustang great!!
B009337O9A|5|Product is a great improvement. Better stopping distance with less brake fade.
B001CBTSZ4|5|Great quality.
B010WJ45U4|4|Just beautifull. But be aware ppl the are not like the photo. They are black tinted even the reverse light....
B00B7LXZ6M|5|Fits perfect. Looks like a newer car. I almost want to get it painted over again...
B00B5NPL7I|5|i love it...as expected
B002P8EMK4|5|It works
B004A6OEHK|5|Shipped fast. Good quality product at a fair price.
B004AFK1HS|1|this was the wrong gasket
B00GHT3SA2|1|This is an extremely poor quality piece. I have had two of them go out in less than a year. The plastic fitting gets very soft and then it just explodes. Fortunately for me, both times I was less than 5 miles from home and was not left stranded somewhere. I will definitely avoid these after this. OEM is more than double the price but I have one on order now.
B009TKMTXI|5|It was delivered in a timely fashion. The quality of the blower motor was excellent.
B005LDBU0U|5|Great my husband loved it. He road from Pa to Sturgis SD. 700miles a day, comfortable ride.
B00PZ6LC06|5|Thank you it fits perfectly on my big ole yellow truck
B00OK1O4WU|5|Just as pictured
B00KLEVR0M|5|These are just what I expected.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Good product and great service.
B00062ZOTO|5|Items arrived on time, these clamps come many sizes and are the finishing touch to any line or hose. Peter C.
B00NH55VKE|5|Love it
B000W1QZPG|5|I had bought these at w mart and several auto stores only to have leaks and trouble getting it to depress the stem. This one works perfect. Well worth the extra dollars.
B0016ZIZGE|4|nice product, prompt shipment.
B004UHG7Y2|5|Perfect for my scooter! So happy to not have to poor in the acid and all that mess. Thumbs way up!
B000RFBPQQ|5|Exactly what I wanted at a great price and with outstanding service!!
B00OZYHOE2|5|Quality protective glasses. A cleaning cloth. A case. Better than expected.
B00BQS6VDK|5|Why would auto store want to charge $35-$40 for such a simple item. I even afraid  to imagine how much VAG barbarians would want for it. THANK you for great product at the right price!
B0058SR63I|5|Perfect replacement for my G3 bass boat. Easy to install and operates smoothly
B00L3FL690|5|This tire charge kit is good I bought it for my car but it takes a while to fill up. Requires a cig lighter and it works just fine took about 4 to 5 min in about 20psi to 35 psi. Very quiet highly recommendz
B00Z6D3BZW|3|case is nice but tools are very cheaply made .Good for a youth starter.
B0012QIUTE|2|They did not fit for my application
B0009I1WYQ|3|I searched for over a week online for a good quality camper cover at a descent price. A cover is imperative where I live in Mass and my yard is filled with trees. I eventually went with this one because it seemed to be the mid grade so I thought it would work and last.<br />Installing was pretty quick and easy. The fabric seemed to be just right. The top is a bit thicker than the sides. There is zippers to still have access to front door which is great. The front and back have buckles so it can have a tighter fit if it happens to be a bit loose, as mine was.  And another great factor is there are straps at the bottom that you connect the back side to the front sides so the cover doesn't fly up.<br />My Major disappointment was that after just a year, there was already rips in a few spots, a couple of them are pretty large. My advice to others, be very, very gentle while pulling this over your camper, the lightest pull can send a rip down the whole side. Also, be careful not to fasten the buckles too tight or it'll cause too much tension and rip with any amount of wind, rain or snow.<br />Wish I didn't pay hundreds for only one season of use before it was already ripped up.
B00T47KYZ6|5|lovely and wondrous
B00EDQ2EM4|5|Great product for my 2007 Avalanche LTZ!
B002P8HIUU|5|A lot eaiser to install that I thought.
B00BFE1O6Y|5|This is a bit of superfluous gear that is pretty easily destroyed at battery change time. One of the clamps was held in place by a stuck bolt/nut, and my son-in-law totally roached the battery clamp getting it off. I got this part, as the old one was in really bad shape at this point, but then it wouldn't fit because the battery clamp is proprietary. I hate these guys. After struggling with what to do, I found that Marine style battery clamps fit, the distance from the post to the bolt is very short on the marine parts just like the proprietary Nissan part. And they are available everywhere, I got mine at the local auto parts store. I don't see any way to connect things without using the fusible link holder as power is taken from it through two large plugs on the side. If you just hook up the big cable to the positive post, you'll have power to the starter but not to the dash, the ignition, the lights... stuff like that.<br /><br />The battery clamp has to be way shorter than a standard battery clamp and has to have the single bolt type connection to connect to this dumb 'Fusible Link Holder'. Look on Amazon for the &#34;Shoreline Marine Battery Marine Terminal Kit&#34;; less than ten bones through Prime. It'll get the job done.
B00FBLDOP6|5|Ok
B0050EFHWW|3|Toilet (model 976) did not come with the mounting brackets.  I had to spend another $26 just for the brackets.  The details should have mentioned that.
B00SOKVK2A|2|clutch lever fit alright but brake lever not at all
B00F66HWBI|5|Fit like a glove
B002P8IBBU|5|A great product at an excellent price !
B00DGYQMD6|5|It's awesome, the size is great and the material is really good. I bought it some time ago and it doesn't have a single scratch
B00062YVKW|5|Fit my 5.3 LM7 perfectly
B00DSR46H0|5|I LOVE these car mats - they are very easy to clean and fun to look at! I do wish the 2 back mats were a little larger, but other than that they're great for spring, summer & fall. I do plan to purchase front heavy duty mats for winter time so these don't get ruined. They are also well constructed. I would absolutely buy these again.
B000C9DPN8|5|excellent product excellent price. great transaction.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Awesome Cargo bag. Great fit on top of my Cadillac SRX and easy to strap down.
B000GD5FMY|4|the glasses are nice for the price. i bought them for kids so if they get broken or lost im not out much. but thet like them and say they keep most wind and debries out of there eyes.
B003XNGLJU|2|I hit a deer on I-5 in Oregon. Totaled my Honda. Bought this whistle. Very little investment for a chance of safety. In one week after installing this device on my trucks grill, I passed 2 herd of deer grazing alongside the canyon road. In neither case did the deer even appear to notice me or react in anyway....&#34;JUST SAYING&#34;
B0050Z9XNU|5|Great HIDs and even better customer service. I had one of the bulbs go out and they sent me two new ones to ensure I didn't get a faulty set.<br />I used the lower wattage for the 3Ks to ensure I don't jeopardize my fog light housing and its worked beautifully.
B002Y39NFY|5|Thanks
B00BCRMAQC|1|They tore apart withen 6months
B00IG2IZDS|5|Is a deeper orange than the Prestone Dex-Cool. I feel like this product is superior. It has worked well for me.
B00NOL6RSG|5|When I bought it, I thought the frame was a bit loose. So I secured the screws tighter and they work great now. And the price at which I bought still amazes me. I would surely endorse it for free to my friends as I never had any issues with it till now.
B00M4K4KWI|3|Great quality material but doesn't cover the entire windshield in 2014 Silverado.still allows to much sun in.<br />But it does protect the dash board from UV Rays.
B004SSAER4|5|Fits my 1997 GMC Jimmy
B00VHW89Z8|5|great price and freshen up the look of our truck.
B001G65FWU|5|Fit my 2000 A4 B5 30 valve ATQ V6 and works as advertized. I assume Audi discovered hot spots in the coolant passages of this overbuilt/overdesigned V6 and determined that after-run coolant flow helped mitigate some issues. Whatever. It works.
B008V655KA|4|After a two week trip of sleeping on this mattress, i can confirm that it was worth the money. So far so good.
B000GV70SI|5|Have 1999 Springer softail and the seat fit without any problem. Seat feels good when riding and it feels like I'm siting higher. Had to buy 2 bolts from an HD dealership to bolt it to the frame (only 4 bucks)<br />Only problem was the bolt that keeps the backrest upright striped when I tightened it up. had to get another
B003WKHMBA|5|Love them
B000BPOI8O|5|Second plug I've ordered. 1 for my Craftsmen string trimmer and this 1 for my Sthil leaf blower. The NGK was giving me some trouble starting. I've always used the same &#34;canned &#34; premix gas. Since changing the plug, it's just prime, choke, pull, second choke position,  pull and go. Way faster. Lawn mower is next.
B000BUU5Z4|5|fit right where i wanted it to go and easy to install and use
B003B5HVIK|5|it does the job and you can't beat the price
B00A1973XW|5|Perfect fit. Works great
B00KRJ82FO|5|As described. Very nice replacement
B00CTVG85O|5|Ordered wrong type but they replaced with correct  ones.
B00IZF2FNC|5|What a great bargain. I ordered this for my 1994 Honda Civic VX with 292,000 miles. Bolted right on with minimal effort...all required components came in package. Wish I had done it back at the 100,000 mile mark. Hope to drive car until 500,000 miles. Car is an under-powered high gas mileage vehicle (50 mpg). I bought the stainless steel exhaust because I'm tired of wasting money on non-SS mufflers and connector pipes. The sound is throaty but mellow...NOT like an old baseball card mounted on a bike wheel to hit the spokes. Not sure why millennials think a high-pitched card-in-spoke sound means powerful. Different strokes for.....just buy it and you will not be disappointed.
B004X5QMY6|4|very satisfied with the radiator,no problems thankyou
B00CO8UKEW|5|Has been working for more than six months since I bought these... I have faith they will keep working.  Good deal (though mysterious why the rubber band bracelet is included as a bonus...)
B005N6YFYS|5|Product, service and shipping was exactly as expected. Thanks
B0087NB1IW|5|Good thus far. Do wish the volume was louder during higher speeds.
B0050Z9WL8|5|Fantastic product. Always a fun job to do HID kits and I can tell you they fit great in my 2006 Ford F250 diesel. Unbelievable product. I have referred several friends to this just because its so easy to use. Plug and play. And great value.
B00U26LMQS|1|Junk, broke the second I put it on<br />Spen the extra 5 bucks and get a good one
B00KTJ1PLU|5|Arrived in three (3) business days and with included instructions, it worked perfectly.<br />If you need a remote replacement, buy from this company.
B00RV2FIUM|5|This works great on my car!  I am from the UK originally, now living in the USA and love to show my pride of being born & raised in the UK.  The magnet was a nice size and clings well onto a car.  Has held up well so far too.  Would recommend this to others!
B001O0XOX0|5|good
B000CKPIAU|5|Quality thermostat that works as advertised.  My '96 Corvette always seemed to run on the hot side .... especially in warm weather or driving up hills .... until I installed this thermostat and cleaned out the radiator fins of accumulated road dirt .... now the temperature runs rock steady no matter what the conditions.
B000F5ECZ4|5|Good quality, heavy duty. Works for many applications. Must have in every Hobby mechanics toolbox
B000EFCPOK|4|Thinner than expected but works great..
B00U5LPYYG|5|Great cloths for any use!!  Especially good for cleaning my car.  I highly recommend these cloths.
B008ACWMLA|5|All I can say is that IAM completely satisfied
B0009JKI6S|5|These wipers did the trick. I needed to be able to see in the rain again, and sure enough replacing whatever I had on there before, I guess technically it's still a windshield wiper, did the trick.<br /><br />Rain-X is one of my favorite brands, they seem to build their products to a higher quality than most. It's good enough where I'm willing to spend the extra money. If you haven't tried their windshield fluid, it also helps a ton.
B004IAB4DK|2|Inexpensive and look fine until you put the switches in.  They stretch to fit the switch, but then there are small gaps between the each housing piece.
B007RVQXRO|5|Delivered fast, fitted quickly with good instructions provided by the web link and works well. Tailgate is a little more work to pull down to close now, but not excessive. Also were slightly shorter than the units removed ... as the units removed from our model w/o power lift gate had been fitted with the units for a power lift gate and this gave the tailgate a little more height before.
B000WK3P46|5|My hubby wanted this for fun, you know scaring people, looking like a dork, robbing a bank, things of that nature! It fits him perfectly and is very comfy!
B00FGXA41Q|5|Very Nice
B0049U1AXI|1|Not good at all
B00YIA2VH8|4|Hubby loves it and he gets lots of compliments. Only thing is, it's already fading. It has been extremely hot and he parks outdoor all day, everyday. So, it's expected.
B00301CF18|5|Work great and have powered my HIDs for over 4 years.
B00KC9SOH0|5|Well made and looks right in my '72.
B002FDGQGM|5|Best sounding slip on I realy love it sounds like a race bike now
B003VASIBO|1|VERY CHEAPLY MADE
B004I0YAHM|5|Inexpensive and a good replacement.
B0068G18E2|5|I'm putting these on all of my bikes.  Easy to install.  Huge difference in ride.
B00A1A6PT4|5|Miracle product here!  Two Grand Prix have failed in one year....the original heater elbows were the culprit both times.  Check these before you assume gasket failure, save yourself a ton of money.  Easy to replace yourself, maybe 8 bolts between you and a smooth ride!
B00771WT0E|5|Fit perfect and non expensive. They work great and good timing on shipment, I'm satisfied with the brakes.
B002UC4XQS|5|Perfect replacement for my RV under bed unit.
B000BNOIAO|4|It has been super easy to use and only took 10 minutes to install.  Shy of a 5 star, because I didn't realize it was a soft top, I guess I missed that in the description.  Still, a really good product.
B00KRIIIIG|5|Excellent quality.
B00BUOSVL0|5|work just fine
B0002SRCK6|5|Work great.
B009XD1YIW|5|Great price
B00TPKJ59S|5|Works great, fits like the old one
B000CITK8S|5|Great
B00X9Y2H8M|5|great
B0002F66DI|5|i love it...as expected
B00IABFTTI|4|exact replacement for cheap OEM cover.Would have preferred grey but black looks good
B00CCYW8L6|3|Looks like a well-made product, but it does not work on the electric awning on our Coachmen Freelander RV. Make sure the support arms are on the outside of your awning and at the same height.
B001C96IJA|5|Everything worked great thanks
B00LH2Z8IE|5|Love this.it holds our owners manual.  Keeps it clean and fits perfect in the glove compartment.
B0085I1DL4|5|Great device. Easy instalation.  Works great.
B005FKG8YC|5|Very pleased with the quality of all parts. Will purchase again.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|This is a quick and easy way to add a USB port to your bike, assuming you already have an SAE plug wired up to a power source.  I've used it for around 6 months without issue. It has no problem charging my phone and powering a GPS unit.
B00PT18QAQ|5|This gauge is very well made and accuracy is dead on! Keep it on my motorcycle when every psi counts!
B00PYYLPJW|5|I love this phrase!
B000AYDXJQ|4|This is your grandfather's oil can.  It works like you need it to work.<br /><br />One quibble: I bought two of these and one came without a gasket in the screw cap.  I had to buy a $0.95 O-ring at the auto parts store to make the can leak-proof.
B0051QY0RC|5|I probably want another one!
B00PVBWJLQ|5|This item fit and was very easy to armed in accordance with the maintenance manual.  It will perform if the engine has Full Synthetic Oil and change the oil at lease every 5,000 miles.  This infomation is for a Dodge 2.7L Engine.
B0040CTTH4|5|These fit the interior door and rear panel for the FJ Cruiser.  They seem as good as the original.  Excellent for the price.
B00NFAIFWM|2|Great bulbs, but get &#34;fog lamp malfunction&#34; error message on dashboard. For this price that should not happen!!!!!!
B000182EWI|5|I have had my Ventshade Ventvisors for a few weeks and they are perfect.  I am very happy with the product. It meets all my expectations. It is a great product for the price.
B001D8TGJE|4|works pretty good, and got here on time
B000P72CJK|5|exactly what I needed
B00OZYHOE2|5|My friend has a motorcycle and would always ask me to ride on it with him. However, I'm never a big fan when having wind in my eyes or when it gets foggy. These goggles save the day! It is very comfortable on my face and adjust very well. It will not slip off once worn. Love the black tint as it blocks out the sun and makes me looks cool and mysterious! The only thing about these googles are that I can't wear my glasses with these so I have to settle for contact lenses which isn't a big deal. Love that it comes with a cool case and wipes! Great way to keep this goggles safe and scratch free. Love that it doesn't look like you are wearing science goggles, instead a nice pair of black sunglasses that will keep you away from the air, sun and fogs!<br />Disclosure: This product was received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased, review.

B009TAGJDO|5|Very well made.delivery was appropriate on time, fit very nice on my bike well recommend.
B00JVHLS3G|1|This item fades to a a yellow-white after 1-2 months. Do not buy! It was also only 76 mm, not 82 mm as advertised.
B00KWDMP2Q|3|This filter is the exact replacement filter for my 2014 Lexus GS350 (4th gen GS).<br />Price is too high though.<br />The TYC 800179C also fits perfectly and is much cheaper (I bought one of these as well).<br />For now on I will buy the TYC filter
B00J9XSMGS|5|I love this sticker! It looks great on our new Subaru. I did mess up on the applying the sticker but it is not too bad, it still looks great. The decal arrived quickly and I probably messed up because I was just excited to put it on and didn't take my time. Thanks guys!
B0040ZPQLY|4|Very good.  Great for large zippers.
B003ULWFMM|5|Fits Well
B00XVBHYXG|5|Most importantly - Wonderful seller.  He originally sent me the wrong size, and when I notified him that would not fit, he immediately sent me the right one.  No complains at at all and it looks great
B00L4TF32G|5|Great product, used it on the  fiberglass on my RV as well as our spa cover.
B00O8W5O3E|1|Returned... Didn't seem to work very well.  No real difference between Hi and Low beams!
B006N0I5VW|5|It fit great
B000V2W0GE|5|good product
B00P65JJ7E|5|easy to install, my son is very happy with the mirros, they also look great
B00OBJ8VAM|5|Love how it shines on my car. We'll worth it.
B00XIY8NNQ|2|This item didn't fit the console readily. I had to take a cutter and cut down the lengths to make it fit.  Also, beware the edges are sharp.  When you reach in to grab an item and your hand hits the edge, you will likely get cut.
B00E7G0BU2|5|Works great
B0090NQQ2Y|5|I didn't have time to drive to the dealer and spend a few bucks more and wait a few days.  Simple search on Amazon and here it is within 3 days.  BLACK KNOB, FITS PERFECTLY ON 2000 HONDA ACCORD A/C CONTROL PANEL.  remember to ensure that the old metal clip is off the post before installing.
B004YWSSYK|5|works great, and for the price is a great value.
B0049MTGXM|5|Fits perfectly for my 2010 Honda Civic LX-S Sedan. It was definitely a little bit of a pain to install only because I had no idea what I was doing initially. I definitely recommend having a helping hand just because you will need someone to hold the dang thing while you screw it in and it gets heavy after a while of holding! It took me about 45 minutes and again that's because I had no idea what I was doing. It works great, I was able to tow a motorcycle trailer (850lbs) and a motorcycle (375lbs) like 1,200 miles with no issues. It even came with an attachment to hold the ball (but it didn't come with a ball though but those are cheap anyways)
B007Z4X1Q4|5|Great!!!!
B000C39C86|5|Fits perfectly for my 2010 Honda Civic LX-S (R18). Although there really aren't any DIY's or good instructions to do the install itself, I was able to install it fine after figuring out where the ATF in and out lines were. Performance wise, works good for me. No complaints so far, it's been 3 months.
B00NHXGGKK|5|Perfect in every way and looks great on the car!
B0017Q6EEW|5|Got this today and couldn't wait to open the box. Put this on my 2005 Dodge 3500 5.9 Cummins dually. Slid it right on over my 4&#34; stock exhaust pipe and lined it up where I wanted it and tightened down the allan head bolt. That simple! Looks great and well made. Would definitely buy this again!
B00480J4QY|5|Excelente
B00YLQR9FS|4|Snapped right in. Would definitely lirchase another.
B002E2ZUNE|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Fit great on my 2011 GMC Canyon fog lights.  Nice yellow color, definitely helps visibility.
B00EEG353A|2|one worked, one didn't. returned and got a refund. lights not so good, but transaction was clean even the return. thanks
B0009TNIY2|5|Perfect  fit its clear like the original
B00MOKM8T0|5|Easy to install and they look GREAT. Took me right at an hour to install both bars.
B001CVXW1K|5|Motorcycling and sport car driving can really irritate sensitive eyes.  These work great.  They fit over my glasses and keep my eyes from getting sore. I highly recommend these goggles.
B0009H50WM|3|Not a miracle wax..
B00ROSZC8G|5|These r really good buy buy buy them
B001C6Q7US|5|As expected, super easy to put in and fixed my no-defroster issue on 06' silverado.
B00HBN4K28|5|My husband loves this on his 67 912!
B002PQQDOO|5|These fit perfect they were a little challenging to put.
B0016J3LFK|5|good price
B0002EXJI4|5|They work very well!
B00L4EJ36S|5|These work fine but you need 2 normal keys to set it up so be prepared. Just look it up on YouTube to see how.
B00D3E168K|4|Worked well but only had to wear for about 30 miles coming home from Sturgis. Fast delivery and good price.
B00B1VUWAA|5|Excellent timing, great packaging, product... PERFECT!
B000FSADEA|1|Junk, do NOT purchase!  This antenna in the 70's was an excellent mobile antenna.  Sadly, this Chinese knockoff does not come close to the original!  Poorly made, flimsy construction, constantly retightening all setscrews until it finally just disintegrated! Sad, there are better out there!
B000C2UJMA|1|Amazon says this fit 04 kia rio but it doesnt. This is too small , the right bell is Bando 4PK885 OEM Quality Serpentine Belt for 04 kia rio w/o ac
B00HEDHJ9Q|1|Makes the car run slower to a stall, had get the dealership original part instead.
B00T5G53ZM|5|Received this quickly and works excellent. Have not had any issues with this and all of the data it sends has been correct. Easy to use and connect to android device. I use the android app Torque with this device and it shows all my vehicle's data on my phone.
B003UNSQDM|4|Exactly what they claim to be and they worked great for the mod I made to my bike.  Only reason why I didn't give 'em 5 stars is the base seems to be just a bit flimsy and so you have to be careful not to over-torque the screws.
B0001XPC7C|4|Needs a clear little window so you know when you're getting low. Otherwise, just buy two.
B00BYRP8I2|5|Bites pretty hard after initial break in period of 50~200 miles. Still on first 1500 miles, will do an update after 10,000.<br /><br />Also make sure that the provided hardware does not touch disc rotor, otherwise it will make metal to metal dragging noise.
B001S8F2V0|5|Exactly what it says it does at half the price!
B000C9SRD6|5|Works very well.  It was very easy to remove the old one and install the new.
B001BMZDB2|5|It is one of the few seat covers I was able to find that is 2 pieces. The single piece covers don't sit well and tend to look sloppy no matter how tightly they were attached to my seats.
B00OL2BXYK|5|Love it!!  All my clients always ask where I got it from
B00178WH9G|5|These boots worked perfect, easy too install
B000F09CEA|4|Keeps your fishing reels salt and rust free
B0042XORMI|5|Good addition to a lab bench
B00332GMS6|5|fits fine
B00N9VR75S|5|I Bought this product because my old one broke. Looks the same as the one i had even better i hope you guys find this review helpful and buy from this person.
B000BZIFV0|5|made by same folks that make mobil 1 and kn
B001G7O0F2|5|Exactly as needed, works perfect, perfect fit.  Thank you
B00OOJH3DK|5|Good item
B001LHVOVK|5|Worked exactly as directed. Great.
B00UBPGM1U|5|WOW, installed and FIXED.....fantastic price......Thanks
B001BNAQJU|4|A little narrow in both a Corolla and a Prius.  It needs a few more inches.
B000FW2MC2|5|There's a spring on the inside that helps keep your cup in place.  Also an open slot in case your cup has a handle.  Pretty much impossible for your cup to tip over unless you hit it hard enough to flip the entire thing.
B005ZS00WU|5|It was just what I need.
B001IHBLPC|4|Instructions would be nice but otherwise it works great.
B00F4YHODS|3|Works goodholds my phone and change ,adds much needed storage in my 2012 camaro!!
B004ADUMMY|5|fit well
B00HNFRI6Y|5|Love it!
B005KLGYTU|4|ive seen toothfloss thicker than the wires on these
B0009H529S|5|good filter for me
B0089AIXN4|5|Fast delivery. Correct part.
B00RV46YBC|4|The delay in the white coming back on after signal is the only reason for 4 stars. I knew it would be this way from another review but I still absolutely LOVE these. Incredibly bright, it's unreal.
B002N0RGCK|1|It does not fit my 2015 Dodge Dart or my 2000 Subaru Legacy. There should be sizing choices.  After realizing that shipping it back was going to cost about $15 I decided to use my Dremel tool to force fit it to my Subby. The mirror curvature requires your eyes to refocus which is irritating. After a day it fell off and I put it in the trash...caveat emptor.
B009AQN2JG|1|BS cutoff line, no step down and projects a crescent shaped pattern. Paint all flaked off and housing is all rusted. Absolute garbage. Not even a good bargain for the cheap price. Don't waste your time.
B000E4VGMS|2|Well they do the trick, but I swear they were made in a toy factory.
B001GF2SP8|5|Got a new car and window shield I really love it.
B00189APDY|5|Looks great and easy to install ... getting the stock doors off was the hardest part! Doors are easy to remove and toss in the back for cruising home from work. No leaks and no fading. Combined with the Front doors in the same style and this Bestop roof the Jeep is ready for summer!https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P23VQO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1
B0002MA4WK|5|pretty straight forward. Great product
B0106NWFIK|1|First set did not fit my 06 nissan titan.  2nd set did fit and the bushings broke after 1 week.  Nothing more to say
B002UC2SG0|5|Good price
B0012UK3M2|5|exactly as advertised
B006XIZ3AK|5|Easy to program.
B003RGIWO0|5|I had coolant leaking out from the head gasket on my 300,000 mile Mercedes and didn't want to pull the head to replace the gasket ..... I used Bar's Leaks as outlined in the instructions and it stopped the leak cold!  The car has run for another two years without a drop ..... so believe it or not .... this stuff works!
B0002SQYTG|5|It is accurate and therefore earned a place in the glove box.
B00T2GT9L4|5|works great
B007J7E238|5|I bought this mat for my fiancee as he is an avid bears fan.  He absolutely loves it.
B005SUHZ78|1|Bought this in 2012, did not use it until spring 2013. Lasted 4 months, turned to a powdery mess on top, tearing from a light touch. Called Empire and sent the corner with tag and sample of top. Received a new cover in timely fashion no charge. Waited until Spring 2015 to use cover, lasted about 3-4 months before disintegrating again. Apparently this material should never see strong sunlight as it cannot handle it!! Total waste of $200.00. Warranty should be money back,sending me a new cover doesn't solve problem.
B000AP1MUC|5|Easy 1,2,3 installment
B001AM3IFQ|4|Came in the time expected and fit great. Saved $20 each.
B003BYFT9O|5|Great product!! We have a GMC Envoy and the middle row has no armrest console. Our kids had a hard time reaching the cup holders near the floor so we got this! The bottom has a carpet style fabric and it grips quite well to the upholstery. I also buckled it with the center belt. (It doesn't have straps or anything but the belt did fit around the unit just under the lid of the hidden compartment. The kids love it and it looks very nice in the SUV. The compartment is a great size for storing a few snacks and a package of wipes, etc. The cup holders are great too. Would totally recommend to a friend.
B000CIT3N0|5|Its an oil filter, works as expected
B000X8EGZE|5|ok
B00VKI4XVS|5|Hope you come up with a little smaller pack for smaller bikes!
B00M10YHQU|4|Good
B006H34AE6|5|This thing WORKS! I bought it because my mother is coming to visit in a few weeks and she is a clean freak.  Having dog hair stuck in my sofa cushions would freak her out.  I used this on my sofa as soon as it arrived and ended up cleaning a dog-sized amount of hair off the cushions.  Highly recommend.
B001F0I4QQ|5|Great product, Thanks!
B003RW29FW|5|works very well  no leaks
B000CF6RX2|1|If you have a newer truck with the safety windows - this WILL NOT WORK!<br />I bought this with the hopes it would, it does NOT!
B0002SA21W|3|It's okay, but we didn't need it.  The Bikini Top that they said it was for had snaps so we didn't even need the channel!
B00U6QN7US|5|Props to 4WS for offering such a good product.  I was skeptical about the spacers being 2.25&#34; tall, figured they were just 2.  First thing I did was measure them, and they really are 2.25&#34; coil spring spacers! I got what I paid for. Grab a set of these 2.25&#34; spacers and a set of 2.5&#34; add a leafs and have a Jeep lift kit for under a Benjamin.
B00WA4AALI|5|Great liners
B0087Q0Q58|5|Very good I turn heads now bike looks a some u won't regret remote works realy far too
B000CKJJM8|1|According to Amazon, this drum was supposed to fit by 2005 Malibu 4 cylinder but the bolt hole diameter was too big. Had to return them.
B00TP0GK1E|1|Not the right part and cost as much to ship it back so I just donated it to my local mechanic... It was a genuine BMW part after all. Learned my lesson...leave car repair to the experts!
B00T47K604|1|Piece of junk . . . doesn't fit into seat belt locks . . .cheaply made & not worth the time or trouble to return item . .they went into the garbage. Had to contact car dealer to get a real extender that fits seat belt & it was free!
B00TF8G110|3|Fits perfectly. Not impressed with the texture or camouflage design. Would still recommend as my old cracked seat looks much better
B000HLO936|5|very good product,
B00W8ADB1K|5|The car organizer is compact and well made. It's obvious that a lot of thought went into the plan of the compartments. The firm back on it holds it tight to the seat and makes it stable regardless of what's in it or if it's empty. When I say &#34;compact,&#34; it is smaller than I thought it would be based on the photo shown. But the size works well for me. It holds everything I really need and keeps me from collecting too much extra junk. JACO really seems to care about its customers' satisfaction, too!
B00ABYVTXM|5|Makes car detailing easy.
B007OW6M0Y|5|excellent
B00KTHXO2U|1|Didn't work out...
B00J65I4KS|5|Simply the best lasting shine!!!
B00DS002XY|5|Good seller.. Good quality.. Thanks
B002PL5818|3|These are probably great pads... But they do NOT fit a 2000 Toyota Tundra V8 with standard calipers.. Too big.. I will return them..
B006GVH61I|5|WOW!  These things really make my van &#34;pop&#34;!  I saw them on a loaded to the gills Limited model at the dealership and just knew I had to have them.  SO glad I bit the bullet and made the purchase.  I have had them on for a few months and they are on there tight as can be.  I have gotten more compliments on my van since I have added these chrome moldings.  I couldn't be happier and hope this review encourages you to make the purchase!
B002X6VXL4|1|when I opened the outside cardboard box, I was shocked to notice that the Stanley cardboard box was TORN OPEN at both side's at the front of the Stanley box??? furthermore, after I removed the Stanley jump-starter/air compressor from it's box, I noticed that the plastic wrap was torn open at the back of the unit??<br />the unit is being charged for 40 hour's, but my concern is this product might be re-conditioned??
B004EIAADG|5|This is a great jump starter even started my dads 454 mobile home in a matter of seconds no charge time needed! As far as an inverter goes it did not work well enough to ignite as small wattage CFL but then again it's not an inverter it's a jump starter and a great one at that
B00G08Y35Y|5|perfect and right price
B00029WVL0|3|I though it was steel.
B004I0VK16|5|Put this on an 06 Colorado Crew cab, 4x4. Mine looks brand new, came with wiring and bulbs, and fit exactly like the original. I would question any reviewer who gave it less than 5 stars.
B00KTJ0A0C|5|Worked perfectly!!
B00Z515O5K|5|Great price, fast shipping and low cost . . .
B006LW94RG|5|Solid belt
B007V2CQ9S|5|Awesome.  Really makes a difference
B00QSHTO0Q|5|The install is done using 5 screws, three in existing holes, 2 into clips that require no drilling into the OEM parts.  Bumpers are placed under the unit and held in place by pressure and double sided tape.  There is no wind noise audible at all, but the unit is low profile.  I travel 40 minutes to work each day at highway speeds.  Overall I am very pleased.
B00EVILBOQ|4|Works well but the rubber inserts didn't fit my windshield frame as well as I hoped. Ended up spinning some around but in the end it worked out well. I like how easy this clamp makes it to fold down your mirror
B004JHN0FC|5|Perfect for porch sitting with a fat cigar!
B00X9E0HRK|3|First I'll start with the pros of this little device. The build quality is superb! It feels extremely sturdy and could easily pass as a $50 accessory. The caps grip tight and the cables seem to be nice quality. Unfortunately, there are a few things that took away from the rating of this device. The length of the cables is extremely short. I bought a similar product to this for a project bike I'm working on and the length was easily double that of this device. I know this could be fixed easily, but I shouldn't have to do that. Inside one of the outlets there was some kind of crud? it came of when I wiped it down, but come on really? Other that that, I have nothing else negative to say about it. Full Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
B005P7CKAQ|5|Looks real good, I only wrapped the barrel and the action I left the wood stock.
B0013REXSO|5|Just ordered these and they took about 5 minutes to install and look great on my 2015 JKU.  I used a 10mm socket wrench for the bolts and the job was super easy.  I put my full body weight on each and they don't budge!
B001FANR54|5|Excellent description and easy to read instructions, perfect fit and looks good
B00PIBZ76I|4|Good product, but lacking in instructions. I found the FM sensitivity to be pretty good. However, I was trying to set it up as a Globaltuners receiver, so that people could tune it remotely on the web, and I discovered that I could either get HF (by enabling direct sampling on output), or FM/VHF (by disabling it) but not both at the same time. This is a major limitation for Globaltuners, as the web interface doesn't have the capability to change these settings. However, it seems fine using HDSDR, SDR-Radio, or SdrSharp when not using a web interface. The HF and AM sensitivity is a bit weak. I was only able to get 2 stations with the built-in antenna or a simple indoor whip antenna, 950 Philly and 1480, which are very close to me. The Funcube in contrast, gets most of the local stations with the built-in antenna. So it is probably a better choice for FM and VHF than HF, unless you have a good outdoor antenna.
B004SR8AGC|5|Fit like a glove for my 93 ford f150 xlt rwd
B0009VIQ1A|5|Great
B00KMDBS9W|4|The mats look great!  The sunshade was too big for the window - but my brothers are big Vikings fans so I will give to them.
B005TB7ES6|1|READ INSTALLATION CAREFULLY!!  My husband put there on his Jeep at 4 PM and let the car sit over night.  He left for work at 8 AM the next morning and drove with the windows rolled up (they install inside the channel so he thought they would be supported with the windows up).  Both front ventshades blew off on his 15 mile ride to work.  I e-mailed the company and they said that the ventshades are supposed to sit 24-48 hours (it says 24 in the instructions).  They don't sell just the front pair and would not even give me a 10% discount to buy a new 4 piece set from them.  Very disappointed!!
B00L6GG4Y8|5|sweet
B00IXZQEFY|5|Perfect fit! Great look!
B000BYD46M|5|Good fit, shipped quick, works great.<br /><br />2003 Chevy S10 Crewcab.<br /><br />Definitely recommend
B00B03MGLM|5|This was for the husband who says to say that it is great.
B003E7LJNI|5|Perfect fit. All the lines were rusty on our 1997 jeep tj. Fit just like the factory ones.
B00REJX9MG|5|Shipped quick, fits good, easy to install.very happy!
B004LWV0GQ|5|Works
B00002N57X|4|This fan was very simple to install without instructions, although instructions were included. The fan fits perfectly for the original Lomanco fan I had. The 3 mounting brackets perfectly matched screw holes used by the &#34;triangle&#34; shape mount of the original fan. As far as noise, I would say it is roughly the same as the original fan before its bearing wore out. It has been on constantly for the last 2 months without incident.
B004LX3AS6|5|Works great. Ordered the extension cable to charge batteries away in the garage.
B000QQZ9HW|5|:)
B00DX8CLXA|4|right size out of the box. riding with it about a month, and have had no trouble.
B001PYDX3G|5|The cable was well made and as advertised. I would have liked if the length had been specified.
B00RSRF5U8|3|It works great except for in rocky or mountainous trails. It tends to catch rocks and bend easily if it does.
B00GZL76BE|4|It fits and it works.
B00T6S94R2|2|I purchased this wiring harness a few days ago and it seemed pretty easy to install. After hooking up my light bar to it and installing the switch, I flipped the switch and my light bar didn't turn on :/ I rechecked all of the connections I made to make sure I did it all correctly. Everything seemed to be in working order! After hours of trying to figure it out I ordered a new relay hoping that would solve the problem. A few days later I received the new relay and plugged it in. Same issue, lights didn't turn on!! Finally I took apart the factory installed wiring enclosure to find that the wires were not connected! They had sent me a product that was not manufactured correctly 😠. It took me a few minutes to correct their mistake and it was good to go! Now I'm just hoping that there are no other issues that arise once I start using the light bar for an extended period of time!
B001DKPJW0|5|Worked as advertised, very happy with product and will purchase again.
B00UWZLDUY|3|Holes didn't line up
B000C2QLZY|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B009KAAFDI|5|Just what expected. Like the removable cover
B000EQOIZS|4|I bought this item to replace a rear engine mount on a 2000 Dodge Stratus w/a 2.4L engine. This mount fit as directly as advertised.
B00AQUVOPY|5|works great
B002NGCO30|1|sucks
B0002STST4|5|Good quality plastic with strong magnets.
B000EVWDU0|5|it does the thing
B0074DFHMW|4|Worked great and did the job.  The outer knobs were a little poor fitting so I reused the original outer knobs.  The one's I needed (inner buttons) worked and look 99% OEM once installed.  Can't beat the price.
B001233DC6|5|Cool
B00KOD8W7Q|4|my grandson likes the helmet
B003ZZM1FY|5|Exactly as advertised and reasonably priced.  Plus, made in USA.
B004SX5HNA|4|Took 2 days for shipping , can't get any better then that . these lights for what you pay are fairly bright for volunteer services and construction reason and I highly recommend them if you're on a budget . very very satisfied and will definetly buy from company again.
B00ZCVKZG6|5|This tire pressure air gauge by car buddy pro is a must have for anyone who owns a car. My car tire is always losing air for some reason and my check tire pressure light comes on frequently so I'm alway having to stop and put air in my tire. theres nothing worse then stopping at the gas station pumping in quarters to use the machine only to find out the pressure gauge on the air hose doesnt work so you have no idea how much air you just put in or if all the tires are at the same pressure, this pressure gauge fits right in my glove box has a nice big display and is easy to use and is acurrate. Love the design of this and its easy to hold onto, Ive bought the little slim style ones that just has the little stick the pops out of the top but I alway lose them or after awhile the stick doesnt pop up anymore and they really arent accurate at all. I love this pressure gauge so much i'm gonna be buying more to put in all my kids stockings this year for christmas. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and I highly recommend
B001KW00NY|3|i drove from ny to florida and we had rain on the way and the clothing inside did get wet so its not water proof other then that it was great
B000BWAPR0|2|Surprised that the wing nuts just slide on (and off).  Photos show them in place.  Without putting an adhesive or something into the splined upper portion, they would just fall off while driving.  Since part of the point is appearance, having the bare splined studs sticking up is less than ideal.
B002935IV2|5|I bought this as a &#34;why not?&#34; when I purchased my Keeper bag- I'm glad I did.  It offered additional purchase on the car and certainly buffered the contact between roof and bag.
B001UCGQ0U|5|good price
B004I0WS6M|5|Was the exact part i needed.  Installation was easy.  Price was unbeatable.
B005FTW69E|5|love the improvement they make for this product...
B004OXRDU4|4|Simple to install.
B0007WJQ6K|3|Definately cheaper looking than my old extang.  Not sure how well it will hold up.  Spend the extra money and get an Extang.
B00BVL7LUY|5|Tools are made of heavy steel.  They worked on the few connectors that I tried.
B00192QBHY|4|Should make the zipper higher so easier to get to gas valves.
B000CQDRN4|4|They work and sound good.  Not much louder than stock.
B00K35UP52|5|smells a little weird but i love it
B00WOTIHHS|5|Works great!
B00C8E9CMS|5|Great product and fit.  Fit like OEM .
B0042L0S50|5|Perfect fit. 2006 f250 now has the 4 x 4 that works. Great check to see if you need this part. 1) Turn air on full fan with it blowing in your face. 2) engage 4 x 4 using dash control.  3) If over about minute the air flow switches from in your face to defrost only then this is the part you need.<br /><br />You would think a modern truck would throw a code to let you know the vacuum switch wasn't working properly?
B000FQ1XNC|5|Perfect. The fit is a little tight, but not a problem. Make sure you install it from behind the dash, if you try and shove it thru the hole it won't fit, ( not that I tried)
B00HLUSEXC|2|I would completely love this helmet if Bell would have lived up to it's own standards.  Great field of view. No buffeting at highway speeds. Well fitting.  Great looking. Good ventilation.  Man.  It was awesome... Till the day I went out for a long ride.  4 hours of whistling and wind noise. What makes it worse is that when I called Bell to ask them if this was normal...  The reply was, yes.  They reminded me that this was not a technical racing helmet.  I was very disappointed.  If this is the case why price it at 400.00 bucks?  Bell that was a complete cop out.  I hope you can make this helmet to your own quality standards.  I am extremely disappointed. This is a fantastic 100.00 dollar helmet.  At 400.00 bucks...it's a technical rip off.
B004YJTLYY|5|Great on my fj
B002MQCYO0|5|Used this stuff for years. Best cleaner and polish for all surfaces of my motorcycle. Highly recommend.
B00TF1A50U|4|Did not fit perfectly as I had the regular American Pickup model and not the Hilux, but it was very very close, good enough for me considering the price.
B0057F8FDC|5|I love this car decal! This is the third one I have ordered from this company and all have very good adhesion.
B00I6YBATM|5|Came in earlier than what I expected and I love it 
B00A1A6PT4|5|WAY better than the OEM plastic crap. I've replaced 2 sets, one for a friend, and one for my mother, the OEM ones always seem to crack at the o-ring groove. These aluminum ones will never rot like the plastic ones do.
B00K8CHOXQ|2|Very hard to put on and once installed , the seat covers wouldn't stay in place.
B00LUSTQEM|1|Didnt fit my H11 fog lights.  Threw them away.  Waste.
B0117VVPJA|3|This mount is NOT aluminum-bodied as shown in the picture!  Instead, this mount uses a plastic housing similar to the stock mount, which I was trying to avoid since the plastic on these lower quality aftermarket mounts is more susceptible to cracking under stress.<br /><br />Having had trouble with another aftermarket replacement mount identical to the one I received here, I'm rather disappointed that this item is not as advertised.<br /><br />Additionally, the rubber seems to be of the same lower-quality composition as the &#34;Eagle&#34; brand rear differential mount I purchased a few months ago, which is already cracking and will have to be replaced soon.<br /><br />For a quick fix, this is an &#34;ok&#34; mount, particularly because of the low price.  However, for long-term use, paying extra for a factory mount is advisable.
B00BIR1KJE|4|Smart product if u want to carry your phone by neck lanyard or belt carabiner. Get a heavy duty screen protector.
B001CKCHMQ|3|Not big enough, but it's cute for looks.
B00KV8U29U|5|The headlights worked much better then the original bulbs. The light output was great and just as stated on package,
B00659K34S|2|White on,y shows up on darker backgrounds and cannot be seen as well as a darker sticker.
B00MJ458JI|5|Super easy to apply and fit my 2013 Honda Fit perfectly.  Super hot summer and it makes a high difference to be able to leave a crack in my window and not worry about a passing rain.
B00BN44QYS|5|Had to have something to go with my New truck and this really fit the bill. Not to big or to small. It's just about ten size of the Ram key fob. So it doesn't add bulk when I stuff my keys in my pocket.
B009FUF6DM|5|Super soft, Hugh quality microfiber. I have yet to have any Amazon basics product disappoint me. These cloths are no exception. Super soft great for any application. Washing the car, dusting, makeup removal. Will definitely purchase again. Recommend.
B00F5W2AU6|5|Fit like it was suppose to
B0000AYES4|3|Works good... Only issue I've had with it is that it doesn't stay locked but for the most part it gets the job done
B00G6188EM|5|Just finished putting on one side of these reflective rim stickers an dang , I dig um , didn't see any photos of them in the light , so here ya go , happy happy
B009GO6CYO|5|works great
B003SZ76AG|5|Works As It Should, Hopefully Can Provide The Years Of Service That The Original Did.
B007EEVIWY|1|After getting the carb and seeing how many things were wrong and then seeing there was no name I should have known better than to instal this carb. After hours of MODIFICATIONS I got the carb on, and it worked great, for about two days later when I actually took it out to do some work and as soon as it warmed up it started pukeing gas and run like s@#&. This carb is junk in my opinion and I will be rebuilding my orginal carb that I know fits and works right. Do not waste your money people.
B00QUSEFWA|5|Works well, no problems noted so far.
B00D7QP19E|5|Worked perfect
B002UC2UB8|5|Great deal
B00UPMTI0G|4|For what we are using it for...it is o.k.!!
B00H4OUHXA|5|Fit perfectly, looked good
B00KZD8HNE|5|Quick easy installation
B000E9TS6O|4|Does what it says.
B004ZG8FES|5|Very good
B000CONU9M|5|Best lugs they don't rust
B00M9M9008|5|Excellent bars, the two clamp blots really ensure they stay in place and the finish and welds were great quality. Would purchase again.
B00BGH4UAC|4|Price point is fantastic. Pads installed easily and have lasted under under normal conditions.
B001HKZHIW|5|I only used this once, but it did what it advertised to do. Just remember that you have a time limit on how long you run the motor.
B00M1OUBES|3|no motorcycle adapter
B00II5YADC|3|Not as big as we expected it to be. My boyfriend ordered it and apparently didn't see or didn't read the description carefully. It does work, but it takes a little longer.
B007PP055S|1|garbage
B000JUXGAC|1|Didn't work at all. Instructions were horrible. By the time I got around to returning it, it was past the 30 day return policy.
B005RSUT3S|5|Great item
B00VGL64G6|5|A great ball mount package for just $16.95! As good or better than bigger names on the market.
B00869A60G|5|Super Nice!!
B0088YE6YQ|5|Very good quality, worked great on my 2005 Infiniti G35 coupe !
B004I0HFQK|5|works great, easy install.
B00L2T6N9U|5|Very well made, and was surprised after carrying it in my pocket with keys rubbing against it that is really has not scratched like I thought. Very happy with the purchase and the seller sent it fast and it was packaged very well. Thank You
B011WI1CY6|5|Good
B001Y8HAZ0|5|Fits a 2007 tahoe perfectly!  Very happy with this product.
B00VQUXXWA|5|I have been sensitive to the sun for as long as I can remember and constantly have to change the position of the vizier, which can be dangerous and annoying. Whenever I am the passenger, for some strange reason I am always sitting on the sun side so I purchased these shades for me.  I love that these come in a set of two because I use one in my car all the time.  Because they fold so easily, I am able to keep one in my purse and when I am in a friend's car, and if the need should arise, I can put it on the window in seconds.  The suction cup works very well and these shades do a wonderful job of filtering out the sun.  If the sun affects your vision in any way, these are the shades to buy. I received this item at a discount for an honest review and since I always read the reviews of items I purchase, I will always leave be truthful.
B0043063JU|1|it is ok.  There was a run in it and I am not sure I like what it is made out of.  It feels like plastic, and it also does not relax so how it was folded in the box is how it still looks a month later.  I would not buy another rug made out of the same.
B002Q1MPVI|5|This backrest looks great and is very well made.
B0098VFTCQ|5|great $$
B00E5OUOCQ|4|This thing folds up nicely and covers the majority of my Lexus GS350's windshield. Can't complain for the price.
B003VAUQ2I|5|real easy to hook up, love it
B00BYH6C1E|5|I installed two of these in my cars and they work just as advertised.  Installation was fairly easy ( my BMW was a little more difficult than my Subaru ) but both work well.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I like the little credit card flashlight and sticky pad for holding my cell phone and stylus, both of which usually fly around inside the cabin when I'm driving..and yes, I do drive rather aggressively so this has been a real problem in the past.  I plan to buy these as Christmas presents and birthday gifts this year.  I have no doubt they will be well received.
B00GBQ3932|5|fit perfectly
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Love  easy to use static cling shade press and go
B001BNT4W0|5|Handsome keychain. Not bulky.
B00B9EYJQ2|3|Fit ok on a Ford F150, was a little tight around the edges.
B00R6RGMFW|5|Better than the picture!!
B000CN4XWQ|1|No matter where I installed it, the fan would not come on till 210
B006TMLZHA|5|Great item
B00902G49U|5|Great !!!
B00DQU9W4G|5|Excellent car cover great fitting.
B00SBZRR8O|5|The pump fastens securely to various sizes of gas cans and pumps quickly. Great purchase.
B00JSRC9C8|1|I have ordered signs in the past from other vendors. They were metal and this was plastic. I expected that. However, this sign is quite small not the size of a standard parking sign as the others I have ordered were.
B00EHE8R9Q|5|Really like it. Exactly what I expected
B00ABW6DO4|4|Very nice fit.
B00IGZQGAY|5|Great Product for very reasonable price!
B000MW5SO4|5|I matched perfectly to the original component.
B00BP4DCGE|5|This type of LED light is the only way to go. It has a nice big contact surface, rather then the tiny thin wires on other LEDs that amazon sells.<br />I tried several sets of the kind with little wires, and ended up them away.
B00T3ZLXHC|5|Looks great
B00FV1MM72|5|Good fit and easy to put on for my 2015 Silverado Reg Cab. No vibration and no wind noise with the windows up.
B000R5ARJ2|5|Thank you
B00H6XPZN6|5|blocks alot of the sun light out
B004TB3878|5|2005 Nissan Titan<br /><br />You will need 3 hoses to complete the job. Upper, lower, and mid lower hoses.<br /><br />I forgot to order the mid lower hose :(<br /><br />next time!<br /><br />Quality!
B00652G4TS|1|Got a lemon, got my money back tho
B005HR29BO|3|Not Great, but good.
B000CLQQM8|4|Good
B008TV47EC|5|works as it should
B006PEKCXK|1|I double checked my order info and I gave the correct year model etc of my vehicle yet the grommets do not line up with the floor.  Very disappointed.
B004Q76RGY|5|Buy it, it's excellent.
B001F0I4SO|4|After my husband broke off the passenger side mirror off of my car, he duct taped it back on.  Then my daughter broke off the driver side mirror off my car, and she duct taped that back on.  I ordered both this and the matching driver side mirror - and in less time than it took them to duct tape the mirrors on, I had them replaced.  It took a lot longer to scrub the tape residue off my car!!!  My car has automatic mirrors, but they haven't worked in years - so I took the chance and ordered these and they worked just fine.  Easy to install, only needed a ratchet set and a long shaft screwdriver.  I've had them on for several months now and they are very sturdy, no shaking or vibrating in the wind.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B003OH20HW|5|Fits great.
B00G4S4H24|4|Pretty close to professional grade. It looks better dry then wet. It's pretty thick stuff so you need to work quick with it. It sets fairly fast, if recommend doing it in cooler temperatures. I applied it in 90 degree heat and it was a bit harder to work with.
B007N9K920|5|Great product! No quality issues and fast delivery.
B00NBOIZZO|1|This will not fit my motorcycle, even though it says it will
B000C9TC3A|5|Good Air Filter that easily fits into a vehicle
B009FUF6DM|5|Very nice
B00IAZ4MDS|1|Terrible kit, &#34;expedited shipping&#34; a month later received it. Both rear spacers have big dents and gouges out of the metal, front spacers are all damaged, paint chipped off them, very poor service I would highly recommend just buying a ready lift kit for the extra 80-100$ a lot more satisfied with them over supreme suspension. Would not recommend anybody to ever purchase this.
B0050DCX2A|1|plastic and attaches to existing cover with 2 sided tape!  Not what I was looking for
B003123EFC|5|TM Designworks make high quality products for your off road vehicles. What comes on your dirt bike may be fine for a short while, but this after-market product is an essential to prevent expensive repairs.
B00GXLUP1Y|5|Install would be better with two people. But it works exactly as I hoped it would on the front of my GTI.
B00GD49GTS|5|Perfect product does what its supposed to and more
B000YCCP2U|3|These are heavier and sturdier than the ones we found in the stores, they look nice. If you only have two screw hole mounts on your vehicle then they will not fit tight at the bottom and rain snow gets under them over time. The mounting screws that are included are way too short, had to go out and buy the correct ones.
B00JVIIKGS|5|Looks beautiful on my MacBook 2015
B00ED61I4E|5|GO NAVY!!!!!  High quality window decal.
B0016GUMIC|1|Still using the steer wheel cover because it is cute but the art is falling off the wheel cover and it really makes your hands stink at first.
B008RIEQXY|5|If you dont mess up wiring they will last a long time and look cool.
B00JVHLS3G|5|Satisfied with purchase.
B0024ECC3S|5|It works with my starcraft pop up camper but the crank wipes against plastic. It still useable anyway.
B003VOF6A6|1|DON&#34;T USE!!! Killed the sensors in both my Audi and my VW they want $200 to replace sensor
B003A8D6YG|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B0001E65UE|1|A total piece of junk. After the 3rd use it started leaking oil everywhere. Bought this for occasional use so the 30 day return period has passed. So I have a $128.00 paper weight
B007HRN72M|5|Perfect fit on my Lance 11'-6&#34; Model 1121 Truck Camper. Just keep in mind that the color won't match exactly because usually the RV's are an off white and this is pure white.
B003Y323NC|5|Works great the only issue is distance since last regen and edge is working on it for 2015 ecodiesel's and they say want be long.
B00KK98KO4|1|Dollar store sunglasses don't bother
B00R6S0MEI|2|I had high hopes for this nozzle, but sorry, the power from this nozzle was not any stronger than the cheap one I already have, that I bought at Target.  I would have kept it if it were as strong as it claimed.
B00B3YLVJG|1|Complete junk.  After applying (to a clean windshield), pressing the bubbles out results in several white glue spots.  The best I can tell, the glue separated from the decal.  Additionally, the face of the decal was scratched.  Save your money.
B0071I2PBQ|5|Fantastic price and quick delivery. It fit perfectly. I will definitely order from you again and recommend you to friends.
B004Q820TQ|1|Pay attention to the size of this panel.  It well not fit on the dashboard like I had planned.
B006VC8UI0|5|Worked as advertised
B002BFVZX8|5|it actually looks better than the pix.  we bought it for our RV and it really helped keep the dirt from being tracked in as well as making our camp site more &#34;homey&#34;  I would recommend measuring the area you plan to use it as 9x12 turned out to be way more coverage than I was expecting.
B00BT0970O|5|They are beautiful! Great value! One seat cover anywhere else costs as much as the whole set!
B00F5BFKF4|1|I initially bought this sticker for my car window but I definitely won't be putting it on now. The accuracy of the cuts are not good, the diamonds above the A's (but actually are V's) are rounded, so no points on it. The sticker isn't dye cut so you literally get a rectangle sticker, I personally would never buy this ever again.
B00IAUNGJE|3|The seats covers does not stays on or maybe I did it wrong.
B000JD39WO|5|quick and easy to apply. fit perfect with 08 civic sedan
B00194547U|4|Good quality for the money.
B006OKXKA2|5|Increase in throttle response and my gas mileage has improved significantly....very high quality product with extremely durable construction.
B00KME3W2M|5|The red and black has a nice touch. The SF logos are nice. Proud to sport my team.
B00S1X7BUK|5|I bought these Alpha gloves along with their externally armored coat. The gloves are a perfect match for the jacket and are extremely well made and very comfortable. They take away a good bit of vibration from the grips and allow a good amount of ventilation to keep your hands cool and dry. The hard plastic piece above the knuckles acts like a cowl that directs air right onto your knuckles. I couldn't ask for better gloves. Seem very protective on the top side of the hand. On the palm side it's just leather. They look like gloves batman would wear. Awesome.
B007RXBTI0|5|Works great for mini fridge,but had to raise up fridge to open door.
B0041CC0ZG|5|very good price and good quality!...
B000BRFGGA|5|fit and works Great!!!
B00W8LQYKO|5|fast and good price
B00K8D9Q36|4|It's important to note that this radio is quite different from other marine radios.  It has 4 screws (two on left side and two on right side) that are covered by the black plastic pieces to make it look neat after installation.  For me, this radio IS GREAT, since my Bayliner 185 boat came with an older model with the same form-factor.  I purchased this for the Bluetooth audio functionality, that the Jensen radio that came with my boat did not have.  Installation was simple and the wires on the included wiring harness were color-coded.  Even after following the included instructions, pairing a Bluetooth cell phone for the first time was quite confusing.  Bluetooth audio sounds great!  I wish that there was a microphone jack and microphone included like several competitors offer....that's great for hands-free calling on the boat.  The display is black and white and is nothing fancy to look at but the front of the radio (after mounted) seems to be somewhat water resistant.  I don't think that I'd test my luck with water resistance if the radio was mounted in an exposed fashion though.  There are definitely fancier-looking marine radios on the market with more features but this one works well and seems to be built to last, at least for a while.  I've included a picture of it mounted in the helm of my Byliner 185 boat.
B01173NNLQ|5|A monkey with a flathead screwdriver could install these things in 5 minutes. It took me 7 minutes....
B00J17X6ZE|3|Needed a set of these door handles as the chrome is separating from my current set and was pretty happy to see them at 84 and some change so I ordered them up. Shipping was ok and the product arrived in good working order and everything appeared to be good, just make sure you order the right part the first time because you will be paying shipping to send it back and a restocking fee.
B0015S9ZG6|5|these cutters are amazing ! I install 5th wheel hitches for a living as part of my work. These cutters cut though pickup frames so quickly. It only takes seconds instead of minutes of drilling and and taking a break before starting on another hole .
B00NE49IAC|4|Like most reviews, product arrived in time and works great. However, THERE WASN'T THE ADHESIVE! I had to go buy that.
B00E3H5JJI|4|arrived on time. customer service tech was very helpful in setting the program up for my car. I'v had it a few weeks now and it has missed the signal a few times, but, that could be due to the heat were I live. I would recommend this product.
B000GVAFJY|5|Didn't fit my bike
B00CE3OWAU|5|Great price and works well.
B00HUBXBBM|5|Love it
B0077RM6D8|5|Great product.<br />Good: Easy to mount, good fit, wide enough to fit two kayaks (Pelican 100's) side by side, light weight.<br />Careful; after initially tightening the hand screws I had to snug them up a few times over the next couple of days as the bars became loose, probably rubber molding into shape.<br />Mounted on a 2011 Jetta TDI, gas millage dropped from 42 mpg to 39 mpg; might want to take them off for long trips.
B000C5I8AM|5|works and fits well,reduced the temp so I dont burn very much oil and it doesn't turn black,cant ask for more
B004HORJJK|5|I got this for my 04 kia rio great fit installation took no time
B00KMEB9IQ|5|Gave this as a gift to my cousin.  She absolutely loves it.
B004MAOEKG|5|Product as promised
B001C6OYYO|5|not easy to install-but nice to open the hood without pliers-should have fixed a long time ago--cheap fix-but you must be the kind of person willing to tear inside panels off and removing parts under the hood to get the job done
B002UC2RSE|1|Wanted it to work but after flipping the right switch a few times it just went limp and doesn't do anything any longer. No snapping action to it. Too bad, good looking in an RV but no confidence in this unit. I hope you have better luck.
B0009TCRB2|5|Nice ball  Well made  hope to get many years out of it
B0015PK3AG|5|pretty easy to use. Used it to change the oil on my mothers 2013 toyota rav4. if you need any help theres this dude on youtube, i think his name is huang (asian dude), pretty good video. If it gets stuck to the filter cap, just tap it a bit, it will loosen up.
B001FNG7BM|4|This starter is working great. It was about half the price of a rebuilt one from a local parts store
B00579ASVU|3|I couldn't easily put Them on my Trac rack like I had read in a review. The rubber cushioning started tearing after the first usage. Other then those issues they seem to be worth what I paid.
B002XR3AU0|4|Very helpful and delivery was quick! Thank You!
B00QLDDC50|5|Love it.
B00GHSGDPU|5|Fits my 2010 Accord  perfectly.  It is easier to put on if you put it in boiling water for about 2 minutes to soften the rubber.  Once it's soft (using gloves) it went on real easy
B0019II8W4|4|good fit, but by chance.  the ends slip over the 2 1/4 pipe if you cut and add this muffler in.  but on my 96 caravan i have 2 7/8 out the back to the tail.  description in the ad doesn't mention the end sizes. 2 1/4 on either end fyi. muffler muffles good. thanks!
B00QRANHI4|5|Def worked better then expected
B00CDT494O|4|Great product. Easy to put together and install. Look great on daughter first car
B00KPQYV0E|4|The BAL Hide-A-Spare works just as advertised, and bolted up under the frame as expected.  Having the spare up under the trailer is a great location.  The unit arrived with little packaging, a questionable amount of bolts, and a bent securing knob.  Camper RV Supply got a new knob coming, but did not communicate that information very well.  But, the new knob showed up and worked.  They seemed to be not knowledgeable as to how many bolts were to be supplied.  It was easier to just go get the bolts at the hardware.
B002M72K98|5|Perfect, great price, I needed
B00BCRMBGQ|4|I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....<br /><br />This Oxford Set Flat Cloth Mesh by OxGord fits my 2004 Chevy Malibu alright. I have the solid black set. I had to take the pieces out of the bag to let them air out. They had a smell to them. I believe it was probably because they were stuffed in the bag. The fit was suitable. They are universal covers so they are not made for any specific vehicle. I had to tuck them into the crevices for a good fit. I have 4 kids and bought these to help protect the seats from spills. The fabric is thin, but strong.  This definitely works for me
B0002MBKAA|5|Great fit. Gives me a better nonslip grip. Tight so there is no slip on steering wheel
B0027AD1DE|2|I am not happy with this. The unlock button is sticking.  Im hoping it doesnt eventually break.  I only bought this control switch last month.
B001O7PNS2|1|not worked as described. I cant see any major difference. Better to buy gel
B0068G4LDC|4|For use in my 2001 Toyota Tacoma.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Excellent reflective quality. Mirror quality itself is absolutely perfect: no artifacts, bending or haziness.<br /><br />2. The actual size is perfect as well; fits without having to compromise too much on sun visor functionality.<br /><br />3. Unbeatable value for money.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. As with all convex mirrors, magnification is greatly reduced and there's an adjustment curve if coming from a flat mirror. One star taken away because the curvature actually minimizes more than other mirrors I have used.<br /><br />Regardless: I would buy again, pros outweigh the cons.
B00UHD4HJA|5|had a very good selection of stickers
B00MU5X17M|5|Just got it today It took 10 min installed great price working fine thank you
B0006BIACS|1|This was advertised as a 36 mm wrench. It is an 18 mm.  Please change the title.
B009E9LX5O|5|Works great.
B004IZKKZS|5|I'm a Subaru certified tech and even though we have to use Subaru parts on customers cars given the rules of the dealership, these are what all of our mechanics install in their own Subarus. They are designed very similarly to the oem turbo engine head gaskets and those almost never have issues. If you want to replace your leaking head gaskets every 5 years go oem. If you don't want to ever have to replace them, buy these.
B000EDQQHO|1|I originally gave it 5 stars.....wish I could take them back. The cleaner worked good and the uv treatment went on just like it was supposed to. I normally cover my RV but when I don't my roof gets some dust on it and is fairly easy to clean with a pressure washer , car soap and car brush. Well this PO$ product is like oil and remains oily attracting all dirt and literally stained my roof. I worked 2 hours with a pressure washe today, tediously working every square inch trying to get the now IMPREGNATED dirt off my roof.  I don't know WTF this is but it looks like I put olive oil on my roof after I rewet it, trying to clean the roof   I will never buy this $h*t again
B00HWI3WSU|4|They look great but the i had to completly replace the brackets they used for the install becouse they feel extreamly cheep and i didnt trust is
B001C6Q34S|5|Easy to install
B001D9E41I|4|This is just like an ordinary cover like the other brands that I used before.
B0031HPELY|5|2007 Tahoe back lift gate quit working normally. This and it's accompanying part SG330076 fixed it!
B010IQ9SJY|5|The sticker was wonderful, perfect gift for my boyfriend and very bright and stands out on his truck!
B00O83KZ1Y|4|minor modification needed on both the product and vehicle to get them to work ( extra 10 min work ) Looks good on vehicle.<br /><br />1996 Suzuki Sidekick 4x4 2dr soft top
B003TAB6Q0|5|I shopped around and found nothing of good quality with a reasonable price. I took s chance and my wife loved this license plate bling. Great quality, stud are imbedded and it shines all the way around👍 I would buy again
B00OK01VC2|5|Perfect
B004367PT6|1|Dear readers, Never buy this product for Honda Accord, it will not work. I experienced severe vibration for the car after fitting these mountings and all these mountings broke with in 3 months. I had to go back to Honda workshop to refix the car with genuine honda mountings
B00KAWGQD8|5|Looks great and fits perfect.
B00842A7F4|2|doesn't look close to original .
B00UW09QJE|5|Everything is as I thought it was going to be. Only reason I got this was because the inside was black and I could maintain the oem look.
B008W1BF4O|5|perfect
B00AYXM4DY|5|works great
B0006MRRU8|5|Perfect replacement.
B001GJ3FIS|3|Very disappointing. It worked properly for a day, and now 2 settings work well, but the rest leak heavily from the dial. Not happy!
B00EPYDYD2|5|Perfect fit  on 2015 Camaro SS.
B0063TKKA2|1|Did not fit my T100 like amazon said it would.  Had to return and pay shipping back
B0002SQZR2|5|if you are going to take the time to wax your car, this is the stuff to use..  What a great shine.
B00G2TV7OG|1|Shorted out the first time using them do not buy product is junk.
B00DX5TUKU|5|The jacket is not as heavy weight as I wanted but the fit is good and is very high quality
B00JAI8PE6|5|This did not come in the color posted but in white. Not pleased.
B00A9YZP3E|5|Worked great in my 2015 Chrysler 300C vanity lights. A little on the bright side - but that's fine by me!
B00NRA2AU8|5|Excellent replacement for OEM fender!
B0009NUG66|4|Worked fine
B00ONH2DJC|5|Good quality and right in time . Good job!
B00EVMT6A8|5|They do exactly what they were meant to do!  They stick just fine to the existing mirror, and provide more than enough view-angle to see what's going on in your blind spots.  One drawback: I put these on my motorcycle mirrors for added safety and they take up a lot of mirror real-estate.  I wish they made 1&#34; or 1.5&#34; ones.
B004IV8NBU|1|just sounds like cheap whisteling.  don't waste your money.
B00A8XK3DI|5|This took me a little over an hour to install on my 2015 Accord Sedan.  Removing the Exhaust hanger was the most difficult part.  But even that just took a little perseverance and patience.  Fishing the bolts through the frame rail was no problem with the fish wires they provided but it was the part i was most nervous about.  I used a grinder to cut down the heat shield and instead of aircraft shears and that worked pretty well.  I would buy again from this seller.
B00K889FCI|5|worked great on my 2006 toyota. It wasnt as simple of a 30 second wipe but was maybe 5 minutes of using green and gray pads to buff headlight. The dealership wanted to charge me $99 to do the same thing so my 5 minutes of work was well worth price of the wipe new restorer kit
B005X796DC|5|perfect fit
B00GEQTVQS|5|The fit is perfect. Great coverage for the cargo area
B001BWE9MG|5|perfect
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Jumped started a boat with no problem.
B00757KJTI|3|The range is terrible. Luckily I do not listen to to much radio so it's not a really a big deal. It looks great and is constructed well, but it doesn't perform well.
B001C6GQPY|5|I was looking at the rebranded Chinese stuff sold through the main jeep accessories retailers and I was glad I found this product.  Its worth the extra $20 over the other stuff because I plan to have it on my Rubicon for the life of the vehicle.  I gives you an OEM quality product with the Mopar price.  I was able to install this receiver with messing around this the muffler.
B006PIHT82|5|Real nice!!!
B00EUXLKCU|1|Very easy to install. However, the piston did not compress after installation. I got defective items which would not compress even with my 200+ pound weight on them. Had to return them. I hope the replacements are much better.
B00FC22PFE|5|Very good light output. This is probably my 6th or 7th kit that I purchased for different vehicles and as far as light output brightness goes, it is one of the best. On the negative side - even though it has slim ballast, it has also additional voltage converter connected that is at least twice as thick and provides additional mounting challenges. Also for H11 connector that goes in to stock power harness, it was mounted backwards and would not &#34;click&#34; in to place in proper orientation. I'm not deducting any stars for that because it is universal kit and not for specific application. Overall I'm very happy with price/performance.
B001KXN3YQ|1|destroyed my transmission
B002UC4P2U|3|I gave this product a 3 star because it did do what it is supposed to do. I got 2 bulbs in the package and I have used only 1. I am storing the other until I need it.
B00VKQ6ECQ|5|Worked perfectly.
B001CSBY0Y|5|Received and have been using this product, which works as advertised. Recently learned via you tube that people are using regular motor oil for the same purpose. But would buy again.
B001THQX1S|5|Good Job
B00DNIUC4U|4|Great for the price. These are nice seat covers for the cheap price. I installed them in my husbands car without the included s hooks and they are staying nice and secure so far. I would recommend these for someone who is willing to replace them each season (I doubt they will wash well). We live in the country with lots of snow, ice and gravel so being able to just toss and replace in about six months is reasonable.
B000H8BU5Y|5|Worked perfectly how I had hoped. I now put things in the back of my truck with much more peace of mind.
B00FD7M6B6|5|Love it. Just as expected
B00TJSZ18U|5|Excellent shield. Easy to install. Smooth transition between light and dark. Highly recommend.
B00BZODN9A|5|Happy
B00MJDWVOE|5|So far so good. Had it installed 30 minutes or so ago. Did windows only, roof thing looks like a 2 men job or ladder needed to get it set right. But so far, window visors fit almost perfectly. Someone said they are too long or something - none of that. Peel, center, set, press in - done!<br />The only reason I said &#34;almost&#34; perfectly is because the front window visor, where it's next to the rear view mirror, is a little bit wider than the glass frame, so it hangs down a little off it. Some may possibly find it unsightly, I don't care. Mark it on the frame, take to grinder and grind about quarter of an inch of it down. All it takes.<br />Hope 3M will hold. But that's easy fix too, I had that happen before. Simply go buy 3M tape and re-tape edges.<br />Good part about glue-on visors - they don't screw up your window regulator, like in channel ones do.<br />2012 Highlander. Very happy.
B000E670XK|5|Solid switch, does what it should.
B00FWXJK6A|5|60+ miles on the gokart and I don't see any wear on this gear.  I bought two so I'd have a spare, might not need the second one.  I wish they'd come with a key, had to run out and get one.
B00II55HAC|1|purchased  6 bulbs in february thought they were great purchaced 12 more to fill all lights in rv then within 6 months with very little use the individual leds in the lamps began to flicker and go out checked power requirement and power supply all well within range  will be returning this product as they are junk
B00KNGCUMW|5|fixed the vibration great shipping
B001OBBC6K|5|Good product. Easy install.
B00KWDJ07Y|5|Perfect fit on 5.7 V8 in Sequoia.
B00684TD6O|5|Good product. Had to look up how to program on YouTube.
B0040CRV56|5|great product
B00DHQO5PA|3|Not an exact fit for my 2013 E Class.  Disappointing.
B00CPYF34W|5|FIGHT THE POWER!<br />I make sure the fighting spirit of Team Dai Gurren echoes far and wide with tales of its badass leader.<br /><br />Amazing show, beautiful/ high quality sticker.<br />Just get it if you have the few bucks, so worth it for a smile when you see your car after work.<br />Makes you remember to believe in the you that believes in yourself.
B00H86EN4S|4|Good experience
B00GHT7ZYM|5|Perfect replacement to get my 2002 Excursion 4WD system operational again!  After replacing the vacuum lines to the hubs the issue of going to defrost once the on the fly 4WD switch was thrown was still present.  After a visual inspection of the remaining vacuum lines this vacuum valve was the only remaining option.  This was a direct replacement and installation only took 3 min.  once plugged in the hubs snapped to lock and all was good again.  Highly recommended!
B00ZIRATQ0|5|Looks good and very easy to put on, just make sure to clean the surface with rubbing alcohol before putting on the sticker.
B005ESSZ3W|5|Fit perfectly
B00QZ8YK16|5|Tekonsha P3 trailer brake control worked perfect on my 2015 Toyota Tundra. Plugged right in,easy to install and easy to understand instructions.
B0134MBDXS|5|[[VIDEOID:3a7d47e84fbab473c7d8d71e802168a4]] Much better than my last jump starter pack (from an autoparts store). Includes an air compressor for tires with plenty of attachments inlcuding a needle for my basketball. Built-in flashlight is nice even though it isn't super-bright. Charges my phone just as fast as a wall charger. Has a battery indicator so you know how much juice you have left. Well-made . The air gauge is not accurate unless you turn on the air (if you just plug it in it reads about 5 psi too low), so just make sure to have the air on when you use the tire gauge. 5 stars
B00O0PDQ2U|3|I thought it was yellow but received and it was gold.  Glad material is aluminum to withstand when I drop my keys.
B00KCYNDN0|4|Pretty awesome that it was like my drag sticker where it was kinda like a peel off tatto but its just a sticker still cool tho
B008HZJRK4|5|Installed on my 2005 Nissan Titan 4x4 Off Road.<br /><br />Installed them on a Thursday, and immediately pulled a car on a trailer(~4,500lbs) it the next day 160 miles and back two days later. I didn't have the trailer assist brakes, so all the braking was done by the truck. Needless to say they had performed better than expected. Not a single squeal there or back. This is with the trailer attached!<br /><br />Without the trailer the truck can nearly stop on on a dime. The brakes are very responsive, and have excellent initial bite. I honestly can say if you're brake heavy, these pads may not be for you. They're a bit of an aggressive pad, and if you're hard on the brakes you may slam your face on the steering wheel.<br /><br />Always make sure you have flushed your brake fluid when changing brakes. Brake fluid can absorb water over time causing your brake pedal to not feel as firm.<br /><br />I would 100% buy these pads again.
B001J1ZV08|5|My wife loves it. That's all that's important.<br />As for delivery and packaging - It was perfect!
B002LYITR4|5|Great storage container. I mounted it on the roof of my RV. I've been through countless rains with it so far, and everything inside is completely dry.
B00VR700QO|5|Great product, and well worth the modest price!  It looks great on my Audi Q5 and the finish is a good complement to the factory black trim option.  The frame is very solid with minimal obstruction of the licence plate.  I bought the 4-screw version for the back of my car since there were 4 holes in the mounting area and the 2-screw version for the front.  The frame is stiff enough that the 2-screw one would be sufficient for the back (there are some tabs in the frame that grab the bottom of the plate securely.  Be sure to get the bolt cover kits for a nice looking finish as well!
B00IZ7D9M6|1|This is nowhere near waterproof.  Had to clear coat with auto paint to make water proof. This is the third one I ordered. All leaked water and quit working except the one I clear coated
B001CA784I|4|Wires worked great and fit as expected. They're missing the numbers which was a bit frustrating, but not an issue
B000W0RQ8C|5|GR8 item THX
B00OBJ0AYM|5|This key that I ordered and recieved did not fit my original Southco Lock.  I didn`t want to send it back<br />because of the freight charge I would have to pay.  This item did not work for me.  I thought all Southco lock<br />and keys we standard, made to fit all.  Looks like it`s not.
B009DJMR6O|1|It threw more codes than my old one. However seller was great to deal with!
B0134MBDXS|5|As described. I only used the jumper part. Looks nice and comes with carry case. LCD scrren n stuff.
B0002JMFKM|5|BEEN MADE
B001IH8Q0A|5|Works as presented
B0071F7KJG|5|Received nice light assembly that included all 3 bulbs. Was about half what a dealership would have charged.  No complaints!
B008HZJV9Q|5|Installed on my 2005 Nissan Titan 4x4 Off Road.<br /><br />Replaced front and rear set.<br /><br />Installed them on a Thursday, and immediately pulled a car on a trailer(~4,500lbs) it the next day 160 miles and back two days later.

B009DK5HL0|5|Item fits the car perfectly and is good quality.
B0081SBYPI|5|It works well great deal!!!
B00843V9G4|2|Cheap material, trim is falling off with limited wear
B00GUF74HQ|5|It was easy to install and works great. The only area you need to pay attention to is the nut insert. You must keep count of the number of rotations you turn the nut. Overall great price and works excellent.
B007RZ2Y0A|5|Took a week to get here. It is well made and it looks great. People laugh when they see it. I would buy it again.
B001A698NI|5|Exactly what I expected!!! Very pleased with the quality!
B00BI1U8VQ|5|I installed a 520 conversion kit -1/+2  on my 2005 YZF-R6 and my speedo was off. I purchased a speedohealer and it was terrible and didn't work at all just killed my engine it had wiring and tapping into other wires. my bike wouldn't turn over. Stumbled across speedodrd. Took mins to install and program, completely 100% plug n play, bikes speedo is corrected and it was easy and actually worked unlike the speedohealer. Buy this product if u need ur speedo corrected.
B00OM8XVZ2|5|This looks AWESOME on my 2005  Black PT Cruiser windshield. Most of my car is &#34;blinged&#34; out with Chrome, and these are super Chromy looking.  I had another sticker that I had had on there for 8 years that was starting to wear, so was time for a new look...I have had many compliments on this..My cars has been through several car washes since putting it on and it has held up VERY WELL - nothing is peeling or coming off  I love it .I would buy again for sure or any other stickers by this seller!
B00BDJB1WI|5|Fits perfect on my 1000 XT. Bolted up fine and little vibration on the trails.
B00D9MYKA2|2|not as big as i thought they would be kind of flimsy
B008VJ9URQ|5|excellent product
B00SJTN5U6|5|Works great!!!
B000CSWR10|5|Perfect fit. Great price. When the sensor goes bad the engine will not start!
B00AXMW0EY|3|Price was too high for the product I received
B003ZWKCVW|4|Very heavy duty. Extremely strong. A bit on the small side. Will not work well for anything other than a small trailer or compact pickup. Cones with 4 very robust straps.
B00FDQPCR2|4|work good !
B000VBZCKG|4|Well, even though these are the correct part number for my 2004 Civic Hybrid 5MT, they fit &#34;well&#34; but I wouldn't say they fit &#34;perfectly.&#34;  They are more footwell liners, and not floor mats, as they're so large (which is a GOOD thing).  Problem is, the footwells are not flat, there are irregularities (humps and bulges), which is typical with any car, I realize, but these mats don't account for them.  I'm not sure if they fit better on the coupe or the AT cars, though.  These are at best semi-custom, so one star deducted.  Otherwise, they are nice and heavy.  I like the hook holes in the mat to secure them, I had these in my Subaru but the hooks eventually came unsecured, let's hope Honda's are a little more stout.  I bought my car used, and it looked as if someone lived in it from the filth.  The carpet was worn through on the drivers side, and the OEM mat was missing.  These definitely help to hide that. If you want something with perfect fit, though, best to go to Weathertech, and pay the extra money.
B004C6I7WG|5|'Excellent', it's awsome...thank you.
B000C9S4RU|5|work great thanks
B000Z0HVHA|5|Good construction. Using it to extend dvd adapter for children
B00HX0MZIK|5|I love it, it is a little strange most people think but I Love it, Fit my jeep well no problems putting it on and away we wents.
B009SCNGD4|5|This product works excellent! Cleans up the chain nicely all while posing no risk to your bikes plastics or metal. I keep it 'in stock' now. I must note; I've never used any other motorcycle chain cleaner but, as happy as I am with this product, I'm hesitant to ever try anything else.
B000FPY63M|5|Great product. Had to buy pretty much all new hardware that my local hardware store had. No big deal. Get longer bolts
B000FQ01TE|1|This gas gauge is a piece of crap.  The directions where for every product Sierra offers, so they were of no help at all for installation, as a result it took hours longer to install than should have been required.  The lip is extremely small, so the installation must be very precise, with almost no room for error; but because the directions are useless, it is almost impossible to install sufficiently perfectly.  The glass on the gauge caved in during installation (from normal handling, was not dropped or mistreated).
B000G28PPE|4|Great product.  The epoxy paint dries to a nice glossy highly durable finish.  I painted remanufactured calipers before I installed them.  Everything came out looking great.
B001TFE38A|5|Very nice shined
B00HFE4K7I|5|Perfect decal, I did apply it to my window and leave the backing for nearly 12 hours in the hot July summer so when i peeled the baking the decal remained perfectly intact.  Looks great on my dark tinted windows.  Several people have asked me what it means, While I have had others with this tattoo or something of the sort strike up random conversation. The symbol of modern patriotism.  Would purchase again.
B00450FLAU|4|Very loud and recommend you extend out away from your (or others) on first pump:) This pump horn actually surprised me at just how loud it is. Did expect it to perform so well and first use rattled my ear.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars except the fact that horn part blows off occasionally. Since it does not screw on (pressure fit) expect it to seperate from time to time. Not a biggie and for the price something I can live with, just wish it screwed on.<br /><br />Would say not for constant use but sure shuts the dogs next door up... Is it worth the price? yes it is.
B005CNNLRY|5|The liners fit perfectly in my 2015 Focus ST. Just make sure to remove the factory mats that came with the car prior to installing this product.
B000C9SL7I|5|Quickly shipped, worked as hoped!
B00OI5WESE|5|Fit perfect
B008K2AGEU|5|Great product, good price
B00QE1U90A|5|Cool looking looks good on the car thank u
B00I3E2558|5|My daughter bought these for me for my classic 1963 Ford Falcon.  They look great.
B0091OE6II|2|I probably could've accomplished the exact usefulness as this gadget provides with large document binders.
B00MVQPQ0U|5|perfect headlights for our golf cart ... easy to install ..
B00GXZQMG2|2|did not fit
B00029XGAU|5|This is a really neat little horn with a big sound. I bought two, one for my Kubota B8200DT and one for my Cub Cadet 1650. The kids love blowing the horn on the little tractors.
B005VKRSZE|4|correct parts,but there was a chip on bottom left corner otherwise satisfied
B00CS9CO6Y|4|This bag held up well on a 13 hour drive. It took a little bit of work to get on and off the roof of the car, and took an adjustment or two to make sure the straps weren't flapping. But once it was secured, it kept everything dry and freed up a lot of passenger space for us. At the hotel on the way, we just emptied the bag, folded it and stored it in the car. I would definitely recommend this carrier.
B00IYVUVQA|4|Looks pretty awesome on the tailgate of my SUV  just wondering how long it'll last feels a little cheap
B00HX6P7YI|5|This laser worked out about as expected.  I screwed it to the ceiling and then plugged it into the plug for the garage door opener.  It has worked fine now for about a month.  The only thing that seems a little off is the motion sensor turns the laser on even for small motions.  So I would expect the laser to be on most of the time.<br /><br />The laser was easy to aim after installation and now it works well.  It's easy to see on my dash, where I have it pointed, any time of day.
B00ZLPABGC|5|Check them out yesterday, sticking ok attempt to remove after installing. But was stuck good and can see my blind spot objects are closers than they appear.
B00YB9HD24|5|It's beautiful and worthy of my beautiful new Ford Expedition!!
B00KTWBM5Q|5|Works like a charm for my 2010 Honda Civic LX-S Sedan. I only bought it because all of the other kits required cutting/splicing wires (yuck). This one was a simple plug in and you're all set.
B004C26TD4|4|I love this cup holder! I installed on my 2001 Honda VT750 ACE and it compliments the look of the bike.  It holds your drinks very well.  The only downside, is that the install is a little bit confusing in regards to mounting the cup to the base, but once you figure it out it's easy.
B000C2SB70|5|It was exactly what expected and I didn't have go to the auto parts store..
B00E1ILM2M|5|Works as expected...
B000CD8HH8|5|These blades are fantastic on my 2002 Trailblazer, and the price here is great.  The first pair I had lasted 2 1/2 years, and they always produced streak-free windshield glass. I tried RainX and another brand when my old pair died, and those other ones hardly made it 6 months and never matched the Valeo quality.<br /><br />On the passenger side, the stiffness of the blade prevents it from laying perfectly flat on the outer edge of the curved glass, but as they actuate, it doesn't cause any lines or smearing to appear. Not worth docking a star.
B00B2AFXOA|5|Huge improvement in ride and handling.
B00NC8UABQ|5|Great product! Works great with my 20 inch light bar. It's been on for a couple months now and still perfect
B0010Z4MDK|4|Arrived sooner than expected, installed with no problems, did have to use the adapters for the smaller fittings.  So nice that they were included with the battery.  Has been about 5 days and is working with no problems.  Would give a 5 star but not sure how long it will last.  That will determine that rating.
B003ZOLC8M|5|I hope that means I am conpletely satisfied with the produce.
B000C2OB2O|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B00SZK1420|5|They look great on my 2008 Silverado! Now I just have to get headlights to match them. Would definitely order again. Installation was very easy, took maybe 5 minutes.
B004NFXA7I|5|I always used RainX until I heard about Aquapel and gave it a shot.  I swear water still beads up on my windshield at least 6-8 months after an application, with nothing but a VERY occasional wash in between.  This stuff is awesome!  Be very careful though, I was an idiot and cracked one of these open (like you're supposed to do) and dripped the liquid right onto the body of my - at the time - freshly washed and waxed automobile.  It left permanent drip marks in the paint (or maybe the clearcoat?) that I could not remove no matter how much washing waxing or claybarring that I did. So just be careful.  With great power comes great responsibility.
B00537EKSI|5|Very high quality product and easy to install directions for installers.  Got mine installed at SEARS Auto Center on my 2014 Dodge Charger SRT8.
B003YMTJ6M|4|four stars are all I could give this product because I have not used it long enough to give it a 5 star rating, However, the fit was perfect and the price was right. The original rotors only lasted 45000 miles before rust demolished them. Wear was not a problem, noise was.
B007XY3R42|5|Great kit, easy to use, easy to follow directions. Anyone can do it.
B00NQ198LC|4|Worked fine, but the code numbers on the locks are illegible. If I ever need to get new keys, it will be very difficult.
B000CQQKGU|5|great price towed 6000 lbs no issue
B006TM1FM0|5|Perfect stock replacement for 2004 STi
B000VVYQLW|5|Powers my truck perfectly! No running out of juice with all offroad lights and pulling high RPMs
B00746CMO0|5|Works great thanks
B008NO4GVY|5|Look good for faux decoration.
B000J3ZR10|4|This fits my Dodge Caravan (1997) perfectly.  It will stay up really well, even without using your sunshade-flaps.  The only complaint I have is, because it is such high-grade thick material, it is very unwieldy, and therefore difficult to fold up quickly or easily.
B0074A8FH4|5|Just as described and promptly shipped!
B004SCETXU|4|Well, it's a piece of plastic and four screws.  My car doesn't have holes for a front plate and I just moved to a state that requires front plates.  I was inclined to drill a few holes and screw the plate straight on.  My wife insisted that instead we get a mounting kit.<br /><br />This kit is basically a piece of plastic and four screws.  Not really much of a point, actually.  I ended up using the four holes as a guide and drilling through the bumper, then screwing through the license plate, mounting kit, and bumper.  That's basically what it's intended for.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, this doesn't serve any functional purpose except maybe to prevent the license from rattling around or scratching your paint.  A bit of shelf liiner would have done the same thing.<br /><br />Still, it works.  Attaching a license to a car (even if there are no pre-drilled holes) isn't rocket science.<br /><br />The kit recommends that you get a frame (sold separately) and a clear plate cover (sold separately).  I didn't.  None of this stuff is needed, frankly.
B00CELSRW6|5|these guys are just perfect!  Well built and look great on my 2014 Grand Cherokee!  Customer service was excellent!
B000C18QN0|3|Love the floor console, the only thing is that it sits on a slant and my cups when sitting in the cup holder spills on to the car seat and floor when full. It's fine if your cup is 3/4 full. So that is why I am giving this a 3 star.
B0002STSTY|5|Definitely what I've been wanting to get for awhile to get more organized with all the tools in the garage.
B00NOL6RSG|5|I bought it a week ago for my ambulance and then I unfortunately had to use it during an emergency. I must say that it worked very well and it happened at night so the streets were fully lit up and the traffic made way for me quickly. So I am extremely happy that it sort of saved a life. Terrific product!
B004G7ZP6M|5|Fits well and no mushroom head look...
B00U1PFOF0|5|Wow! Works great and does what it should. It shipped and arrived much earlier to my place than what was originally estimated.
B00KCXQGAS|5|I'm so happy I found this! I have lived in America for about 2 years now and I miss Denmark terribly! I wanted a way I could show off my Danish pride, but everything is pretty expensive😕 When I found this I wast sure what to expect but it's super awesome and It's worth the price!
B000AMBOI0|4|Great product and fast shipping only thing is that I got it with a few dents around the vent holes but the tester works great was able to test all of my 6 and 12  volts batteries I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because of the dents
B007553AE6|1|The sticker already had a smudge of black ink on one of the letters when I opened it. The process was messy, the instructions were poorly written, & it looked tacky overall. I threw it away immediately.
B000EDOTCS|5|Great...this is nice, hung mine vertical (Note: when hung vertical, the slide on/off feature doesn't work - it will slide off by the weight of the paper towels) it's in an area that's out of the way and easily accessible.
B001PIKQYG|5|I have this on my 04 Wrx and it has the deepest rumble I have heard from subaru's and it is not raspy at all just note you will shake everything in your house when you turn on your car ,not really but it is a very deep rumble.
B008BC8EW0|5|Feel like solid OEM mirrors and install was easy , took 5 mins to put on. These  give me more visibility overall and make my 2500 HD  look  mean!
B005OQYCKE|1|The jumper cables started to smoke and when he went to takes them off burned his fingers. Minor burn because he was quick about it.  This could have been awful for someone that is not used to using jumper cables. The rest of the kit was adequate so we aren't going to waste shipping money to send back.
B00I9680Y0|5|This is for the slightly older version of the NGK Iridium. Hope to get the same results with these.<br />I had the NGK Iridium plugs as OEM on my then new 2008 Toyota Matrix. I've never changed them and now have 154K miles. I'm trying to solve an slightly high and erratic idle problem. First was cleaning the MAS and FI, no joy. But the car still runs great otherwise and fuel economy is still high, 37mpg life time overall. So I though, time to look at the ignition!<br />While these seem expensive, considering they have lasted about 5 times as long as the old cheap copper core like the Autolite 3924 at $6/set of 4 would cost $30 over the same distance, these Iridium plugs are actually cheaper at $25.51.  And even if they were the same cost there is my time involved in changing 5 sets and I have better things to do:) Good Luck and happy motoring!
B009DJY9DS|1|Don't waste your money on this cheap knock off.  No where near the quality go the OEM part.  It is flimsy and has the thickness of aluminum foil.  It;s going back.
B00407TTL0|4|first can nozzle was crappy and it dripped  and was thick and didn't cover evenly. COLOR was the perfect match though. 2nd can worked great!
B001AIZ5HY|4|It took about an hour to go through the process. I highly recommend going to the 3M website or youtube and watching the video first. The effectiveness of my headlights were GREATLY increased after using this kit. I only gave 4 stars because my headlights did not look new cosmetically after the process, but thet did look 95% better and the brightness of the headlights at night was like new. I highly recommend this product.
B00OZSGWJG|4|nice
B0055AW0N0|3|i have a crysler crossfire, no cupo holders... this works good, only complaint i have is it needs to be deeper
B0016ISGTM|5|Quality OEM replacement part. Fairly easy to install.
B00H9S71LW|5|NONE
B000CO9QBI|5|Came in super fast and I like the quality of the product.
B00696LITQ|5|I love my plate cover! I've gotten people asking me while driving where I got it. Came on time and still looks brand new after a year.
B006DXWE2A|5|this Reman AC pump works great, i installed it on my 2006 Saturn Vue shortly after i receive it in april, i must say the price went up significantly since then, i purchase it for $98.99 compare to what it cost now. it is working great up to this point
B008A5GRHM|5|Great for Avalanche owners!
B00G1YF068|4|Wish I read the full description. These do not have the built in resistors that the others have in this price.
B000EFMU4A|5|Cheaper hubcaps than you'll find at Walmart or the auto parts store and they still look great! Made my 1995 Nissan Altima look new again!
B00SQC0CGQ|5|Looks great on the car and works
B000F285EQ|5|Needed it for our jack.
B00F2GU6U6|4|I've had the lights for a couple weeks and they still haven't burned out haha well see  how long they last
B008KZKDYA|5|Perfect! Made a huge difference in making my car feel new again!
B007D5480S|5|Easy installation. Good welds.
B00652G4TS|5|Had the ABS and Traction control lights come on one day on my truck.  Also disconnected my cruise control which I use all the time.  Tried doing all the normal trouble shooting - reset by disconnecting battery, look for bad fuses etc.  Could find nothing<br />After receiving this unit I plugged it into OBD2 port and did a scan.  Informed me that the left rear wheel sensor was bad.  I ordered part which was $20 and was able to clear all the ABS codes that were causing the lights on dash.  Between the new sensor and this unit I guarantee that I saved money from bringing it to the dealer or a repair shop.<br />This handy tool will come into play in the years to come with 3 teenagers all getting used cars in the next year or so.  I will definitely use the live mode when we go test drive vehicles.  Too many options to list, but many options to view live feed from engine.  Really cool.
B002XM5E6S|5|got for our rv door, works great, I bought two so I have a spare.
B000ELW8EG|5|1
B00M0ADAIW|5|Great overall riding jersey!!
B009LPTCRW|5|It's a excellent product for anything diesel.
B004ZF3KA8|5|Easy install no problems yet. Highly recommend.
B00BFDFY6Q|3|Needs instruction how to install
B003V1AD34|5|I found a local source for new $199.99 and used for $125.00 then saw this deal. Ordered it and installed in a snap, works great. Delivery was only 5 days
B00IDHW0PU|5|Perfect
B001U6DMSK|4|Back seats are hard to install
B00DJ5KEEA|5|works perfectly.
B001FZJ9SS|3|Light duty, will probably last a year, but thats fine, the sun is harsh.  the mounting hardware provided is super light duty, might want to find some yourself to substitute with.
B007HGU9JM|5|Worked as expected
B000NZSR5W|5|great item A++++
B000FIY08U|2|It's normal.
B00076QA4C|4|It's a great storage bag for the uses for which it is intended. For my purposes (hanging off the transom in the cockpit of a sailboat) the mesh is a bit too large and small items which tend to float around causing mischief slip through. That is no complaint against the bag as it is exactly as described. It is well made and versatile.
B00LJ3BRO0|3|Pricey
B0002KKIXC|5|It works on carpet, not so sure about using it in my car. It took the spots off my rug with no problem.
B00N396W6Q|4|Fit great did not like the cheap clamps
B001CF1A7O|5|works well for pulling out bushes
B000VKOD9S|4|Product was good but shipping was very slow
B005O01Q86|5|easy to install
B00W517OLA|2|Does not fit the Yamaha rhino 660 UTV. The fuel connections are to small.
B0075ZQCZA|5|These things fit over top of jeans. Very big.
B000WEIJ3O|1|Cheap.  Lid broke within 2 weeks.
B0007LVHT0|5|Perfect fit from a quality product at an affordable price! I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family!
B00NJRGD70|5|GREAT ITEM
B00K69GEQY|2|Since we live in the United States, I expected the thermometer to be in Fahrenheit but it is in Celsius only.  Very disappointing !!!!
B009FREAGO|5|Bought this for a road trip and boy did it come in handy!  It's worked awesome holding trash, even cans that leaked!  Easily washable.
B009344HJY|4|This item is a great replacement for a 2009-2013 Subaru forester and has a decent build quality for the price as it is about half the cost of the OEM version.<br /><br />The size and appearance is identical and I was actually able to remove the painted back cover from the original and snap it on to the Dorman replacement.<br /><br />It's not quite up to par with the original as it tends to vibrate when going over bumps and the motor sound inferior to the OEM.
B005K08O6M|4|3rd time is the charm.  I was finally able to find an extender that fit my older model (1989 Ford Econoline).  Simple installation too.
B000EVU89I|3|worked well for what I needed it for.
B002SE1GDG|3|Good fit  ,a difference in chrome color.
B00789Y98K|5|OUTSTANDING!!!
B001XW7UWA|5|High quality great unit
B00S92R3F6|4|Worked perfectly. Looks amazing in my 01 Durango cluster. Only qualm I have is that I wish it could be just a bit brighter.
B002RM7G7O|4|A fish is a fish, no matter how you eat it!
B004QQ05HC|5|Great price
B001GRZKJC|5|These gaskets worked perfect
B004A0ZLSC|5|Fit perfectly.
B00N67AA1I|5|Autoshade fits my vehicle perfectly...son took about 10 min. to install....they look great
B00LGDOY8E|5|Just put them on my 2015 Z06 and they look amazing with my black rims. Couldn't be happier.
B000VWK4UI|5|Fits great and is really handy.  Fits better over sound bar and the safari top.  I use with the sides and back off and when very stormy over regular top.
B002X55TRE|5|I bought this about two years ago. It was a little smaller than I expected but not by much and definitely not in the way that I'd say they intentionally made it look bigger, so that was probably just a miscalculation on my part. Pay attention to the dimensions. The product itself was easy to apply, stuck to the wall well and didn't peel off until we wanted it to. When we did remove it, it came off without damaging the wall and without too much trouble. A+ product.
B004A533X2|5|work just fine
B000LNU41Q|1|worst pump i've ever had, and i've been cycling 25 years.  main problem is the fitting does not seal down onto the valve appropriately to enable the air to enter the tube and for pressure gauge to work.  It can be made to work after numerous attempts, but I've never really found a trick to ensuring it works.  plastic handle also broke after a few months.  These issues are a pain with a tool that must be used daily before every ride.  cannot recommend this pump.
B00CJ5DV2I|5|Extremely efficient product. Took about 30 minutes to bleed all 4 brake lines. MUCH better and quicker than the other method of bleeding brakes where one person needs to step on the brake pedal......
B000NCOKZQ|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B0009JKGJC|5|i love it...as expected
B0002M9QRE|4|i can now see the deer at night sooner
B0060YHP3A|5|i love it...as expected
B000BLNTQU|5|I got exactly what I ordered when it said it would come.  No problems! I used it for my 1999 Toyota Corolla with no problems.
B00O4XUHAM|5|They worked great.  Bought them for our special needs daughter and put them in all of our vehicles.
B009DJQT54|4|Works well so far no issues
B007TWOKX0|4|Happy with the price. Installed on a 98 xj. Made the back ride a lil bit rougher but who cares its a jeep. Riding a 30/9.5 wish I went with the 265/75/r15 because its a lil bit bigger
B000C9U126|5|Perfect fit for my 2005 Chevrolet Impala LS.
B008VN18KY|5|perfect fit for my Sportage
B0077RLG20|5|I purchased these crossbars for my 2012 Dodge Journey.  I  Am incredibly pleased with them.  They were easy to install.  It probably took my husband and I 15 minutes.  They came very well packaged.  The color doesn't match the factory installed roof rack,  but thats not a deal breaker for me.  The price was much cheaper than Mopar's parts.  There is a slight humming in the freeway,  but nothing the radio can't drown out.  I would definitely recommend them.
B003RVRQJW|5|These worked perfectly and super affordable
B0006JLU22|4|They feel a bit lightweight so I'm not expecting them to last any length of reasonable time.
B001QV7VF4|5|Solid aftermarket choice
B0028PJ10K|5|good product
B00NGJEN5K|4|We are on our first trip with this tent. It's working great on our Toyota Sienna; we are using mattress from our sofa bed to sleep in van. Instructions were not real clear but we ate able to get it on the van fairly easily. It takes about two minutes to remove or reattach to the van when we go out for the day. The only thing I don't like is the door. Our old tent had a &#34;C&#34; shaped door easy to step out; this one is more like an inverted &#34;U&#34; and you must step over about 10-12&#34; of bottom of tent;greater chance of tripping. Have not been in rain yet
B000NVW1LM|5|Stopped 95%of our engine leak good product.
B00UHD4HJA|1|a bunch of stupid anime/ chinese brand stickers. may be the worst purchase of my life.
B00LEBLI82|5|they work great!
B0066CP6I2|2|I think it is very loud and its not just air noise, its an annoying high-pitched singing noise.  Not good background noise for sleeping if that's what you're buying it for.  There's no reason for a fan to be this noisy except cheap construction.  If you want it for a loud truck or construction equipment which is otherwise noisy maybe it would be ok.
B00LZ4IS3G|5|I ordered this carbon fiber switch plate for my RZR 800. The quality and fit & finish is absolutely amazing. Install was super easy. You will have to cut your dash with a razor knife to accommodate the extra slots. I relocated the 12 volt plug under the dash with a relocater bracket I found on Amazon. This is real carbon fiber and not some cheesy carbon fiber look alike plastic. It is well worth the price and I highly recommend it.
B00Z8F2UA0|5|I clean expensive cars for a living. Range Rover, Mercedes, Ferrari.  This minute is an incredible cleaning tool. It is helped make the job easier quicker and better. I highly recommend it!!!
B000UK1WYS|5|Great spark plugs for only $2 bucks, not because they are copper means they are bad, they work wonders.
B00S8ET146|5|great price, fast delivery...
B0052SF0LO|2|What a disappointment! This solar light stopped working no matter which direction you point it. It looks like this item is not equipped to be outdoor especially in the hot summer in Texas.
B00KBQWSB2|1|These things are junk do not order them if I could give them no stars that would be even better. I got them plugged them in and the low beam on one keeps flashing so glad I spent money for a box of paper weights!!
B000IZ49MW|5|A+
B004ZF39T0|5|These fit on my 2010 Honda Civic LS-X (R18). Had a hard one plugging these in only because my civic was a little tight for my hand to fit in some areas, nothing to do with the kit itself. Not going to lie, at night, these lights are bright AF! They do seem like they might be just a little* obnoxious for other drivers, but screw it, I'm fine with that. I went from blind as a bat to being able to see so much more at night.<br /><br />I just bought another pair (different sized bulbs) for a friend's 2008 Subaru Outback. He says he LOVES them.
B001DAGEDI|1|Fit just fine.<br />But only lasted 15 months. ABS wires both broke off after 11 months.<br />Would not recommend at all.
B00F3J2FW4|5|These fit perfectly in my 2015 Wrangler.
B00496LM4E|5|Replaced my old dirty filter in my 2013 Sonata with this filter.  It appears to be a quality filter and it fit perfectly.  No issues whatsoever.
B000CPAFYO|5|The add a leaf kit fit perfectly, installation was easy, and the best part is that there is no sag in the rear end of the '88 Suburban any more.  Add to that improved ride and cornering, and this product is a no-brainer.
B00N12RT8A|3|Online search said this would fit my vehicle, 2013 JCW Countryman. Holes were too small  for proper mounting and the item is not large evohmu6MTic for drilling bigger holes. I'm rather sad about it because they would have been a beautiful addition to an already beautiful interior.
B001O7PNS2|5|Easy to apply and protects well
B00WNE1XDO|5|Comes with everything you need to rebuild your brake master cylinder. I own a 2005 Suzuki GSXR 1000 and I personally did a rebuild on my rear master cylinder with this kit. Definitely no complaints at all with this purchase.
B002MQIRGO|1|Didn't fit my 2005 cobalt 2 door. The mirror is much bigger than the coups original. I tried to return it and was informed that I have to pay an excessive shipping fee just to send it back.
B007CTR59G|5|Sounds great
B00BSUE80O|5|Bought for my husband for Father's day and he loved them!
B0002SR4AE|5|does the job and a co. you can trust
B002R0Z56A|5|fit
B004SRC5GI|5|Fit my 1997 Acura RL perfectly! Quiet, works great.
B000HBI9EQ|5|Just what I ordered.  Great uality permatex adhesive.  Thank you.
B000XBCURW|5|Product as promised
B003PJA1LQ|3|More difficult to install than anticipated.
B000COC0GQ|5|Have this in my 2013 Outback & my wife's 2014 Crosstrek.  Performance is most noticeable in the Crosstrek.  (Same air box in both, same size filter, but Crosstrek has a 2.0 boxer vs. the 2.5 in the Outback...we run Shell Premium in both.)
B00W4IDIGE|1|Steam clean and alcohol prep meticulously done. Applied EZ Lip which looked amazing. Unfortunately, this lasted only 2 days until it peeled off. Not worth it. Avoidand save your money
B00B0ZEPYG|5|It's the factory stuff. Good for us purists!
B001AM8K04|5|The auto repair place that I got my last set from didn't carry them anymore.  I saved myself over $200.00 doing it myself! All the parts I needed were in the box took me about an hour to remove and put the new shocks in. I highly recommend them to anyone that needs air shocks. Theywork great. No problems at all!
B008C7VPD4|5|Got delivered on time , Good quality.
B00877SL2M|5|Work great!
B005JCQHYC|5|met my expectations
B0109K40CO|1|Loved them for 11 months then one went out sent in under 1 year warrenty. Gave me the excuse that the product was abused and would not replace or refund the money. I dont know how you can abuse a head light bulb thats sits in a sealed head light housing.
B000C9S4RU|3|Works well but would be better if the wires were colored to match the original plug.
B00JGJG8VG|5|true 4 Gauge and is very well put together
B00252GHK8|5|this batch was made in Germany, so I bought 2 more.
B001DRJNB6|5|Went on easy and the clips were included.
B00QSLMXUK|5|Works better than the OEM one.
B000C7TU52|5|I cannot believe the shipping quality, the box was doubled and was secured great, comes with extra flare fittings I didn't use them because I was lazy and didn't have no leaks prior in that area...the price and quality cannot be beat....
B00JTUBTQG|5|Now going 15-17k miles on my Honda Accord after numerous UOA's that tell me to go longer and longer. I also run 7-10k with 50% towing miles in my Toyota Sequoia 5.7L FFV engine and UOA's again say I can go longer. This is GREAT oil and worth a $1-2 more to have it shipped to my house vs a dreaded trip into Walmart!
B000A0EJ66|5|Pro: Value, flexible, quality feels very good, fits well<br /><br />Con: none<br /><br />My Story:<br />Replaced air filter as regular scheduled maintenance of my 2001 VW Passat 2.8L V6.<br />Fitting was good, and it was easier to install with this filter compared to others, because this one is very flexible (my car did not have much room to work with).<br />After install, I had a test drive with it, immediately can feel my engine runs smoother and accelerate better!  A new clean filter is always awesome.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Price is good, quality is good, very convenient to have the part you need arrive at your door step.  Thank you Amazon!
B00P30XVQW|5|Great product at this price point.  I was getting these until I figured what type I wanted on my new truck.  After the simple install and sleak appearance the will be staying on for a while.
B0079JWMME|1|Unable to use product as it came damaged and empty
B005TIV2GY|5|WOW
B002J81Y74|5|I've used this product for years.  The surface is not greasy or slippery after application.  The amount of shine is determined by the number of coats applied.  As stated it is an &#34;Interior Dressing&#34; however I would like to see something for the exterior that stays on after getting wet and look as nice as this product does.
B0086I9XM4|5|It was not even in its box ! I got my other two items but not this one & it really upset me!
B0046C6EQM|4|I like it. a little bigger than I would like it to be.
B000LG24YI|4|Was easyish to install.  Could use better instructions.  But great overall.  Throaty when you get on it but still not obnoxiously loud.
B00MVR1R7K|5|Can take 10 min or more with file or grinder, this is less than a min,.
B000GZELF4|4|back to squealing tires!
B00K6BR0L0|4|Only complaint is that the bolts that came with it won't work on my Polaris factory winch.  The factory bolts are too big, so I drilled out the holes slightly.  Now the bolts fit, but the nuts are too tight to fit in the holes.  Nothing a little machining can't fix, but more work than I wanted.  It is a nice aluminum piece though.
B008KM81E2|5|Best project you can put on your car!
B00EL13ISA|5|Brighten up an RV fridge or range hood
B000TYTSH8|5|Fit perfect for my 01 Saturn.
B0089VAS7C|5|Nice kit
B0002MBKUU|4|good product
B00VTDRRX0|5|Good brackets,Five stars<br />Fit my 2003 Ram 1500 perfectly.I finished installation within one hour.So easy. Hahah.Recommend!
B00387A6TC|5|Awesome fit on my Craftsman 2 ton all aluminum racing floor jack.  Now I won't be abusing the underneath of my cars that I work on.  These jack pads are made of polyurethane and are very heavy duty.  You can easily pop them off if you don't want/need to use them.  I have two other Craftsman floor jacks that these pads DO NOT fit (3 ton and 3.5 ton regular floor jacks).
B00352H076|4|Product shipped as described. Instructions were perfect although I coupled them with a YouTube video just for a visual. The only difference I found was you can't just unscrew the bolts attaching the assembly. The assembly was riveted on at factory to the vehicle so I had to drill these out. Make sure you have some bolts and nuts with lock washers ready if your vehicle maybe riveted as well. Other than that it was smooth sailing and easy to do.<br /><br />Window works and I don't have to open my door to get my Starbucks anymore;)
B003DV78LM|5|user friendly
B00PV5DJRK|3|Seems good so far it's been a few months now
B00RH3AMIS|5|great prouct
