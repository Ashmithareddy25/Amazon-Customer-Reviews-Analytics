B00F53N6I0|3|This sweatshirt is very thin. I expected something more for the price. It also runs small. A 4T usually runs big on my 4 year old. I would have need to buy a 5T for it to fit through the fall/winter.
B009LNIMWK|2|This scarf is lovely but the quality control is awful...it arrived with a huge fuschia spot on it. I made that comment in an earlier review. I was dumbfounded when just a couple of days later, Crystal from Luxury Diva called me -- CALLED ME!!! -- to tell me that they wanted to make it good. She told me a replacement scarf would be in the mail the next day. She also told me that they would check the scarf before sending it out to ensure it was in perfect condition. I was pleased and amazed. Today, she called back, and I am a mix of satisfied and disappointed. Disappointed because Crystal told me that they had checked several scarves and all were damaged in some way and that they would no longer be using that vendor. I'm disappointed I won't get my scarf, but thrilled with this incredible customer service. In less than 4 hours, I had am email from Amazon telling me of the refund for my purchase. I was dead wrong on the quality of Luxury Diva before...they do have good quality control and outstanding customer service. i won't hesitat to buy from them again.
B004K22A2U|3|This wig looks exactly as pictured in the front, but has 2 very obvious black pins in back. if you remove them, the twisted bit loosens and falls. besides that, it is good quality, though a little golder then it looks in the picture.
B00E4QMQ44|5|This is our daughters 2nd pair, first one she accidentally got a hole in but she was so devastating I just had to biy her another pair. They look awesome.
B00DDCWA4G|5|So comfy and soft! Love it so much, I want to buy more in other colors/prints. It is one of my favorite shirts now!
B00FJ4UWWS|5|Fit was good. color was very pretty and bright. Was heavier than expected nice surprise. Will order again.
B0046EJMAK|3|Ripped 1st time wearing 😔
B007XVX8PI|3|I had to punch my own hole because it wasn't small enough, and other belts have fit me just fine with the same size.
B00B5UDV1E|5|I love these and would highly recommend. They are fantastic for<br />any kind of wear and a must for backless.
B00LHSMEN0|5|Great
B000WO8BFK|5|Great deal for the price!
B00IJ8XQRY|4|Thought it had more flair. The slip was not full enough in portion with the skirt.
B002GJ0IBE|2|Poorly stitched. Not quite as shown
B00IP86RBA|5|i ordered this for a very special person and gave it to her she loved the color and the size
B007699BEO|5|The mask is great. It's very warm, sheds snow fairly well, and fits great. Granted, I have a big head. My hat size is 7 3/8. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one as a gift. Also, it's nice and soft. I haven't tried washing it to see what the effects are on size, color, texture, etc. but I'm confident it will be fine, and perhaps even fit better.
B00BLXLLC6|5|I was sceptical about this bra, but read some of the reviews and they were right:  this is a fantastic bargain.  It's extremely comfortable and fits better than some more expensive bras.  I'm a triathlete (36C) and intend to buy many more of these.
B000HATYEG|5|LOved it. It look exactly like the picture. I will wear it with leggings  because it is too short, the  quality, the price and time of shipment was perfect.
B00WRKRMRA|3|Very cute and so I will keep even though I wish it were a little smaller. The band with small seashells is so appropriate for beach week vacation.
B001RFK9A8|4|Needed a simple belt for belt buckles and this is a great one at a great price.  Simple and straight forward.
B007WR7OLW|4|My elves love this costume and look pretty impressive with Santa. Unfortunately the socks are a bit short and don't always stay up so that their legs get exposed. I had to replace the socks with something better.
B00D1GI8FO|3|Nice and cozy but thought it would be longer based on the picture. It is not a long sweater at all
B00CZ2R220|5|I really love cowl necks and knitted fabric.  The color is beautiful and the material is very fine.  I am about to order more colors.  On me it is a little long, as I am petite, but the style allow it to be allowed to wrinkle at the waist.
B00HQYA6CK|4|Nice for the price i paid. Is not cotton its more polyester
B0073E5902|2|This costume fit very weird the top was baggy and the legs were tight I typically wear medium top and bottom. The picture is deceiving the gloves to not reach the end of the sleeves. The plastic part started to come detached from the fabric on the utility belt half way through the night. Disappointed :/
B0044NXXW6|4|Very comfortable and great look and feel  However, covers too much.
B00V6YMZQ6|3|I know its supposed to be workout wear but it's a little snug.
B0053O1KHA|1|I mean... of COURSE the company that I bought many of my textbooks from while I was working on my PhD should carry my graduation regalia too. It just makes sense. What, nothing in my school's colors? Ridiculous,
B000MND79Q|2|I have a 42&#34; waist but these are still too large.  Will be returning next week.  Nice quality, really like Russell brand, but these XL were too big and the style is different than what I usually wear.
B008ER7XII|3|It's a very nice hoodie, but the zipper broke. I know that sometimes happens and thought maybe it was a fluke. I bought my son 2 others and the zippers on those broke too... Think that may just be a problem with the design
B00D7IBX94|5|I was looking got something different to add to my collection. They arrived on time I immediately tried them on and to my amazement they fit perfectly. Very sexy very comfy.  I hand washed them,  let them air dry and tried them on again they did not shrink or lose color in cold water. Will definitely buy more of this brand in future.
B004GXA8RC|5|Very comforable and almost no bouce bra. Will probably buy another.
B00BKZZW7A|5|Fit perfectly. Very well made.
B0007KN8NY|5|My last key wallet (eight years old) was coming apart at the seams.  This new one has the usual slip socket rings for keys, with solid heavy-duty construction, plus a bonus split ring that is accessible without opening the wallet, for house and/or car keys.  The leather is thicker than on many such cases that I've seen.  I expect this one will last for a decade or more.
B00KT91V0A|5|It's a really nice coat but it's a little tight in the arms.
B00N4Q28WK|5|good product...highly recommend
B003P7IRQO|5|Nice small wallet for my smaller handbags. Good quality.
B00HZGOXV4|5|The dress came super fast, way earlier then expected delivery date. Awesome dress can't wait to wear it out. Just an fyi if you aren't busty order a size smaller than normal
B00WV6DHS8|5|When I ordered this shirt, I ordered the actual size my husband would wear - XL. But when it arrived, it was closer to a Medium/Large. I see that this has been changed in the title to allow for others to select the correct size. Luckily, it fits (a little big for now) my teenage son.<br /><br />Having said that, the shirt is wonderful. Beautiful fabric, good pockets and cool to wear. The salmon color is really nice. Soft and pinky-orange and just right for a sunny, summer day.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.
B00EQWV142|5|Love the fit and love the color...
B001SLDC50|5|great support and very comfortable
B008AQCKRW|3|I ordered a size small but it fitted as a size large
B00CFQ5LRO|5|Nice sweatshirt!
B00F9F4C5K|5|Fits great! I'm 5'9 and about 175 lbs. I have a booty. This skirt is thick, flattering & beautiful! Absolutely love it!
B00AJWO7AS|5|Nice shirt but large is like xl so get large if you wear xl
B00BRYEA1I|5|ER MA GERD where have these been all my life?  Absolutely the best thing that ever happened to my flats.  They are soft and warm and make flats more comfortable.  I'm so happy I don't have to stop and pull ped style socks back over my heel 50 times a day anymore.  I live in Northeast and these have been nice for fall cool weather and my always cold office.
B005QRCC6W|5|Great pullover fleece.  It isn't the heaviest material but it is definitely good for those cool fall days.  BE CAREFUL, sizes run large.  I am 6'3\\" 200lbs and I was a large in this, when usually I am an XL.
B00JVDL358|5|I love everything about Hudson Jeans. This pair feels great and the fit is awesome. This pair of Love Jeans has a lower rise (8.5&#34;) compared to the Love jeans I own in Vinyl (9&#34; rise). The rise is slightly higher in the back.  The signature Hudson Jean has flap pockets. These are a five pocket style, with flat, minimal pockets, my preference. The Glam has a very slimming, (not overly) faded effect.
B00UXSQZKS|4|Very nice. Belt was a little simple.
B00DQT84ZU|1|Fell apart after one wash
B004YLI10M|1|It doesn't work.
B00OYAKIQS|5|Loved them. Fit well and super comfortable.
B008M4LOK6|3|jeans are too hipster-like for me. not pleasant to wear. photos did not furnish me with sufficient information. sick of adding words
B0091CVVEW|5|excellent gift
B00MVK7316|4|Great purchase! Right on trend and fit exactly as expected. Great washed out color. Goes great with any color jeans or as a &#34;jacket&#34; for the day.
B00K19GB4O|4|They fit really well but are super hard to get back to crisp white, no matter how I wash them!
B00IGIPLI4|5|Nice eye glass case that fits all regular types of glasses. Also has a cleaning cloth with the character logo on it.
B00J2HA994|5|It came very quickly and fits exactly as I wanted.I'm pleased with my purchase and will order from them.I am a size 13 and decided to order a 38 since the other reviews said they run big it fits tight as it should.GREAT PRODUCT.
B006V4IUIS|5|Shirt true to size and looks better in person than on pic.  Bought it for a friend, so pleased to offer it as a gift.
B00CQ20HWQ|5|I bought this for my grandson. He indicated that he loves the fit even though it was a little big and longer than most of his polos. He has a slim build. The color is great looking. Recommend to anyone that likes Polo.
B000JHHEG2|5|I need the 28' inseam at 34' waist.  This was one (if not the only) option...the good news is that there is no sacrifice in quality.  Great jeans at a great price...highly recommend!
B00HQYR9B6|5|I live in this top whilst at home. It is oversized which is what I had hoped for: comfortable and lightweight. Throw in the wash and no iron.
B00HY59320|5|Love this dress!
B00STKBMTG|4|Really upset the case fall apart
B00DD5FMES|5|Wow.
B00KGSSXQ4|2|Material is super clingy, shirt sizing runs small.
B00GHQZSS0|5|My grandson loved these socks.  Part of his Christmas gift.
B00CW89D1U|1|gave it away to a child
B005Z2LTOO|5|Hubby loves them!
B00NGXOF6I|2|like the outfit a lot, but the fit is off.
B009QTIOAE|3|I have mixed feelings about this wallet.<br />The build quality is superb, and the change area really saved my life.<br />Seriously, I hate rattling change, so a dedicated pouch for some change (and my all-important flashdrive) is quite nice.<br />I rated it 3 stars simply because the sheer size. It is a large wallet.<br />I mean we are in George Costanza wallet territory here.<br />If you are the size of a mountain and don't mind dedicating an entire pocket to this wallet, it is great.<br />For me... I may soon look for a replacement.
B00EURI754|2|I think I should make one thing clear about these: they are short. I bought a few of these for my boyfriend who is middle-aged. From the image, I thought that they were relatively high-waist and that they would cover half of his thighs. I was very wrong - these look like something that he can go swimming in. And they do NOT stretch vertically. It would be great if the merchant could add a more accurate cover image, but they probably won't.
B0051U17GU|5|Got to love these when your toes are nice  and toasty when playing golf in 30 degree weather. They are very thick.
B0078U9UZ6|5|Excellent-love how it fits, easy to wash and dry!!!  Just have to remember not to throw it in the hospital dirty scrub bin-you never get it back!!!
B00CS4U8K8|5|Cute dress/cover up - fits true to size. I am a size 4/6 and it is perfect.
B00T4GXUZI|3|I got an XL which should be big on me and it was not.
B005R1SRKW|5|Like it
B00EE08SKQ|2|Looks cool but it's miserable trying to get a credit card in and out of it.  Do they have no idea how large cards are?  Cannot
B00CXXQ11O|5|I love this case it works perfect for my camera and has a clip that goes right on my belt when we are hiking or just our having family fun.
B00TPZJRGE|5|It seems to be the only Easter tie Garcia makes, so it's perfect.
B008ARIR0U|5|HOW DO I LIKE MY FLAT CAP? : I LOVE IT: THIS IS MY SECOND ONE THIS YEAR.  SOMEONE ELSE LIKED MY FIRST ONE.
B00JJ7IGJ2|5|Great socks - very nice cotton, not too high or too low on the ankle. Would definitely buy them again!
B00I1AJ7CS|5|Great bottom coverage, Well made, soft and comfortable.
B000CEO8MA|5|I ordered this Jeans from Amazon Global after I was frustrated with not finding any decent jeans here in Bangalore, India, that would fit me and still has a classic appeal to it.  I found about Amazon Global accidently and after noticing that customs/import duty is all taken care of by Amazon Global, I was pretty certain that if I ordered something, it will do show up at my door-step without the worry of being getting lost in customs.<br /><br />I received the item few days earlier than expected delivery date, and Jeans fits me perfectly.  I will surely shop more in future.
B006RJGQA6|4|This top was very comfortable to wear while pregnant. The side panels are so soft. The only problem I found with this product is I was unsure what size to order, and they appear to run on the large side, so it was too big for me.
B007US8O7G|4|A bit small but I it will do since I will not wear it all the time
B008VPQKQY|5|The cut is good & roomy; the legs are fairly loose & long to provide the comfort and full coverage that men need (preventing fallout).<br /><br />The fabric is light, breathable, silky & slightly stretchy.<br />The waistband is strong & wide so it does not slip down or roll over, yet it's soft & smooth next to your body.<br /><br />The fly is long enough to be usable (unlike some brands), but doesn't gap due to it's bonded construction (the 2 buttons are convenient, but not necessary).<br /><br />If there is one improvement that I'd make, it would be a longer rise and/or a gusseted panel for more room in the crotch. After all, boxers are intended for men who prefer hanging LOOSE.<br /><br />Altogether, these are great boxers, especially in warm weather.
B0051I6MYY|5|Great adjustable IH Hat. Granted, you must be an IH fan! Shipping was fast. Quality material. IH logo is slick and really stands out in a crowd.
B00NPC09OW|5|Christmas gift.
B0045MBYUE|4|The tag wraps over the waistband seam in the middle back and introduces itself. I am waiting for a few washes until it softens and fades away from  prominence. Otherwise my first synthetic under purchase and I am pleased.<br />PJ
B0046BML60|5|this is one of my best pruchases ever.  sooooo damn comfy.  it's enormous, but bigger is better.  buy it.  now!
B007725FJK|4|I got this costume for my Grandson. It fits well and he absolutely loves it. He wears it all the time to pretend hes a Power Ranger
B0012M0V8Q|5|I own many pairs of this bra because it is the absolute most comfortable bra and looks great under fitted clothes (no bra line or weird shaped boobs).  I am a 38D and this bra makes me look trimmer and somehow still perky, even though there is no padding.  I am going to stock up in case this bra is ever discontinued!
B00ENLMUVY|4|The quality is good. Cotton is thin and soft. The colors are much brighter than they look on photo. It is pink-pink.<br />The size S comes out to be good medium.
B00P88ILOG|2|Runs way too small, I wear a 2-4 and it still was small.  Looked liked childs size
B008YQHJRE|4|I just got this jacket, heres what I think considering the very reasonable price:<br /><br />- Fabric is good quality.<br />- Jacket is well designed.<br />- Shipment is quick.<br />- When it comes about the sizes be careful! I read the previous reviews on this item and all they were saying is that there were some areas of opportunities with the Size of this brand. So I took a look at BOUBLJU website and so I order size L, unfortunately it didnt fit me well. MY ADVICE is the following:<br /><br />If you are US size S, then ask for L<br />If you are US size M, then ask for XL<br />Im sorry if you are US size L :(<br /><br />I will absolutely order an XL one, I loved the jacket.<br /><br />Ciao ciao!
B00GODQ22W|4|Had to return the large for an extra-large but the sweater itself is beautiful and just what I was looking for.
B00GY4V3EI|3|Runs very small.
B000A3I3O2|5|We bought this for my father-in-law, and I was expecting the materials to be cheap or something to be sacrificed because of the lower price.<br /><br />We were surprised to find that, not only is the jacket of the quality of the $60 ones, but it has a wide area on the back for putting a sewn-on decal like my father-in-law wants.<br /><br />While it may not be sherpa lined like the more expensive denim jackets, I don't think that takes away from its practicality at all.
B00O8PWE4I|5|It fits me so well but i am aware of the fact that i have a big head, lol. I should tell that although it fits so good even then it fits just a TINY LITTLE BIT JUST TOO large but its just a matter of millimeters. but that's okay.
B001V8NUMA|5|The shirt fits great, even after washing. It seems like this is going to be a shirt I'll have for a long time. There have been no problems with the pockets if I keep a pen or my identity badge attached to them (this has been a problem for me with Van Heusen shirts where the pocket rips from the seams after a few wearings). The shirt looks good with a solid blue or yellow tie.<br /><br />Also - the no-iron promise is true. If you take the shirt out of the dryer immediately - just put it on a hanger and it is good to go with no ironing. The only shirt that looks better after washing/drying is a Stafford wrinkle-free.
B008BHK8HO|4|Material is very nice.  Looks great.<br />Ordered a small which was a little big but OK.<br />Made in Dominican Republic.
B00F36AROU|5|I have thin-average legs but the warmers fit me well, they are not tight but neither loose. I purchased mine in mauve color and is true to the picture. The yarn is also incredible good and soft.
B00PTDD0IC|5|This is the PERFECT size wallet!  The quality and design deserves a 5+ star rating.
B00M3GONHK|5|Arrived just as expected. Very nicely packed, got a small &#34;bonus gift&#34; in the pack. Very pleased with sender
B0002ZRUBA|5|Nice fit.  I like the way that they hold a wallet up high so that it isn't under your thigh while driving.  Can be fatiguing when you drive as much as I do.  They are somewhat longer and higher wasted than jeans of the same size, but should be good for keeping shirts tucked.
B00A34NDBG|4|I sew but for the price of these little guys, you just can't go wrong. They are very detailed and my 2 year old had fun identifying the animals by name and sounds. I had to wash mine, easily done by dumping and zipping into a mesh laundry bag, because they were stinking of sewing machine oil smell. But they were fine after they dried. I love these!
B005XONW76|3|Was somewhat small out of the box and then it shrunk even more, does not fit anymore
B006RJ3NH0|5|LOVE MY NEW HEAD DRESS !THANKS AGAIN !<br />IT WILL KEEP ME A WEE BIT WARMER UP IN THE HIGH DESERT OF CALIFORNIA ! GREAT PRICE, TOO!
B003YDHF9E|5|these sock are very good quality and have an excellent fit. i am going to buy more of them for my daughter
B000ULWQH4|5|works well
B000BRL0LU|5|Cute, durable, simple hat.
B00B2HLEBO|4|Love it.  Makes changing purses much easier.
B005P39GBG|3|Got me through one SantaCon in NYC.  Wouldn't expect it to get me through another one.  If you plan on getting something that will last years and years, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for one and you expect it to get trashed, this might be the suit for you.
B00E55D4KY|4|Great value for a one night stand<br />But the feathers were itchy and shed everywhere<br />But for the price they served the purpose
B000C6ZQDI|5|My husband has been butchering many deer this season and processing the meat into sausage, balogna, etc.  He usually comes in soaking wet from washing up his grinders and other equipment, so I looked for a waterproof apron for Christmas.  The only ones I found were long, heavy, rubber, so I decided to try this.  He loves it!  It's extremely lightweight, wipes clean, and is sufficiently water resistant for his needs.  Great product!
B007M67LZM|5|Enjoyed receiving it and enjoy wearing it. very colorful
B0077QGOSW|5|I am normally a size medium, but after reading other reviews and noting it was junior sizing I got an XL so it was a slightly loose fit. Perfect! I'm very happy with it.
B004QWP8HS|2|I've been searching trying to find patterned handkerchiefs with material thicker than a tissue and these looked like a good possibility.  They are a good size compared to what you will find at the typical box store but unfortunately the material weight is not much better, if better at all.  You can hold them up and easily see right through them.  A tissue is thicker.
B00A9HVENG|5|This became my favorite shirt in about three seconds.  Sizing shirts it painful, online or personally.  I purchased this as a large and it fit perfect, which is typically the opposite - So, I'd say large is about a loose medium.<br />I'm 6'1'' and semi-fit.  The upper torso is perfect and the lower is loose, but not baggy.  I'll probably order a second in this style, just to have it.  Out of all of the Super Buddha men's line, this may be the best.  I hope this clothing line progressing and prospers.
B00QUXMD1K|4|Fit just right. Like the look of it.
B00C8B1JF4|4|Good beard.
B008AHJ1PU|5|Great Price super good Quality!
B00K8LWPM2|5|Cut and reasonable price outfit!
B00A6YTNHQ|2|Most reviews suggested going a size or 2 up because these leggings ran small. So, I went up a size. Mine arrived and were huge! Definitely disappointed. The color was great, but the fabric was very thin. They were a cheap but though, so I was taking a gamble.
B00HYWZX54|5|My son loves them!
B007T6U2T2|3|I like it, it is cute but it already is showing wear and I have not had it long. But I did not pay much for it either and just wanted to try out having a skirt. I like it.
B00H8VBQE8|5|It fits perfect! The quality of the fabric is great for the price. I am pleasantly surprised. I love it!!!
B0002TOZ1Y|4|The socks are a little big straight out of the package. Since they are 100% cotton, I expect them to shrink down a little to be a good fit. Gold Toe quality is always the best.
B003TLS7PW|5|Like all Mountain t-shirts, excellent quality; sizing as expected; longer than most t-shirts; looks really good. Color and graphic very good.
B009NN7TFE|1|Runs small
B009SDACO4|5|My boyfriend loved it.<br />It is 50% cotton and 50% polyester.
B001MXGRVU|4|Too big for me
B00IFGFEHK|5|This is the second one of these we've boughten for our son. They're great coats, nice weight of fleece, built sturdy, couldn't be happier with them. And its Camo, and John Deere, so win-win :)
B003TU1I8Q|5|This dress is fantastic. Shipping was very good. I ordered my a size medium (I am a 34D and size 9 jean and the fit is perfect) and it arrived in 5 days (which is pretty fast coming from CA to the east coast). This costume is very flattering, especially if you have a little bit of a belly. There is a lot of material in the chest region, but this can easily be altered by adjusting the halter ties around the neck. The elastic around the waist is a little tight which may make love-handles stick out a little more than what would ideally be desirable, but the back is SUPER SEXY which definitely makes up for it. I am 5'2\\" and the dress covers my toes (but if I'm wearing sandals it doesn't drag on the ground). The arm band is a little cheesy and is a bit tight (unless you have sticks for arms). The other reviews are correct in that the fabric feels thick and warm for a cold night. If you decide not to wear a bra with this costume (I recommend not wearing one), the fabric is thick enough to hide your nips! Which can be a plus or minus depending on how you look at it ;) I definitively think this costume is better suited for a voluptuous woman rather than a thinner girl.
B007W0XT36|2|Please get the Leggs Profile hi-waisted shaper back.
B00LKCAFIY|5|I went to several stores to look for suits for my toddler twins, then I searched here. They were exactly what I wanted. The fact that it is a 3 piece suit with shirt and tie made things easy. My 3 yr old twins are about 12 months apart in size so I ordered the 2T and 3T - they fit both boys perfectly.
B002TPYBZE|5|The perfect lab coat! Fits great the3/4 sleeves are perfect for bedside care giving. The item was shipped very quickly. Will buy another of the same soon!
B004ZWVPG2|4|This corset is beautiful and sexy. I was amazed at the quality considering the price. And the stockings weren't too tight and didn't roll. My only issue was the fit for on the thong. It is HUGE. I got a 1x/2x and it practically fell off. But honestly, it doesn't matter. The corset and stockings were more than worth the price.
B002P9NAY2|4|fits good
B00KJIVDW2|2|purchased it 2 sizes larger and it still didn't fit
B00I450PA8|5|thank
B00PO7MFKM|2|I probably won't wear it very much. The style wasn't what I expected. I should have ordered the next size smaller. Can exchange it?
B00F4WKS7Y|4|Unfortunately my girfriend said that it does not fit perfect, a little bit large at waist. Amazon need to add measures of Waist, Hips,<br />Inseam etc...
B00KWZ2IOY|2|I don't like the back because the bottoms look like grandma panties.
B00J3QGBR8|2|These &#34;gloves&#34; are all fabric. Super thin fabric, even the metal parts are just silk screened fabric. Also, they appear to be made for a child's hands. Especially ridiculous if your using a metallic arm or anything other than a t-shirt as a costume. Lastly, the outfit requires the right hand glove to be fingerless and cutting these would unravel the whole thing.
B00BLV7VJ0|5|It fits fine. Good quality and printed.
B000RUJJAU|5|Just to let people know, the paste stuff smells HORRIBLE and makes me a bit nauseous, but once you get it done and clean up the teeth, they look real.
B009T5EXGY|3|This bra looked very cute, and the cobalt blue was vivid, but it didn't fit me at all. It seemed to have too much fabric at the sides, while the front was too small.
B001TEBT4M|4|He loves it!
B00061NIRU|5|Exactly as expected.
B007P6YYRM|5|These are the jeans I wear to dress up.  I'm probably sized between a 4 and a 6 so I chose the 6.  Its a great color and goes with everything.
B00BZQ7ZNS|3|Kind of disappointed. I wouldn't call it extreme slim fit at all. It fits decent, but I would've expected a bit slimmer. Also, the fabric wrinkles a LOT. Excessively, actually. It wrinkles more than any other shirt I own. A pain to iron. Fabric is extremely thin too. I wouldn't have paid this price had I known these things, but couldn't be bothered to return it.
B00C80LAZ4|5|good jeans and the best price
B00NHLD3XA|5|nice
B00BBW6PZK|5|Very comfortable.
B00K9AMJ8W|5|Love it!!!
B00D1R84ZC|3|Fits as expected now just have to see if it really works as time goes by for waist training. It gives you a nice hour glass shape while wearing it and it's uncomfortable at first but I guess you have to break it in... So far good price and fast delivery.
B007YVYOJ6|5|Love this comfortable, lightweight skirt.  Wear it frequently.
B00D3MZ8WW|5|Red Engine is a great quality jean. This style is a beautiful dark striped denim with nicely tailored details. However, I did return for a smaller size. I have found that this year the Red Engine Cayenne skinny jean is running a size larger than previous years. Don't know why but I have had to size down twice now in this style jean. I am 5'5\\", 128# and usually wear a 28. Other than the sizing issue, I highly recommend this jean.
B00NKYLZV6|3|a little to large
B008KATCO2|5|Outstanding Product!  Just what I needed for the holidays!
B005L3KI3U|3|They're good looking, certainly warm enough to do the work of a good pair of gloves, but the stitch work is shoddy, and I feel as if I expanded my hands in them the material would tear. I'm happy with them, but mostly because the price is low. I worry that in two weeks when the Velcro patch has come off, and the palm pad has peeled loose, and I'm shopping a new pair, I may not feel the same way. I'm taking them to a tailor to see if I can get it reinforced, which may be an extra 5-10 bucks, but may be worth it.
B006G38WUK|5|I ordered 2 of these altogether. I absolutely love this scarf! It's warm and not too chunky, being a short woman, a big huge chunky scarf can look silly! But this one is perfect!
B004XAT3OW|5|I purchased this shirt for use in my photography business.  I wasn't very pleased with the options through my screen printer, so I ordered this shirt in hopes that it would be a better fit and higher quality than the generic options.  I have been very pleased with the shirt.  After receiving it back from the embroidery shop, I've worn it around 20 times.  It fits exactly as I expect an XL to fit, and isn't excessively wide fitting like so many other shirts.  Sleeves are about an inch longer than most other generic shirts I've ordered from other manufacturers, which is fine with me.  I'm 6'6\\" and around 230 pounds.  The shirt fits my form well without binding anywhere.  The quality of the cotton weave is high, IMO.  The shirt is soft enough without being too soft or flimsy like an American Apparel kind of weave.  For the price, I doubt you'll find a better purchase for this type of item.  For some people, the embroidered Columbia logo on the left chest might not be desirable.  However, I found it to be a very nice balance for my corporate logo on the right chest.  The Columbia logo is approx. 2-3\\" wide, if that matters to you.  Hope this helps you make an informed buying decision!
B0018Z4F3O|1|Terrible quality, got tangled and ended up not wearing it. For the price, I got what I paid for essentially so I really can't complain.
B00HFXP7J4|1|These are not knee high socks and should not be advertised as so. These are cheap sock with no cushion that barely go past the ankle.
B003IHWPVO|5|I am thrilled with these camisoles with a built-in underwire bra.  I have looked for so long for a cami to wear that did not show the extra bra strap.  The built-in bra with a foam style padding took a little while to get used to, but, I was so pleased with the comfort and look that I went ahead and bought some in all colors available.  The length on the top is perfect to wear under another top or by itself.  I have worn the colored ones alone and received so many compliments.  A big bonus I found with the way the foam padding is designed, I can lean over without everyone being able to see the girls.  The foam fits to the body and the material for the top and skirt comes down over it creating a flattering line.  I have some in the DD and some in the E.  I like the E better overall...the straps are a little wider, the material seems softer, and the skirt fits a little looser for wearing alone.
B005GYGEWS|5|I was very hesitant to buy these because I've never actually worked out before so i wasn't really sure i even knew what i needed. However, i took the leap and am pleased to say these capris have not disappointed. They are sufficiently stretchy without being overbearingly tight. They are of a nice thing breathy material and are comfortable for my light to medium cardio workouts. So comfortable, in fact, that part of me wants to buy more so i can sleep in them!!
B00F2H1B0E|1|If you are in the United States be sure to order your size 3×bigger I wear small so next time I'll order an extra large so they'll fit. Over all the material was excellent
B003IBT9KK|5|Fits good and arrived days before it was expected!
B00H4UM84A|5|Beautiful Color and Great Fit.  I am coordinating a May Wedding for a friend and needed a dress that was not my usual &#34;black dress&#34;.  This dress is perfect.  I ordered the eight because I am busty. I would order one size larger if you are built the way I am. Oh and I love the color.
B00DVKNIFU|5|The fabric is soft and warm, just what I was hoping for.  The Kids love the graphics. very bright and colorful.  They are Mickey Mouse fanatics right now so these were a big hit.
B00123BHPQ|4|I thought I was buying a silver necklace but this is actually just metal, not sterling. Still, it's not a problem because it's clearly solid and well made and will not rust. The hearts are beautiful, the rhine stones shiny and well embedded. I bought this for my teenage niece's birthday and she loved it. It comes in a nice box with the seller's card and descriptive tag, so it really looks special. The chain could be a bit longer is the only reservation I have, and truly hope it will not rust...
B00LB7KGGE|4|Nice dress a bit darker then i expected .
B002N3AMCS|5|Great for Halloween, springtime festivals or your local Spelling Bee and is a great costume for the money.  Good value.
B002NGLJAO|2|I ordered infant size for my 24 monthes son as amazon size chart says infant size is for 18-24 months<br />however actual package says infant size is for  6 to 18 months<br /><br />And It was unfortunately too small for my son
B002YBCLY6|4|Fun w/complements.
B00ALR3QBM|5|I am in love with this top.  I wish it would come in white or cream color.  The back of this top is just wonderful and I do not have anything like it.  I will be buying this brand as often ask I can.  Its worth every penny.
B000HTIMRM|4|Back pockets too large. Weird. Worn Levi's for 60 years and never has that happen.
B002OCBAYW|2|My husband wasn't happy with the ribbons that have to be tied to keep the mask on; he thought it would come with an elastic band (which would have made sense). The mask itself was substantially made, although where it was cut out was white and powdery (around the edges and eyes). I just took a permanent black Sharpie to it and you would never know. It worked out fine.
B00E3DWLMU|5|Like it and fit as expected!
B00COPSYRU|2|They do not fit perfectly! I bought a large (size 12) which is my normal size and the are too tight. I've read the reviews stating they were too high, NOT! They are low rise! which I do not like. They would be good if  you were a teenager, or very tiny. They need more material in the waist to allow for full hips. The material is very soft and stretchy, which is what i like. Now I'm not a big woman, but I like pants that fit to the waist, not low rise. which is hard to find, everything I looked at so far is low rise. I don't recommend these if you are like me and don't like low rise pants.
B00BEFNTMG|4|Good socks
B00TQLYU32|5|The shirt was all I wanted. Fit was great and service was as well. Again happy with amazon Prime purchase.
B0071PBJJS|5|This is all I wear, yoga pants in whatever colors I can find. Nice, light weight and comfortable. want more color choices.
B00NMKPDZC|5|This is a very nice quality dress.  The lace was in great condition with no snags.  The dress is very comfortable.  The one thing I would say is that the picture is a little misleading as it looks like there is sequins down the side that follow the lace.  There is no sequence but it still looks and wears great!  Very pleased all around with this purchase.  Came only 4 days after I ordered it!
B001GSAZDW|5|This is another very kickass shirt from Liquid Blue. The image quality is great and stands out very well. It's a very fierce and scary-looking shirt of a very large and angry red dragon breaking out of the chains that bind him to the Earth! An awesome shirt for fantasy lovers!
B00FXXYK9Q|5|I gave this to my girl friend as one of her Christmas presents and she really loves it.  Thank you !!
B00BO0SLC4|4|Is a dress very nice for a girl the  fabric is fresh and line simple is very beautiful. thank you
B00K6KGB2U|4|We love it!
B00IO64K8U|5|Love love LOVE!!! Comfy, true to size, pockets, perfect length!!! Wanna buy more, just let's see some cool patterns to choose from!
B004IZVE6W|4|Although I do love my oversized sweatshirts, this one may be a wee bit too big. I still wear it all the time though! Because it is your average sweatshirt, it pilled within the third of fourth day of wearing it. When I first got it, the inside was extremely soft. It's thick, good quality, and I have had no issues with the stitches coming loose. Would recommend! Just make sure you know the right size to get.
B001AKUHGG|1|What you pay for at a cheaper price definitely becomes evident once you receive these scrubs. The quality and fabric of the scrubs was rough, shiny, and different from the color I had chosen online. While the blend is 65/35 Polyester/Cotton, it sure doesn't feel like it compare to some other scrubs I purchased.<br /><br />Additionally, the sizing was WAY TOO LARGE! I already ordered a size down from my actual based on previous reviews, but it seems I should have went down two sizes cause it was still large and awkwardly fitting. Same with the top, which was on the longer side too.<br /><br />Lesson learned: pay some extra money but get good quality, better fitted scrubs!
B00BJOEQ7O|5|I bought a set of these about a month or two ago.  I absolutely love the way they feel.  Of course, I order larger than needed because I like that loose feeling.
B00NXL4WX4|5|Nice fit!
B00GKV4QMG|5|This is very comfortable!!! It's perfect material for sleeping in! Soft, stretchy, and a little loose with short sleeves.  It's perfect! I love it!!!!
B00GHLMRAW|4|I chose a 4 star rating because it's a nice scarf a little thin . Long...my only complaint really is that it took forever to get it, it seemed like. It does come from Hong Kong though so I expected it to take a while. Packaging was appropriate and over all I am satisfied.
B007VN0FAO|5|Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it
B00G2KM3HK|5|I adore these! The fit and quality of the material are both outstanding. Though the length is a little short on me, about an 2 inches shorter than I'd ideally like, they are still currently my favorite yoga pants.
B00BXIP29C|5|This top is fantastic! Fits very well, true to size and figure flattering. It has become a wardrobe staple now.
B00KRC30QC|5|my girlfriend loved it
B00FBM1TW0|5|Love these pants.  Fit great.
B007XD4TGI|4|Cute shirt, it looks like the picture but it hits at the waist. It is not a tunic like shirt
B00CHC2LRO|4|This belt looks great and the cost was not bad.  My only knock is that that actual belt holes seemed to be off a bit.  I have another belt the same size that I notch on the third hole but this one I have to notch on the first hole because of excess strap.  Still, it's a nice belt and I do recommend it for big and tall guys.
B000V0EPKA|4|I am thus far please with the overall fit/style of the scrub set, though the pants could be just slightly looser and the top could be an inch smaller all around. I am an XS and I ordered an XS, but the top fit more like a SMALL.  pants were XS,  Fast shipping, great product for price paid! Mahalo and Aloha from Hawaii!
B00EAVI9Z8|5|fits just right and very sexy
B006PC3LXK|4|I ordered these pants in a size 12 & they were soso big. Should of ordered a 10, maybe a 8. They were Very Nice Pants. Thick, & very good made. What a disapointment, should of returned them for a exchanged, but didn't.(seemed too complicated & I don't have a printer)
B00HDA2QHK|4|Cute and little girl sleeps easy in it.
B00EIQWQ6I|5|I am 5'10, 190 pounds, muscular build. I also have broad shoulders. Cup size 38 C.<br /><br />The Material:<br />With all that being said, I bought the suit based on the reviews of others. When I received it (3 days earlier that expected, so that was a bonus!), I absolutely loved the material. It wasn't some flimsy material you'll find at Wal-Mart, though, it wasn't Michael Kors either. All in all I thought it worth it.<br /><br />The Fit:<br />I am tall, broad and curvy. The suit most likely fits a shorter torso frame like a glove, HOWEVER, it still fits me in a way that I am okay with --&#62; Very &#34;boob-alicious&#34;, so if you're not the kind of girl that is comfortable with a little skin, do not buy it! Also, the white belt is attached very nicely, and comes up and under my chest and around my back perfectly! I have a waist, so the cut-out sides look great! Also for the taller people: the halter doesn't cut into the neck.<br /><br />The Print:<br />The pattern is wonderful. I think it is very modern and hides any imperfections you may have.
B00M0HXDM8|5|washes good, my kid had a #2 accident at daycare and it did not stain inside.
B0047ZW9OO|5|gave it as a gift to my girlfriend. she loved it. she's about 5'7&#34; and the large size fit perfectly in length. went about halfway down her upper leg
B005N2VYIM|5|i really like it its not too shiny and its perfect for what i need it its a bit think but if you place it right it should look okay
B00N1S8EDS|4|Got it as a gift for my little brother and he loved it
B00QEUL7ZW|2|This dress looks better in the picture and did not fit the way I expected.
B008NHSU5E|5|I bought this dress for my senior prom. It fits great and is extremely flattering. I got it in black and the beading looks very cool with the color. I highly recommend it.
B008LY4IT6|5|Great quality, great fit, affordable price and stylish! WonderWink is my absolute favorite brand!!
B00IUHGCLG|5|Very cute does not look exactly like the picture but this beautiful
B0000ZFG4A|2|They were made well but very different color than what I expected. I ordered a black top lace and sheer bottom and I got all black
B00B2ZPKW0|2|hello, i have problem whit this tshirt.. its too small, not its XXL NORMAL.. like at L or XL.. thanks
B0029F1WYW|3|Prompt shipping. Mask is good for what I need it for.
B00LPWM3MK|1|Don't buy this!!! I ordered this and it's way too big. I then went to return it and the shipping cost was $10.  I guess I'll just try to resell it on my own.  I'm very dissatisfied
B004U9EB6G|5|I must admit my new obsession is baby leg warmers. After searching on multiple websites I see that Amazon has the best deals for baby leg warmers. My daughter is 7 months old and 15 lbs. I was concerned that they would be too big and slide off her little legs but they fit perfectly. They are nice and snug but not too tight on her thigh. The colors are bright and bold and so pretty. Even though they have the days of the week on them I let her wear them whenever. She has plenty length in them so I know she will be able to wear these for a while. 5 pair of leg warmers for under $20 is definetly a steal.
B006AA5F86|5|Bought this as a birthday gift. The set seems well made and true to the pictures.
B00N11IHPU|5|Love this dress!
B0052G1JKC|2|Really cute... but totally see-through, even with a slip it looks a little trashy.  Its really only for the bedroom.  Beautiful Yellow though... I had high hopes for this garmet but wont be wearing it anytime soon
B00K434QEO|5|Lots of card slots, separate slots for cash and receipts. Seems to be well made and good quality leather. And of course, it's RFID. I keep my every day wallets for 3 to 4 years. I expect this one to last as long as the best
B00DW8833S|5|love them. the rims have wire in them so you can shape them. So worth the money.
B00GSD84Q0|5|I like how this jacket doesn't feel heavy but still keeps me warm. It is more of a metallic black color and made with down feathers. It is washable, but I would wash it on delicate cycle and air dry or dry on low or cool. Very nice fit. Very feminine and stylish.
B00H3IH1GI|4|loved the shirt it was a little small/tight but still good
B00M1AY6PC|5|love Lee Comfort Fit!
B00PDEPYIG|2|Quality was good but I didn't know a size 5 equals to 27 in waist??? In that case I need a size 8 😳
B00M8JZ2KO|5|I got this same dress in 2 different colors; it really fit my body well. It's a fabulous price and very beautiful fabric and I would never find this here in a local clothing store. Although I'm in Hawaii, on the Big island there are really hardly any nearby places that would carry something this cute at such a low price. If they did, they would always be &#34;out&#34; of my size. I am thrilled to be able to buy summer clothing year round from Sakkas and Amazon.com.<br />Ladies, please remember to buy ONLY using the &#34;smile.amazon.com&#34; so that we can help our Wounded Warriors Project! It's really important.
B0094ML9G4|5|This was too adorable.  I read reviews saying it ran small so I got a medium (I'm a 5'3 woman) just to be safe.  I don't think these shirts run small - they fit similarly to other men's (or unisex) shirts than I own.  The shirt was a hit - everyone loved it :-)
B00HO0ANWO|5|LOVE THESE SOCKS!! THANK YOU AMAZON
B001RFI30Q|3|I ordered a size 33&#34;-35&#34; and I got a 31&#34;-33&#34; other than that it's a good belt. Still dissappointing though.
B000EPP5AQ|4|It rides up in the back a bit, but it's comfortable and is a great help for support while being active
B00QH3T3DY|5|This has become my go to jeans belt.  It's perfect if you're in between belt sizes or just need that occasional extra room for holiday meals without letting out a full belt notch.
B004ARPYK0|4|My kid is a super grover fan so he was pumped to try these out. they're a little tight and my kid is a 50 percentile tyke, so keep that in mind when you order them.<br /><br />He insists on wearing them and this is good because we are learning to use the potty.
B0088MOEF4|5|Seemed a liitle tight for Relaxed fit
B00PX8YVL8|5|Came quick and fits great!
B003TP49SM|5|Excelente
B00KI16L0O|4|Great fit!
B00GMK979M|5|I'm not a fan of polos, but I play in a band where our uniform is black pants and a white polo, so I had to get one.  This one is comfortable and stayed dry during hot weather.  If I liked polo shirts, I'd buy this again.
B008BBS1ZG|5|Great for working out!  Supports my muscles and it easily wicks(sp?) off sweat.  High quality.  Under Armour never fails me.
B0055GFVV2|5|MUCH larger then I originally thought, made of heavy and sturdy material. Glad we made this purchase! Would recommend it
B0017UHCEY|1|This cap was too tight and very uncomfortable To wear underneath my wig.
B002M9WY5G|2|This is one of the oddest-fitting items I have ever purchased for my home embroidery business. It is almost like a t-shirt that had snaps added at the bottom, giving it an odd, short, square shape. I know babies are compact and pudgy, but this is really like a bizarre caricature of what a romper should be shaped like. Luckily I purchased this for my own kid, so I used it and it was fine. I would not purchase this for a customer.
B002RRYU1E|1|I am a full figured female with large breasts. This bra does not support me at all! It is entirely too slinky and stretchy, and just does not offer any support. I gave this thing 1 star, because I kinda had to, and because I have found use for the bra. I use it as an undershirt thing when I have on a low cut top. No one knows that my black \\"undershirt\\" is actually a bra.
B00MK451WG|5|good product.
B00L4FWRQK|5|bello
B005Y1FKF0|5|Ordered these for my 4 year old  in a 13. He is curently a size 12 and these are an inch too big so they are perfect!!!
B005L3E4GW|2|The fabric felt beautiful, soft and plush to the touch.  Everything was lovely except when I tried it on it was too constricting, I could barely lift my arms up without it tugging up on the bottom.  It was too short-waisted so I'm sending it back. I recommend ordering a size up, especially if you're on the tall side.
B00I3D5U7Y|4|my son was so happy when he received this back pack.
B00K34KMYW|5|I love this cami! The quality was wonderful and the shelf bra was really helpful as I am not a big fan of wearing a shirt that shows bra straps.
B00UZEIQWA|5|Great QUALITY/PRICE ratio, stylish dress socks, what more do you want ?
B00N5PN8YM|4|Will be testing for warmth in Chicago over Holiday.  Fits as expected. Looks ok, pretty non-descript.  Really wanted one with more colors, but for the deal of the day, I got a bargain price.  I will re-rate if it holds up to Chicago weather!!
B00PABH1SS|4|It's a nice poloshirt for summer.
B00FYKWO8C|3|I haven't worn them yet, but after trying them on they will do the job.  Not the most flattering, but comfortable and cute. I think they are priced too high - for $29.99 I would have gotten a few pairs, but $60+ is too much for this item.
B0040JGU1U|5|I have never mail ordered a suit (jacket and pants) before but couldn't beat the price. The jacket and pants are made very well!    Shipment only took 2 days for standard shipping.
B009JKFWUA|3|Jacket is nice, the only thing was that it took forever to receive it.
B00LZ7PKH0|3|Gorgeous dress, just didn't fit me.
B005T4606A|4|For 5 bucks all I care is if these mitts live past one Chicago season.  I'm not winter trolling around town or making snow angels, so buying the warmest mitts is out of scope for this purchase.  50% thru winter and holding up just fine.  I wouldn't drive with these as they do not provide the best grip on the wheel.  However, the thumb opening is a big help when flipping through fins for the valet or texting on the metro.
B008C3XLZ8|5|These boardshorts are super cute. A great fit and with all of the different color of polka dots, they go with just about anything!
B00AU52XT6|5|This is the best yoga top. It fits well and stays in place during yoga practice.
B00PJ1CD8M|5|Bought three of these for my granddaughters. They all love the dress.
B00HFGNXQA|5|Really nice
B005W0LVBA|5|Love it. It's the perfect bra:) I did my research before buying these. They are the perfect fit!
B00K8GCQAI|4|Very pretty.  Looks the same as picture.  Great price.
B0016KKNU0|5|These shorts are very comfortable, good looking, and the side pocket comfortably fits a giant phone like the nexus 6, with a protective case installed. I am 6'2&#34; tall and the size 34 fit great and I love the length, though some may find them too short.<br /><br />For comparison I also bought the Carhartt Twill cell phone work shorts which are: less comfortable, less breathable, longer (not a bad thing), do not fit the nexus 6 with or without a protective case (it's huge. my previous phone, the LG volt, fit fine).
B00MXUA848|5|So cute on my growing 11 year old, I think I might buy one! Looks flattering on any figure I would think.
B00MH6CCCY|5|Hysterical
B00MMOVIXA|4|Fits my seven yearold grandson. He loves it
B000V9MFJ4|5|Good
B00COQBGJC|3|&#34;Granny panties&#34; style, but still kind of cute !:)
B00DRU0KOG|3|meh. wish it wasnt so baggy but i like the bra shows on the side. i added a photo but you really cant see the tank bc i puled it up since its so long and baggy it is unflattering in photos lol @panzafit
B002G9UD2S|5|I have always thought that Carhartt products were excellent which is why I ordered this shirt. It is long enough so I can tuck it in my pants and it will stay. Very good quality and heavy duty. I have purchased many Carhartt products and they don't seem to shrink much if at all. I expect this shirt to be the same since I have washed it twice already and there has been no shrinkage. I think I may purchase another.
B00574M4SK|2|I won't be buying these again.  They look nice, fit well, and are comfortable but last only a few months.  Not worth the money.
B00JSJ4GDG|5|These shirts are SO classy. Love them on my hot husband. :) -the wife
B00ODD53O8|4|This Womens Casual Jersey Knit Open Collar 3/4 Kimono Sleeve Drape Cardigan by Hot from Hollywood is a nice, light Cardigan. I ordered the Large for my daughter who wears a large and I have to say, it runs quite big. She felt like she was swimming in it and it was larger than she likes. I tried it on (I'm a 2X) and it fit me and even had some room to spare. If you order this, I would definitely go down a size or 2 depending how much room you like.<br /><br />Material is very thin which is fine. Perfect to wear a light top or camisole under it. The sleeves drape down and are very flowy. Material is 97% Rayon and 3% Spandex. The stitching is done well and I didn't notice any loose threads at all. They suggest to hand wash but I washed in my delicate bag and line dried and it came out just fine. did not shrink and there was no color fading. Definitely a cute cardigan but again, it runs big.<br />**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.
B007NLX5KG|5|I love this dress!  The fit, the feel, and the look.  Great for any social occassion, the accessories make the transition.  So glad I ordered in 2 colors.
B006PTTEBQ|5|While I wouldn't try to wear this during the dead of winter (January and February are rough here in western PA), it seems near ideal for spring (rainy), summer (sweltering whether raining or sunny) and fall (rain again).
B00HSNIY5U|5|Lovely hat.
B00D8CUTQ2|3|The flip open design is cumbersome and the case itself is too thick and heavy.  It's well-made, but it does not fit my purpose very well at all.  If you need to minimize bulk in your pocket and/or bag this IS NOT the item to purchase.
B005GYGF54|5|These are comfortable cotton blend pants.  If you are looking for something with spandex to help hold your figure, these are not for you.  They show every curve.  They are not tight and don't cling to you.  They are 57/37% cotton/polyester and only 6% spandex.  They work well for my needs - working out and dance class.
B00FEH3AGU|5|I used the sizing chart to pick the size I believed would fit. Dont just use your normal jean size use the chart and you'll be fine. I love these pants and they seem to be quality made at a great price.
B004RNZA7O|4|Got this dress home &was surprised how cute the dress was. Great color & amazing price. Dress is really long & I am 6 ft tall.
B00DNSSGA2|5|Came to my APO very quick and fit perfectly! Soft and comfy
B00E1S29YM|1|When you look at the thumbnail is a music note (vinal scratch) but the main picture is the butterfly (flutter shy) and the discription says flutter shy BUT sure enough it came as the music note :( my daughter was upset Becuase she needs it for a costume
B00L9GH4E4|3|It is adorable.
B008T43NJ4|5|My husband comments on how much he likes it every time he puts it on. I would recommend it to anyone. Good quality, nicely made
B00IA8KMG6|5|Quality top that washes and wears well
B005X1W7IY|2|Be very careful when you place your order!  I also thought I was getting a three pack as advertised!  Depending on the color that you select, it can change from a package of 3 to a single item, even though they specifically advertise a package of 3 on the description. Very misleading!!  The ones I purchased were sold by HerRoom.  I gave it 2 stars because the panties are great, but you just need to be very careful when ordering because you might not be getting a three pack.  When you choose the color you want, in SMALL writing next to 'color' make sure it says three pack.  If it does not specify three pack, then it's only one.  I found that out the expensive way after ordering what I thought were three packages of three.  Like I said, the panties are awesome (they fit and feel great)!!  Just be careful who you order them from...
B004CJPC12|4|I needed a lightweight spa type robe to use around the pool and hotel. This is good quality and not too bulky for packing. The small is large on me,but I am very petite. The white fabric is thin, so don't go nude under this in public. It will suit my needs though.
B008H865JM|5|GREAT PRICE AND ITS A CUTE TOP GOES WITH PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING SO THANKS ON MAKING SOMETHING WORTH BUYING OK
B0001DYW8W|2|The delivery and the packaging of this item was fine. However, the item in no way could be described as plus sized. It would probably fit a medium sized woman (10-12) comfortably at MOST. Don't waste your money if you think this will fit you and you are anything sized 14 or above. I wish I had heeded the other reviews that complained about the plus sizing to be incorrect. They were right! Also, the quality of the stocking is only so/so. After I put one on and took it off carefully, there is a noticeable pull down the side. For less than $10, they're not worth returning and I can't exchange them, since obviously this store doesn't carry true plus sizes.
B00DN11OPS|5|I ordered this for a friend as a Christmas gift. She works for a cat rescue group and I know she will love it.
B000TJNDD8|1|cheaply made
B00LP6YHM0|4|I really like these sweatpants because they are very comfortable and warm. Very good quality.<br />My only complaint is they run about a size smaller than they are labeled!
B00JKSNGOK|5|I rated 5 stars because I read the reviews prior to ordering. This dress runs small so I ordered 2 sizes larger. It fits nice with a little room under the arms which is fine since I purchased it as a cover up for the beach. I highly recommend not purchasing as a dress because you will be disappointed. It is very thin but serves the purpose for me. Shipping was great and didn't take long.
B00JEYZTHC|3|I love the pattern and style of this dress. The zipper detailing and ruching on the side are really flattering!! Unfortunately, it's slightly too large - not large enough to go down a size, but too large to look right. I may have to get it tailored so that it fits properly.
B005QIPZTM|3|The vest fit well at the shoulders, but I have a 36 inch waste and the vest is designed for someone much larger.  I would guess it would fit someone with a 42 inch waste.  My wife was able to stitch up the sides to make it fit well.  It does look nice.
B00CM3IP1E|3|I rated this 3 star because it runs rather large. I am a size 6 and bought size 6 but it is not as figure hugging as I had thought. I suppose I'd fit better in a size 2. The colors are nice overall.
B00EPEIKHC|4|If the girls like it, so do I.
B002CLI7PU|4|Good stocking but run very easy.
B00GS18WMI|5|Love it
B00KFJZC5O|4|Was expected to arrive in 45 days, actually came in 3. when it arrived the jacket fits Great, and is super duper soft and feels pretty dang classy. I got the jacket in white and I'm pretty friggin stoked super casual comfortable .
B001G3QMSE|2|My son wears a size 10-12. It was the perfect length but too narrow. Doesn't work with regular belt buckles. Really disappointed.
B00IN4O2HC|5|I got the 4X, because I wanted to have a little extra room. It fits like a 2X/3X and is long enough. I'm 6'1&#34; and it hit me a few inches above the ankle, and the sleeves go down past my wrists. It is Satin, so as expected it is a bit slippery and thin(It does say 'lightweight'), it's going to be a wonderful summer robe. It isn't going to stay shut very well on it's own. Personally, I added a couple little ties inside, one on the right inseam, and then a small one on the left lapel, so I could tie it underneath. Works perfectly!
B0027NIU8W|5|This shirt is looks good on and is very comfortable.  No shrinkage with washing.
B00TT78FZW|1|Not sure I would buy it again
B00OBDZNNG|4|fits my son good
B00H29NS92|1|I purchased these thinking that they would be like normal leggings and stretch to fit to your legs. I was wrong they don't have any elasticity and they aren't the color shown in the picture, they're brown.
B00JV3LQPK|4|Love it, but definitely larger than most Harley size Small tops.
B00IPKNLKS|5|great product and great fit
B003LO1ZXS|5|excelent
B00K9FYNGS|5|I was kinda scared to buy it because ordering jackets is always tricky but I'm a short petite gal and a large fit a little big but I wanted that kinda look. It also came wayyy before expected so this was a test run and I love it so look out fall, I will be purchasing more!!
B00REZJ63Q|4|Super cute shirt, but it would be cuter of the hearts were white like in the picture. I ordered the black version of the shirt and the stars are back too. Besides that, the quality is good.
B00IAOSNCA|5|Love this sports bra. Got it in couple of different colors and have been wearing them for months and will continue once baby arrives. Great support. My fave.
B00A8GKKEW|5|After many years of wearing other brands, I have rediscovered Levi's. I have purchased both 501s and 508s shrink to fit and preshrunk.I just love these jeans so much.  They are built very well and fit my body (which is hard to fit sometimes) much better than other brands.<br /><br />I usually wear my jeans quite a while before washing them so that they conform to me and my shape.  I'm a guy who has more junk in the trunk than most.  Levi's will shrink up tight if you need them to (by washing them right away), or give you a custom fit if you are a little more patient with the initial wear.<br /><br />508s are my current favorites providing me a nice taper (not a skinny jean - I hate that look) and a great option of colors.  I love them!
B00F3CXSC2|5|Like that is says NANA!
B004W98UK2|2|straps sewn on irregularly, one side will never lie flat...my wife had to rip a seam and re-sew correctly.  This sewing irregularity occurs on all three pair that I received.
B00JFDDYX8|2|Very cheaply made. The mechanism is pretty shoddy and hard to open and close.
B00DHOGIFC|5|Nice belt. Cool buckle. Like the custom sizing. I hate extra belt length, and this you trim to size... Then lock in buckle and variable sizing in place. Need tight? All good. Too many wings and beverages? Loose covered....
B00DSYC2V0|5|Better than I expected for $25. I have 1 so far.. but I will order more
B007ZCLO5G|2|The size was fine but I. Do not like the elastic leg so am going to return them
B00719ZPQM|5|Light weight and breathable.
B007H5331E|4|I bought this for her and she likes it enough to wear it frequently.  I think it looks better than her other push up bras.  The price was good.  I should point out that it's probably not the ideal size for her but the closest we can get.  She might have said 5 stars if she was a true 36B.
B00HWEI0FY|5|Great quality .
B00FNOWNFS|5|If you are built like Joan on Mad Men, then this dress is for you! It fits snug where it is supposed to, and has &#34;give&#34; where it needs to give.
B00B1NOAYC|5|I just love the way this vest fits, it has the PERFECT AMOUNT OF STRETCH.  I have worn it with jeans and tank top, sundress and jersey jumpsuit and it looked great.  I plan to get lots of wear from this vest over the summer. You will not be disappointed if you get this vest.  I ordered and returned 2 other vest from Amazon before I tried the Big Star.. It cost more than the other 2 that I tried however you get what you pay for.  The quality is here and it shows.  Finally found the one that is just right.
B00UMOVIKU|5|Love it. One of my favorite buys
B00KAWDTXI|5|This is a cute shirt for a little boy.  The shirt is soft, warm and comfortable.  My son loves to wear it over tee shirts.  It fits just right for the sizing.
B00AWBURVY|5|It's warm and nice.
B00K5TBSA2|2|too small.  Sent back
B00GQO18Y6|5|Love it
B0007CKMPY|5|were what they were supposed to be
B0073N3LH6|5|fits a little snug.
B00HVZK9H6|5|Super cute and better than expected for the price!
B00AOCV8Z0|5|Love this sweater! Wish I could live in it every day, it is so comfy!
B00OABZ01E|5|kept breaking my eyeglass cases, hard case is perfect to protect your glasses
B00JFARFNQ|3|when washed in machine starts falling apart after first wash.  Not the best quality and likes to wrinkle
B00NGUFBIW|5|The fabric is soft and not sheer. Fits perfectly. Very comfortable. I probably won't wear the belt they included but that is my preference and has nothing to do with the belt itself.
B0095UY06Q|5|I love these pajamas! They are incredibly warm, fuzzy and comfortable. I like to keep my house relatively cold in the winter to save on heat, which can make it difficult to get out of a warm bed in the morning. These pajamas make it feel like I'm taking my warm bed with me! I read a review saying that if you are between sizes choose the smaller one. In the future I would choose the larger. The smaller size is manageable, and it doesn't shrink in the wash, but I would prefer a little more room.
B0052DD9UI|5|This is perfect for the between seasons weather as it's not too light or too heavy. My 2 year old loved the hood and the front pockets that he can use to carry his toys around. The fabric washes well too. Got a size 3T so he can wear a t shirt of even a thin sweater underneath.
B005NMB9PK|5|I received the legitimate buttons and tags that are great quality. I did not have an issue with generic flimsy or cheap quality buttons that some people have. The apron is fantastic as well. It is a good thicker material with a nice screen print on it. I had to order a blue head band separate which is fine. Amazon offers a blue satin band that is cheap in price and looks great with the costume. I cant wait to wear it for Halloween.
B00BTTN4QS|5|These are nice and soft and fit my girls well. They did not appear to shrink in the wash (I use warm water and low dryer settings).
B005ZVK8LA|5|great fit and you can shape it however you like, the color plum is just what I wanted
B000LUY01Y|4|Great sports bra. Very comfortable and supportive. Just be sure to wash it first because once you begin to sweat it will bleed onto your clothing and stain it black.
B00N9BOQOI|5|love love love it
B00JQRQO1C|4|Very good, somewhat small.
B007BLC1ZS|5|Very nice. I wear Freyr bras and am an odd size. This bikini top fits great.
B006IY6J1G|2|Color looks nothing like photos! Grey
B00JVXYLLQ|5|very nice
B00OACMUTS|3|After our daughter wore it once my wife noticed the size tag was stained red. So she carefully washed the shirt by itself in a sink.  Good thing, since enough red dye came off to ruin a whole load of wash. Otherwise the shirt is good.
B003N80UNI|1|My husband usually wears a medium so I got him a medium but when he tried it on its a little tight.
B009SKQ0WA|2|This t-shirt was for my nephew. I orderd size 7 and got a size 4. I am very disapointed! I will try to return it
B007UT533S|3|I bought a pair of these last winter and loved them.  This version is thinner and not as well made as the ones I purchased last year.  Disappointing.
B00GQSIISQ|4|its a little bit large
B00NKWUHMQ|3|Very nice but to small, seems well made. I guess I need a XX!
B004FPHIA6|3|I wish I had been able to tell, or that it had been included in the description, that these were the foam cups. At 42DD, I don't need the added foam. Also tends to run a little small.
B00LC6CVCG|5|Looks great on my two year old grand daughter. Good quality
B00AQDXAXU|5|My son is tall and skinny.  He has to wear a belt or these would fall down, but if I were to buy him a size 10, they would look like the gym shorts I had when in junior high.  They look nice, and with a belt fit great.
B009YJP738|5|Very nice coat , good quality , perfect fit and very good price.
B000MX3R6O|5|good
B00KLTXU52|1|I purchased the large in this dress and its too small and tight fitting,what a waste of my money,the length is totally not ankle length am so disappointed.buyers do not waste your money,buy carefully.
B00H38SF5E|4|Really fun corset. Strong and sexy. A bit small in sizing but not too much. I'm calling it motivation.
B00B6D4UME|3|October 2013 Update: After after throwing them in with every wash for the past few months, the bras have softened up considerably. They do create a smell faster than breathable fabrics like cotton, but that's what happens with nylon. Most important is that they're now soft enough for my ridiculously sensitive skin.<br /><br />July 2013: Sooooo itchy. They're supposedly made with nylon, but clearly not the kind in your tights. This stuff is like sandpaper on your cupcakes. It's awful. I tried washing them a bunch, but no, still scratchy. It was a silly and desperate attempt.<br /><br />Gonna have to go full cotton for cheap sports bras.
B00GIRK24I|4|I got this as a present....mine is a different color..I like it a lot....what I don't like is that it has no description telling you if its waterproof or not... other than that I'm satisfied sturdy and sporty...feels like good quality
B00PRWFNYE|5|These run really huge but I got them specifically for wearing with boots so it works out.
B0077R35U6|5|Perfect and arrived on time
B00J0R8EV6|4|I loved the shirt but it was just a little too small. If it goes on sale again I will get it a size bigger
B0076TOK3Q|4|The material is very lightweight but it is still very warming. The color is great. It is definitely a slim fitting article of clothing-a little too slim for me which I would have liked to have known prior to ordering.
B00EL3LHBS|2|This one had to be returned.  Out of the package I was so happy with my first glance at this sweater.  It seemed well made, beautiful material and design, and color.  I slipped it on and my love affair faded.  The sizing couldn't be more off.  I have Dickies, Calvin Klein, Pronto Uoma, Banana Republic, and several other brand sweaters.  This one felt like it had more of a slim cut but is definitely not advertised as such.  I also found the sleeves to be on the shorter side.  I wear a 34/35 in my dress shirts and found these sleeves to stop short of this.<br /><br />Shipping was quick and sweater was well packaged. Overall I was just so disappointed in the cut and fit of this sweater.  Back to the drawing board for you John Henry!
B007P297ZK|5|Love this sock!!! Am a size 9 shoe & the sock fits perfectly. Very comfortable to wear!  Not too thick or too thin...just perfect.
B00DZFYXTG|5|Nice for work
B00II9DCL4|5|You'll never want to take these off during the winter. The fleece lining is perfect and so cozy, without being too hot or too thick - the leggings still fit great and look great.  Not see through at all - bonus!
B00501HG9M|5|The reason I give it 5 stars is because for a little over $3 I thought these gloves weren't bad, Yes they are very thin and threading could have been better but I only needed them for a costume, if your looking for actual use like with a tux then don't be cheap. Find something where you get what you pay for.
B00N5PQSUS|5|This appears to be a nice jacket! It is very warm and extremely packable! Not to mention it's very fashionable!
B00LN603P2|5|we took my son to the hard rock cafe in memphis tennesse and there was a live band there. the lead singer was wearing one of these hats and my son just loved it. we found one at a local store that was too snug and ofcourse over priced. i promised my son i would look around and ofcourse amazon was the first place i looked. i love amazon i always find everything i have a hard time finding else where. this hat fit perfectly on my 6 year old son. he wears it alot especially on special occasions. the coloring is better in person as well.
B00DEO5AXQ|4|Love this outfit, the only drawback is if you use it more than once the pants fade! Otherwise I would give it 5 stars. This is expensive for a one time use . I bought for Christmas for my twins and they were just adorable, just wish it didn't fade so I could resell!
B0050AFXDY|3|I found them to be itchy but my fiance loved them
B00Q2QUPPQ|5|Fits as it should, perfect for wide hips. Super comfy and soft, not thin and cheap at all. Great quality and value.
B007BL28CO|5|They seem to be out of stock everywhere now.  I really liked them.  They are warm and fit nice.  Not to skinny through the knuckles like some women's gloves are.  Hope to find them again.
B00NAXYHZI|5|Good product but runs small.  Order the next sie up;  Appearance and finish appeared good.
B001KJCE5Y|2|I purchased a Field and Stream flannel shirt that looks just like the picture of this shirt from China thinking it was the same.  I was wrong!  The colors are brighter blue which not desirable to me.  The material is thinner than the Field and Stream shirt and the fabric started rolling after the first wash.  I am not happy with it but cannot return it after washing it.
B008B9FOOE|5|I surprised my husband with this hat,he was in the US Navy,and served in Desert storm,He opened it and was so excited to have it,it looks beautiful,the stitching is very well done,and It came very fast,Thank U To ALL veterans,I appreciate you all !!!!!
B00DLZ2XZG|5|my daughter loved it see look so beautiful in it
B001H4EKAE|5|Perfect fit, good design, great quality.
B005FDTAJO|5|These socks provide a nice measure of extra cushioning without having to worry about excessive sweat.  The thinner layers seem to wick away the sweat.  I would advise, however, that if your current running shoes fit very tightly, these may not be for you as they add a little bulk.  My shoes, Brooks Glycerin, have ample room to handle the additional bulk which comes with the padding.
B001TNTGJ8|1|This item should be rated -5, this shirt is not only tasteless but very disrespectful towards Michael Jackson, the Jackson family, and most of all the fans. Michael Jackson was an icon who will go down in history as the GREATEST entertainer! This person should be banned from posting anything on the internet! Shame on amazon for allowing this trash to be viewed.
B00UF3SCVQ|4|My favorite color.... its cute! i weigh 180 and got either a large or xl and its form fitting.. wouldn't wear this to church but cute if u are a clubber...:)
B00HAP5JJA|5|Perfect t-shirt for any Talking Heads fan. Gave it to a friend for their birthday and they loved it.
B00F1E8I3G|5|excellent
B002S6APTK|5|order this for the wife costume and it look good on her.
B008JHQRVM|4|Ordered as replacement for previously well used DP hat.  Only two issues, one is that the sizing is on the small side, and two, the interior hat band tends to bunch up into wrinkles which can be uncomfortable.
B00IGAT7FK|4|Just wanted the belt buckle. I'm sure it's a great belt for children though. Very colorful.
B00IAB4B24|4|The fabric's not very soft yet after a couple of washings, fyi :)
B00U19VQ44|5|Nice
B005XGX8L4|5|The pants came in on time and my girlfriend loves them. She wears them every night.  Would definitely buy this product again.
B008VPH8A6|4|Cute and sexy, but also good for every day wear. Fits well, like the color, I would buy similar ones again.
B00KDI7DPY|5|This is an amazing hat!  My only gripe is that a hat this beautiful should always be fitted.  The white colorway of this hat is.  Don't know why M&N decided to not make the red one fitted also.<br />But it still looks and feels great.  I get compliments and questions everyday about it!
B00RDD984G|5|I love it. Very well made product. The design is stitched not application. Did not shrink after washing and drying. I get compliments every time my son wears this.
B00CJSA0L0|5|I really like how this shirt looks and fits. I'm 5'10 235 pounds and lift weights/workout extensivley. I have a hard time finding shirts that fit my upper body without looking like I'm wearing a tent around my waist. This XXL thermal fits exactly like I was hoping it would.
B00P4RND9O|5|It is lovely leather and I feel somewhat safer from hackers that can use a phone app to steal credit card info. I know it works because once it actually blocked my car key! Great looking
B006HFJA12|5|This backpack turned out to be just what I was looking for.  If I had any wish at all, it would be for a few more pockets.  Looking at the photos that might seem sort of a crazy thing to say but now that I've loaded the backpack I find that I'd really like to have a couple more outside zippered pockets for small items (like in-ear headphones, charging cord, mints, aspirin, gum, etc).  Some of those things can go in the lower front section but they'll end up dumped in the bag bottom behind the organizer (for pens, etc), so not too handy to get to.  If you open the main compartment the situation is even worse and they'll for sure be buried on the bottom.  There's a nice upper zippered pocket on the top front but it's the only one (and that's really my complaint).  The two pockets on the side (not the ones for the water bottles, the tall skinny ones) are interesting; almost like they're intended for a collapsible umbrella or the like (I'm using one of the for my action camera stick and it works well for that) but they don't work for throwing small loose items into (they're deep and skinny).  But over all that's a minor complaint and one I can overcome easily with some small individual zippered pouches/bags.<br /><br />What I most like is the construction.  Everything seems well thought out and well put together.  The material is heavy-duty and the handle seems very robust.  I really like the water bottle holders, they're very convenient.  So far, the bag stands upright when it's set down; I say so far because I have some clothing to add to the center (main) compartment and that might change the balance a bit.  I love the laptop section (easy to get into  from the side of the backpack) and love that there's a dedicated pocket for my tablet as well.<br /><br />What I can't review yet is its durability.  It looks promising but I won't know until after my upcoming three month trip.  I'll try to remember and come back here to add to this review.
B00S9NQ0AY|1|The seem ripped the first time I wore them.  They were not too tight.. the seem sewing is horrible.
B0002QVBVY|3|I bought bigger, however, to make sure it fit.
B000KEN8X2|5|The bib is Awesome. The description is spot on. The winter has nothing on me now. My job is 90% outside so now I'm prepared to work in the cold snowy weather.
B0078YX97W|5|The ears and tail worked fantastically for me, it was very fun and very easy to attach to my costume pieces.
B000G7VG5K|1|Too thick to be a liner
B00BTPP7US|5|I'm 5'1 and 115-120lbs, I bought a small and it fits great!<br />Not too loose, however I'm wondering how an XS might fit. An XS might be a little more form fitting for me, but it's really not a big deal, it still looks great! I'm perfectly satisfied with the Small.<br />The skirt is definitely not too short on me, overall the costume is very comfortable and soft. The bows and brooch are very nice quality. Gloves fit very nicely, also very comfortable. The choker is great as well, not irritating to wear at all. I was worried the tiara would be too big, but it's actually really nice and comfortable, not tight at all. The hairpieces are also really nice too!<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with this costume and its accessories.
B00JJ8STEI|4|Great coat, but if you are between sizes, order the smaller.
B00G9YU18W|4|Daughter loved it fit very well
B00CAA0L7U|4|Had amazing complements on this outfit. Runs small and tight!
B002HWS45C|5|Ear muffs are great.  I was having a hard time locating these muffs in plain solid colors.
B00H1U8RAW|5|Love it. Pretty and very comfortable.
B007W0WNO2|5|excellent product , everything came good.
B00LV9W2C8|5|Beautiful dress my daughter's body type is very similar to the little girl on the picture so the dress fits perfect she is quite tall for being 7 so I got her a size 8. It has a nice shm
B0038M1XQM|5|I ordered a 2-4T for my 2.5yr old.  She is skinny (50th percentile weight and 95th height) and it fits her perfect.  I also ordered a Danskin Now leotard from Walmart because it was cheap.  The quality of this one is far superior.  The Capezio leotard is lined and much slimmer.  It fits much better.  We are very happy with this leatards fit and it is also very cute and girly.  I will only order Capezio items form now on.  You get what you pay for!
B00I3UJO2E|5|Big fan here.
B0007YXRXQ|5|These are the best and most comfortable bras ever made.  I wish I could get more of them!
B00CEML81C|5|Product was just as expected. Great transaction! Thanks!
B007WASFNA|3|It looks good and the style is as shown but the fabric is a bit thin and scratchy...not comfortable as it looks
B00AW5THWU|4|Runs large and the color is a lot lighter that expected. Well made and nice and soft so I like it a lot.
B00LUDLNBG|2|way too large & they fall off
B00AIEJDAG|5|This Shirt was a hit for my Christtmas Party. Fit nice,  very comfortable and cute!! I had several compliments.  thank you!!
B00IIFWQ4W|4|This is a cute shirt and I love the way it's cut, but the size seems a little off or I'm a little heavier than in other brands of clothing.  Either way you may consider getting 1 size up.
B00FFXYPCG|4|Overall, I like this sweatshirt.<br />I'm 6'1, 175 and have a longer torso. The sweatshirt is an XL and it fits a little snug. If you're any bigger than me, I don't recommend getting the XL.<br />It arrived in about 3 days.
B00J5FM82Y|5|Very cool pants.
B000F1PBM6|5|I was looking for just a nice simple slim wallet with some slots for cards and a cash section that didn't have a divider.  The cash section is just tall enough to where if you neatly place your bills in it they don't hang out.  But if you're like me and just kind of put the cash in there quickly when sometimes leaving the store they might hang out a little, but it's no biggie for me really because it's so minimal.  I also like how there are additional slots behind the three card slots on each side. A few cards can fit in each of those so that means it can fit at least 12 cards total.  I've used this wallet every day for 5 months now and it still looks great.  The leather is kind of thin, which aids in it being a slim wallet, but you can kind of see a card shaped outline on the outside of each side when it's closed because I sit on it so much. This isn't something that bothers me and I still love it.
B00IXCLASS|5|This is an ideal every day piece for layering.  So basic!
B002TNAIAS|1|Order a small - tall and it was way too tight and way too short! Wouldn't give this any stars at all, but had to give it one to list my comments.
B00CVNXO1Q|5|My husband isn't crazy about it but the girls I work with love it.  Very comforable and fits well.  I don't usually wear a plus size; a 16 plus in this suze fits like a normal 14/16 or regular XL
B0051HETOK|5|I finally have gotten a chance to wear these jeans!  The ankle zippers are really cute and the fit is great!
B001LV87XO|4|This is a fine quality 2 shirt. Heavy cotton, vibrant colors and half the price of other Grateful Dead tye dyes. Happy purchase. Keep on truckin'
B0029IMFUY|3|It's good for occasional use. Was small for my head but wasn't bothersome. I would recommend it to other people.
B00DRMAJ18|5|Looks great on the boy
B0007YR9EY|5|Good quality & fit
B000P50W4Y|2|The material for these shirts are quite nice and feels wonderful.<br /><br />The reason why I would never buy these again though is because they are too large and the collar is not tight enough.  I like an undershirt to fit nice and snug (I normally wear medium everything but small undershirts) and this definitely does not do that.
B00B5PWCF0|5|I wasn't expecting much from this shirt, given that I'm unfamiliar with the brand and the &#34;value&#34; pricing, but I wound up being very happy with this shirt. It fits well, the button snaps seem solid and it's quite comfortable.
B00B8AYGQU|5|My three year old loves her swimsuit .  It fits well and looks adorable on her.  The price was very affordable.
B009SRR6Y4|5|I have had a lot of great comments on this shirt!  I have only worn it a couple times, but everyone loves it!
B002LFDWQQ|4|I have a kind of small head and very short, slick hair. The bandana stayed on perfectly all night. It was a fun wig and I got compliments on it.
B00E1ZOWY0|2|Not happy with the fabric. Wanted it to be all cotton and soft, disappointed and would not purchase again
B00V5PM2JQ|5|Very good
B003YME5LQ|5|My sister and I will travel to Hawaii in the Fall.  She has always been an avid Elvis fan, so the luggage I.D. tags are an ideal gift.
B007NLKOCS|3|Ordered a large because that is the size nitrile/latex glove I wear and they were too small, otherwise good gloves.
B00630L04Q|5|Perfect fit.  I used  these spanx for a special event dress;  it did what I wanted it to do =  smooth out any unwanted contours and  bumps.  It worked!!
B00DNV1LYC|1|I just recieved the item as of yesterday 2/27/14..which is to small and not happy with the item.please contact me to let me know what I need to do to return this. I would like to order it in an bigger size, which I did..but still to small. thank you
B00ESK3Y1K|5|Washes well, and it's so cute.  Bat thing on the front is sparkly and so girly looking.  Couldn't be better
B00RMFHF22|5|It could be a little bit small. (too large)
B008Y0S67W|5|Awesome product taking this on my trip to Alaska in August. True to size.
B00SP8N52Y|5|Best bibs ever!!!
B00QTXUEM6|5|Nice looking. Fit perfectly. My favorite new bathing suit.
B00BVD00KK|4|These fit pretty good and comfortable. I'm 5'2&#34;@ 120 lbs. with an athletic build and these look nice. I bought these along with the blue ones and the blue ones seem to fit much smaller than the black. Just so you're aware, even though you may be buying the same product from the same seller. The brand of the product does differ. Because I was going to order more of these if they fit to my expectations. But not if it's going to depend on the color and brand I'm buying. Which we don't know this until we purchase them. Just a FYI kind of thing for you all.
B001N0OORG|5|The product arrived as expected.  Quality of the product was superb, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B00JJT269G|3|NIce pant.  Fit small and length to long.
B00GDFVHY4|4|Delivery was amazing and looks amazing
B001TYFW18|4|I really do like this shirt, but I was sent the wrong shirt. It's still a tye-dye Grateful Dead shirt, but it isn't the one with the turtle on it. Regardless, I like it so I suppose I will keep it.  Also, the shirt fits great, but its made with a thicker material than I was expecting
B003FPZFC0|2|The shirt does help flatten out the beer gut, but it's not worth the discomfort of being sweaty and unable to breathe.
B007KFZHNI|5|It's very comfortable and no bouncing with exercise.
B007D3EWCY|5|Hubby loves the shirt!  Good quality tee, sizing is good and screen printing is of good quality.  No complaints here!  Very nice!
B0054UJQYW|5|This is a well made undershirt. Fits well. Holds up well after many washes. Feels great. I would purchase again
B00PJBH1IY|5|My son loves it!
B00JH1ENLA|4|The robe is very warm which what I wanted. I live in a cold climate and even slept in the robe. It was an extra blanket.<br /><br />One minor problem is that it's very heavy, but in cold weather that a negligible problem.
B00L5M9GZM|5|Very soft, loved them
B002PK1N36|3|Everyone loved it, in pictures you cant tell its cheap, and it works for a quick costume and enjoyment, funs a little larger than discribed for 6-12mths
B006GTKYWS|5|it is a great winter coat that keeps the kids warm.  great for skiing, snowboarding or just playing in the snow
B00286UP54|4|We used this suit for a Christening / Baptism / Confirmation. I'd say it's a good value for the money. It came with all the pieces and in good condition.The material wasn't the top of the line stuff, but I didn't expect rare silk in this price range. At the end of the day, I would recommend this suit to parents in a bind for an occasion (since they grow out of this stuff so soon), but not to someone doing a photo shoot.
B00FRDSXFY|5|Fantastic slipper socks!!!  I wore out the striped ones.  Where do I find these again?
B00N2U7QK2|5|The kids loved wearing matching pajamas on Christmas morning.  These were comfortable and fit my daughters perfectly!
B00G9HUKBC|5|I LOVE IT.
B00J647RH0|4|This will be great for all year round actually. During the spring it will be good for outdoors, and during the colder months it could be worn inside to help chase a chill off in a room instead of turning up the thermostat.  It's very comfortable to wear.
B00QEBXWY0|5|all the men in my life approve of these boxers. They all say that these are comfortable; made with quality..:)
B00JS9J758|3|The strap was a little defective but not horrible. It was worn on the side.
B00KDMSH0U|1|Cheap quality - turned everything it touched, red.
B005GIACWM|5|This is one of my favorite maternity shirts paired with leggings.  It is very comfortable, nothing tight or restricting. It does not emphasize my bump, actually it kind of hides the fact that I am 6+ months pregnant. I like it because it does not look like a typical maternity top. I would definitely recommend this top.
B00DTQJ9HW|3|Everyone knows that a person grows unevenly. Teenagers often have growth outpacing body extremities. But manufacturers stubbornly ignore this fact.<br />Many brands have a problem in short sleeves models for teenagers. This jacket is no exception.<br />The jacket is very beautiful, light and warm. But you can not wear it, because Cost bend your arm or lift up the hand is lifted up by 15-20 cm
B00CVQ17DU|5|I am 5&#34;4 , 110 lbs and busty and this top in s/m fits great.  Beautiful color, soft material and great quality.  I'm ordering in more colors.
B005UNW09G|5|As always a, it is a pleasure purchasing these quality silk products from you! Exceptional fit, quality, and service! VERY classy! Thank you!
B00MU0JXI8|5|Great shirt!
B00HHOXWA2|4|It's. a nice every day jacket and nice and warm and it's stylish
B00D3Y3CLO|3|The set is cute and the sparkly buttons add a nice touch.  However, after washing it does pill a little bit so it's not as smooth as when I first received it.  Would have been nicer if the fleece was combed and of a little higher quality.
B00L3XPEH2|5|I bought this shirt in size &#34;Large&#34; for my girlfriend who is 5'9&#34;, 124 pounds, 34C-26-34.5. (Although she is a 34C, she wears a 34D bra in Victoria's Secret brand.) I read every review of this shirt before ordering, many of which said to order at least 1 or 2 sizes bigger than what you'd &#34;normally wear,&#34; but this advice is NOT helpful advice unless the reviewer also includes a description of her dimensions, including height + weight. In her case, the Large shirt fit her entirely too big -- leaving about 4 1/2 extra inches around her bust of pure bagginess -- even while she was wearing a slightly padded bra! We returned the Large and got her a Small, which fits her PERFECTLY. The shirt is of good quality, and the stretch gives it a higher end feel. For the price, buying this shirt is good value. We love the shirt, but the Amazon reviews misled us into buying a shirt that was way too large. Usually the Amazon community of reviewers serves us well, but not in this case.
B00DP2B5OA|1|THIS DRESS IS VERY POORLY MADE.VERY CHEAP LOOKING. ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. MATERIAL IS WAY TOO THIN, ITS VERY INFERIOR
B004T99C84|5|Captures the whole personality of my GSD!
B00UHN9F5G|5|love it!!
B00PW6W398|5|Very comfy and soft inside and out !!  Wonderful price for a popular name brand product #!
B00816TO8E|5|Wonderful great price well mad
B00JQY5LNC|2|Bought a 4t when my son just had turned three. After one wash it fits like a 2 t
B00G24IC3A|1|I returned these pants.  They run at least a size smaller.  The fabric was nice but they come from Hong Kong so be ready for quite a wait.  Can't comment on the overall look since I couldn't even get them zipped!
B009WS4PN4|5|Great quality, real leather, fit is true to size. This belt will wear nicely.
B00C1EN3MA|5|These shorts are amazing love them and they fit very well, great quality and look even better on than in the picture
B00KNELKMU|3|Smells like plastic
B004TQM0WC|4|Good
B00AO73QY6|5|Perfect for what I ordered them for. Using as part of Easter Bunny costume.
B00789TAPW|5|I recomend. It is light and warm.
B00CHMTRUI|4|Quality is good with good graphics.  Borderline too small, so hope there is minimal shrinkage after washing. Although this year Halloween may be the only time it is worn.
B004VBPRZM|5|Great pants, fit as expected, good quality, wash well.<br />Made in USA!
B00I1D6PH0|5|love stance socks
B005CSNVW4|3|runs small
B00BY9CZ7C|5|Fit great and will be great during the winter.
B00DZTXA0K|5|I love these pajamas!  I got a set for my sister and Mother for Mother's Day---gave them their pajamas early and they are enjoying them like crazy.  You won't be disappointed.
B00B1BXIOC|5|came in the mail quickly and fit like no legging i have worn before. so perfect and comfy and they look awesome
B002CATS0O|3|I used it for 3 months before having to get a new pair. Keep in mind I wash it @ least twice a week. It's not really durable just because its really thin. Works fine if ur shoes size run small and u don't want a thick socks. The elastic lasted for about 2 months. The design is pretty cool and looks good
B00XJEF9OQ|5|Great clothing fit prefect will order again.
B00ICU6FM2|5|I have many- great quality and fit!  fast shipping!!! great scarf for anyone who doesn't want to tie a scarf, just slip it on and go!
B00NN2R7G2|5|Nice .
B00452R5GG|5|My friend is a big &#34;Curb&#34; fan and really liked the gift.
B00DNSN7UQ|5|These shorts are made well and are very comfortable! Long inseam cargo shorts are hard to find in this quality.
B00PZ9MKU4|4|good
B00171TBQA|4|I read a lot of reviews and was a bit worried about size an quality. Over all very happy. The crown was not bent as some people complained. It is long but fixed that by wearing 4\\" heels (I am 5'6\\"). The sleeves were tight around upper arms but I stretched them out a bit. I ironed the whole thing even the netting underneath. And had to cut the waist on the under slip with netting an add a draw string it was much too small to pull up....I know that may sound like a lot but if you just spend an hour CAREFULLY ironing it it will look stunning on you!
B0024DBIK2|5|I rarely write reviews, but this was such a good value I felt compelled.  For a very small price, you will receive not one but two scarves, packed already in a gift box.  After getting one as kind of an experiment, I quickly ordered another one as I could think of others that would like to get this for Christmas.  Give these guys a try - i don't think you will be disappointed, and the shipping is quick as well.
B00ODD3YI0|5|These shorts are super comfy! Nice fabric, not see through. They are form fitting, but not tight at all. The material is super soft and stretchy. I ordered a medium, and they fit perfectly. These are perfect for working out, jogging or just laying around the house.<br />Shipping was super quick. They also came with a nail file with the company's name on it. Nice surprise.<br />Am thinking about ordering another pair. Would love to try out other products from this company.<br />Disclaimer: I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions here are my own.
B00NBHCN72|4|Love this brand!
B000EOGAFQ|5|Good product.  Fast delivery.  This bra is the only I can find that fits me well.  I just wish it came in different colors.
B00KSFE7JC|4|I gave it 4 stars only because it took so long to get here. Other then that, it's very nice
B00415ZKL4|5|Very tough product,  real leather, and it looks great in my motorcycle. Great price.
B00DX6OPEA|3|The material is a little uncomfortable. It made me itchy a few times
B00N1Y28CU|5|Beautiful, a little snug around breasts,but fit great
B001JTPQP0|4|fit nice, looked good, good quality, seems to be lasting, form fitting, really quite perfect for the occasion of a couple's christmas
B0053GEB4M|5|The material is rich and of good quality. My hubby really loves it and will buy another one of the same
B001U8SKJY|5|I wore this to a recent exclusive NYC Italian family wedding with an Armani suit.  It was perfect!
B007M61482|5|Great pants
B008A1JK8Y|5|Good nights, I wish that my package should be sent in box, envelopes, or small bag, wish to reduce mas that could quite for this way do not be so costly your freight, graces.
B00GLQAJN0|4|Bought it for my Mom
B0083RKBZQ|5|It is very comfy for my 5-month pregnant tummy, and I love the fabric and color.  Highly recommend it to all the preggo.
B00BYQQYOU|1|granted im 5'10 but no way would these have worked if i were 5'5! insanely short. dont recommend them unless you're 5' ?
B00C6M563Q|4|I bought the costume after reading the sizing information on here. it says it fits size 16-24. upon receiving it i learned it only goes up to a size 20. i wear 22-24 in between. the dress fits for the most part, however the stockings do not fit. i looked up their return policy and read other reviews for the company and they charge to return it. i have just decided to buy plain black stockings for the costume and settle. the costume itself is cute and comfortable. (aside from the cheapness in the fur attached to it) I also do not like that the hood is not attached to the dress. (its not going to stay put without something to help it)
B002T04QHW|4|Nice sox for summertime heat. Appear reasonably well made. Fit well. Sometimes I wear a second pair of thinner socks underneath these if I'm walking a lot.
B00GBDTGH8|4|This scarf is very soft. It came in a plastic wrapping that looks like it's straight out of China and has a slight smell ... but it's really soft. I'm hoping a good dry cleaning will do it justice. I purchased several colors.
B00JML1WR8|2|Nice shorts, but they run very small. I wear a size 6 in everything, but in these shorts, would  need an 8.
B00C7BEMI6|4|Top of Garter Belt is a bit awkward fit has the basic elastic top (which causes a bit of a muffin top-I'm a small/med). Stockings are perfect fit. FAST Shipping!
B00CCA5P3S|1|I would recommend never recommend this product. If you are slim don't buy product it is even too small for size 0-1 women's.
B00028B32Y|5|Love
B00W59DUN8|1|Wayyyy too small. Terrible quality
B00DG6ISJ0|5|This is a very worth buying the coat, I like it
B007IYG9FG|5|The fit was great.  I really liked it. Thanks so much.!
B00E9NDB46|2|These appear to be knockoff's, they do not look or feel similar to the same pair I bought at Macy's.
B008R8E4Y0|5|Perfect for my 7 year old daughter. It was soft and she never complained of anything itchy. Great dress! Would definitely by this type of dress again :)
B00JSOIKW4|5|the product is awesome just a little smaller than I thought would defintly recommend ordering one size bigger than needed
B00MQR07IA|5|I purchased for my 6 month old, and it sort of fits him, but also fits my 4 1/2 year old.  Soft, and good quality.
B001E4CM16|4|We purchased this jacket for my son's First Communion and we were both very pleased.  Same jacket we saw in the store, but the cost was the real benefit.
B00TFANFZ8|3|it's really pretty but is not neoprene just regular lycra it isn't bad quality but i think they just have to name it right
B00G30RTL4|5|This was sent as a gift, but they were very happy with it :)
B0056DK7KO|5|Neck line stays put and retains shape. Fabric is slightly form fitting and very comfortable. I purchased more in different colors!
B00SWH9BDA|3|Pretty  dress, nice quality; seems to be 1 or 2 sizes too large, so returning it.
B00EI8TSQW|3|Is good. But the material has many wrinkle
B0013ENDF6|1|compre el bello vestido rojo y me llego un vestido totalemnte diferente color mandarina, me siento robada.<br />buy the beautiful red dress and I received a orange dress totally different, I feel frustrated. I can not return
B00K62IVEE|2|I got these to give as a gift and they are way too small for a medium. More like a small or even an extra-small.
B0109K0T10|4|It is a smaller fit than the size listed but not too small. Have yet to wash it. Comfy shirt.
B00FBJLGS0|4|I like the material and the look of this belt. Best of all is the price and the super speedy shipping. Thanks.
B00AYXDQFO|2|The description should say that these are sheer. I don't know what the point of having see-through leggings is. If I wanted see-through, I would get panty hose.
B001AV91E4|4|Soft material and nicely sewn! Runs a bit small but I will keep! Looks better than in the picture and I am happy with purchase for my daughter!
B00ARY91ZE|5|My daughter loves these socks! They are so bright and fit great! They weren't worth $12 but oh well. As long as they fit and she likes them.
B00M4P829U|4|The hat fits a bit snug, but it is very nice. The Brown is a nice dark color, and it is very warm. I would order another hat from this company.
B00D3H0FB6|1|The first time I ordered this product same size but different color - it was as promised, high quality material and size was fine.  However, I ordered another one in black and one in Nude and neither of these was the same ...<br />Material was different, shape was different and sizing was nothing like the first one.  I am sorry to say that based on my first order, I was so pleased I did order another one in black and one in nude and I am sorry I did.  I should have returned them and this is not Amazon's fault but whoever the manufacturer is did not supply the genuine product and article.
B00IYEKO14|5|If you're the type who isn't afraid of wearing bright baby blue pants then you probably won't mind that these are somewhat tight, but plenty stretchy.
B006WFFZ6Q|5|Not bad.
B0094EJFTK|4|Very lovely belt, came just when it said it was supposed to. It has a rubbery kind of smell but it'll go away after a while of being out of the package. I wish it would've been a bit tighter, but it still works fine. Love it.
B00H57YK0W|5|Loving my wallet it really is convenient!!!
B00BGBDNDI|5|Great fancy (dress) men's black / grey socks. Nice, smooth transaction with ordering, shipping and handling. Thanks to all!
B00R3EDEHM|5|Great fit. Very comfy.
B00LURYREW|5|This dress is awesome,  it's very pretty on Bette than expected
B00152WF3W|3|The jacket is cute, but it is a size bigger plus the material is thin and looks cheap. I would not recommend this item.
B009I54BNA|5|Great color!
B001HQQ2ZS|5|This is my third Kangol cap.  They are great caps.  The materials are great as are the fit and finish.  The small openings in the material, especially around the perimeter help the cap breathe; there's no worry about sweaty scalp with these caps.
B000UA2LHK|3|Nice belt for  the price Looks to be made well but a bit wide for some of my pants although wide belts are now in
B00T9EO24I|5|Beautiful Dress !!!!
B00LMI9A6Y|5|fit great! and are not see through!!
B00CJSGEHY|5|Love it!
B00EZYZS68|4|The material of the jacket feels nice, it's light but feels sturdy and it's definitely warm. Really a nice style, but it fits a little small. Rarely do I need a 2-XL but I really could have used it with this jacket. It looks awesome unzipped so that's no problem to me! The pocket zippers are a bit of a problem though. They're very hard to open and close, they're prone to getting stuck and needing quite a bit of force, and one refuses to close all the way easily. I felt like I was going to either break off the zipper pull or rip the seams entirely. I'm not going to be touching those again. Given the price I paid, I'm content.
B00M6K2EWO|5|Anything Dr Who is awesome! regardless.
B00F9B5A4Q|5|Mad men tie! Cheap. Not the best quality, but the best value for a few bucks. I spill soup on the white tie and it came out in the wash.
B008R6ZBHQ|1|About 3 sizes too large unfortunately. Typically I am an extra large, however these are massive. A medium would have been better
B002SHTIZG|5|These are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly.  Diesel tends to run a little bit large, normally I wear a 32x32 in most jeans (lucky brand, AG, 7's), but I wear a 31x30 in these.  The 32's are extremely large in the waste for me, and the 32 length drags on the ground.  Overall, the fit, feel, and look of these is awesome.  I would highly recommend them.
B00GBM3S5A|5|Priced right...in my Bob Barker voice.
B002AQ496S|5|item is perfacted
B0083IKSU8|5|I bought it in size 3 for my 2 year old grandson. It is a little big for now, but he is still wearing it. The color is great! It's warm and cozy. He loves his orange jacket. It is a little pricey if you want orange. I saw it at half the price chipper on Overstock, but they didn't have size 3.
B00GP2KMS2|5|This scarf is great!  Lightweight and good quality.
B0018VL9JG|5|These worked great to give me a green body for Halloween.  I dressed up as Mike Wazowski from Monster's University.
B00L9REE1O|5|Perfect!
B00L5YLVEO|5|So I normally buy expensive wireless bras but certainly not anymore. I needed a wireless and something that I could wear under my racetrack tanks. This bra does the trick, is beyond comfortable and it feels as if you're not wearing anything underneath. I am a hot woman naturally and unfortunately I live in a hot region so sweat is always a concern. This bra is so light and helps keep my temp low. Love it so much that I bought the black one as well. I wear a 36B and purchased a medium, fits perfect. Would definitely recommend a thousand times over!
B00CHYPH6Y|4|Nice
B00IJEWONA|4|Birthday gift for a friend, and he really liked it.
B00MH20U9A|4|But quality,  use to lounge around the house
B00MEDE71O|5|Cute!
B00BLMC446|4|Hopefully shrinks a little...shoulders fits ok but really wide in the body...
B001E6KGIA|5|I order this costume and it's great, only thing I did was to cut out the lace on the chest and shoulder area because lace usually bothers me and gives me a rash, but other than that it's a sexy piece (but not slutty looking) and comfy, easy to wear it for hours to a party. Got a lot of compliments while wearing it and looking forward to wear it next time I need a costume.
B00ULZAEJ6|1|5% soandex does not qualify as &#34;Spandex Short&#34;<br /><br />Waste of money. Very disappointed
B000FFT22W|5|Thick, quality T-Shirt material.  Design as picuted--nice stark contrast between the the black and colors.  Very unique.  Would buy again.
B0050AFYQ0|5|The fit is true to size and they wash up nicely. I will buy these again. Buying in bulk saves money.
B00SHN0C1E|4|Pretty scarf but picture colors slightly off.
B00SIIC5LS|5|This is sexy! If you have some booty, buy a size bigger. I bought a medium. I'm 34-26 1/2-39 135lbs, 5'7. It fit perfect. You won't regret it. If you have trouble areas, you might want to buy a different bottom as these are very revealing.
B008Z8IVSM|4|My son liked the top but the shorts were poor quality.
B0031U0PUQ|5|Fantastic belt. Well made and comfortable.
B00FY7VF1C|3|Really like the way it fit but did not realize it was a patern skirt. did not really care of it but I can make it work
B00K64K24E|1|the cups are really bad ... plus the sleeveless side keeps falling
B001QGH118|4|Little small, but I think my head is a little big.  Hard to get it to look as good as the picture but it should serve the purpose.  Excellent delivery & service.
B00FXIGQDE|5|ordered this for my 7 year old niece and she was thrilled!  she face timed me to do a fashion show and looked so absolutely precious.
B00J5PCZQI|4|the color advertised is accurate and the fit is good.  I wear a size 12 shoe.  I would have loved to have this as an over the calf sock so I would not have to worry about adjusting every so often.
B0051U195O|5|I don't believe there's a warmer pair of socks on Amazon. These are just so warm Reviews of these should be very short. They should just say..WARM...WARM...WARM. Try spending $8 to $10 more on some Merino Wool and see where you could have saved that $8 and $10.<br /><br />Great socks
B004ODQWJ2|5|I'd seen this product at other sites but having account with Amazon I decided to order through here. This Star of David pendant is thicker than I expected, looks great, should last a lifetime. Levine Judaica prides themselves on quality & fast delivery & trust me, they delivered.
B00PVLGUOS|3|I thought the lace would be at the top of the hands.  Was disappointed it was at the top of the arm.
B0071GZMC2|5|Bought these for my husband. True to size, great pattern, much nicer quality material than many for the price. Very pleased.
B0055QNLR8|4|Seems to cut down on swelling and discomfort-don't know it it's the brace or another variable but worth a try!
B007XGDL9G|3|As a size 14 lady, these fit as perfect knee highs. A little disappointing, but still love them.
B00KT0KQM8|4|This shirt seems to run a bit small. If in doubt, purchase the next largest size.
B006VR97WI|5|Loved this!!! Can't wait to wear it :)
B004SW9LOM|5|I wrote late because I live in Venezuela and I had to wait more time for receiving the product. They are confortable
B00LLO3KQA|5|Size 10.5 male here. They fit great and don't show at all.
B00NFICB1K|5|So it's time to buy a new collection of warm clothes! I really like this one because it's smooth and easy to clean. I like that the neck is also cover so you don't have to take scarf if it's really cold outdside.<br />The buttons on the top makes it good to enable you to choose how tight do you want it
B00LNC9OCE|5|Excellent Fit
B00KID90B4|5|Love the dress but I had to send it back because it was too tight.
B00NQA6WDA|5|It's on the snug side on her if you compare it to the photo shown, but still looked really nice on her.
B00638L4LM|5|I bought two of the skirts. Havent worn them yet as I am from Canada and it is a bit too cold! Fast shipping, exactly what I expected and beautiful skirts!!
B0002DFTE2|5|Couldn't beat the price. Wear this for tactical matches/outings to the gun club!
B00MCGOV6E|2|and tight on my LO arms even though she is a long & skinny baby. We've never had a problem with short &#34;long sleeve&#34; arm length before. However, if you don't mind this the material is beautiful the dress appears very well made and it's even prettier in person. If not for the sleeves I would be ecstatic about this purchase, but I had to send it back.
B004OVCZ7M|4|Ordered it in color charcoal. Looks and feels great. The length of the sleeves were slightly long but nothing to worry about. I'll take it to a tailor for fixing.
B00L47VSPY|4|Cute little outfit.
B00596V388|4|Love the color and its soft. Its very comfortable. you can wear it very casual with sandals or dress it up with some chunky jewerly to dress it up for a night out on the town
B003LX2IBC|2|I bought this for my son, he weighs 210 and is 5'7&#34; so I thought the plus adult would work, but it was tight, sorry to say I am returning it and due to the time frame I have left I had to go to the Halloween Outlet and pull a chief indian costume together..<br />Seriously dissapointed!
B0007CKMOA|5|Great value. Shipping was fast. No issues
B000S5DR9S|5|This was a gift for my mother, she loved it. The scarf arrived quickly and quality was wonderful. I would order this again.
B00OMU6NIC|3|Beautiful just like in the picture and color is what you see (peachy pink) which I was hoping for.  The reason I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars is the cut around the bust is not flattering.  It appears flat with a slight curve outward at the top.  I ordered 3 other corsets at the same time so I was able to compare.
B00FL7ZWYG|5|I was looking for something to throw over a cami that was dressy with slacks for work or a night out.<br />I am a 2x and is lovely on. It is not clingy so does not emphasize the wobbly bits.<br />I will recommend this for the larger lady as I know how difficult it is to find clothes that look nice.<br />This is a nice item and it is sized correctly
B00CYAXXXU|5|These knee socks are wonderfully soft, thin enough to be comfortable with my deck shoes, and snug enough to stay up but not too tight.  I've ordered two more pair, and put another two pair on my wish list.  Umm!  Great for keeping your piggies warm during our chilly Texas winters.
B004DTDYCU|5|We love this shirt. It's our &#34;summer jacket&#34; if you will - in that it breathes, so you can put it on baby in the hottest weather, keep him/her protected from the sun but not overheated. It's just what we needed for our active, non-car lifestyle. We're always walking everywhere ,and I needed to make sure he didn't get sunburnt when he was younger than 6 months.
B00IVEE1JS|3|And by wide I mean really wide. It is also super long. The image is bigger than I would thought too. It is soft but it is just long and wide. I am not good at sizes so I had to ask a guy (this shirt is a gift) if it looked big to them and it is.I am going to give the shirt and see if it fits but out of box is long and wide.
B00JSJ4D66|3|Too tight across the chest.
B00BEMYQVC|5|Good comfortable fit. If one tries this shirt on in a store it will feel a little big, but will shrink slightly upon 1st laundering.
B009O9YJP0|3|it fits okay and its quit different from the types of shirts I usually wear but over all I like it.
B00UV3ESLS|5|Can't beat, um!!
B00K3DFJFU|5|The shirt was much nicer than I expected - great quality for a incredibly low price!
B0001YOP10|5|I love it.
B00MPW3I4Q|5|Very comfortable great quality.
B00WG92ECK|5|Nice dress....I received a lot of compliments...it looks nice with black leggins.
B00923MDO2|1|This product is a waste of time and money to buy. It never fit right. Every second I had to pull it up because it slips to my ankle
B008F2DOOE|4|As expected a good quality pant from Puma, however be warned Cabaret is not red or even close to it, it is a vivid hot pink, even though I wouldn't have ordered hot pink I have kept it anyway.Other colours are true to screen model.
B00AT0SRVK|5|Great gift for my son
B00JLQL1M0|5|fit is perfect
B00FT2SVZA|5|fits a bit big but perfect for 3 mos
B00DD1Q6UQ|5|I chose this because I was looking for long vests.  They are a nice addition to an outfit, especially leggings.  I don't like my hips to show in leggings, so vests like this add a lot to an outfit without adding a lot of clothing.  This weight is good for all seasons with only having to change the top worn underneath.
B00NUCIE9E|2|I loved the style of the dress.The adequate size was purchased but the dress did not fit true in my bust area nor abdomnial/ rib cage area. Was very disappointed.
B00NG8LH50|4|My package was missing two bows (purple for sure) I can't remember the other color that's missing. What we did get, we love, however.
B00TYMHM2O|5|Shirt is awesome and I got lot's of compliments when I wore it.
B007WHW5I4|1|It is horrible because the size is too small or too big.Also I think it is horrible because it shows your skin.The oatmeal one didn't even have the design it looked like it had.
B0044VEFWK|5|I bought this hat along with the slouchy beanie hat and I love this one just as much.  It fits a bit smaller but I like that.  It is more of a fashion hat so if you want to look cute while staying warm, this is the hat for you.  You can't beat the price.  This was a good buy!
B00AR94HVW|2|size, shape, I am not happy with results and dont look foward to buy this type of products in the future.
B00BSXB6EW|4|soft, comfy socks.  The scallop detail is minimal and the 'touch' of cashmere is there - good value for the price.
B005Q0E10O|5|I was expecting some crappy see-thru quality t-shirt and all I got was one the best quality t-shirts I have ever laid my hands on.  Seriously thick and well made shirt.
B00LHOWUPG|5|I wear this belt *everywhere* I go. It is excellently designed and beautifully finished! I gave one to my father and he gets so excited to show it off to people. I highly recommend this belt and will probably only ever wear a Trackline.
B00HR198D0|2|Socks were very difficult to get on over arch. Liked the color and style.
B002K6F79Q|4|For some reason the black bras seem to be a bit smaller than the white but equally as comfortable which is why I have given them 4 stars compared to 5 stars for the others. These are very comfortable for sleeping and wearing around the house. Not enough support for a D to wear out but they are sleeping bras.
B008AMGO3M|4|It was a little tight on my chest but it did fit on my body. Nice looking shirt, looks a little flimsy though. I think it's dry clean only so don't machine wash.
B001UB095E|5|This dress is amazingly beautiful. I am 5.2 tall and 120 pounds and the S size was perfect.  In the back part it has a kind of tail (which is an elegant detail) and in the front it fits perfect (I am a 34B).  It is a simple dress but also elegant, so you can use it for many occasions.  For example, with few accesories and your hair combed in a simple ponytail, you can use it for a more informal occasion.
B000H51TOY|5|My son loves this boxer, initially he wanted to wear it daily without putting it in the wash, this was not allowed of course but he loves it so much I went out and bought 3 more
B003QOVG96|5|Nice product for newborn. Fit as expected. Love it!
B0001VJ2V6|5|I bought some of these the other day and I loved them so much I went bck to the store where I got them from and got more.  This is truley the best panty I have ever worn.  They are thin, silkk, and stretchy.  They totally move with you and they offer GREAT support for the male anatomy.  I also got the hip briefs but I like these better!  I still love the hip cut but I am sold on the high cut  I think these will be the ony panties I ever wear again!  I better go out and get more pairs.
B0057X9MT0|4|It's a good shirt with a decent price....
B00D7JS2IS|5|New favorite shirt. I wear it all the time because I love the design and the material.
B00JVAD7G4|5|My daughter loves this shirt.  And we don't even live in Iowa....
B00IQO4X4Q|1|This crinoline is terrible quality. Item not as pictured. Is not full at all and very scratchy. I will be returning.
B00E4IV23S|4|They are comfortable a little loose and almost like thinner sweats. I love them when I am not trying to be to dressy.
B00Q5FBP44|5|Great hat, warm, looks just like the nfl<br />New era hat but 1/3rd the price
B00I40WPF6|4|Beautiful dress at a great price.  Would be perfect if it had fit.  I'm a size 4-6, and I don't have a particularly large chest/rib cage area, but it was too snug on me there.  Had to be returned.
B0056K2SYK|1|Bulky too thick and too wide  Attractive appearance and good materials.  I think I will go back to my old wallet.
B008FLUHBS|3|Product fits but smaller than expected for this size
B00RU73NAK|5|Silky smooth and beautiful color. No complaints.
B0099TPDRI|4|These are decent socks for the price as far as quality and fit, but they are very thin compared to other no show socks..they resemble try-on socks, but not bad
B003NVM9LG|5|It fits well, structurally sound, all in all a good pair of pants. It's really hard to find pants for me too, so this worked out great.
B00E7RMWJE|2|Its warm and comfortable but doesn't come with instructions on how to fold into the 6 different things and will not go into a beanie I'm not satisfied about this product but I wanted it for the beanie \.
B0085BAS0I|4|This item fits me very well and it is the color that I expected, It is very nice, thank you
B00IAVUFE2|4|I just love thisCardigan......
B005XZIE28|2|Disappointed with the shirt overall as the stripe does not go all the way around. The reviews were confusing on this point, some saying it does and some saying that it doesn't. I took a chance and it in fact doesn't.
B0068SFH7E|5|I recently received these socks. Shipping was very fast.<br /><br />As far as the socks go, they seem true to size. This pack is 12 pairs, 2 pairs of six different colors. One brown based, one blue based, one grey based, and 3 black based.<br /><br />The quality of these socks is good, it is a blend. I cannot speak to the longevity (yet) of these, but they seem like they will wear pretty well. For the price, you can't go wrong!
B005DF2TH4|5|I like this nylon nato strap because the color is identical to the color pictured (as all straps should be).  I would recommend Clockwork Synergy to anyone interested in giving their watch some nice summer flare.
B00AJLK7K8|5|Its was 85%ok...
B005HATOCS|5|For the price of the tie it is excellent quality.<br /><br />I have to type 10 more words to post this.
B001JT3P9E|3|Typical medium-grade bulk socks, on the thinner side of most crew socks.  Perfect for walking on cold floors or to wear under an ankle brace without adding too much bulk.
B00DN11OPS|5|I got it because of the color and I like cats, but it's also a great overall scarf.  It's light weight, which is nice, because I live in a warm climate and use it more as a fashion accessory than a winter warm-up.
B00P83RX4K|5|Pricey but worth it.....really really comfortable.
B008GT5G4W|5|This is so nice in black. The fabric is like a lightweight sweater. I'm also waiting on an order for the Dusty Rose
B00B5851Y6|1|I ordered extra large as I normally wear a large but wanted a little room.  The material and cut is beautiful but it is more like a medium. I gave it to my daughter who wears a small/medium and it is snug on her.
B00E4PKU5C|5|perfect
B00OVYJ7YQ|2|Wasn't as supportive as I thought it would be. The cup inserts move around a lot and you have to constantly reposition them.
B00IJJ7QAQ|4|Perfect color!
B00K9NL3PO|5|its a little snug for a boy and after I got it it looks like its cut for girl. If I would have known that I would have gone up a size.
B00EK5RNTW|5|Love it!
B004RTOZ56|5|I finally received my tie set on yesterday. I must admit it looks great and everybody I've showed the set too can't believe the price I paid. Quality material, great packaging, however the order to delivery time was terrible.   I placed the order on Nov 24, fully expecting the full 2-3 days of processing to happen and then a couple days for delivery via snail mail, yet expecting it to be in hand by the low end of the delivery estimate on December 1st. However, the 1st came and when I checked the status I noticed that package hadn't even been processed. It was not until December 3rd that I was actually able to track the package and noted that it had been dropped off the evening before. The package did arrive within 3 days of being delivered to the post office.   I do plan on using DapperTies again, however, next time I'll know to plan for a two week deliver time. I will say the tie looks great though.
B00JBVYQ04|5|really nice
B0085IGLH0|5|Great pair of jeans, perfect length and fit.  Straight-leg relaxed look is well done  Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice pair of comfortable jeans.
B00E9B0XDK|5|Great looking warm gloves that work with my Lumia phone just fine. Nice grippy stuff added to the palms and thumb to help you hold your phone. Good product.
B0084G02WI|4|Little on the small side.  Love the color though!!
B00R8YOE30|5|Perfect!!! we're very happy with this
B00V1LAOTO|4|Cute and well made, the pockets are ample size for storing your goods. I'm a size 22 and while this says it could fit up to a 5x, I would say it's no more than an American 3x- but the snaps are well made and its knit so it's a bit stretchy too. Alltogether it was a good buy and I may buy another!
B0058V5CMM|4|I am 5'1 and 130lbs. I ordered a Med top and it is a little too big. I was afraid if I went to a small, then it would be too tight. Love the feel of the fabric, and of course the cuteness of the wink.
B00LHN8CV8|1|make bigger
B002698064|4|good
B001CKY1K2|4|It was only meadow green on one side and white on the other (not violet as in picture). The white side is the soft one which would be facing up, so not as pretty when you are using it! But when changing diapers, that's the last thing on your mind?
B00HQZ4ZZ8|1|bad class
B00HWRPDR4|5|good
B002EVPFWQ|5|Can not find low rise in black anywhere! Love this product and want the low rise brief in black. So comfortable!
B00UV4S9GC|5|Nice but runs small in a 42 needed a 44 or 46
B00MPE6IUK|5|Love all my products!!!!!
B00E201MWO|5|I dont often order online for fear of size issues but I love it. Good price, good quality. I will defiantly order again.
B00D8RTEZY|4|I bought this for a quick one vacation suit but the quality for the price is great! The ties sides on both top and bottom are a bit much so I cut down the size of the bow and retied it.
B00B9BPUAE|3|My daughter loves it
B000BVXZ4Q|5|These are perfect for my daughter's ballet lessons. They are made of quality, thick material and so far no snags or any issues. They fit snugly without bunching and still look like there's a little room to grow.<br /><br />I would recommend sizing up. My daughter is two and a half, is tall and average weight and the size small 4/6 fits her. For reference she wears 3T in Carter's tops and 2T in Carter's pants.
B000ZQCDMM|5|Just got this wig, and I can't take it off!! It perfect! And I like the way it's cut, even if I tilt my head any direction you can't see my real hair....The color is just like in the photo, and  I'm extremely satisfied with it!
B00M2ZHV6W|5|Thumbs Up!
B0091GWIGI|5|This is the best bra I have ever owned.  It is so supportive but not bulky and there is no bra line under your shirts. I am 43 and this is the FIRST bra I have ever felt like it actually fits!
B00F3RU0N2|5|It fits perfectly.  Nice quality material.  Definitely a good designer.  Worth the price.
B005S22TSG|4|I'm a fairly fit 5'11\\" guy, and this shirt (the Medium) fits super tight without being awkward or uncomfortable. What I'm trying to say is that this thing is straight up fashionable. It shrunk a little bit the first time I dried it, and I think that actually helped. It may not be suitable for your average, overweight 'Merican, but I dig it and so do the ladies.<br /><br />For anyone who's not afraid to have their shape shown off, it's a nice change from the usual \\"frumpy\\" band shirts that we've all been stuck with before. Very nice fabric, too. Minus one star for making the ALICE IN CHAINS text a little too subtle. Otherwise, this shirt is cool enough for me to actually write a review about it, and that's saying something.
B00A793REA|5|Great underwear I wear every chance I get.  I will buy more very soon.  Perfect fit, well made, soft material
B00UJ0IY68|5|Love the feel of theses fit great!
B00IYX6Y50|4|Like others have posted the fit on this runs large.<br /><br />Even with that knowledge and ordering a size smaller than I normally do for my wife, the bottoms were still extremely baggy. I decided to return the item sadly.
B00LH1DHQU|5|I bought these for my son's birthday. He loves these shorts.
B008HZ6M9I|5|For a full cover bra this is exceptionally pretty and is a great fit.  Will buy again. I love it.
B004IDHLIE|4|This pant fits great. However, I ordered a 34x34 and it seemed 34x38... on top of that the boot comes disjointed to you have to get it tailored up.
B008KTIO56|5|They look great! They take a long time to come but are worth the wait. They package them really well.
B0036995AI|2|The bra seems to be made for someone with wider set boobs. The molded cups gave me a square shape. I wasn't impressed with the fit, but recommend trying it on before passing this bra up. It may fit you perfectly.
B00ILZ0S5I|2|The hem around the bottom of the legs is to small for bigger legs and the first time I wore them the hem broke and the material is now hanging off the legs.
B00152VKCO|4|Light weight and great for special occasions. The price was perfect as well, and it was on prime. Worth the $$.
B00B4X6P42|4|Love the price and fit although I would have liked to get another color.
B00CBRBBIU|5|Beautiful with nice detail work. Bought in black and white and am going to to purchase another color.
B00422MCVW|5|It pleased me so much to receive the wallet because it was very nice. I got it on time and both men liked the gift they received very much.
B0091GWJN0|5|This is a very comfortable, smooth fitting bra that is great under a T or a sweater, something that is hard to find in my size range. For some reason there seems to be a greater selection in the larger sizes.
B00IMNVSNK|3|I got it wrinkled. Fits good because of ribbons. The headband was folded so it didn't really stand up right as well.. The lace on the headband was also wrinkled too. I guess this is good enough...Wish they pack better though.
B00NC0R7CO|5|cute outfit
B00MGFBXNU|5|My sister loved it! I bought big kid size and it fitted ok! She loves dinosaurs so she use it even when is not Christmas!
B00LAI81RK|5|great!!
B00CB3FT6E|5|The perfect gift for the stoner/drug addict in your life. My buddy hasn't taken it off since I gave it to him. Not only does he stay warm when he's waiting on his dealer, but he looks good doing it!
B000BD40XE|5|Our wedding was quickly approaching and I soon discovered finding boys white ties was impossible.  I found these ties and they were perfect and cheaper than any ties I had seen in any color anywhere else.
B00P9PE2ZA|5|Great
B00M6FMYDI|5|Loved my Shirt!!!
B0027VT614|5|The afro I got is just as I expected, however it is not as poofy as the picture. I used a hair-pick comb to fix this situation, but it will not get that poofy on its own.
B00LES0EUS|5|Exactly what I hoped for - a QUALITY belt with GENUINE leather! I could not be happier that this item matched the product description word for word. Compared with inflated store prices, this product is a STEAL. Most importantly, it fits great and looks great. And on top of all of that, the delivery was fast, on time, and the package was well-sealed and neatly secured. From the purchasing click to the first fit, everything was what I hoped for.
B001PO6CTS|1|I bought DKNY Tee Shirts from their website way back when and I love them.  Still have them actually and they are great.  Wanted some more.  What arrived wasn't Tagless.  I sent them back.
B00QEVLI9Q|5|This dress is so great! Fun, fits like a glove!
B00412N97E|5|I was looking for a petticoat to wear under a polyester dress.  This gave it the perfect poof!  I wore it a little lower on my waist because my dress was just past the knees & if I wore it too high, the poof would have looked odd.  However, it stayed on my lower waist all night.  Also, the size worked just fine & I am a size 14-16.
B0031DUE68|5|Arrived as soon as expected.  Packaged very well.  This is a stunning color, and I am extremely pleased with this scarf.  I chose the \\"Olive N Figs\\" color. Lots of beautiful colors to choose from.  I highly recommend this Amazon provider!!  Keep up the good work!!
B000CCIPWQ|3|Total ripoff but totally works
B000UK4TVG|4|good quality and are comfortable. I like the longer skirts and this is the length that I like.
B005FIHQHC|5|Arrived quickly!!! Was happy with my purchase
B00R4LRFN8|5|i like this is coats!!!!
B00UXPQ5VU|5|Fit and color are great. Will purchase again
B00ET4H83A|4|Nice fit, I liked the double buttons on the cuffs. The color was a tad pinker than what I expected, compared to<br />the photo. Comparable to LL Beans big comfy shirts, but a little tighter around the hips. I expect it will get<br />softer as I wash it a few times.
B00CHGP6YK|5|The set fit him very well and kept him snug and warm. I would recommend for purchase this is a great buy.
B000FGCSEU|5|Perfect! My husband is directing a community theater play and needed a wide brimed ladies hat and this is perfect. The service from this vendor was excellent.
B000HSTWY0|5|i need these socks for my job and they are hard to find one thing i can say they are so comfortable
B005X67NJC|2|It is huge around the belly it would be okay if you were about nine months pregnant
B00LCYI5RI|5|Very beautiful color! Vibrant like I wanted, fit just right and made well :)
B00MNGNDQ2|3|It is not bad.
B00MSEQB68|5|DC's quality is really good!
B00UV6MYSO|5|I loved this bathing suit 🙌🏾😝
B00LPUR4PI|3|This dress runs small, I bought a large wanting it to be a little big, & I think it fit more like a medium.  It was also shorter than I expected for a maxi dress.
B00HSHPAL2|3|I thought the fabric was very light weight, not sure is it will last, but otherwise it was as described.
B00E1ALO0K|5|The arms were a little tight, but it fit beautifully
B003WQT17C|3|I agree with the other reviewers on the outfit being a bit too large. It isn't snug or tight in any way. I'm going to try shrinking it in the dryer to see if it looks nicer that way. I do like the fact that it\\"s a unique fishnet style and color. The sleeves by the wrist are too wide but if you fold them then it doesn't look too bad.
B00GNU1V2C|2|I ordered the size I normally wear and it was too small - clearly not true to size
B00MHDY6GC|1|Too small for a Large.  Size completely off
B00JBCQA8E|2|FITS large! I got a small more like a medium or smaller sized large. It is cheap feeling almost like hospital pants very stiff. Unsure if after a few washes it will feel better.
B004UI6E1C|5|Keychain design is high quality.  It's a beautiful piece to use for everyday things like car keys.  Copper is vivid.
B00FKBYGE0|4|Love this hat!
B009CBM0HO|5|I was looking for an all black shemagh and this one gas worked out great for me. I would recommend this one to all.
B0059DS5K0|1|Here's my quick summary--thinner than thin. I have many Columbia fleece products, not one is as thin as this one. I am sorry I purchased it as it won't provide much warmth in the winter. Looks as if it was made for mass merchant at a cheap price. Also very large in the hips and I have narrow hips so it sticks out.
B00OMVX8M0|5|Camo is just too cute on a baby boy and probably on a baby girl too. If you are into that look at all, this is a great pick in shorts. They look like big boy pants--like daddy's. Superior quality. Will be passed down to the next generation before these ever wear out.
B00OGA09AG|5|Great hat. Best true to size hat I've found. Keeps head warm and looks good. Reasonable price for a quality cap.
B00J3QHOJM|4|The sole is a massive hospital shoe-type pad, but it fits my male size 10 foot just fine even though it is a bit big.
B00412O5JU|5|great
B00OMTBTL4|5|I bought this as a present for my friend and he loved it. It looks exactly like the picture, great quality& it's comfortable too.
B005KKB4SW|5|Very well-made strap, here.  It runs a little long, but my wrists are fairly small at 6.5 inches.  I ended up running the tail through both loops, then back around and through the first loop again.  It has yet to ever slip out.  I actually ordered it based on specifications of a watch that claimed to be 20 mm, turned out my watch is 22 mm.  Figures!  I will not be returning the strap, however.  I have another watch it will look great on.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect buying a strap sight-unseen over the internet, but I'm glad I did.  They put some effort into this thing.  The strap is tightly woven and well cut, no fraying what-so-ever.  Highly polished closure and rings, wrapped in plastic and it even came in quite a fancy box.  Whoever was in charge of presentation sure hit the mark.  I am ordering a second as soon as I am finished writing this review, so there's your real proof.  Excellent item, highly recommended.
B0088CGN94|5|My girl was surprised to get this and totally had fun with the jingling stuff on it.<br />It didn't last long... but that wasn't the point.<br />Thanks for providing a fun time, she has two friends (who love the look too!) and promises me a true harem experience once they arrive!<br />DW
B00BBMI99K|5|Beautiful hat, well made & elegant. I have got the champagne/plum/burgundy one. Fits my head perfectly but wish it had an elastic band to secure the fit ( i made one by myself ).  Love it, Thanks.
B004UULUYQ|5|Looked great. I wear bangs so I usually like my wigs to have them too. I did not have to cut any, this fits perfectly.
B00GNBLIPG|5|Very nice scarf!
B00ARDCDBY|5|gave as a part of a gift, loved them dearly, they were soft and colorful. seem real nice and worth the money, mommy to be was very happy to receive them
B00BEYWB6M|5|The body contour is great for working out in.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks
B00LJONNSM|5|Package arrived in fast efficient manner, design of shirt very clever with the &#34;inside out look&#34; which sounds stupid but works, top quality made, only bad point for me was the xxl  too narrow, more like a xl fit, when ordering go a size up to what you normally take.
B006YMYZ68|5|Great pants, great fit. Definitely  recommend the &#34;flex&#34; waist on these pants rather than the &#34;comfort&#34; waist available on some others. I own three pairs of these.
B00FF09ZYW|5|this shirt is AMAZING! I felt beautiful in it BEFORE I got compliments at every single place that I went! It makes my boobs look stunning...you will want to have a plunge bra...I am a full DD and 5'9&#34; and the length is perfect. Totally love it and am buying more in different colors. LOVE LOVE LOVE! I cannot say enough!
B00XUBX8V4|4|Pretty dress, but too small. I ordered xxlarge
B00JJIO2W6|4|excellent
B007NG6NPU|5|I've never worn these types of belts, before, but I liked the results.  These eVogues belts are really neat.  This one, in particular, is very stylish and versatile with the silver.  The band is quite comfortable.  Unfortunately I lost so much weight that they don't fit me, anymore!
B00JHZSWMW|5|I love my new swimsuit it fits perfect. I wear a medium but the size chart was different so it suggest I get a 2x and it really does fit like a medium.
B00MNEBWK8|5|For my grandson. He loves it!
B00BOKJMXG|5|Love these! Fit is comfy! Perfect!
B004S0SE4M|4|Excellent product for the price range. Stylish and fits great. I like being able to purchase the jacket and slacks separately. I am a slim build and this is a perfect fit.
B00EI49LPO|5|I ordered and had it sent to my daughter for my granddaughter. My daughter sent me a text after receiving and it said &#34;this is the most beautiful snowsuit I have ever seen&#34;  and it is, the bow on the front is so cute! It is so soft and is very well made. It's keeping my granddaughter warm and stylish during this frigid Ohio winter!!!!!
B00B8EEOQS|5|This little dress is Perfect for summer & can be worn as a top or a dress. It's light & very comfortable.
B00XLSE19E|5|Daughter looked great in this dress! At 10 years old I was unsure which size to order for sure. However, looking at size chart I made selection and it fit perfectly with little room to grow.
B0037T2TTQ|5|Forget about the brontosaurus (aka Apatosaurus). The Brachiosaurus was twice as heavy, almost twice as tall, and 33% longer. I wouldn't even consider buying a shirt with any other sauropod on it, neither should you.
B00K72OBUG|3|Too tight
B00R49AFGY|5|Love it
B00JE1S3I2|4|The quality of the fabric and look is great. My only complaint is that the neck is a little too wide for my liking. GAP baby clothes have a ridiculously wide neck, these are mediocre and Carter's has my favorite neck fit.
B00GYITNNC|5|I love the material. Initially thought they were cotton (didn't read the description), but when I got them I was presently surprised.  Very comfortable and can be dressed up and dressed down.
B00T3JPS92|5|I don't normally wear skinny jeans, but I decided it was time for me to step outside of the box. I found these Touch Me Women's Skinny Jeans and I actually really liked them. I decided to go ahead and get myself a pair. I was so excited to finally get them. I had them out and tried on in just a few minutes after they arrived.<br /><br />Now that I have them,  I'm so happy I took a chance. These skinny jeans are made of a good quality denim. They fit just like I expected them to. These are very nice jeans. They have 5 pockets in them. There are two back pockets, two in the front and the fifth pocket is a small one that's within the left front pocket. These jeans are very nice casual jeans. I am very satisfied that I purchased mine.<br /><br />* I received these Touch Me Women's Skinny Jeans discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B012ADM372|2|I thought this was really cute but the top doesn't fit well. It doesn't conform to your boobs and there is no support for women with bigger boobs. (34/DDD)
B008JRU8MQ|5|Great!
B00IEBI9V4|3|Very cute and good quality but they run very small
B00GU15MWE|4|it makes people talk  warm comfortable does not twist.makes sum people unhappy.its a hat it keeps your head warm. buy one
B007ZPTENM|5|Shirt looks great, wonderful fabric feels good on your skin and good to the touch. Fit a little snugly for my taste, but I'm still satisfied!!
B00DQ2S2OK|2|The colors are awesome, but the buckle broke in half after wearing it about 3 times. Most of my belts are reversible, and they often lose some of their springyness after a year or so, but I've never had the metal itself fall apart, let alone so quickly. Because I like the belt I'm going to try to swap the buckle with another belt of mine, but I am disappointed (I liked the color of the buckle also). The quality of the leather doesn't seem that great, but it's fine - I'm rarely impressed with belts in this price range.
B00ENLN338|4|Pay attention to the size it is really accurate, I ordered the large and should have ordered the medium.  They are comfortable, however  the length is 1.5 inches too long for me.
B00H9RF5ZC|5|This is a really nice Harley Shirt and I love it.  Fit's right, obviously made from quality material not some cheap thin T Shirt. I highly recommend.
B00FFOF6XC|5|My little guy is in love with his new shirt! Fits as expected.
B00BY3KT26|5|I was very upset that this jacket was too large on me because I really liked it! The other reviews were saying it ran tight.....but not on me!LOL
B00NAK1F10|1|These were the joke of our house when they arrived. Somehow I just discovered yoga pants and when I put these on they were small so you could see through them. So I just wear them to sleep in.
B00C5QF6EM|1|This product arrived with stains and obvious wear and tear. It was clear that it had been used for quite some time and then returned. I was very disappointed but was leaving for a trip abroad so I decided to keep them and just wash them several times. Quite a rip off considering I paid full price for a used item.  I am very disappointed in Amazon for selling a product of this poor quality.
B00HLM4IOE|2|I am not usually one to complain about products, but this rashguard is below par mainly for one reason. If one uses this rashgaurd at the beach the sand becomes a part of the top. No matter how many times I have hand washed the top there are still thousand of sand particles that I cannot get out. The top is no longer white as the sand makes it look a washed out gray.  The stars I have given the products are because I  love the feel of the top and shorts ( pre sand) and my son has no had a sunburn since he has been using this set; But if I cannot use it at the beach because I cannot get the sand out, what is the use??
B00ACIH7WE|5|My husband wanted these to sleep in.  Fit is perfect, fabric is soft.  Nice elastic on the waistband and comfortable for sleeping.
B006LFV44E|4|fits great. washes great. tried another brand for variety and disappointed. Doesn't roll up!
B000JGHHEM|5|Looks great fit a little snug no problem with delivery
B0095W3E02|4|It is a great shirt but it shrank up (not in) a lot after a couple washings.  Otherwise a good purchase.
B00HQG0VOG|5|Great! Especially for price. I am using it for my wedding so I didn't want it to look cheesy, I was happily surprised! The color is basically white and the length is accurate. Very Pleased!
B003E98N9O|4|Nice hat for our purpose, was disappointed that it came somewhat crushed and creased in areas. The box was too small and there was not packing in the box just the hat.
B00EH8MQTO|1|This Dress was very thin & looked cheap. Wish i wouldve sent it back. No wonder it was only $7 i would not recommend anyone waist their money on this product
B00EHI4LRY|5|love them!
B003GD2PFQ|4|It's an excellent choice if you have the weird tennis that come with the toes separately, you will need it.
B00NOB2VA4|1|Boot sole broke off after 2 days of wearing. Can I return and get my money back?
B00PG8I6Q6|5|Fits really well. I'm 5'1&#34; and weigh about 125 and ordered a size small.. so lables are true to size. It's soft on the inside and really warm. What you see in the picture is basically what you get. And the best part is that it's batman! It's Definitely my new favorite!
B00K47YY88|5|Love the material it looks great!!!
B00CXGHA34|5|Nice
B00U35Z0N4|5|very nice jacket
B00JS8CCY2|5|Most comfortable pants to wear around the house I've ever owned. They are extremely long. I am 6 3&#34; and they are long on me.
B000KA0IKC|5|What you see is what you get.  Good material, good quality, I'm very pleased.
B00NMWH4MA|2|Cute but not really on my head!!
B00IGVB0S6|4|Great quality for such a low price but the thong definitely wasn't necessary. I was unsure about the sizing and I read that everyone should get a size larger than the usual so I did, yet it pretty loose for me. Next time I'll know just to keep to my size!
B005CSNUTS|5|great product, fits great, not to heavy not to light. durable and very comfortable, i am happy with my purchase.
B00BSOKH0A|4|Very classy dress. I wore it to a wedding and got tons of compliments. I usually wear a size 4 but ordered a 6 and it fit. It was a little snug, but not too much. The fabric doesn't have any stretch to it but it still felt comfortable. My only complaint is that the lining is not attached to the lace at the top. I had to safety pin the lining above the bust so it wouldn't slide down and my boobs wouldn't  be exposed. I plan to sew it in lieu of pinning it next time I wear it. Overall, it's a pretty dress at a good price.
B002WTC6DG|2|The description of cushion is streching the description in my opinion. But if you want lotts of ok grade socks they are ok.
B000UZYX9O|5|This is my 2nd time buying this bra.  The first one would still be great, but my dog decided to hide it.  (Still haven't found it)  LOL.
B007JVOD2O|5|Best bra
B00KC7GPKK|5|Felina is a wonderful brand, and this 2-bra pack is an amazing value! These bras fit great  and are just perfect for wearing under mesh summer sweaters.
B00HS1SEMU|5|The price is excellent and box your privacy snug than others I bought.
B0029RBK2E|5|Very good quality. I recieved them in excellent condition I would very much recommend these to friends money well spent. Looks and feels like very expensive quality sunglasses. Im ordering two more sets in the near future.
B000KK0ONI|4|Great pair of shorts, tried hanes, jockey and also champion, they were not a comfortable as these. I will be ordering another pair.
B006SRT0FA|5|Love the top very warm! Not bulky! Soft. Never want to take them off! The best on the market!
B00NNRYJBI|5|I purchased this on a whim on black Friday for my husband. It fits great! I would say the medium runs true to size, but is more of a slim cut so fits a guy 5'10&#34;, 160 lbs. The material is like a very nice quality sweatshirt material. I wouldn't call it a sweater fabric, but an upscale thicker shirt/sweatshirt. I'd definitely order this again.
B005DDVWE2|2|The product has so many issues. The jacket and shirt w/ tee looks more like rags they attached to a decent costume chest. The chest portion was ok, but very hot. I end up having to remove the chest part from the shirt and jacket. I added straps to the chest portion to make it look half nice. For the cost, I'm not sure if it was worth it.<br />I caution anyone who is looking to buy this. Be prepare to make your own alterations.
B00U87Q0UO|4|I apparently made a mistake.. I thought I ordered an xl and a xxl arrived...but it worked out better..it fits fine..I also thought I ordered it in black and was surprised when a white jacket arrived...but am actually happy with it..I'm sure that it was me who made the mistakes... As I am a chef and it was 2 am when I ordered it..all in all I am happy
B00AEW46F4|5|This dress is sexy, comfortable, & flattering while still maintaining modesty & classiness. Easy to unpack & wear! Love it!!!
B000IBFGHS|1|carhartt,... Imports that don't fit should be there new saying.
B000GWT6DY|5|This is my FAVORITE bra to wear underneath Tshirts and tighter fitting sweaters. Give me a great lifted and smooth shape.
B00ZBBISPC|5|Lightweight and perfect for hot summers in Tucson. And it has pockets! Was surprised that it did not have an actual hem, simply cut material, but it has held up through repeated machine washings, so that has not become an issue.
B001KXMV08|4|Very cute on.  Perfect for certain teenage girls. My son bought it for his 16 year old girlfriend & she loved it!<br />Good quality. Was hoping the eyes were a bit more substantial. Hope they don't fall off.
B00SF73ZCK|5|I got it for someone else. After reading helpful reviews, I got size 4X for someone weighing about 160lb. She was very happy as it was perfect on her without being too tight. It provided a great support for DD cup and made her body look much slimmer.
B00PMLCI98|5|This shirt fits as expected, and has vibrant colors! It is soft, so it is perfect for a summer shirt.
B00DOMBWB2|2|nice material but the legs wide are super large
B002R5FXDA|3|It's not fancy and it's not perfectly made, but for the price it was great. My husband wore it to a Mardi Gras ball.
B000EOZ3DQ|4|I got a lot of compliments when I wore that T-shirt to an adoption event. I'm involved with animal rescue. Everyone liked it.
B0014DTP80|4|Cool hat. I got it as a gift looks great.
B00S7CDHSU|5|The material feels very nice! The 36/37 length has been described as a tall man's dream.<br />16 1/2 - 36/37 Amanti Slim Fit<br />185lbs 6'3&#34; male<br />Would repurchase. Good quality. Good price.
B000PBVCWY|1|[[ASIN:B000PBVCWY Jewelry Display Stand Blue Dress]]<br /><br />I submitted a purchase order for this item last week and after several days received a cancellation stating that the item was \\"out of stock.\\"  When I checked the item it showed in stock.  I could never recommend Bella Casa Boutique to anyone nor do future business with them.  The $29 item might be worth $20 in shipping but I will never know...
B00I0HEEGG|5|Love this, very pleased with purchase. A couple of items to note: it WILL shrink when you wash it, and until you wash it the dye from the fabric may stain your skin or other clothes you wear under it (especially in the armpit and elbow area).
B009S6ZQGA|4|The quality is not bad, thought what isn't shown on the image is matallic fiber which i don't like . I think without that metallic fiber this tee could be more  trendy. about color , its oatmeal with yellow metallic fiber not Antigue White as described.
B00E5Y8RHU|1|I got the bear one. In the picture it looks brown and white. It is no wear near brown. It is a very bright yellow, like day-glow highlighter. It seems really thin and cheap. I would try to return it, but I'm not gonna go through the hassle plus I need it for a party next week and shipping from china takes forever.<br /><br />Had high hopes and was planning to order more, but it I can't even trust the color I guess I'm done with this seller.
B0057AVUIY|5|My daughter gets a ton of compliments when she wears this outfit and the similar blue one she has. The colors are nice and vibrant, and the quality is great. They've also washed really well which says a lot because my daughter wears them all of the time.
B00SSLISCK|5|awesome product. feels very comfortable and the quality is great. will purchase from again.
B00OYVV7JO|3|Liked the look, but rivet-type holes started coming out after the second wear.<br />Canvas was kind of flimsy.<br />but for the price it was hard to be too disappointed.
B00005KJXN|4|people actually thought i was a nun!<br />I am 5' tall and this was too long for me i had to cut a good 6 inches off before i was able to walk without stepping on the fabric. its made out of the cheap costume fabric so dont be too rough with it. overall a good constume and its very fun to wear
B000NCGGJY|5|So for all of you who are wondering what color &#34;Midnight Navy&#34; is...  It's blue.  Really really really dark blue, but it will still look funny against your black socks, even the faded ones.<br /><br />You're welcome.  ;-)<br /><br />Other than that, the pants are fantastic!  I am 5'7, 153ish, with a 33&#34; inseam.  I have both a Medium and a Large pair.  The Large ones get more use from me, as that pair is black, and I tend to like my clothes pretty loose.  Also, I can easily layer a pair of Underarmour-type yoga pants underneath, which is great for Chicago's Polar Vortices...  I put the Medium ones on when I am doing something where a closer fit makes sense.  Somehow, both sizes have legs long enough for me, without being too long, which is AMAZING!  If I could find them again in black, I'd buy two or three more pairs in each size.<br /><br />Enjoy!  I hope that helps!
B006BQET18|4|muy bueno el producto en calidad y precio justo de acuerdo a lo mostrado al momento de la compra muy buena tela muy fresca me gusto
B00GQORN4A|5|This hat is a facial and a nice color. I can wear it to every coat and jacket. I liked everything and they say that I look young.
B002AQ45I0|3|too short.
B00GTQKQOE|5|This shirt is a great shade of blue.  It washes well and is more than long enough to stay tucked in all day at work.  Husband is very happy.
B00LYJ5W9K|5|It's your standard classic sweatshirt and I think it is good quality especially for the price.  I, of course, love the screen print on the front, which is also of high quality.  Everyone should own one, obviously!!!
B002Q7C6IO|4|Great socks for working out in. Lots of compliments received. Lots of smiles. Lots of laughs. Makes great gift for awesome friends.
B00EAPDS6Y|5|To avoid complaining how it fits I made sure to measure myself properly before ordering , and so the black chinos look great and are multipurpose
B002FU5YHC|4|I tried another longer size and it was too long. I wear these but feel really silly with my socks always showing
B00IT5CV0U|5|Perfect!
B00GOL1NYG|1|absolutely awful
B00RAWK28G|5|Cute, nice quality
B00IGGR2VK|5|Beautiful swimwear, great quality.  This suit was impossible to find until I tried Amazon.
B00RAPRKIS|5|Love Vince camuto full cut.  Perfect for my figure!
B008KYP0V2|5|This bra is so great I love the fix. I didn't have to worry about it sliding at all, I'm getting another one!
B00M1IFM98|5|I ordered this dress about 10 or so days ago and it arrived waaay earlier than expected and it arrived on the day I needed it!! Halloween!  I wanted to go to a few parties as a sexy leopard!  I already had shoes and a purse to match so it was perfect!<br /><br />I read the reviews and it was good but had me a lil nervous because I was afraid a &#34; one size&#34; dress wouldn't fit ...well, it probably could've been slightly bigger, but it still looked great on me! I got many compliments and looks....<br /><br />I'm small in stature;5'0&#34; and I'm chubby lol I wear a size 14, the dress says &#34; one size &#34;, but actually its a small- medium and its stretchy! But not as stretchy as other materials.<br /><br />In short if you are short and not top heavy, a lil curvy id say buy it! Wear a shaper underneath if you're worried about belly bulge or anything unflattering like that...great buy..beautiful ..arrives on time...inexpensive ....buy it!
B00CBBFRCM|3|The waist part is very high so you have it wear it down on the hips for it to even stay on.
B00KJM2CZA|4|A shirt that represents The Walking Dead. Awesome shirt, great purchase. Thanks!
B00IP8BHZQ|5|Was perfect for my daughter's class project
B00CHNNXOI|5|Covers over the ears, but doesn't get in the way of my anchor point when bow hunting.  This hat serves me very well and will probably get another just to have an extra in my vehicle.
B00K1B0YKE|5|soft and cuddly pajamas :)
B002JIO2KU|5|My boyfriend loved it! Definitely a good wallet for a good price!!
B00NTMZFNS|5|Fits good
B00P7TRF0C|5|Love the shirt!
B00BZ7J5XA|2|Runs small, order a size bigger than you need. Other than that is is an ok shirt for the price
B00IDZTUTQ|5|Lightweight, supportive, doesn't gap and is smooth under tshirts. Most comfortable underwire bra I've had in a LONG time!
B00EF7QS50|5|Looked everywhere for this hat,  love it!
B00GH69EBW|1|The fabric is rough and uncomfortable even after washing. Its cheap and stays wrinkled and firm. Not something I want to sleep in.
B00LUTLIGU|5|Very happy with this order, but as I replied on the order of the halloween unisex onsie order made the same day I am very unhappy I sent this to my GRANDSON.  In the picture it appeared orange not pink around the neck, I did see the bow but it was labled unisex I figured the bow could be removed.  I have heard nothing about a reimbursement or something to make it right!  I would like some kind of response!
B00QKEG74S|5|fits well ,quality is good too ,im happy with this purchase ,finally found a coverup thats not so long to cover the whole butt.<br />im 5'5 ,115 , s fits me a little bigger than the model pic.
B00F3IDCAE|4|I ordered these leggings because they had good reviews and at a good price. I was nervous about the one size fits all since I am 5'1 and weigh 117 I was worried that they would be to large or fall off easily but they fit well and stayed up on my waist. The only complaint I have is I thought they would be a little thicker than they are and my boyfriend said sometime he can see my underwear if I bend over, so I have been wearing them with long sweaters. I ordered both the dark red and navy and they are both true to the color.
B00T297AJO|5|I haven't worn in hard rain yet, but works well in light to moderate rain. Took forever to find a small size for a low price. But this was it!
B009NR52Y0|5|Fit just right! And very pretty.
B00GBK6RJG|1|This does NOT look as nice as the photo. It is a little different and it looks so cheap!
B00FEXHJPC|5|My daughter absolutely loved her kritter hat.
B0046482LA|1|Grew my own for free, this is nothing like Bryan Cranston's. It is great if you want to look like Ali G.
B00DZYWYIE|4|Good
B00IP86ICI|5|excelente
B0090I6H8W|2|Also the coloring isnt as pictured. The red is actually a dark pink =/
B00GSD71H8|5|Really nice jacket in the grey plaid. I am 5'2&#34;  120 lbs. I ordered small .  This jacket runs<br />small. It is a fairly tight fit with very little room for multi layers. It looks really good on,<br />nicely tapered at the waist and long enough . The sleeves are on the long side but<br />that is OK with me.<br />The neck area is a bit too tight when i zip it up all the way. This not the way i<br />usually wear my coats. I like the way the fake fur zips off. The entire hood<br />is removable as well. I really like this coat!
B00CBKP962|5|Great item. Got this for my nephew n his 4th grade class to show support for my sister - his aunt - who has terminal Cancer. Thanks Amazon.
B00BK7XF5Y|4|The quality on this was not the best but it was half the price of the real jersey so overall still a good buy.
B00MMRBC4C|1|Cheaply build and too big. I'm a size 4 and the belt was huge on me.
B00LCH44WU|5|I purchased that dress for a wedding as a guest, fits perfect, show some curves, beautiful soft lace, not too short like other lace dresses out there. Would recommend it to anyone, that is looking for something simple yet stylish.
B00IAMRGQQ|5|Exactly as described and pictured - just what I wanted.
B00KM2PD5S|4|Great dress
B00NNQSXT8|5|Very nice fit.
B00K8D024I|4|This product is very nice and does the job I need it too do. I only have 2 complaints. My thighs are bigger at the top so the shorts roll up and leaves, what i guess you can say is a panty line. It causes my butt to have a awkward shape and is more of a spillage look. From behind it looks great, but behind you can defiantly tell I'm wearing it!
B007T27LQS|5|The trunks are stitched nicely, the color was true. Would recommend. They also dried quickly after swimming, which was a nice plus.
B006P2F6T2|5|Great material and comfortable, very easy to use.
B009DF3WFI|3|The waist seems very tight for this sz 10 - 12 body.  The sequins falls off easily and you leave a trail of where you have been. But it is pretty.
B0011N245Y|5|Somewhat larger but overall best nursing bra and after 3 kids I have tried a few.
B0092GWOI4|5|They only had medium in stock, and I usually wear large, but I wanted it so I rolled the dice and was pleasantly surprised that the medium fit perfectly.  I haven't washed/dried it yet, but will avoid the dryer just in case.  So it fits a bit large (which worked out perfect for me) if you like a form-fitting t-shirt.  Would recommend.
B007C4GHS6|5|I use these on the legs of my chairs instead of the chair pads. They work great.
B002PORDOA|3|the thing isnt evan  one isde is diffrent size than the other its lop sided and it dosent say witch is front or back
B00WVFIQSU|5|super cute and comfy
B00JAI5DW8|5|I am shocked at how nice this dress is!  Very, very comfortable and very, very flattering!  I bought an XL and it fit perfectly (I wear a DD and was worried about the fit.)  I would recommend to anyone!
B00282KOYK|3|Item looked like the picture. It was too big though. Shipping was not what I expected. It was too late to return, so sadly it was not really used.
B00UZKQPZY|5|WOW! great tie for any occasion.
B00RR06442|5|Cute, cute, cute!  Soft - well made. The parents, especially mama, LOVED these shorts.
B0043M67US|5|were a gift for a young man and I believe he really liked.  I know I was really pleased with the pics.
B004YJQ174|1|I wish I would have listened to the other reviews. The med/large are three times longer than they should be (I'm not short). Seriously... when held up in front of me, they almost reach the top of my head. they are also way, way, way, too small in the tigh area. They can barely be pulled up correctly and obviously won't stay pulled up because the thigh/waist is made terribly! I showed them to my friend who is even taller and skinner than I am, and they fit her the exact same. She said there is no way she would purchase these/this brand and I'm SO wishing that I would have listened to the other poor reviews. I'm out the money and have terrible tights to show for it that are not created proportionally right!! :( So disappointed!
B0058SLVF2|4|We bought these because my husband wanted low socks for his boat shoes. These socks are a great buy - definitely worth it!
B008LI7MHM|5|Thank you
B00LQKXKWS|1|Coat is not sized correctly. The chest is way too small and the hip is too large.
B00OWDGQRC|5|Great colors! The flexfit is always nice because it stretches to fit u perfectly.
B00JY3FBTO|1|Very poor material
B00F5Q5GLC|5|Had this altered for my daughter and removed all the patches..cute and good quality.
B00SR5VT6O|2|I am 5'6&#34; and 128 pounds.  I usually wear a size 4/6 pants and a size small top.  I have a little belly remaining from pregnancy.  My bust is 34&#34;, and the size small of this dress was draping off of me.  It was so big on me that I was able to pull it off my body without unzipping the entire back side.  I might recommend this dress for a curvy, beautiful shape (Marilyn Monroe/Jennifer Lopez) instead of girls with boyish figures.  I definitely have hips, but I don't think I could be called curvy.  This dress is not suitable for too formal of an event.  It needs a slip, still.  The fabric is rough and stiff, and it definitely was not high quality material.  I think it would be beautiful to wear as a guest of a baby shower, wedding shower, or formal lunch, but do not plan to wear it to anything more formal than that.  It is such a cute design, but it does not work for me.
B0059MJNLQ|5|I was very satisfied with my gift and the quality of it. It was very beautiful and each detailed matched what was presented on the display online. My package came on time as well.
B00M2M04DM|3|I ordered XL when usually use S, nice blouse.
B00ZDTQ67E|5|I just received the package and could not wait to try on the dress.  I purchased it to wear to my Nephews outdoor wedding.  The fit is wonderful and it is so comfortable.  I did go one size larger than what I buy my jeans and shirts because for some reason I have always had to do that with dresses.  It is a perfect fit not big but not tight.  Pure comfort!  The sleeves aren't hugging your pits and there isn't that fat bulge that can happen with tight shoulders.  I really recommend for any women to try one of Sakkas dresses or blouses they are so pretty and so comfortable.  The other pieces I have bought of theirs I have only gotten compliments and asked &#34;where did you get that&#34;.  I make sure and let them know.
B000WTREOY|5|My son loves it!
B00CNZ0K64|5|I bought several outfits for my little granddaughter who is five.  She is a clothing Diva!  it fits perfectly as all the outfits do.  The style and quality is perfect.  She will be a well dressed little girl for kindergarten this year!
B00A6N32RO|5|Well, it is. Very figure flattering. A bit long...but overall fits as expected. Nice shirt with jeans and boots and a movie date. Probably not for office unless you want the girls to get attention. Now, don't get me wrong...this is not a trashy looking shirt...it is simply sexy. If you have any belly issues, bust out the spanks and party on.
B00LFGV5FM|1|Doesn't even look like you pews on the picture poor quality
B00K56LO5Y|5|I bought these for my daughters and they LOVE them. They say they are so comfortable they want more pairs.
B00FJJ2U1E|4|makes a beutiful top on my 5'9&#34; wife, but too short to be a dress
B00M4UFH52|5|These pieces are very confortable and fresh, wonderfull
B002QREFKG|5|For me and is great stretch belt
B003IFUTDM|4|but its cause i have thinker thighs
B002ZCY0MA|5|Excelente
B007CFD9BI|5|Very warm and comfortable.
B00EO5ZYUS|1|Hated it.
B00WH53XAU|1|Not the same as pictured and they do not stay on your feet.  Waste of money.
B00KBULWWO|5|These were better than expected - so soft, thick and the colors are bright - I would buy them in every color - my son wears them everyday.  Great buy
B00FEF1SJ8|4|I have no problem  with this fits good but I would like to hve it deleted from my account  Thank You
B00N422D56|4|This is the 3rd suit from this company I've purchased & this one was just a little too small, but the other two fit perfectly. I assume it's just a minor variation based on slightly different styles.
B00L7NZD2Y|5|It was the perfect fit
B00AAQTIX4|5|Good
B00DMI20T6|4|Not for a short girl as the gold &#34;belt&#34; will go too far down waist.  Must tie up tight in front.  A bit see through at the butt, but okay for night.  Would buy again.
B000A38CRU|5|I bought these and the fleece-lined version by Wrangler. These are almost as soft inside as the fleece-lined version, so just as comfortable. The pockets are lined with regular jeans pocket material, if you're concerned about the fleece pockets in the fleece version (worried about keys punching holes?). On the other hand it's nice to have the warmth of the fleece-lined version for when I stuck my hands in the fleece pockets. I was comfortable wearing these inside and out when it was single-digit temperatures, but when it got to the 20s outside it was too warm wearing them inside. REALLY nice having them when it gets really cold. May cause you to forget you have a regular shirt on and you might go outside without a jacket - a bad idea if it's really cold.
B002VAX52M|3|So far I really like the bag, it has a ton of room on the inside, but is not too big to carry around.  I did not get the color I ordered.  ShopBags emailed me to let me choose another color or cancel the order.  I appreciate this since I've had other stores just substitute without contacting me.  The only issue I had was when I did email them my new color it still took a long time  to get it.  I placed my order Dec 23, was emailed and replied back Dec 30 and did not receive my shipment until Jan 14th.
B0094VLYZG|4|Product came as expected. This was an attempt to put &#34;spice&#34; into things. I liked it, the wife would be been happier, if it would of fit grandkids instead?
B00BTO3IV4|5|The shirt is an excellent fit for him.  Looks absolutely delicious on him.
B0073W2BJG|3|should have ordered the next size up
B00UTEDZOA|4|Take heed! I read the reviews before purchasing and knew the dress was going to be sized smaller, so I ordered it larger than I normally would. It does not come lined but for the price, custom lining and custom tailoring are worth it.
B00NCF0ZA0|2|&#34;I ordered the large size.  It was way too small.  I have a &#34;curvey&#34; type of body and these did not fit me very well. My life style is more practical and while these panties are just beautiful, the material was rather flimsy and probably better suited for a 20-something young woman.
B00IIXPO0M|5|Just beautiful..just as described. Received quickly..and it is very pretty.
B00V9XR9Y2|2|This is not what I had expected.  There is no shape to the product. Unlike the picture it is straight on either side there is no curve.  It does pull things in, but not in the shaping way I had hoped.  I find the picture a misrepresentation
B00HUS792M|4|No issues. Great product.
B00IXKP1J4|1|I ordered a MED! And not only does it take forever to come in,<br />which I didnt mind at the time cause of the price came in a XL!<br />I have ordered lots of stuff from another country I hope all of my orders<br />arent messed up! Was very happy with Amazon till Now......
B00JUFOUWU|5|Very nice material that is soft. The colors are nice and the same as the picture. I'm very pleased with the product and can't wait to bring my baby home wearing it.
B002AQJP2Q|3|i wear a 32dd and my boobs are heavy and do sag a little…they don't ft in the tape…wish it was wider maybe it would have hold better...
B00G5084SO|4|Bought these for my kids  (they are now big enough to wear adult sized shoes and socks) and they love them. They are normally hard on socks but these seem to be wearing well even though they are not a thick sock. Will buy again .
B00X9SM3OG|4|You have to make sure you read the sizing chart before ordering this item. The size I ordered was 2 sizes larger then anything I have ever ordered. If I had just chose a size according to what I normally order item would have been way too small. Using g their sizing chart I ordered accordingly and item was a perfect fit and I love it
B00X6QV4SW|5|I bought this dress to accompany a friend to a wedding. It was phenomenal. As someone who is top heavy it is increasingly difficult to find a dress that fits the bodice comfortably, look spectacular and is not too revealing. The length was perfect, hitting a little below the knee for my 5ft 9 inch frame. Based on other reviews I bought an XL but would probably have been fine with a L since I did have some room. For a little oomph I bought a petticoat underskirt but the dress would have still been beautiful without it. I will be getting this style in other colors because the look is so versatile. I also added a black belt for added flare. You wont be disappointed with this dress no matter how you wear it.
B001SLB6JO|5|Fits nicely.  Wish the strap adjustment was in the front rather than the back, but couldn't find this style with that feature.  Nice quality. very comfortable
B005HKDN3Y|5|I bought the silver tone and worn it with a dressier outfit, as well as jeans and baggy shirt...it looked great with either style! It fits very well, hangs nicely, isn't too shiny nor too dull which adds to its appeal of flexibility with many styles and outfits. Seems true to size & am very pleased with it. Have owned it only a short time & am hoping it doesn't corrode. Nice value btw!
B0085IPJ2S|5|These are for a sexy night with your hubby/ boyfriend etc. very comfy. Would recommend to friends ...but not family..lol
B00OXB0GN8|1|hate it - the print is barely visible
B00DUYXF2S|4|It won't stay closed but other than that it's perfect. Material is heavier than a t-shirt. Doesn't look cheap. Can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can wear it out!
B00H8Z6BAI|5|I gave this as a gift but she opened on Christmas Eve and appeared to love it. The color was red and vibrant. It looked great on her when she tried it on.
B008RWDPUK|5|Way warmer than a fleece.  It's been nucking futs cold in Michigan this winter and I've worn this thing over my columbia interchange XLT parka, (I ordered a 3XL) and it's been beautiful.
B00AW783GO|1|These gowns were part of a large number of items that I sent as a &#34;new baby girl&#34; gift. The new parents were delighted with these as they were with everything else. So much fun to see the new little one wearing these bright and happy clothes. They launder and wear well.
B00CBEL9FS|5|Is how I feel when I wear this hoodie.  Oh, and I'm super warm.  I couldn't really tell from the picture, but it has this very cozy fuzzy lining.  It does seem a little small, but they do warn in the ad that they run small, so I wasn't really sure how to rate it, since I expected it to be a little snug?  But it is smaller than I would expect the size I purchased to be normally.  If that makes any sense.  The pockets are placed strangely, and I had to get used to where they were before I could reliably be assured that my hands would land in them, rather than flailing about wildly in front of my person, but once I got used to them, they were fine.  Really, I think they were placed where they were to avoid the very common added bulk that hoodies provide to the tummy area, and so I for one, and prepared to learn a new pocket location rather than look like I have a pooch.  Also, ya know, if your pockets are drooping out in front, your ninja assassin skills will be greatly inhibited.
B003MVZ0PY|3|I bought this for my 6.5 year old boy. The sizing they gave me seemed like it should fit. However, when I received it, shirt was HUGE. It will not fit him for at least 3 or 4 years. It fits me!!!
B00IVDOUF4|5|Very young looking. Love it!
B000W4524I|5|This cloak is perfect- long and full.  I tried it on my 6'5\\" husband and it came down to his ankles... I am ordering another one to go with his Death Eater costume.  I will probably put a temporary hem in mine when wearing it to crowded places so that no one steps on it.
B00CBELJP8|2|This arrived with one buttonhole (lower collar button) uncut, and all buttons loose. One button even has the end of the thread loose and pulling. Definitely not the quality expected for the price.
B005R4WQ2E|4|nice
B00NOAIMS0|5|Perfect fit & great price!
B00ILYPUI4|2|Am I bigger than I thought? Got these - black and white - and I thought they ran a size smaller! Plus, I washed them and they shrank even more. I'd say just pick up a tank top at walmart as this is about the same quality and fit.
B00KWMSPO4|5|Stretchy material that fits comfortably and is perfect for those hot days!
B00JD41YRM|2|Hi, I really wanted to have this bathsuit, but there are a lot of things I didnt like the item. Firts I saw after i received was that the colour is not as shown on the picture. It is shonw orange, but its real red on live. Also the bra doesnt fit at all, it it wrong made and not only me, another my girlsfirend also try it, but it fits to nobody. Also the materia is not very quality.
B000MC68PC|5|The dress came in a very timely manner and was just perfect.  My picky little princess absolutely loves the gown.  She looks like a mini bride.  The gown is good quality and fits true to size.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B00HF9PQBM|5|Awesome thanks I'm an Army veterans wife I wear it with pride
B00K3DG0IK|5|This shirt is very nice. I enjoy wearing it, especially with jeans. Nice material and well-made. I can't believe that I got it for only $.99!I would buy more colors if they were available.
B00X8SGGMW|2|Looks great but it was to small for my wife she wears all others in the 2-3x plus and they fit.
B000YT6W6I|5|I like the freedom of wearing tops without a bra. These covers work great! You just put them on and you're ready to go.
B00L3PYS9A|5|Very cute
B004CVKLDY|4|Nice looking shorts that fit true to size in the waist. They are a bit tight in the thighs. That will only be an issue for those with large muscular thighs. By tight I do not mean constricting but just that it is noticeable when I sit. Other than that the fit good and wear well. As previously stated they do wrinkle a bit out of the dryer but then again so do most of my nice shorts. Dry clean if you need to have that just bought look each time you wear them.  Took a star off cause I'm not in a five star mood today.
B00NOOE41U|5|All of you that say these are to small are probably to heavy for the size you bought. Buy bigger sizes to fit your bigger bodies
B00E81HVRW|5|I got this as a gift for my hubby. He is a big fan of Breaking Bad, but doesn't like to where T-shirts with huge logos, so this works perfect. The quality of the graphic looks good and doesn't seem it will fade or wear off. Seems to be a well made T-shirt and this is coming from an exbuyer in the fashion world.
B00L65T9V4|5|I'm a 34D and I ordered the small. It fits well and is supportive and very comfortable, I love it!
B008I5804W|2|As you can see by the picture on your website the length of the legs end at the knee. On the shorts I received the length ended several inches below the knee. I felt as though I was wearing Capri's for men. The waist size was fine.
B00KE8HQ8W|4|Very comfy! Very awesome! I am only 5'4 feet tall, so it had a lot of length even with the fold over, so I cut some of the bottom off and it still looks awesome and holds together well. I am using the bottom parts to make into hair bands to wear with other outfits. I also am mentioning the length so that if you are a tall woman...and I mean much taller than I am...say even if you are nearing 6 feet, (or wear heals a lot) this is a great option for you. We all have our own height & shapes to consider when it comes to clothing. As for shape, if you are curvy or slim, it looks awesome. I am very curvy and it looks great. Frankly, it feels like the comfort of pajamas, but is nice and dressy. I will order more soon!
B00O8YS9TS|4|great fit....will order another pair
