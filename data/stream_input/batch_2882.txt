B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great game. Wish there were more opportunities to get free pearls. Fun for kids. Visually pleasing. Love getting new fish. Would recommend this game to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun game. I wish there were more levels though. It's challenging enough to stay entertained and easy enough to where you won't get bored.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think it's an awesome game  and the best part it's FREE!!! I wish more Disney games are free. I am going to 8th grade an l love it...
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Needs more information and pictures to go with the words. Everything is good.<br />Needs more words. Could use pictures to go with some of the words. Also needs more information for the words.

0670022411|5.0|I received this book right on time as stated.  It was in excellent condition-I was very pleased with that.  I am kind of picky about the quality of my books, and this one was very nice.  I would definitely buy again from this seller.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|In enjoy Bottoms and Scissors.  It is a very cool matching game. It helps keep my mind sharp.  When I can't sleep I am on the game for hours. Also very good for long road trips.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out!  Thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy....a great read for any Hunger Games fans...and anyone who is just starting to read it out of order!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I'm really enjoying watching this series.  I did not realize that there was more than one movie to watch, its very interesting to see how they all lived at that time and how they all wanted to move up. I can't wait to read more.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I'm not sure why, but this wasn't the captivating read so many have suggested.  I never really felt absorbed in the world of the characters.  It's not a bad read, but I think it could be better.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|I collect Zac Brown Band. Besides other things they have very good vocals, better than many others. I wish them the very best.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|If you're ready to suspend your beliefs, this is a delightful read.<br />It was a bit too fanciful for my tastes, although there were some wonderful analogies that bore moments of reflection.  I came away with a few smiles, a quote or two to remember, and a recommendation for those thrusting for a fairy tale!
B00AMS38YU|5.0|Very enjoyable, edge-of-your-seat, movie. I won't ever think of bike riding in the same way. Good cast and good story.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I have a brand new kindle fire and after I downloaded the game, it said I had to upgrade my system so I did. That took forever, then it stopped so I had to do it again. Then when I tried to open the game, the screen just went black.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|What a great series.  Can't seem to get enough.  Glad my daughter shared this show with us. Gotta love the women in the office.
0634089358|5.0|I have bought several blues bass related books and this one is the most comprehensive so far. It starts out with basic info and walks you through more complex topics.  If you are starting out on bass and particularly if your focus is blues this should be in your library.
B0084RSZKI|4.0|It's not an &#34;Eddie Murphy&#34; movie. It's a movie that happens to star Eddie Murphy. It had a nice message to it. I liked it.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I love cheesy action, and I love The Rock, but the story line wasn't a smooth and clear as it could be. Doesn't matter all that much in a movie like this, but would have been nice. It's not terrible, and I'd probably watch it again, but it is definitely cheese!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Really liking this clock. Does pretty much what I want it to do, though I haven't had enough time fussing with it just yet to see if it's perfect. But I'm thinking I won't be disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I know these free apps are supported by ads, but this one is especially annoying since it changes every couple of seconds. very distracting.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It's great to see what I need to do to free up storage. My 1st Kindle Fire with 5.5mg. I received a message from Amazon about memory, almost. This app was recommended to me. Knowing that I needed to remove vs add info..This app helps free up space your using, and frees up memory. Basically, everything you do on your device, saves aka cached. There is storage info that you can't look at or edit. This comes with your device and It's a few mb.  I now have the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD. I have used this app many times since June. I would recommend this app if not as a necessity, or like now I keep up on what's stored or cached. Get it. It's worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it I get to know when my friends are online.Even,I love survival and the cave seeds thats nyan my and other seeds I love minecraft
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie is non-stop, and action-packed . . . if you love the Super Heroes . . . don't miss this one . . . they include everything!
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie is so amazing. Everyone in my family loves it. If you havnt seen it its only $3 and it is so good.
0385333846|5.0|Product received of very good quality. This is a fast shipper. Would purchase again. I feel price paid was a good value for the money.
031603438X|5.0|Keith has a surprisingly absorbing and entertaining writing style. He speaks to YOU directly from the page. No holds barred - everything you didn't know about life, generally, and specifically about one of the most extraordinary lives in rock music history, is revealed in these extensive pages. This book HAD to be written and only Keith could do it! So glad he did - its a keeper!
0316223239|5.0|Product received of very good quality. This is a fast shipper. Would purchase again. I feel price paid was a good value for the money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|When I started watching Downton Abbey last summer (2012), it quickly became one of my favorite shows on television. In fact, I'd say it's my absolute favorite show of those currently running. Season 2 builds on the drama of the first season and adds further plot twists leading into Season 3 (which also does not disappoint). I'm itching to get to Season 4!
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|Once again, both Henning Mankell and his hero Kurt Wallender do not disappoint! Our melancholy detective, actually has a ray of sunshine,  in his life. Two actually and the possibility of a third. They are all women; his daughter Linda, a new love Baiba, from Latvia and the beginning of an office friendship, Ann-Britt. In addition to followers feeling good about Kurt, Mankell writes a tight, brilliantly crafted, page turning mystery.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|this keeps up the pace of book 1 and is full of unexpected events. love it and looking forward to reading all of the books.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|This movie is a staple in my viewing library. I recommend it for everyone to watch, young or old. They don't make them like this anymore!
B0058DRUV6|5.0|One of those business books that should be on everybody's wishlist. This book gives some excellent research-based advice on how to take a good, mediocre company and make it great.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I was skeptical about buying the 40th or 45th anniversary editions of mary poppins as I just wanted an inexpensive disc without all the frills.  I read up on reviews regarding both editions and decided on the 40th anniv. one and couldn't be happier.  My kids love it and it has a little extra for adults to enjoy after growing up with just the vhs version!  definitely recommend this one and not the 45th anniversary edition.
B004EYT932|4.0|It is what it is. It's a data heavy book about the history of sovereign financial crises. Either that's your thing or it isn't. It's pretty dry and pretty detailed. But the authors did a great job of meticulously researching and finding approrpriate data and then drawing reasonable conclusions. These guys are clearly experts. Not an easy read at all, though.
1593082800|5.0|This is an awesome story.  Well written.  Held my interest.  I even stopped doing what I shouold have been doing just to read.  If you like 18ty century you will love this book.  I hightly recommend it.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Really great look at subject matter I had little to no idea about prior to watching. Great film overall, certainly presents the rivalry between Senna and Prost with a favorable view of Senna, but not knowing the other side of the story I cannot say whether the events transpired as such, or whether they are truly biased towards Senna (then again, this is a documentary about Senna, not Indy car racing in general).<br /><br />Would certainly recommend, especially before the hollywood remake comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This books are well written and has a pretty intense and dramatic story.<br /><br />These are all being adapted into movies so looking forward to them.
193700788X|5.0|I have read every Sookie Stackhouse book thus far and I was excited to read the final book in her series. I read the book in four hours not wanting to put it down. IT had everything a Sookie Stackhouse book should have. MYSTERY, ROMANCE, EXCITEMENT, SUSPENSE AND a resolution that was well deserved. I am a huge fan of Ms. Harris and she had done the series justice. If you are a die hard fan like me then you will love it!!
B004XISI4A|5.0|Well, Kindle + Game of Thrones = awesome.<br /><br />The book is amazing and kindle also. Online delivery for the book worked as it was expected, interesting story.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Great music for martial arts demonstrations as well.  And there are a couple songs that will give you goose-bumps.  Highly recommended for any Pacific Rim fan.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like matching symbols to symbols, these game will definitely suit your fancy.  Caution at each selection or the game wins.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 11 year old loves this minion game, he steals my kindle often to play it. Thanks.. really :) I mean it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It improves your concentration  skill by changing bad guys and giving new good guys to fight with as you go along.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|I like that his is so different from all the other aps out there. you actually have to move the Kindle around to try and get the ball where it needs to go. Fun, but very hard.
B005721Y7Y|1.0|\\"American Beauty\\", directed by Sam Mendes, is a drama from 1999.<br />Unhinged by his pretentious mid-life crisis, protagonist Lester Burnham encounters the endeavor of his lifetime: finding out who he is, what he wants and basically lavishing his life by smoking pot and doing things which keep the audience in perpetual disbelief.<br />The great acting of Kevin Spacey fades near the middle of the film, however, his daughter getting laid by the weirdo next door is the continuing exaggerated symbolization of the alleged, wannabe problems of American Society.<br />The ludicrousness is additionally supported by the real-estate agent Carolyn - incidentally Lester's wife and mother of one -, who apparently takes success for luck and her yard for flagship of social appreciation, underlining the obtrusively obvious and self-important enlightenment of problems of western civilization.<br />This masterpiece of a miscarried artistic tries, by hook or by crook, to push the audience into a mental status of finding the inner beauty, but unintentionally leading into a paralysis of continual boredom.<br />Carolyn's actress is, without a doubt, a good one, totally concentrating on her duty, what shall be stated as one - amongst plenty - other reason of the movie's annoying attitude. She is just playing her character so well that there occurs a very serious problem: the character in itself.<br />The shrieking of Carolyn Burnham is, by any means, one of the most significant misfits - unfortunately recurring every time you nearly forgot her presence.<br />American Beauty won prizes. Plenty of prizes.<br />Admittedly, I would have honored it with a well-known prize as well: the GOLDEN Globe - noo, just kidding - the GOLDEN RASPBERRY Award.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It is time to get the game candy crush saga in the app store!!!!!!  I have it on my p<br />phone i and i really want it on my kindle. Please put the game in the app store.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The author did a good job in filling in a lot of material of Jesus' life not generally known by the average person.  But he let his scepticism of the gospel story slant his findings too much.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I don't usually like zombie shows, but love the characters and their interactions.  The zombies are secondary to the story line and now I know how to kill those scary things.
B00DQR26EC|3.0|While I did enjoy this game,  I had a hard time playing it because it constantly froze my kindle forcing me to restart it.  I finally gave up and uninstalled it.
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|This guy is a powerhouse guitar player.  I wish he would make an album that showed he is a powerhouse guitar player.  This is a good album.  Very mellow with some country tones to it.
B001XULSG6|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie of the Star Trek Next Generation series. It has great action and plot to include two very suspenseful plot lines to boot! I would highly recommend this to any STNG fan.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I purchased two of these and they lasted only 4 weeks.  The point where the cord connects to your item became so loose that the cord wouldn't even stay in to charge.
B007HVBW2A|4.0|The very original &#34;possession&#34; movie! It is a must see if you want to find out where all of the horrors of today get their inspiration.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|The development of the characters is slow but very much in depth, which is typical of Oscar Wilde. Reading this book reminds me of old, very old television movies, where the acting is overdone and even funny. However, the plot is good and the ending is maybe suspected.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|This self-penned work has it all. Young son of a semi-prosperous musician does the rebellious art school thing, forms a band, struggles, enters into petty feuds and legal entanglements with bandmates, gets the right breaks, writes hit songs, tours the world, goes solo, drinks too much, suffers from chronic anxiety, discovers mysticism, enters into a series of relationships, marriages, breakups, ages and achieves a level of moderation and wisdom. There, you have it.<br /><br />Who I Am draws the reader into Townshend's self-absorbed world. It spins the all too familiar rock star yarn, but how can you not root for this guy? He's the consummate multi-tasker. After all, he just wants to be productive. It's all about his craft, whether it is a song, manuscript, rehearsal or production. He can do them all at once as well as juggle chainsaws.<br /><br />The book does not have an upbeat feel, but appears highly confessional. He devotes ample attention on the subject of child pornography and his brief legal troubles that threatened to compromise his reputation. After a police search of his office computer revealed questionable material, we learn that Townshend was beginning research for a self-searching book about his own personal experience perhaps being molested as a child.<br /><br />All in all, an engaging read and a compelling look into the complex psyche of a guitar maestro.
B005WYFLNU|3.0|Honestly, I knew what I was getting into because of the previous reviews, but for lack of an alternative, I still gave it a go. This is ridiculously girly... We have a Melissa and Doug sticker set where we can dress the girls in regular clothes -shirts and jeans and shorts and some dresses too, so I thought this would be similar. Instead, this is weddings and beauty pageants! My 2.5 year old has fun with it (with our help) but I just can't stand how gendered it is. She doesn't recognize a lot of the clothes (long gloves and sashes) because they're so outside of her experience. Couldn't we have a reusable sticker set where we can dress girls and boys in everyday clothes? Wouldn't little boys like that too? Melissa and Doug are missing an opportunity here - ALL little kids are obsessed with their everyday tasks. Why not make it fun and realistic for everyone?
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie in theaters. I will definitely buy a copy for my video collection. I was wondering is the digital copy for itunes or is it ultraviolet?
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game be sure to by this my little cousin loves this game great for 7-21 this game is awesome  and it's no ripoff  well have fun
B0011EU0NG|4.0|Our whole family enjoyed this movie, particularly my 6 year-old son.  The kids in the movie and cute and sincere, not obnoxious or sharp-tongued like kids are in many modern movies.  Dick Van Dyke is great, singing and dancing.  He has some really great numbers.  The movie does have its slow moments, i.e., when they sing slow and not-so-memorable songs.  And it was one of the worst bad guys I have seen in a kids movie; I even remember him from when I saw the movie in the theater 40+ years ago!  My son was VERY scared of him.  He wanted to turn it off, but he kept watching and felt much better when the situation improved for the protagonists.  The movie also has some very magical moments, like the scene in the candy factory and when Mr. Potts and Truly Scrumptious dress up like big dolls and entertain the king.  These are special moments in movie history that should be shared with everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome, very addictive.....despicable fun! I don't play many games but will admit that I'm hooked on this game. I also have this on my iPhone and play every opportunity I get.
B000QUEHNK|5.0|2013-09-04
B008MWBY6W|4.0|If you plan to carry just one camera and lens, this case is a great choice. It's sturdy and will absorb shocks without transferring them to the gear inside. It is also small enough to allow you to carry it and move about without feeling burdened or awkward. If you prefer, as my husband often does, more than one camera and several lenses, then this case will not serve, but when you anticipate needing only one, this is a very good buy, or when you can carry more than one case, this is a great addition to your gear.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I thought of all the ghost stories l have seen,  there would never be one that was as scary as \\" The Others\\".  This one hit the mark.  Don't see this movie alone.  I did.  I started seeing shadows around my living room.  I was creeped out.  A  very intense plot that makes you jump,  scream and dream.  I  had to buy this flick.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nine Inch Nails...but lately they're stuff has been weak. This release however is fresh sounding. Not as heavy as other NIN releases but it doesn't need to be.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I became a die hard Downtown Abbey fan during season 2 so and I'm glad I went back and purchased this series from the beginning!  Just fantastic!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|My grandchildren would play this game for long periods of time.  I had to set a timer by the computer ton give them only 15 min each.
B005FPT51K|4.0|I love this camera, it is really nice and you can point to many different angles.<br />However the app is just ok, the image freezes a lot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome<br />it is so worth the money<br />you can build anything<br />I love battling monsters<br />it is so fun
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I was not overly impressed by this album upon my first listen to it, but now I can't quit listening to this album.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Love this song!! ! Makes me wanna dance! Lady Gaga is by far one of my favorite artists to listen to and every song makes me eager to see how she brings it to life in a video. Thumbs up!!
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Fun, dynamic, diverse cast. Cute, farcical, rom-com formula. Cliche-driven (embrace it!) characters driven away from and towards each others paths until they all converge into a single truth: Love is crazy. Love is stupid. Love is love.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I bought it as an audio book to listen to on a trip to the beach
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Don't understand the end<br />Why Prim?<br />TOO much at the final chapter that really think it wasn't necessary.<br />Hope for the results in the movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun like subway surfers. I Love it. It's so much fun that  I could play it all day. I mean that's how much I love this game!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season 2 was anticipated, I thought I would be ready....but it blew my mind!  I'm very, very pleased, and can't wait for more. Truly!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Excellent writing and Spacey is very good in his role...Can't believe Robin is the same gal that played Forrest Gumps hippy sweet heart...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Unexpected, unanticipated, simply great.  I didn't expect the sincere charm, the romance, the story [ies].  I simply fell in love!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app. This gives me up to the minute information about storms and warnings and watches.  I use this app all the time.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I LIKED THE BOOK. IT  WAS EASY READING AND IT HELD YOUR INTEREST ALMOST ALL OF TIME.  A LITTLE SUSPENSE WAS ALSO INTERESITING.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Its nice to see something from the Netherlands and Scandinavia, they have been sorely overlooked in mainstream television and movies for a long time. Having many Scandinavian and Netherlander relatives I enjoy seeing some of the history presented in this show.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Solid scenes with a decent storyline, great visual cues and more. I like Oblivion because it is a movie that speaks to the viewer about the spirit of man, the very essence which drives us to do what we do. I think that Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman turned in some very powerful performances in this movie, and so I think that my movie collection is a little bit more improved now just by having this one added to the collection. It's a decent sci-fi movie, so I think it can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't necessarily care about sci-fi movies.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I have always been a terminator fan  this is a great show  never did get why they canceled it and gave it no closure
B00B5SJEOO|5.0|The soundtrack to the movie is the best, if you've ever seen the original C:TB, then you know that one of the best things about the movie was its soundtrack, and not just the storyline, and the characters/costumes. I own the movie through XBOX live, and would always watch certain scenes JUST because of the soundtrack, so having the soundtrack is AWESOME because now I can just cloe my eyes and enjoy the orchestra without any talking or sword battles. If you're a fan of C:TB and haven't yet gotten the soundtrack, I would say go ahead and get it, it's wonderfully done and great MP3 quality.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is a fantasy novel with great characters, real drama, and no drawn out plot elements. I really was moved and absorbed by the characters once I read on and was disappointed to find that there wasn't a second one. Hopefully, there will be.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I got this for my Grandmother, she loves the show!  She now has six seasons to watch. Now she can watch it for hours :-)
B006S086AM|3.0|I think I liked the 80s music more than anything. It's a typical teen (or early 20s) angst movie. Nothing all that unique. We've all had summers like this.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Late to get started watching this but it is a great show, quality performances, good story lines. And this is just season 1, so lots more good stuff to come.
B00DDRKDUO|5.0|A phenomenal album by these Swedish black metal veterans and one of this year's surprisingly more diverse releases! Incorporating elements from flamenco, country, sea-chantey, doom, gregorian chant, tribal, and so forth, the result is a delicious Watain stew to be enjoyed by every raging black metal fan for years to come.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|didnt feel a part of the story. way to many things happening and the book was one big spoiler alert.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was able to just keep reading and reading. Nicholas Sparks was amazing. He was so vivid I felt like I was wrapped inside the book, living the story myself. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the emotional side of themselves as well as action and a bit of suspense. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has suffered abuse however.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read. I couldn't put it down and enjoyed every word. The person who did the translation was fantastic and really understood both languages. So well written and believable. I spent a lot of time looking up 'facts' which made me really enjoy the book. No spoiler because I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I did.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have never been so pulled into a story as I have these books. I am always eager to see where Eva & Gideon are going to take me next.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and the early plot. I fear the last 30 minutes were written by a studio hack rather than the original screenwriter giving it a somewhat contrived ending. But all in all enjoyable yarn with excellent acting from the child actors.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|Absolutely love the movie.. It's great to see such talent at a young age and seeing where their careers started..
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|anyone giving this movie 1 to 2 stars most likely have an iq of about 1 to 2.  its a sci-fi, it doesn't have to make sense!  staring tom cruise...meaning, tom cruise is gonna be in most of the movie!  reading some of the low ratings make me wonder how stupid some people are when it comes to understanding a movie...<br /><br />the movie is good...watch it...it's only 5 bucks!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game very much. Played it with children and found it to be very intriguing for them and tested their memory skills.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|Liked!  William Hurts character role.<br /><br />Liked!  How the human fell in love with the person (soul), not the appearance of the human.  So when she was transfer to another body, he felt he was able to feel that same love in that body.  Hope that makes sense and all!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Really like the interaction of these characters, great casting. A different take on Sherlock Holmes because it is set in modern times.
0684857219|4.0|good intro onto how body building started. im aslo learning a lot of new great workouts to rebuild muscle. gppd
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Good game but  it is difficult to remove 'creeps'. As creeps keep coming and coming, there is no other option except losing the game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm a wife and mother, this game is definitely better suited for a kid, but it is fun when ever I play it every once in a while.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|good game but less addictive than other Angry Birds Game. My child love to play it. Better if he get more options in this game
B00785P2QC|5.0|Such a good game!!! Once you play it it's soooo fun !!! And very addicting!! It's a must if you like Sims or anything close to that. Super cool to build your own city :)
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very popular and original Angry Birds Game. All our family members like to play this game. Thanks to Amazon for ad-Free version.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Mesmerizing , Amazing, and hard to put down.  Once I stared playing , I knew I finally found a game that would keep me occupied for more than 2 minutes.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|lots of options, lots of cage and other items to break. very much addictive. Ad-Free version definitely make it more attractive.
1931559317|5.0|You can't go wrong with this Atlas.  Makes a great tool and does not take up much room on you observing table.  I use a dome magnifier with it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a sensational page turner. It really does portray the message of unknown life paths so well. Great to dwell on the possibility of what if. Must read.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is amazing fun. It really gets you going. The only thing is that your rewards are too small sometimes but other than that, the game is great.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Once again, the studios are trying to screw over the fan.  What else is new?  Much like the New Line LOTR theatrical release discs, this first Trek 2 release has almost zero special features!  That obviously means they plan a second edition in the near future with better features etc. etc. etc.  I pre-ordered this blu ray expecting it to be similar to the first release.  It is not.  I'll wait and spend my money on the special edition.
B00DNO3JUI|4.0|I found myself totally engrossed in the movie, even though it has a &#34;different&#34; story line.  I had to get past the early part of the movie with a piano being left on a beach for days, and then only needing tuning to put it back in good shape.  This piano plays a major role in the movie. Without revealing more, I recommend the movie.  And no, I don't think it is a kid-friendly movie.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|A little slow in parts but then it picks up and keeps you guessing until the very end. Hang it there.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|It was way too gorry for my taste.  I admit that I did not watch the entire thing.  Lost interest
B009YN2M7S|3.0|I found it tedious and overly dramatic.<br />But maybe that is more realistic in real<br />life.  I just didn't enjoy reading it, but<br />had to see how it all ended!
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|There are so many extras included with this boxed set that you can not help but want to add this collection to your Twilight library.  Well worth the price.
B002LFVE4I|3.0|This movie was made by the same director who does Downton Abby and the plots are kind of similar. I love Maggie Smith in these kinds of movies. We watched the HD version of the movie on our new HD 60&#34; TV. It is an old movie and was converted from analog to digital. However, the picture was not sharp and the sound was bad. They spoke softly most of the time with an English accent and it was easy to not get what is being spoken. I would quit offering the HD version and just rent out the Analog version.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the complexity of this game.  It had some challenges that made me have to step back and reevaluate my plan.
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|Before Midnight...I went into that theater hopeful and expectant and happy to hear more about Celine and Jesse's life together and I walked out feeling conflicted. Primarily due to the explosive climactic scene in the hotel, I was completely stunned by the movie. It took a second viewing to hear some of the dialogue, digest the meaning of snippets of the conversation, and I suspect, much like I did when I was younger and not the ages of the characters at the time, I will only truly understand this chapter in their lives when I'm married. I'm barely 30 and it's nowhere in my mind. I won't spoil anything for anyone, but suffice to say, it will take several viewings to grasp everything.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: DEAR LORD, RE-RELEASE BEFORE SUNRISE AND BEFORE SUNSET ON BLU-RAY. I'll gladly pay for the format.  I've already pre-ordered Before Midnight.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|As a child of the 80's and 90's I saw my childhood flash by in this movie - just like I did when I watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.<br /><br />Little things everywhere, the Konami code to open the &#34;code&#34; area of the racer game, the graffiti in the background saying &#34;Leroy Jenkins was Here!&#34;, video game references in every nuance if you know where to find them, and if you don't notice them they don't detract from the movie.<br /><br />The characters were incredibly well developed, but still true to their original &#34;programmed&#34; purpose - in fact that's the whole point of the movie is breaking your programmed purpose.  Incredibly, don't pass it up.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works great watching mpg-4 movies from your computer on your TV.  Very nice to be able to move to the bedroom to watch the movies.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Fun movie, and would have been one of my favorites if but for two things. 1. Reinventing characters that I have always been a big fan of 2. How they reinvented them. Time travel always is messed up (except for comedy like Futurama or the Simpsons Halloween eps), but the paradox of this film could have a small truck driven through it. Ignore that and it is pretty great :)<br /><br />Watching this movie did make me feel better about Star Wars VII, since the characters and action were excellently done, plenty of humor, good battles, etc.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was just as good as the first one! Can't wait to read the next one all in one day!
0962477060|1.0|this book teaches the caged scale system which doesnt work and will tie your playing up in knots and tie your playing up in box shapes...there are two other systems that actually do work and will have you flying all over the fretboard with ease...these are ..THE STANDARD SYSTEM ..and the 3 NOTE PER STRING SYSTEM...if you want the ultimate scale book that teaches these better systems get GUYS SCALES MODES AND ARPEGGIOS by guy mcroskey
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I loved Boston Legal and I love The Good Wife.  Anyone who has any dealings with attorneys should watch this. because it shows it like it really is.
B0091REZMW|4.0|You know facebook game hurry up and wait. Good hidden object game but personally I think it takes up to much space.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|nice to have a portable option to sharpen my knifes. okay product for being what it is ...portable... good price
B00EIL7E9C|4.0|I am a huge fan of the show and I usually wait for each episode with impatience. This season though I found myself not that engaged with the story-line. Last season ended with a loud bang, with Bill gaining some scary powers and Eric, Sookie and the rest of the band running away from the compound. Here we see how the story continues and the series quickly jumps into topics that have to do with Warlow, Sookie's past and a powerful anti-vampire group.<br /><br />The premise of the story is not bad, but the first half of the season the execution is lacking. It almost feels as if the writers did not really know which direction to take this series in. Finally, in the second half of the season, the story picks up and the end is much better than the beginning. Overall though, it is clearly the weakest season so far and it has shown in the drop in ratings.<br /><br />Sadly, this was probably one of the contributing factors for HBO to decide that there will only be one more season of this show. I truly hope that the last season is better than this one and we get the ending that the series deserves. It would also be good if they go back to 12 episodes, since 10 feels a little short. When things started to get good, the season ended.
0345803485|5.0|its a good book if you look past all of the sex stuff. or for me it was. so yeah
B00DPY95D6|5.0|When I first started reading Cult of Mirrors I thought it was just a courtroom drama but it turns out to be much more.  It turns into a thriller with suspense and mystery around every corner.  I enjoyed this book a lot and i could not put it down at all while reading.  This is one of the best books that I have read all year and I have recommended it to all of my friends.
B006S53QCK|5.0|so sexy, it's beyond my words.  God bless Micky Roarke, he is so incredibly under-rated, such a shame he didn't make more movies.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is not a movie for everyone.  If you're not supposed to watch rated R movies or you tend to be offended by violence, don't watch this movie.  If you don't like fantastic action sequences or being thrown right into a gritty dystopian future that has been fleshed out effectively by years of comic book history, don't watch this movie.  If you don't like Karl Urban kicking ass, taking names, and grunting adrenaline pumping one-liners to a skyscraper full of drug-addled gangsters, don't watch this movie.<br /><br />Now that we got that out of the way...<br /><br />You ready?<br /><br />You look ready...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Liked this book, Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorites. Of course the end of the book was my favorite but I really liked the plot because Katie's character matches alot of other womens lives in todays society. On the outside she is a hard worker, happy, beautiful, and polite but on the inside there is much more to know. It makes me realize that I shouldnt be so quick to judge someone or stereotype them becausd you never know their story. I really liked how Sparks tied Jo into the novel as well. If there was more action and if this novel was more of a \\"page turner\\" for me then it wouldve received 5 stars... oh well, this definitely wont be the last Nicholas Sparks book that I read!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Though I haven't touched the special features, I've watched through all the feature films and I'm very happy with the purchase.  I'll admit I'm not a video- or audiophile, but as an Alien fanatic, I was not let down by either.  The casing is icing on the cake, as each disc is properly and safely stored in a beautiful (in a disturbing horror-science-fiction way) hardback page surrounded by images from the series.  I'm currently lending the Anthology to a friend, and he (an Alien newcomer) made the same remarks about the packaging.
B008PID7GS|4.0|I really really liked this book!  At first I found it kind of annoying because of the use of language and the poor writing skills, but having known what its like to be completely drowned out by addiction- having no one, having nothing, not even respect for yourself let alone others- I expect nothing less.  I was later upset when finding out that this book wasn't exactly non-fictional, many of the events that Frey stated in his writings are made up.... that just sucks.  But this review isn't based off of what I heard, its based off of the book.<br /><br />I found myself not being able to close this book easily.  It wasn't until my boyfriend complained of starvation and my thinking that his skinny butt might shrivel up and blow away that I had to make him dinner- lol!  But right after dinner I was right back to reading, and finished this rather lengthy memoir (so to speak) in about a day and a half.  It obviously wasn't the best book I've ever read in my life but I think I enjoyed it so much because I can relate to some of the things Frey says.
B00C2C637I|2.0|The earlier pages of this novel seem genuinely inspired, and I enjoyed them very much. Unfortunately, as the novel continues, I began to feel bored with it and felt that Bradbury had gotten disconnected from his muse somehow, had begun to imitate his own opening chapters, but without much success. By the end I had changed my initial perception and came away concurring with those reviewers here who describe the prose in terms such as false and annoying. Sorry.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I really liked this book. Although this was basically just an \\"introduction\\" book explaining the main characters and the roles they will play in the next books, it was still good! Ive been watching the show for a couple weeks having no idea there was a book series. So i quit watching the show to read the books and now that I am on the 2nd book (Flawless) I find that the details and things that happen in the books, so far, are actually quite different than the show. Actually, the characters and the roles they play are way different, too. Its actually disappointing when shows/movies twist things up to that degree... but nothing you can do but enjoy the books more. :) I will be a little irritated when I read the last book that has beem published recently and it probably STILL wont give me the answers I am looking for. Such as: Who is the 2nd A? And... who REALLY killed Alison? Cant wait to read more! :D
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game that I have ever played in my life my mom and my sister plade this game and loved it
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book! It most definitely wasn't what I thought it was going to be, and I was a little skeptical when purchasing a BOTM club book (Goodreads) but I liked it alot! The author threw me for a loop many times which I really like and overall I'd recommend for anyone to read it- it shows lots of optimism, as the main character, Patrick, talks about throughout the book and the true meaning of silver linings. To be honest, before I read this, I never really knew what a \\"silver lining\\" was.  I have heard others speak of them in context but just sort of pushed the thought aside.  Mental problems, no matter how small or severe, just plain suck.  I found myself feeling sympathy for the main character in this story and I was quite surprised when watching the movie because it shows a totally different ending then what the author writes in his literature.  Overall, I think this book is worthy of the 4 stars that I gave it and I would recommend it to others- especially people who suffer from some sort of mental issue, or have a family member that does.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|Perfect in Blue Ray, perfect price. perfect FARRAH! with subtitles in spanish, for Farrah´s fans and for the same tvserie fans!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Once you get used to it... you cannot stop playing.  The game play, the upgrades, and the multi player all make this game worth checking out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was so much fun. hope the new levels are ready soon. cant wait for them. its addictive. I love this game
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great for old eyes. Makes an excellent nightlight wherever you<br /><br />are.  Setup is fast and staight-foward.  Get the enhanced version for all the .<br />goodies.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|We saw it in the theaters, rented it and enjoyed it so much that we had to purchase it. The cast, the story and the location were perfect.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|why mess with a good thing.  Used this app for over a year and loved it.  Just opened it like any other night and got this mess.  sorry don't need facebook to get the weather.  bye bye weather channel I will find something like you were before.
B00CDCLL1A|1.0|It was mind numbingly boring and gratuitously complex.  It will definitely be one of the WORST MOVIES OF THE YEAR!!
B003730LRY|3.0|If you like the ghoulish overtones that permeate this picture (and that is the point), you can enjoy this movie.  I did remain moderately interested and there are some good scenes that I enjoyed but I don't think I'd watch this movie again, well, maybe at Halloween it might be fun.  I think the movie did do what it set out to do but this is niche comedy with a narrow audience.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Everything about this movie is excellent - the casting, the script, the look of the film, the musical score.  Truly a haunting adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel.  A must see.
B0020PJJHS|4.0|Quite a few actors have manned the helm of the James Bond franchise and they have all been pretty good but Mr. Brosnan has always been my favorite.  I think the key goal for a Bond is to be able to show that there is a man who can feel hurt and love beneath the iron exterior.  I think that the current Bond, Daniel Craig is doing a pretty good job too but I will always feel Mr. Brosnan did the best overall job.  This is the crux, for me, of what delineates one Bond picture from another.<br /><br />Of course, another reason to watch a Bond movie is to see just how cutting edge the technology is and how Bond uses it to beat the bad guys.  And of course the chase scenes are always great.<br /><br />It's hard for me not to enjoy a Bond film but its the peek beneath that Bond outer shell that is what I look for and this movie didn't disappoint.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I became an instant fan.  I admire the way in which they &#34;updated&#34; Sherlock Holmes.  The transition into modern times was flawless.  I enjoyed the pilot more than I did eposide 1 but was able to get right back into it.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|If you are looking to improve your health and lose weight easily then this is the way to do it. I wasn't hugely overweight I just needed to lose 4 kilos but I was concerned, at the age of 50, about my cholesterol and general health. This book makes huge sense and is something I intend to do for the rest of my life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|BOUGHT A NEW KINDLE FIRE AND WANTED TO TRY A TV SHOW TO WATCH. AFTER SEASON, EPISODE 2 WAS ADDICTED TO THE SERIES. JUST STARTING SEASON 3.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|This is supposed to play without an internet connection, but every time I start it up, it tells me I need an internet connection in order to play! I'm seriously tbhinking that I wasted my money on Kindle. I wrote to Amazon about the problem with this app, but never heard back. Don't waste your time with this app.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. A book you can't put down. I would love to see,The Art of Racing in the Rain, made into a movie.<br />I told my 13 year old grandson, when he reads this book, he will remember his Grandma saying, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain is going to be on top of YOUR! best book list\\"
B0012QO3WM|5.0|This band has never taken the easy way. This recording demands and deserves your attention.  If you don't want to focus on music in this way... go back to the pop stuff.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|this was sooo cool my brother almost stole it.  the quality is really nice and you would think this is almost the real thing
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|Must be a company ready to collapse.  Played one day and now no further without buying something.  Even tab marked free play costs money.  Forget it.
159463176X|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  It was so heavy with characters and plot lines I could barely follow along.<br />One chapter we're in Kabul, the next we're in Paris, one chapter a child is playing, the next that child has grandchildren.<br />A name mentioned in the beginning of the book may not pop up again till more than halfway through - at which point I'd nearly forgotten who they were or why they mattered. And none of the characters played prominently enough for me to care about any of them.<br />Rather than following seams that could have tied this story together, I felt like I was rifling through a bunch of loose tangled threads.  I finished the book two days ago and it would be a struggle for me to remember much of it.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Some songs were fantastic, a couple sounded like Chickenfoot, & some were so so. Still worth buying & adding to the collection. Joe is nearing 60, but still has unbelievable chops. He's just an awesome inspiration.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a big fan of the show . It is nice to be able to watch it on Amazon if you miss the show on TV.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What an wonderful, easy to follow manifesting guide book that really produces results! Tell your friends , it is worth it!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|It is mildly paced with well placed conflicts. However, seconday character development has voids. Overall, a nice story and is entertaining.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I love reading about Stephine Plum I love the characters and the writing,Hope they never end.Both the inbetweens with the different characters and the numbered
B00CF34B2I|5.0|For the money you pay for these cards, and the variety you get is great not that many duplicates and great rares that come with it made some great decks out of these cards i am definitely buying some more. for anyone trying to get back in the game this is a great way to get back into it..
0374533555|5.0|I love this book it gives you lots of insight on what is going on in the human brain. It talks about system 1 and system 2, it is a great read.
0061122416|5.0|This book is not advanced life philosophy like you might find in Eckhart Tolle (read everything you can by him), and I wouldn't necessarily use it as a guidebook for my future, but it is sweet, and an easy read.  Great for someone struggling with their purpose, and recommended for smart young adults.  Dumb young adults will only get the story....don't waste their time or your money.
B005D4YOEG|4.0|I have been looking for a Keen sandal for a while. I settled on the Newport. The shoe feels sturdy, the toe-guard front seems adequate. The only thing is the sandal is a bit heavy.
0739376969|5.0|lots of examples and stories to illustrate the steps leading to change  i have used this in changing myself and our organization
B00D8HNR2K|1.0|this thing is a a true turd without water, it does not float, trying too hard to be different, bunch of dumb sounds and even the lyrics are cheese, should of just kept this one to himself instead of trying to sell it to the public as his reformation or whateves, and everybody saying it's great are just going against the grain and trying to support, this is horrible, deleted it after hearing it, very bad. and he sings everything in like 2 sentences, takes a break and sings 2 more sentences, very annoying. your wife it hot but this the end of you i hope
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is such a crazy season! So much change and drama and heartbreak with loving times. My heart is dying to see next season!!
B00DHQHAH0|2.0|I loved season 1. It was smart and well written. Season 2 was a complete transition to trash TV. Mike's character has turned into a total sleaze and Harvey has lost a lot of his charm. The legal material has become completely unrealistic with &#34;big time&#34; lawyers acting extremely petty and unprofessional screwing over their own clients for some nonsensical personal quest. I will probably watch a couple episodes in season 3, since it still has a lot of potential but I'm hoping for more than what season 2 offered.
0385347774|5.0|The bk.. kept your focus for the whole reading. I am part of a bk. club and we all really enjoyed this bk.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Entertaining, but a little overt in the romance department.  Acting was fairly believable. Really, six more words required?  Come on Amazon.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldnt put it down! I love the way this author writes ideas that you think but wouldnt say outloud. I now have downloaded every one of her other books. The Hypnotists Love Story was even better tham this one if that is even possible.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I must say this thing is pretty nice.  Controlling from an android phone is so convenient.  It really needs a web browser and ability to play local media.  Other than that I can see so many possibilities for this as long as Google follows through with this and actually commits to making it a great device.<br />Google kind of has some history with Dumping devices if there not popular when expected.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I rarely travel anywhere and spend my hard earned money until I consult with Trip Advisor.  One gets reviews from actual users of Hotels, restaurants, etc.
B008Q00RJ0|5.0|The acting is great.  The script, direction, and dialogue was outstanding.  One of my all time favorites and it could be yours as well.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I'd been meaning to see this forever, since so many people recommend it, and I'm so glad I finally watched it!
B00AVTMB4I|4.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film, but I was drawn in and almost instantly emotionally invested in these characters.  It was an enjoyable movie that I would highly recommend.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I bought this dvd and did not watch it right away.  I it last week and even though Denzel is superb, the dvd skipped horribly.  I saw no signs of tampering when I received and actually left it in the shrink wrap until I went to watch it. I try to exchange it today and now it's too late.  So because I did not immediately watch the movie, I'm stuck with defective disc?  Booooo!!!!  So mad because I collect Denzel movies (I have all but 3 or 4) and this one I will not use for movie night or watch again on this disc because it skips so bad.  There should be exceptioons for this.
B001563I5C|1.0|This is the second time I have bought this movie and both times there was nothing on the disk. It is a favorite movie of mine but can't get it on DVD. FRUSTRATED with the manufacturer!!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Liked this movie, but I wouldn't call it a sci-fi classic. I do want to read the book(s) now; more business for Amazon.<br /><br />Most of the killing and gore takes place off screen, even though there are kids slaughtering each other throughout the film.<br /><br />A disturbing look at an alternate, earth-like world that is dystopic but still beautiful in many ways.
B009LDD54K|5.0|I recommend this series for anyone who is a fan of prohibition and mobster genre.  I never missed it. I have my 91 year old mom loving it.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I thought I got this app for my kids but found my husband having way more fun. It's very funny and we are really enjoying it.
B0030DHPGQ|3.0|Interesting self help business book.  Not sure if it really will help our business---time will tell.  Great examples used by the authors.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing books I've read. I can't wait to see the movie for  it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was very easy to install and works as advertised.  But Chromecast is still very limited:  From iPhone only UTube and Netflix and from my laptop PC limited to UTube, Netflix and anything viewed on my Chrome browser.  More apps need to be added to really compete with Apple TV and Rocu.
B005544V6A|5.0|Entertaining  -  it is hard to not to finish the series in one sitting. Offbeat drama on lawyers. Love it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is something my husband and I wanted to get and we finally did it.  Very happy with what we got..
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started this book and I was immediately hooked. I couldn't put it down and was disappointed when I turned the last page...I wanted more!!!! Excellent read!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|What a great book that can help all relationships! Short read and worth it. The five love languages makes sense and I will definitely recommend it to friends and family .
B005PK56TA|5.0|My wife and I are avid horror film addicts, so in between the blockbusters we look for unique shows that peak our unique interests.  This series is definitely a side step from most thrillers.  There's a great deal of sexual context, which depending on your comfort level can definitely make some uncomfortable.  The constant addition of characters and their subsequent development made this series hard to stop watching.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a different flavor of thriller.  My only disappointment was the last episode, but I don't know if it ties into the second season yet.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. This movie strikes me as genuine, acting is great, the story is awesome. I loved the setting in the south. What a great story!
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you're going to watch this TV series you'll need a few items, thankfully all can be received from Amazon! Frankly, the sex appeal is quite high throughout the series. Megan Markle looks like an angel, and so do all of the other women. I like to imagine Harvey and his huge... Well, I suggest you watch the show!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it! I was hooked on it ever since the 1st season. It's so good. Season 3 does not disappoint.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Honest and wonderfully detailed. A true literary gem. It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out how it will all end.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|extravagence on a large scale, talking about the roaring 20's more like roaring about the roaring 20's, like a lion. you def wont be disappointed, maybe at the 24 hour rental, might want to get it, when you have nothing to do the next day, so you can watch it twice, haters still found their way into the movie. watch it w/ your love romantic one, as its sad at the end and you dont want to watch it by yourself, you know how you get that titanic feeling., oh yeah if you buy the soundtrack and you will, buy the one that you download to amazon cloud, that way you get the deluxe version, the cd, doesnt have the extra different songs, for a two dallors more your get 6 more bad songs, enjoy the tracks i def do.
B003V4ASV8|5.0|I would say it is the best  book I have read this year and think it should be put into our list of books for our 2nd level students to read.
140006922X|4.0|I thought the book was very interesting and informative.  The authors choice of words I never heard of or understood was not appealing.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is awesome.  Lady Gaga new album Artpop will be interesting to listen too.  If u like lady gaga but this song!
B000FBJG04|5.0|Amazing story. Really kept me going.<br />It offers a more profound insight than the tv series. A great novel.<br />Loved it
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Slips into your pocket and the phone charges pretty quickly.A really good to have thing while you are on the go and have no option to charge.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is not only a great story, but so visually appealing!  Love the movie and the characters!  Great prequel!
B0076DELIG|4.0|It definitely held me as do most of Connelly's writing. But I think the ending was too contrived with the investigating woman showing up.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like mystery manor.  It challenges my mind by finding hidden objects. Which I like. This game is also fun for my older children.
0786962984|5.0|Wow this game is a blast from the past. I loved this game when I was a teenager and now I get to play this with my kids. This game is hours of fun times. You can easily add optional rules to make it complicated and more fun after the core game has been enjoyed to the point of familiarity. This is a good first &#34;adventure&#34; board game, if they like this, get them hooked on Talisman next.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love this app. but would love it even more if I didn't have to pay to use music as my alarm
0743270754|5.0|This book is a wonderful account of the Lincoln presidency with a great deal of insight as to the great man's personality as described in the correspondence of friends and rivals alike.  One gets a sense of the humanity and warmth of this great man along with the political genius.  The book almost reads like a historical novel and is a must-read for anyone seeking a greater insight into the life and mind of one of this nation's greatest leaders.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I love Clarke's works very much!<br />It's a famous piece I want to read for years.<br />So happy to get it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a simple product, but it solved a problem I had - how do I view uTube (and other) videos on my TV? The setup is straight-forward, and once you get past the idea of no real user interface - you just share from your devices - it works really well. I'm very happy with it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app the alarm clock is really helpful im never late to nothing thanks to it you should try it you will love it
B0054S6N04|5.0|This book has been out for some time but if you are new to Linda Howard's books you won't want to miss it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Clear and informative. Does effectively what it exclaims.. accurate and visual power reads. Easy to interact with and provides viable updates.
B001NLKZUA|2.0|Cassandra Clare is back. City of Ashes is the follow-up to her fun, young adult urban fantasy adventure City of Bones. This second book of the Mortal Instruments series is everything that the first book was not, and I don't mean that in a good way. The first book was light on teen wallowing and focused on more on their adventure through a dangerous magical world.<br /><br />City of Ashes, on the other hand, is a story about a group of spoiled teens in the midst of a big ole angst fest. Clary and Jace are all angsty about their Luke and Lei sibling attraction since they still think they are brother and sister. (Clearly, at some point it will be revealed that they are not actually siblings, because otherwise, eww!) Jace is also wallowing in Vader/Valentine father drama and acting bratty because nobody believes him, because dishing up disdainful attitude is always helpful in getting others to see your point of view. Simon is battling his angst driven jealously over any attention that Clary is paying to her brother, Jace. Alec is drowning in a whole vat of youthful melodrama, struggling with his sexuality, his unrequited love for Jace, and perhaps a hidden romance? Isabelle is not so much angsting as she is rebelling against nothing. Oh, and they are aware of the magical world around them and they are trying to fight evil.<br /><br />Eventually, we see some opportunities for action and adventure. However, it feel like every time a conflict arises, someone breaks out into an angst-driven monologue. How many times are they going to feel swayed by Valentine's fanatical ranting? Really? He's right THERE! Less talky talky, more stabby stabby. When we are not interrupting this regularly scheduled not-a-fight scene, we are flash-forwarding to the end only to experience yet another heart rending near death episode. Surely Simon's nine live are up??? Oh, the drama!<br /><br />This book is guilty of SO many fiction faux pas plot devices that I may have lost count. The top five kind of looks like this:<br /><br />1. Overreaction in place of action - like going to a werewolf bar to pick a fight because you are mad at your stepmom<br /><br />2. Overuse of the monologue - battle is raging all around us, my sweet, but let me try to convince you why my evil plan is great<br /><br />3. Logic is overrated (not sure which is my favorite example) - I hate demons SO much, that I want to rid the world of half demons by allying myself with full demons OR I know you are my sister, but will you still be my girlfriend and we can keep it a secret?<br /><br />4. Smart characters make stupid decisions - The bad guy is looking for someone like ME? Why then, let me run off into the night alone and take back alleys so he can capture me!<br /><br />5. And the worst plot device used in this book is . . . Love triangles, or in this case knots - A hot werewolf girl is in love with me, but I'm in love with you. You are in love with your brother. He loves you, too, but you can't be together, obviously. His teenage foster brother is in love with him, but dating a 300 year old wizard who may be in love him (eww). The foster sister seems to be in love with herself. Let's not even bother with the \\"adults.\\" It boggles the mind.<br /><br />I pretty much liked the characters in the first book. Well, I didn't dislike them, at least. However, in City of Ashes I think that everyone could use a swift boot to the head. Jace spends the book sneering and throwing abuse at others, meanwhile whining that no one believes in him. Clary is trying to martyr herself for every bad thing that happens to her in between bouts of saying really nasty things to people. Simon acts like a pouty douche who seems to have lost at least 30 IQ points since that last book. I could go on. Suffice it to say that Valentine wiping them all out starts to look appealing by the end of the book.<br /><br />As for the conclusion, Clare serves up an ending so ambiguous that when examined you realize that there really wasn't closure to any of the plot threads of this book. In fact, if you remove all of the angst and over emoting, I think that this book contributes maybe a single chapter, two at the most, of relevant information that moves that series plot arc forward.<br /><br />On the positive side, the cover art for City of Ashes is fantastic. In keeping with the theme of the first cover, it features the city skyline with an otherworldly teen figure rising from the behind the city. This time the figure represents Clary with an almost flaming quality to her red hair. Too bad the contents of the book do not live up to the promise of the cover.<br /><br />Now, I am left with a decision. Do I give the series another chance? I DID like the first book. However, my eyes are still sore from the number of times I rolled them while reading this book. Perhaps I'll give it some time, let my eye muscles recover, and see how I feel with a little distance. They say distance makes the heart grow fonder. We shall see.ally wasn't closure to any of the plot threads of this book.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is a fun missile defense game. It brings back memories from my  childhood and the other games where you shoot down invaders/attacks from the sky. I would recommend it for anyone with time to kill and a desire to save the world.    It is simple enough that my parents play this game and enjoy it. You can even play it '2 player' by just playing it together.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Amazing musicianship from all three members! Catchy songs...not a bad one on the whole album.<br />It reminds me of Mr Big but with Soundgarden vocals. Simply amazing! Especially bass and percussion.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|loved it - my kids loved it - chunk is hilarious.  amazon asked me to review this movie, so here's my review.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the Downtown Abbey series. As soon as one episode is over, I start another one and have to force myself to stop watching.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I baby sit and they love it but I had to say that they could not play it. Its soooooo glichy the sounds would not stop and I would have to restart my kindle. don't get there are waaaaaay better hair games out there even if you have spend a buck or two.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an amazing book even though it made me cry and broke my heart at times.  It's so incredibly sad that people can be so cruel and not see the ramifications of what they do to a child when they are little will stay with them throughout their entire life.  There is never a way to truly forget what happens to you when you are little, you may for a while but trust me they will always come back.<br /><br />Sky is 17 years old and has been sheltered her entire life with no TV, no internet, no phone and no school.  She's been homeschooled so her only true friend is her best friend that lives next door, Six.  Six talks Sky into attending school for her last year of high school but then ends up going across the country for six for a foreign exchange program.  Now Sky is left to walk the halls alone.  All of the kids are mean believing rumors that they have heard.  All except Brecken who befriends her the first day of school. After school she stops at the grocery store and meets Holden.  An incredibly HOT guy that immediately makes her have feelings that she's never had before and that scares her.<br /><br />Holden is hot guy with a bad reputation.  He scares and captivates Sky at the same time.  She wants to walk away from him but she also wants \\"lick his dimples\\" at the same time.  He also makes her remember things that she's forgotten that she wishes that she would never have remembered.  Holden was incredible!  He always knew what to say to make Sky feel better.  His responses were always well thought out, careful to say the right thing even though it might that she didn't want to hear, he would say in a way that wouldn't hurt her.<br /><br />Even though you only get little snippets of the side characters, Breckin and Six, they were great.  I LOVED Breckin!  I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the way that he introduced himself to Sky that first day school.<br /><br />This really is a well written story that I would highly recommend!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Awesome show!! We are now hooked on it! So glad it's part of prime and so glad all seasons are available!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its rocks u can go to the nether and bold ur own house from scratch sooooooo worth 7 bucks I'm a pro player ever sens version 2.6 and u shold by it
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works great. Looks great. Only issue is presents only major cities, not more local weather.  There is Boston, but no Worcester.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is a great book! Without giving too much away, I\\"m really impressed by the plot, and the story moves along nicely. The characters are well written and fully fleshed out. The characters are easy to relate to, and you really feel for Sophia. This book really keeps you engaged, and wanting to get to the next page.<br /><br />This isn't my genre of book, but I am happy to say that I can recommend this to anyone, and feel confident that they'd like it. If you're down for a fun, well written book to read...STOP...This is the book for you!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm not sure why anyone would have a problem with this Reacher novel.  It is prime Reacher!  I absolutely love this character.  I love the way he thinks through a situation, is always observing everything around him, separating truth from untruth.  He approaches every situation in a no nonsense manner.  He takes no guff off anyone.  I love that.  This book has strong characters and a strong plot and a satisfying ending.  The dialogue is crisp and believable.  I highly recommend this novel and will definitely be reading the next one, as I have all the ones before.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|If I wanted to hear 2 hours of continuous gross swears and scatological humor, I could have gone to an ILA meeting!<br /><br />Streaming worked fine which meant we got to be exposed to all the language and rather sophomoric humor
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am not really into these so called &quot;freemium&quot; games. I prefer to just pay for something and be done with it. But I found this one to be more playable than most without spending a lot. The game itself is fun. It is something different.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have wanted this app for so long and it's finally free.<br />*squee* YAY But its the best app Eva
0060005696|5.0|I have a hard time making choices and this book exceeded my expectations.  Very interesting and filled with lots of actual data and examples, the author seemed extremely knowledgeable.  I highly recommend this book if decisions are tough for you..
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What can I say.  Loved this book.  Did not want to put it down.<br />Khaled Hosseini knows how to weave a story.  He grabs in the first<br />few pages and does not let you down.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good writing and well acted.  Show a lot of the ins and outs of the Legal Business.  Very entertaining and interesting.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game does what I wanted it to do.  Something simple that works my brain and doesn't require an internet connection.
1909313033|5.0|I loved the book! I have a little pug and everything in this book is funny and so real. Now I see is not just my pug who likes to eat kleenex! and well...likes to eat everything she can! but honestly yeah, pugs are a really special breed, so human and so intelligent, I have had dogs before and no one was like my little pug, she seems to be more inteligent and in so ways many different from a regular dog. I totally love her, my little \\"Coc&oacute;\\" has changed my life. I totally recommend the book, you are gonna laugh and see and understand some things about the breed. :)
B005HEPN06|5.0|At first I felt as though they weren't as good as the previous Star Trek but it came together very well. Each of the characters developed their personalities well in their featured stories. I am a sci fi fan but the stories must have some basic truth or philosophical position to make them something beyond a story. This series did that. The portrait of different cultures should be a lesson to young people about the very difference between cultures on this planet but the basic humanity of all in spite of different appearances physically.<br />I have looked forward to watching Star Trek as my life was too involved with profession and children during the regular season. I must admit I missed Wesley as a young person experiencing that adventure and that being smart was a plus not a negative as it some times can be in our classrooms today.<br />Thank you Amazon as this has become my evening entertainment and I am enjoying going through the seasons one by one.
B000002GVZ|5.0|I recently read Carly Simon's autobiography, and realised that while I knew many of her songs I'd never bought any of them!<br />This collection enabled me to have her favourites, and re-listen. It is a great selection, which I would thoroughly recommend to anyone wishing to include some of Carly's songs without buying a number of different albums.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I had the volume turned down to about 15 during the action scenes and over level 50 when it was just conversation.  The video was great but the audio was so up and down the movie was difficult to enjoy.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read the first book prior to seeing the film and was very impressed with the wealth of characters--their diversity, their complexity, and their fierce determination. Clare does not shy away from the controversial even in a young adult title. I would recommend the novel for those 15-16 and up.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|This is a really good series so far. If you haven't seen season one completely, I would suggest getting this set. Its cheap and worth it.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|There are some voices that just grab hold of you the moment you first hear them. Hearing Mariah Carey's Vision of Love for the first time was one of those moments for me. I can say the same thing about hearing The Way for the first time. Ariana Grande is a talent we will talking about for years to come. So how is the record? Here is my take on each song:<br />1) Honeymoon Avenue: This midtempo cut opens with lush orchestrations that perfectly complement Grande's light airy pitch-perfect instrument. Clean uncluttered production pushes her voice front and center where it should be. Great opener.<br />2)Baby I: Killer groove. Her vocals here are unmistakably reminiscent of early Mariah Carey. This song feels like Grande's tribute to Carey's Emotions.<br />3) Right There: Grande's vocals float over the addictive melody and the hook is strong. She tosses off multi-octave leaps and flips from head to chest voice without breaking a sweat.<br />4)Tattooed Heart: This feels like a 2013 take on a '50's doo-wop song. Here Ariana enters into Bruno Mars territory with retro-soul. A flawless vocal.<br />5) Lovin' It: Grande's lush vocals elevate this uptempo pop confection. Slick production lays her dazzling multi-tracked vocals over a sizzling rhythmic beat.<br />6) Piano: I love this cut. It hearkens back to the work Clivilles and Cole did with Mariah Carey. It reminds me of Make It Happen-inspirational pop at its best.<br />7) Daydreamin': Another song with a 50s doo-wop feel. Listen to the way she bends the notes on the words \\"I'll be yours\\" in the chorus. This is a singer with SERIOUS musical chops.<br />8) The Way: Irresistible pop, killer hook, perfectly produced. And those whistle tones-OMG.It was love at first listen. And the torch is passed from Minnie Riperton to Mariah Carey to Ariana Grande.<br />9) You'll Never Know: The vocals are spot-on but this tune feels generic to me, nothing memorable.<br />10)Almost Is Never Enough: Finally a ballad and she caresses the melody with her warm silky tones-meltingly beautiful. Nathan Sykes acquits himself well as her duet partner. Reminds me of Boyz II Men's End of the Road.<br />11) Popular Song: This was one of my favorite cuts on Mika's CD The Origins of Love. Mika's vocal dominates this song and she plays more of a supporting role. But another flawless vocal from Grande. (\\"Wicked\\" fans will hear a snippet from the musical)<br />12)Better Left Unsaid: Ariana meets Black Eyed Peas. She seriously wails on this but the song is kind of a throwaway.<br />I highly recommend this album to fans of either of the first two singles. Not all of the material is as strong as her vocal talents are deserving of, but this is one of those instruments that doesn't come along very often. Grande, I am yours truly!dy with her warm silky tones-meltingly beautiful. Nathan Sykes acquits himself well as her duet partner.

B000002J5K|5.0|Great Soundtrack and a great variety of artist performing.  Hard to find but the price was excellent, can't find a better product.
0375842209|3.0|This is a pretty moving book with some mild language. It is about the holocaust and Nazi Germany. It is set between 1939-1945. I wouldn't say it's the best book I've read, but gives you great perspective on how hard it was to live in Europe at that time, especially for poor people, and Jews. I definitely want to see the movie that is soon to come out, based on this book, and would suggest that you read the book, before seeing the film.
0321934318|5.0|This book is a tutorial that contains everything that most photographers will ever want to know about Lightroom 5 and more.  Scott's step by step method of writing makes practice easy, even for those who are not especially computer adept with computers.  If you are an experienced Lightroom user, you will definitely pick up many extra tips.  If you are a novice, this book is a must have.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A very interesting story about a young women who chooses an unusual way to find her way and get rid of her demons that life has given her.  Her challenge to hike is very good reading .  Her personal life is somewhat out of the norm.  The book held my interest.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I did not start watching Glee until season 3. Love the show today. Really enjoying the earlier story lines and seeing how the characters have changed over time. The singing and performances are not as polished as they are in later seasons but the are still very enjoyable.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|This adaptation was great! The casting and visuals were amazing. Leo really captured Gatsby. I really loved the modern music that made the whole thing feel contemporary.
0307341577|5.0|Three for three. Flynn works for me. If you liked Sharp Objects, you'll like this. The Gone Girl crowd... seems less certain that they will like this one.<br /><br />Dark Places announces what it is from the start. What it is is: Artful, compelling, insightful, brutal, haunting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am just hoping there is more to come because I love the characters and dialogue. Smith is a hoot.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|I am unsure why but we just don't seem o be able to get a good Judge Dredd movie.  The original one with Sylvester Stallone was awful. This one has better special effects but the acting is just as bad as the Stallone version. The lead actor in this one seems to think trying to talk like Sylvester Stallone will help... It Doesn't help at all! Good to watch for the special effects but if you are expecting/wanting/hoping for a good story or good acting, look elsewhere!!!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Another well written series from Great Britain! Will keep you totally engaged. Wonderful acting.  If you enjoy good programming, this is a must!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|not a big fan of search and find games, but this one is challenging enough to be fun to play!
B003Y5USF0|3.0|Pretty good 90s movie . Great special effects for its time too. Would probably recommend it for a rainy afternoon. Ha!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|A great app for your kindle.however it does use a lot of battery power so you need to have it plugged into power socket .
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|Advertised as shutting off 30 seconds after no movement detected, but actually shuts off after 10 seconds. Doesn't suit my purpose, but too much trouble to return.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I have really enjoy my kindle. I would have to recommend this to all my friends. Ease of reading is wonderful! Having storage on the cloud server saves space on the hard drive installed. Great produce.
B0051MKNV8|2.0|DVD came in time, all is well, just did not play on dvd player but on my laptop it does play. It did not play in a few dvd players. which is strange.
B0081336FO|5.0|It's a fun British-like version of the Sherlock Holmes modern story.  It's generally family appropriate and we all enjoy the episodes.  It is rare to find shows that we all like, so this one gets 5 stars!  There's some humor, mystery, and a good story-line.
B00A285OOW|5.0|You feel the characters as though you are really there.  The plot is addictive I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  The story is not centered around romance (although there is romance)  But the wars are told so that it keeps you guessing who will be the next king or queen.<br /><br />LOVED it!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is a great book.  It leaves the reader with such a sense of how fortunate we are to live in a free society.  I was astounded at the courage it took for Shin to attempt his escape, as well as make his way to China and beyond.  In addition to learning about North Korea's prison camps and otherwise closed society, I learned a great deal about the Korean conflict and the way in which the aftermath was handled.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who doubts that we are fortunate to live in the USA--or any other free society--as well as anyone who wants to learn more about the strength and promise of the human spirit.  My sincere hope is that someday Shin can forgive himself for the life and decisions over which he had no choice.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy the different leveling challenges..the thrill to get all the required items to complete a bingo level room added with bingo.<br />I only deducted a star because the ease of getting free credits to play the higher more expensive rooms is not there. They need more free credit options or a greater rate of payout..we would return quicker to play!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|love the movie the dancing is what i like the most its different just like it its different movie from way back
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Great being able to use my Kindle and listen to my saved mixes anytime without draining my phone battery, great app.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I first got this game off steam to play with a couple buddies and ended up loving it, so when I found out I could get it on my kindle I was stoke. A must have.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game.  It keeps you interested over each level.  The missions can be annoying however. Overall a good runner.
B009GX69RK|1.0|The first season was so inventive and genuine. In the second season, the jokes and story lines are predicable, while the characters become caricatures of themselves. Did the show get new writers after the 1st season?
B001DPDVE8|4.0|As a lover of Stargate, I was pleased to finally see a movie involving the original characters.  We watched it via Kindle Fire and it looked great.  The movie itself doesn't hold up as much as the series, but it's still a fun watch.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book was written with humor and it contains vital information which is grounded in science and a  knowledge of how our bodies process food.<br />The recipes are delicious.  It's a whole new way of looking at food and how it affects us.<br />I strongly recommend it to anyone who would like to look better and feel better and It's a must for diabetics.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I'm still a fan of this show and have watched it multiple times. Never fails to entertain, plus I have a crush on Richard Dean Anderson.
1401924751|5.0|Per usual the cards are always right. These cards are inspiring and helpful. They really get the psychic juices flowing! If you only buy one set of Doreen Virtue's Oracle cards it should be this one!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well written and acted. The sets and castle are perfection and, in my opinion, there is no finer actress today than Maggie Smith
B0063GORYU|5.0|My wife drives me crazy trying to exceed her last point level while we are traveling of just relaxing.  It works really well on our Samsung Galaxy S4 phones.
B0032KPE0G|4.0|Hugh Grant at his most flustered and funny.  Great supporting characters as well, along with a lovely story of cherishing love when it presents itself, even if the timing is 'wretched'....
B0063IH60K|5.0|My wife drives me crazy trying to exceed her last point level while we are traveling of just relaxing.  It works really well on our Samsung Galaxy S4 phones.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is with a doubt my favorite movie of all-time! I have watched it at least 100 times since i was 14 years old.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to watch this.  Getting caught up on all the seasons so I can be ready for season 6.<br />Awesome Show!!!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love the chemistry between the Doctor and Donna - I wish Catherine Tate would have done a second season. I have watched this season about 5 times!
B007AL48UK|4.0|perfect game for if you are waiting in a doctors office or just trying to wind down from a hard day a work. This is great for kids and adults alike
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I bought this to reread after reading The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which was good, but nowhere near this. I love this book!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|More twists in this story than your average tornado-  clever and exciting.  Reacher out does himself and there are several other characters worthy of note.  A must read for Reacher fans.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Good Mahjong game. I have 3 or 4 of the Mahjong games and this is one of the good one.
0439023521|5.0|hunger games was a really good book I think I finished it in 2 days if it weren't for my kids I may have never put it down after I was done reading I got on amazon and started looking for book 2 and 3 now I am just waiting for them to come very good book you will never want to put it down
B003JTHXOK|5.0|one of the best books I've read lately.  would recommend to all my friends.  Nicholas Sparks has done it again!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|freezes..and do we need to sell stuff while we are trying to watch it...IF it hasn't froze in 3 minutes into a 5 minute video..at least 3times it happened to me
B005544TRQ|5.0|We recently started watching Suits and are totally hooked.  It is different than any other lawyer series we've seen.  The characters have edge and it's a fun show to spend an evening with.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I did enjoy reading this book. I feel it was probably written for teens and young adult, but I found it quite enjoyable. I,loved how the author went into the different relationships and how they came to be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series of books kept me on my toes and both my daughter and I devoured every detail. The heroin Katniss Everdeen was inspiring as were the many tributes in the Hunger Games. It is a grim reminder of how, as humans we so easily forget the true value of one another and how fragile the human race is.
1439177791|5.0|Gives an in depth look into her life with an ED. Some would even say it's a book of &#34;tips&#34;. I think it is a great read. I own it and read it often.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved this book.  It was an easy read and hard to put down.  I am reading the books that follow.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Lots of similar games like this.  This one seems to adhere to original game.  Anyway it like it.  I am going yo delete my two other games I have on the tablet
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Ive used it several times with my D300 no complaints. Arrived on time and in working order. A good buy all around
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have seen a lot of the actors in other shows so it is like old home week. I enjoy watching shows about early life and how families and single women over come the odds. Refreshing and enjoyable.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is good. There are a lot of things to do in the game. I recommend this game it is fun.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I would have given 5 stars, if I hadn't have had to explain several steps to my sister. We should keep in mind, even though we live in the electronic age, not everyone is electronically inclined. KDP is the best thing since Velcro. If the program changes, I will purchase 'How To', by Amazon Kindle again.JB
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love this game.  Used to play it on my computer.  Love being able to play it on my new kindle fire
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I mean yeah. It's a damn clock. This shit should still just come with the damn Kindle. However I digress. This is a quality app that isn't ludicrously priced.
B0065V6B0Q|5.0|I loved it as a VHS and even more in Blu Ray... Really beautiful classic, choice of languages. Well worth the extra money.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I love to play this game on the computer but not on the kindal. it is to small and harder to play.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|New update is awful.....loved app before now uninstalled and using Weather Bug...New is not always better. Miss the old app.
B00785P2QC|1.0|it kept popping up download failed so irks what happen but it sucks very bad game couldave done better a lot better
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|While this album may not be their best, it certainly isn't their worst. Best NIN album in a while. My favorite tracks are Copy of a, Everything, Various Methods of Escape, and I Would For You.
B008133MDK|4.0|No need for a long review--it's a very entertaining series --the actors are so charismatic, that alone is worth watching.  If you are hoping for truly puzzling plots, look elsewhere.  Occasionally, the answer is so obvious it's downright painful
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game. I like the different levels, that keeps you going . Play it over and over.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Bossy Pants gives insight into how a show like SNL works and how Tina Fey translated that to her own show--30 Rock.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I am a non-Trekkie. I mean, I like the other films I've seen but I wouldn't consider myself a purist or something. I thought this was a well-written twist on an old story line with great special effects.
B00CVDM8QS|5.0|I consider myself fairly sophisticated about how science works.  I have  Ph.D. in Psychology and have taught psychology as a science for over 30 years.  Like Dawkins, there are many areas of science (quantum physics as an outstanding example), where my knowledge is very rudimentary.  Nevertheless, the power of science to continually challenge itself by testing basic beliefs allows me to have respect for the work of those who are busy exploring areas beyond my understanding.<br /><br />Dawkin's ability to introduce multiple myths that science has debunked would lead any one who's mind was even slightly ajar to rethink the roles that some of those myths play in their lives.<br /><br />For my wife, who did not have my scientific training but does have an open mind, the book was a delightful way for her to find answers to some of her questions about how scientists know what they know.  Dawkins did a much better job of that than I have been able to.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Magic of Reality to anyone open to learning how things really work.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing dialog of information I've already heard/know.  Pam puts a personal spin on all the principals making them so real!  Take your time getting through this great book...savor it!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|contemporary thriller yet learn about a very remote country.  Corey is his usual sarcastic self but you want him covering your backside.
B005F6NA56|4.0|This is a good overall album to listen to in the background of a dinner party or relaxing with some wine.  I really enjoyed it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The overall narrative is very appealing and well thought out, and although some of the concepts are at this point not very much relevant (like the Warsaw pact), the story holds up quite well after some 30 years that it was written.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album.  It's a great listen from beginning to end and you can't say that about too many albums now a days.  You won't regret the purchase.  If you don't &#34;get it&#34; the first time you listen, keep listening.  Believe me, it will grow on you and then you won't be able to stop listening to it.  Artistic, soulful, thought provoking rock music!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My life will never be the same.  We think we have problems!  Oh man.  My gratitude to the whole cast and crew is immense.  I cannot thank you enough for this incredible body of work.  Please, please, please, keep these amazing stories coming!  Love you, ALL!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|This album is amazing!  It's very original, artistic and amazing. I can honestly say I like every song on the album and more than excited that I purchased it!
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I enjoyed this thoroughly.  The characters were well drawn and sympathetic. It was suspenseful and had me on the edge of my seat.
B004GJVI5C|5.0|This movie is a grown up film made with no special effects and lots of great acting.  Its a complex love story set in the hard crime neighborhood of Charlestown, Massachusetts.  If you like Boston, then you'll love this movie.  Affleck is excellent as the central figure but also as a screenwriter.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I thought this was going to be pretty lame, but it was better than I expected.  Arnold didn't try to be the only hero in the bunch, plenty of back patting to go around.  Fun ride.
0345529057|5.0|I don't have HBO @ home so I thought I would read the series.  Quite different from the fantasy series I usually read, but a good read nonetheless, despite the incest.  My husband kept wondering when I was going to come back to reality.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|...it provided great insight on the Jesus the &#34;Man.&#34;  I grew up in a religious environment my entire life and never heard much about Jesus the man.  Aslan's words, however, gave me greater respect for both  the &#34;man&#34; and the deity.  He also increased my vocabulary and knowledge of ancient history--a great bonus!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Downloading videos is easy as apple pie. I prefer having my music videos ready to go instead of wating for them to load
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really didn't think I would enjoy this series.  But with all the hoopla surrounding Downton Abbey, I felt I needed to check it out.  I started watching season 3 when the new season began this year and immediately loved it.  Someone suggested that since I liked season 3 that I should go ahead and watch 1 and 2.  At first I thought, oh...I don't need to go back and watch the first two seasons.  I am so glad that I did!  Love it!
B0093QE37S|4.0|If you are a fan of Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart, you will love it! Funny & romantic.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|If you like suspense, action, and a fast moving plot that will keep you guessing untill the end, then this is a must!
B00002N9ER|5.0|For plastic I thought it was price a little high, I did get them for under $5.00<br />I mounted them on the back door frame. My LED 3D flashlight is there as I go out the door with the dogs at night.<br />They work. I would buy them again if needed.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|This is one movie sequel that won't leave you disappointed. Just as thrilling as the first. I only wished Matt Damon would have continued with more movies in this series......
B0049J3QF4|5.0|We're very happy with our purchase. This is a classic that we've watched over and over. Well worth the money.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I think that the fact that we have to wait to collect all of our gifts is really wrong! These are our gifts and the game holds them from us,which, in doing so makes it so we can't play sometimes. Before they started this I really enjoyed the game now not so much!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Friends from Texas introduced us to this program in June by having us watch the first episode from Season 1.  We were so impressed that we watched all three seasons practically non-stop.  Each episode had been so spell-binding that we were sorry there were not enough hours in the day to watch the next episodes.  The historical account of the early 20th century aristocracy along with the servitude of the maids and footmen and the interactions among them was dealt with accuracy and added to the various plots found with these series.  We are definitely hooked and we can't wait for season 4 to start up.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a great free app, especially if you love horses. The only complaint i have is the fairly new addition of ads popping up after completing tasks. It's  incredibly annoying..otherwise i love it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Such a great story and a great way to put rough times into perspective. I've enjoyed Cheryl Strayed's other books as well!
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|If you are looking for action and things that blow up it fits the bill and it was an excuse to watch Karl Urban. I enjoyed it and there was some pretty cool stuff in it.  I'm a bit of a wimp at a point so a little gory in places for me, but it's not like that kept me from watching it and I'm sure at some point I'll probably watch it again.
0446580848|5.0|This author always has the greatest plots that seem so ahead of their time and I absolutely love his sarcastic tongue-in-cheek dialogue. There is nothing like a great book with a great story that include laugh out loud humor and it isn't slapstick. It is usually what everyone thinks or want to say but, like in this book, he doesn't get it said but his thinking of what he would like to say is marvelousl! I have read almost all of his books from the beginning and I now have my son and grandson reading them. I am a 76 year old female and I think Nelson DeMille is fabulous, can't wait for his next one (hope it isn't too far away, I am on kind of a &#34;time&#34; schedule...jus sayin)
B005PK56TA|5.0|can't wait to see season 2. jessca lange is perfect for it,  hope season 2  will live up to season 1.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|\\"Hesitation Marks\\" is great! This is another great album from Nine Inch Nails. Trent Reznor has helped make another great rock album. This is one of the best rock albums of the year, so far. All (14) tracks on here are great.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />1. The Eater Of Dreams (3 out of 4 stars)<br />2.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have had the Chromecast for about two weeks.  I purchased from Amazon with free netflix for three months.<br /><br />Pros -  It is a nifty device.  It streams Netflix better than my BluRay player, PC or XBox 360 ever has. It was easy to set up, and it is easy to use (just cast two it from the three things: netflix, youtube or a chrome window.<br /><br />Cons -  Very limited casting apps. I want a full featured casting app that will play music or video from my local hard drive. I have about 35GB of music ready to serve up, and the only thing available is a chrome window... one song at a time.  I would also like to rip movies to disk, and cast them from there.<br /><br />At the price... with three months of netflix... this is a great device. Previously, I had turned off netflix streaming because my DSL is so bad that it looked like a VHS tape!  Chromecast is somehow able to do a much better job than previous streaming devices I have tried. So I will definitely be streaming video every night for the next three months. Still, this has only limited use until a suite of casting apps is created to fully exploit the capabilities of this little gem.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent read. I believe there exists more than just what we experience during this life, I have had too many experiences to believe otherwise. I also believe that we have the power within ourselves to overcome more things than most people believe.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it! Read it in two days just couldn't put it down. Love the relationship between Holder and Sky. I hope Colleen could write another book with these characters in it.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|[[ASIN:B002U5HKZ6 Shantaram: A Novel]]<br /><br />This book was a recommended read and what a recommendation!. Fantastic is an understatement, I couldn't stop reading. It is not for the light hearted as there are many blood curdling moments and very emotional times. The book has moral issues and it makes you think and look at the different perspectives possible.It is educational and insightful, and I felt i was in Bombay. I really enjoyed this book and regretted turning to the last page. I looked for another book by the same author and was sad to see this seems to be the only one. It will remain one of the best I have ever read.
B0090XLDKY|3.0|Most over rated musical ever.<br /> Any Rodgers & Hammerstein musical is superior in almost every way; especially in the plot and music.
0425266060|5.0|I can't wait for her new books.  The story was great!  I liked these books more than 50 shades.  The story is more realistic.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Awesome game! Works great with my kindle fire HD and has NO AD's! It's a win, win for this game! Plus to top it off it free, how much more can you want from a game!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|For me, the most enjoyable part of the book was the almost day-to-day diary-like record of one Luftwaffe fighter pilot's experiences during the long years of the war. You get a real sense of the difference between the training and operational philosophy of the Army Air Forces versus the fly-'til-you die requirement of Luftwaffe fighter and bomber aircrews. Beautifully researched and written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very cute little  additive  game! Once I start playing I don't want to put it down! lol Works great with Kindle fire HD, go check it out!
B00AHHODH2|5.0|AS a dog lover I am always looking for books with dogs as part of the story. Thanks for a good read.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I liked all the references to the stars old movies' lines and/or characters, that actually put a bit of humor into it.
0765325950|5.0|The novel does a very good job of tying up all the loose ends in the WoT books.  There are numerous memorable chapters that I've re-read several times.  It also leaves you with the perfect setting for possible spin-offs centered around the various characters.  After 16 years of reading the WoT books, it was a little sad to see the series end, but it was a good ending.
B00CVPAJ94|4.0|I had seen it before and the movie wasn't as good as I remembered. The disk sent was without a flaw.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Loved it, they linked it very well with the Wrath of Kahn.  Don't need to be a treky to enjoy this movie!
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I actually bought this a year or two ago when Borders Books went under- they knocked the price down to  $20 for the box, which is insanely great.<br />I planned on buying it anyways, just never got around to it so of course I lunged at it.<br />Without getting into the technical aspects , which some of the other reviewers have done better than I could, it must be said that this brought renewed interest for me in his folk albums.<br />I have thousands of cds and vinyl albums and HIghway 61 is always close by, as is Blonde on Blonde and John Wesley.<br />But sometimes I will go ages without playing the earlier folk albums and this remastered set really brings them to life.<br />I highly recommend this set and by now it should be discounted somewhere around.<br />Be sure to pick up this classic box of some of the greatest albums ever.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found the book's coverage of the history of Jerusalem and Judea, starting about 1,000 years before the birth of Christ, to be fascinating. For about 400 years, Jews were firmly in control after, based on a direct commandment from God, they took over the land by massacring every man, woman and child and slaughtering every animal. Joshua 10 and Deuteronomy 20 are quoted as sources for this claim, the latter stating &#34;you must not let anything that breathes remain alive'. That makes the current mid-East conflicts look tame. In 586 B.C.E. Judea was sacked and destroyed by the Babylonians, followed by the Persians and the Greeks. Finally, after regaining control for a while, the Jews fought among themselve to a point where they called upon the Romans for help and became a Roman protectorate under &#34;King&#34; Herod, a Jew. Jesus Christ is described, as others have, as a rather simple illiterate itinerant preacher who appeared somewhat mysteriously, then, after only a few years,  was seen as a threat to Rome and was crucified.<br /><br />As have many other recent writers, the author gives little credance to many of the bible stories, including the virgin birth and the resurrection. Nevertheless, this period is seen as important, as it saw the beginnings of one of the world's largest religions, Christianity. This book is well worth reading.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|Now I have a Prime Membership and watch a lot of the Prime shows and movies. I have never bought a movie and definitely not a show. I watched all of Season 1 on Prime and loved it so I actually bought Season 2! I was excited that this was set in an asylum because what is creepier than that!!?? I was really surprised that they used a lot of the same actors and recycled them into new characters in this season. At first this was really confusing for me but I settled in and appreciated getting to see the actors I loved from the first season playing totally different personalities!<br /><br />Asylum was not as good as the first season but it is not because of the lack of surprises, horrors, twists and turns - it is just my personal preference. Asylum still has all of the craziness that the first season had (maybe more actually - they are really going all out this time!) but it is in a much different way. I don't want to tell you the surprises and will not give out spoilers here but if you do not have a weak stomach and are not easily frightened then I would watch this. Totally worth the $20 even to a cheapskate like me! So much better than most other stuff on tv and I appreciate the no holds barred even though I usually cover my eyes. American Horror Story is the best and I am counting down until the third season starts on TV!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book changed my perception and tolerance for my own introversion and that of my daughter. Seeing introversion as a strength, I found myself nodding in agreement at all the ways what I've been doing in secret, has actually helped me succeed in life. The bonus now is, I don't feel the need to stuff it away. I feel I can legitimately and genuinely be ok being myself, regardless of the pressures of others to be something I'm not. What a relief. I will also treasure my daughter's huge passion for the subtle and deep things in life.<br />Thank you Susan!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Chihuahua hunger google B-) Jun f2f going going how google games games going great game get great games get going google both video Greg crutch
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Still addictive but a bit less quaint tha the first two seasons. Interesting developments but the finale is just too much.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Loved loved loved this book. Wish I had been blessed to know Adam Brown.  This is a very inspirational life story.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|Great little movie about the Foos!  I saw this once before on VH1 while I was on vacation but i never got to see the whole thing.  It's great.  I will probably buy the DVD.
B002WY64HA|5.0|The quality of this album is quite high. The vinyl itself is a heavy duty, high quality pressing and the sticker placement in the center is quite nice.<br /><br />The jacket that the album comes in is very nice and the jacket itself is high quality.<br /><br />Nothing special as far as content (some artwork and thank you notes) but it's nice, none the less.
B001JYEMOQ|3.0|This movie had a Weird twist. Did not see it coming but watched it all. Not favorite but definitely suspenseful.
B000054BF2|5.0|VERY high quality album! Heavy vinyl and very nice sleeve for the album. The jacket is nice and heavy as well.<br /><br />Not much as far as content (just some nude photos, X-rated for a reason!), but it is high quality.<br /><br />As for the seller, I bought this thru THE_CONNECTION and man, I'm impressed. I bought two albums and they came incredibly fast (actually a day before the start of the estimated delivery period). The price was WAY cheaper than going thru the label or any other sources, even with delivery included. Very happy with these guys!
1451648537|5.0|That's a great Biography, Steve Jobs was a Genius.<br />The book was compiled smartly. Must read Book! you will really enjoy.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|love the product i rate it a 5 star. i have use it all the time an u should other it all the time /
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I really liked Karl Urban better than Sylvester Stalone. The story line was a little more modern than the previous release. There were still good f/x in this movie. and I recommend for anyone who likes comic books brought to the big screen.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great show. I'm hooked! Can't wait to see the remaining episodes to get caught up for the season premier! Wow
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is an easy game to learn and keeps getting more challenging. Fun way to spend a few spare moments.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|To hard too move around it's different sections does not seem  to be user friendly too use for local leather
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Laid back beginning, then quickly accelerates! Love both of the main actors, Josh and Julianne.<br />Also the bad guy, her husband. He was really awesome and scary. Thanks.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Continue to enjoy this serial. It is easy to get involved with the characters and get interested inthe new ones.
B000YABS8E|4.0|Always enjoy watching 10's Alicia Silverstone & Melanie Griffth, Shinning Through (both, the voice) Monica Potter & of course Jennifer Aniston. My Big 4......
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book more then COB. The way these books are going I may love the next way more then this one!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I'd give it a 6 star but fives the highest I wanted to go one more as Nigel would say
B0002XMKYE|5.0|I'm not a Hi Definition quality expert but I did watch this on a large TV and thought the quality was very good.
B00BIK06JG|5.0|This case was exactly what I was looking for. The leather seems like it's great quality and I feel much safer throwing my camera in any purse or bag with this instead of having to lug around another camera bag.
0316223239|5.0|Loved This Book. Best book I read in a long time.<br />If you were mesmerized by the Ariel Castro arrest, You can feel for this mom who raised her son in captivity.<br />such a wonderful, loving story between mom and son and relationship between the two.<br />you can feel the frustration of dealing with the outside world versus their own room.<br />This 11x11 room is a place of pure hell at times and pure joy at times.<br />You will not forget this story. It will live on in your mind for quite some time.<br />[[ASIN:0316223239 Room: A Novel]]
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Good and quite entertaining but the repetitive scenes get boring. I find I don't read the entire page quite often
1932100660|5.0|Well researched and informative and interestingly written even though is is more of a text.  I received the book in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
0143124544|5.0|I consider this a great book.  Characters are believable, endearing.<br />I always consider the meaning of a title, since obviously it's pretty important, and I don't know to whom the pronouns refer.  Comments??  Maybe we're meant to ponder?
160774273X|5.0|This is an amazing introduction to the art of mixing flour, water, salt and yeast.  The recipes are quite simple, but the results amazing.  If you have the time and patience to plan and bake, you will not be disappointed.  If you are looking for a quick loaf, however, this is not the book for you.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like that I can keep up with various projects in different notebooks. This is a cool tool. It is also user friendly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so awesome. I just love it! you can buy your own minion it just is so so so so awesome. I love it so much.
B004SDEP38|2.0|It doesn't help me with my documents at all. I was hoping to be able to use sort of as a computer device to edit, but so far, no luck.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Had me lahughing aloud on the subway and at times my jaw dropping to the floor.  Hope the upcomming movie does this justice...
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|If you ever want to get into Kreator, Dying Alive is were you should start. Featuring some amazing classics like \\"People Of The Lie\\" \\"Voices Of The Dead\\" and \\"Enemy Of God\\" The only urk with this is that the live DVD doesn't have too much extras. But, that really doesn't matter; you buy a live album for the music, not the extras.<br /><br />The sound levels on all the instruments are perfect, you can hear every drum fill, every bass note and every guitar lick. Definitely one of the best live albums I have ever bought.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is so much fun I can't even describe it! It is so addicting! I love it! It is a great game!
B000HF6XV8|4.0|This is a good introduction to the story, well shot and the cast was terrific. My grandkids really liked it and we are reading the story together as well.
B00DAXYNEI|4.0|Great story, great writing, and great acting.  But the sex is too graphic and too rough.  It diminishes the quality and lessons it's long-term value.  It is definitely an R rating.  This should have been an important work, but it gave up its integrity to Hollywood.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Wish there were more episodes; one season is just not enough! The casting was perfect for this show. Love Nathan Fillion!
B00BNUBK46|5.0|Excellent Light, several options for brightness and this is a well built light. It is VERY bright on the turbo mode on spot and flood options.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Deceptively difficult since it appears to be quite simple. I thought I was missing something because it was too easy... all the way up until it wasn't any more. Then it got super fun!
B00C0W08XK|4.0|Great game that I can play anywhere that I'm bored. I whish it would keep a running score of all games I play.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome show... if you like sci-fi and survival shows this one kicks arse. I was surprised and impressed by the graphics for a tv show.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like the concept of Mario. Like playing it so far, hopefully it will keep me motivated. My son likes playing it also.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|Wow, that movie was absolutely terrible. I watched it painfully, and I'm glad it's over. I had heard a lot of good things about it, so I finally gave in and watched it. It was bad from start to finish. And kind of brutal for a kids show, I didn't expect them to kill off so many characters lol.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|People seriously need to calm down. Yes, the producer could've done a better job. However, it is NOT nearly as bad as people are saying.<br />I almost didn't buy this album because of the terrible reviews it was getting, but I'm glad I didn't jump on the tomato-throwing bandwagon.<br />I can listen to the whole album all the way through without skipping any songs and that is huge for me. I am very critical and picky when it comes to music, clothes, and everything I buy in general.<br /><br />DO NOT make the decision not to buy this album because of the terrible reviews or you'll be missing out on some nice music.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The best mover ever! It was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat! Love love love love love love Jennifer!!!!!'
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I did not find this one very interesting.  It did not keep my interest for very long.  I will give it another try.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|I thought it was pretty good, but don't understand what all the &#34;hype&#34; was about the movie.Unless you take into account the lesbian scene, which on reflection, must have gotten people's attention. It was pretty hot from the male perspective. Not a great first date video because it would make most women uncomfortable, but it did have enough twists and turns to make it interesting so I'll give it 4 stars.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|Difficult sometimes, but kept my interest.  I would not reccomend this to a novice.  I have not played it very much.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's fantastic! Watch one and you'll be hooked.<br />What I love about Amazon is the ability to watch the entire season without having to wait a week for the next show.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I liked this one very much.  My daughter-in-law had to help me a bit, but once I got the hang of it, I liked it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book very informative gives the history of wheat when it was good before it was tampered with. Gives info on the affects of eating a diet high in wheat carbs.
B003FXCSNQ|5.0|Discovered from a documentary prophets of science fiction. It is well written disturbing at points, bizarre at others. Well worth reading
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book, hooks you from the start.  Everyone I know who read it feels the same way.  Now I want to look for other books by William Landay.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Everybody gets this app it is free for today whohoo and if u miss this deal go on 4shared .com get an account and download anything you want and it detects if it's a virus
B005LAII44|5.0|I was a fan of G.I. Joe since I was a child back in the 1980's.  This movie reminded me a lot of the original carton series that ran back then.  I recognized most of the characters like Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow, Firefly, Zartan, Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jay.  The acting and story line of this movie was excellent.  If you are a fan of G.I. Joe, do yourself a favor and get this movie to add to your collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great and fun game recommend to get it its really epic game rate 5 stars if it's not fun to you then you suck
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant is my favorite Doctor right now. Was sad to see him go. The final season was interesting and exciting to me, but inevitably ended up sadly as his time as the Doctor ended.

0399255370|5.0|I bought this for my 5-year old grand daughter after reading a review. Every kid loves to draw and here were the crayons writing notes! Each note/letter was written by a different colored crayon from its point of view. Some complained that they were never used and some complained that they were used too much e.g. blue which had become stubby after being used to color skies and oceans. The black crayon complained that it was used just to draw outlines. One of them pleaded with the kid to keep within the outlines and so on. A lovely story.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I am new to automatic and mechanical wind wristwatches, so, after purchasing a rather expensive battery operated quartz movement over a year before this Seiko the battery went dead and that was a huge disappointment for me. The battery operated quarts movement watch that I owned was supposed to have a 5 year life but died much sooner. I took the watch to a jeweler to have the battery replaced and the cost for the replacement battery was through the roof. Not only was it expensive to have the battery replaced but the Jeweler ruined the water resistance 'integrity' of the watch by smashing the o-ring that seals the back of my watch. Well, it didn't take long for my battery operated watch to become totally destroyed by water intrusion. Almost immediately after my battery watch failed that's when I decided that I was no longer going to buy 'ANYMORE' battery operated wristwatches so, the search began for a new mechanical or automatic watch. It took a long while, I was shopping almost everyday for over a month but most of the wristwatches were overly expensive and had features I wasn't really excited about. After about 2 months of shopping I accidentally stumbled upon these Seiko's. I sure am glad I waited and found them. I AM VERY PLEASED!<br /><br />When I received my new Seiko automatic wristwatch I could see right of way it was no piece of junk. It was heavy and felt good in my hands. The dial was easy to read even without my eyeglasses. I am a 54 year old man with extremely poor vision so I need high contrast to see the time and daily calendar. Although some reviewers may have complained it's smaller then what they had expected, I think it's a very appropriate size for both males and females. Perhaps for some people and I guess depending on your taste in fashion and social statement perhaps it may be to small for some men. I am a 6 foot man at 260 pounds and I think it's a perfect size and I am very picky. Just so everyone knows, most of the watches I currently own are the Invicta Russian Divers and they're huge timepieces, I really love those large watches however, this smaller Seiko watch was refreshing. What I mean by refreshing: I am always worried about ruining my other expensive watches, I don't wear them everyday but this Seiko is a watch I can wear everyday and not worry about banging it around since they are cheap enough to actually purchase several others.<br /><br />These Seiko's are perfect for everyday wear. I usually only wear my Invicta's when I go to dinner or some other social gathering but these Seiko's are actually very pretty and masculine enough to go out for dinner or other social occasions. Really, it's not that small and it's also not an ugly watch. This Seiko wristwatch probably won't get noticed as much as perhaps another more expensive wristwatch but if you take it off and show it to someone I know they are going to like it. I think what matters most to myself is knowing that I have a brand new 'name brand' Seiko quality wristwatch and never have to worry about a battery ever again or accidentally breaking it. I'm usually pretty careful so I am not really worried about breaking it although, this Seiko feels really tough so I think it can take a good beating.<br /><br />Let me tell you what I like about my new Seiko wristwatch. First, It keeps perfect time. After just a few days it's still accurate...I like the size of this watch, large watches get bumped a quite a bit however this watch has a lower profile so it's not likely to easily bump into things as you perform your daily chores... I like the stem at the 4 O'clock position because it makes it much easier to adjust without having to remove the watch from my arm...The brushed steel finish is absolutely beautiful... The crystal is flat making the watch face easy to read at any angle... I truly like the high contrast of the hands against the dial... The calendar is very large and very easy to see with ample contrast even without my eyeglasses... Pulling the stem out one click sets the calendar without stopping the watch, turn the stem clockwise for the day and counter clockwise for the date... I like that the watch movement does not stop operating when the stem is pulled all the way out to adjust the time, you can however stop the watch from ticking if you put some slight counterclockwise pressure on the stem, this allows for more accurate time setting. A little more counterclockwise pressure also makes the watch run backwards for even more accurate time setting... I happen to like the watch band and buckle, too... What I really like are the luminescent hands and markers. I noticed just this morning after 5 hours of compete darkness the hands and markers were still view-able although, the luminescence wasn't overly bright but there was just enough to see the time in complete darkness... I like that the watch is not overly complicated with sub-dials. Everything I need to know about the time and date is supplied with this Seiko... I like that it's water resistant... Finally, I really like that's it's a Seiko but more importantly it's the perfect wristwatch with all the perfect features for the perfect price... This watch has all the features I was looking for in a in a new watch... I have to say, &#34;I am so very happy with this new watch so I just purchased two more in different colors, the tan and the blue. Soon I will buy a green and another black.<br /><br />I think you'll truly enjoy this Seiko wristwatch! I am not disappointed whatsoever so, I highly recommend the purchase of this watch. For this kind of money, it's absolutely PERFECT!<br /><br />Thank you for reading :)ing the stem out one click sets the calendar without stopping the watch, turn the stem clockwise for the day and counter clockwise for the date...

B003QSPTAY|4.0|My favorite version of this classic &#34;kids educating parents: genre.  One of the Disney Greats before the invention of computer generated graphics and video editing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I normally don't like games like this but this game is very enjoyable. It is very addicting I would recommend this game if you like puzzles
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|this CD is better than the previous one. more up beat, and some different types of music that is refreshingly different and good
B00000J2PH|5.0|Brings back the early 70s. Carol King was a master at writing a good tune.Her music will be etched into stone.
B00EJY051C|5.0|This is one of Amanda Seyfried's best works to date. The true story comes across well, and the parallel of public opinion and what went on behind the scenes was expertly executed. Totally worth seeing.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Didn't care for this one, was a bit  boring and I don't think its for kids. Too many steps to accomplish the chore.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a good game you should give it a Rey I play everyday or when I get a chance type type ty.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I absolutely love this game and can't stop playing it. Had to buy it to play full version. Got  my husband  hooked on it too. I play it every chance I get. Love it.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|Jobim was a genious of latin music. So many of the standards of latin jazz were written and recorded by him.Love it. Alot of other artists sing these songs but no one like Frank and Jobim can do them justice.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|There's not quite as much variation of style and groove on this album as some of the other Black Keys albums I have. I still like it and listen to it frequently, but it's got quite a few skippable songs. Overall, it's still rockin', just not AS excellent.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I liked this one so much I immediately went looking for season two, but  I could not find it, there are so many other great things to watch, I haven't taken the time to research it. Overall I thought it was a very good show, maybe a little short?
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I spent 30 years in Washington among the politicians and worked in the Reagan WH.  I didn't read anything in this book that didn't ring true.  Nothing was exaggerated or made up to the best of my knowledge.  I kept trying to find some author bias towards Democrats or Republicans, but there is none there.  A great read for political junkies.
B00338QELU|5.0|Fascinating international mystery from Henning Mankell. Highly recommend to all readers. Engrossing novel in the tradition of Swedish police procedurally with a twist.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|Devildriver has always true to their roots not straying the path but still staying fresh. Beast was a little bit of a let down but WK picks it back up. Not thier best imo prey for villians n fury of our makers hand are my favs but still a close 3rd. Keep it metal \m/
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It\\"s o.k but as it is it\\"s nothing special.only plays songs I have uploaded to Google play music ,others in my library won't play.Youtube works,but my Apple tv does that .it\\"s a cool gadget,when more apps work with it I think it will be much better.
B000I8G594|5.0|Probably my favorite Johnny Depp movie. Considering that I can't stand Johnny Depp as an actor, you need to take my statement as credible.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|If you love quirky characters and mysterious towns you will love Haven. Couldn't believe I hadn't discovered this show before.
B00860YICC|5.0|This is a great movie and Tim Roth really makes it even better!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for<br />a movie that makes you want to see it again and again!
0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore is a great book to take to the beach in summertime. It is light, witty and a decent page turner. There are a few items in the book that are a bit too convenient (what, you don't have millionaire friends that are able to pay for every trip you take on a whim?) and some characters that are a bit one dimensional (I think the villain even has a mustache)-- but I didn't say this was a literary heavy-weight. Just a fun and quick read I'd recommend.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I had to read this. I had a kitty for 17 years named Bob (a ginger) who I loved so much. I am so glad these two found each other.<br /><br />And the life lessons the human learned from his animal brother is uplifting.
B00821OX98|5.0|This was a great show. I loved every minute of it. If you loved the show Revolution then you will love this tv show.
B002LHTRV8|5.0|I love Johnny Depp as an actor. There has never been a time that he has disappointed me. I love the suspense and how dramatic this movie was. I remembered this movie as a kid and I still enjoy it as an adult. I will soon be purchasing this movie and adding it to my collection instead of renting it all the time.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Drags on with distracting detail until it closes with a rush.  Review form requires these superfluos extra silly nine words.
0786838655|5.0|I know I should be embarrassed by how much I loved this book, at least given the fact that I'm nowhere near the YA target audience. Still, this is one of my favorites. The story is funny, witty, charming, and utterly entertaining. I love mythology anyway, but mythology that's sort of accurate? Massive, unexpected bonus. This entire series is amazing, and the author is both clearly brilliant and deeply admired.
B000W1YYEK|5.0|Just as you would expect this album holds up under the test of time. New wave is quickly forgotten but not these riffs.  Excellent in every way
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Quite fine product if you need this kind of handy tripod camera holder for your phone. I ordered this a year ago and I'm still using it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|loved this book.  this author is an amazing story teller!  i couldn't wait to get through the book to see how the stories connected.
1416972242|5.0|Thank you Cassandra Clare! My daughter blazed through the first book so quickly and LOVED it, we HAD to buy book #2 while we were on vacation...she couldn't stand to wait! :-)
B00915G6SU|4.0|HATED to give Criminal Minds anything but a 5 star review.  I have loved this show from the very first episode.  The casting on this show has always been top notch, especially since it's been a bit of a revolving door.  I don't know if Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) decided to leave the show or if they made a serious blunder by getting rid of her...much as they did when they didn't renew J.J.'s contract, but the show REALLY took a turn for the worse this year.  They could have saved it with some great casting, but I seriously DO NOT like the Jeanne Tripplehorn character!!  Maybe a decent actress could have done a better job, but I doubt it.  She does not fit in with the group, could not be more boring to watch and whenever she's on I tend to zone out and have actually walked away from TV when she's on.  This is something I have never done in the previous 7 seasons, I am usually on the edge of my seat through each episode.  I love this show so much and hate that they are starting their downhill slide, but I dislike the character so much that I doubt I will sit through or even DVR another season with her on it.  I intend to buy season 8 in hopes that they realize how bad it is with her on it and fix it like they did when J.J. was not on.  All that negativity aside...you are missing one of the best, most exciting shows ever on tv if you don't catch the first 7 seasons.  Before this year I actually planned my week around making sure I didn't miss an episode.  There's never been another show quite like it before.
1416972250|5.0|We absolutely love the Mortal Instruments series. Had to buy this book while we were on vacation because book #1 and #2 were SO good we couldn't wait to read the rest of the series
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exciting!  Keeps you turning pages.  Easy language for me as a Norwegean.  Makes you wandering: Do persons like Andy really exist?
B005RAO0GS|3.0|The only time I listen to this album is while hiking.  Otherwise I find it kind of mediocre.  But while hiking, it kind of gets me excited.
B003UESJEM|5.0|Great movie with a great message about honor in the professional world!  I have already watched it twice and really loved it.
B005XOPEOU|3.0|This album was just mediocre.  Definitely one of my least favorite's of Coldplay.  There are a few notable songs on this album, but none to write home about.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked the first Dredd, however this one was a step above it.  While most people didn't seem to care for it, I like it
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I walked in to a patient's room.  He was around 75 years old and reading this book.  He told me if I wanted to have an accurate view of the era in which he grew up, I should read this book.  I did.  I loved, loved loved it.  It was so wonderfully written, historically accurate yet had that mystical storyline that made you anxious to see what was next.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book is a book where you weren't suspected to read a book sad and funny. I think the has many genres
1589944607|5.0|If you want to face an amazing Battlestar Galactica experience, you definitely should play this game. This boardgame is focused especially on the first season, with all that paranoia and tension that we feel when watching the show. It brings such an immersion that a Battlestar Galactica fan will love.<br /><br />We've played here after rewatching some key episodes (such as \\"33\\" in the first season) and it was great to confront the same experiences of our beloved characters. It's always a huge surprise when the cylon or the cylons are revealed during the game: it's quite astonishing when you find out that you best friend playing on your side is the cylon, making you feel shocked just like when you discover who is a cylon on the show. I think the best part of this game is how it \\"translates\\" the same feelings and experiences of the show when playing.<br /><br />I must write a note about the product itself: the quality of the materials used in the board game, character sheets, tokens, etc., are outstanding. I was really impressed by the quality of the cardboard, even with the box... Fantasy Flight did an amazing job with this one. Love it.
B001GJ3BR8|4.0|I recommend checking it out  the story makes more sense and the loose ends are tightened up .  its also a little Darker
B005D9MUWY|5.0|none better that I have found.  It works just as it should, and the swype feature feels like a phone!
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|No wonder this movie did not make it.  It was a stupid plot and the only judge that took their helmut off was a female!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great Book! The author really describes each character to the point, that you feel like you could know them!<br /><br />You just want to hug the people you love, after reading this book.<br /><br />The main character, James, will have your heart from the very beginning!
034580709X|5.0|Love love love the character Harry Hole.  A loveable, pitiful hero.  I love Nesbo's writing style.  His prose just flows.  He is very descriptive and lays it all out for the reader with his flawed protagonist.  Happy to at last have a beginning for Harry Holy!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Chuckkkkkkkk<br />Must read fantastic can't wait to v read book two sad ending but still a must read can't v wait for the movie
0786711647|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Had I read it in the 50's I would have enjoyed it much better.  Good mystery/thriller.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Enjoy the beauty of a Celtic Woman dvd of live music with the women's beautiful singing and dancing in a romantic setting.<br />They are supported by an exquisite chorus & extraordinary musicians. A wonderfully entertaining performance that you'll enjoy many times over!
000744785X|5.0|Although Storm of Swords is available in a 1 book edition, the 2 book (Part 1/Steel and Snow, Part 2/Blood and Gold ) is the complete version. A 'must have' for any die-hard GoT fan.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Since I'm not a teenaged girl I just could not be drawn into the story and so I'm giving it a just OK rating. The author though has talent even if the plot seems to be a rehash of many other stories. You know what I mean... the vampire and werewolf thing. Now where have you heard that before? OH ! Twilight !
B000002KON|5.0|I've been a big Kinks fan ever since I was in middle school, and they've been deeply influential in my own music.  This is a fantastic concept album which brilliantly showcases Ray's songwriting genius, Dave's ever-interesting guitar work, and-I believe- was the first album to exclusively feature Mick's drumming (which is rock solid on here) instead of that of a session player.<br />The songs range in style from the brilliant ballad Shangri-La to the rocking Victoria to the protest-driven Yes Sir, No Sir and Some Mother's Son, to a jazzier solo by Dave on Mr. Churchill Says.<br />All in all, a truly fantastic Kinks album--- a must have for any fan of 60s music, classic/English rock, or Kinks fan!
B006JJBFK0|4.0|For those of us that miss the Nightwish glory days of Oceanborn and Wishmaster, there’s Xandria. Xandria seem to be the best at capturing the whole Symphonic Metal sound which made Nightwish so great.  Xandria’s new vocalist does an excellent job and seems to channel Tarja at times.  That’s not a bad thing, really. Xandria’s other musicians are excellent in their own right and play memorable music. I’ll take away one star only because I’ve heard their type of music many times before. Originality aside, when I need my Symphonic Metal fix, I’ll gladly sign up to buy their next release.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|The setting of this retirement home was gorgeous. Even though they referred to a possible shut down of the facility if they did not successfully and profitably complete the &#34;Gala&#34;, that bit of drama did not interfere with the basic story line which was the relationship of the characters played by Maggie Smith and Tom Courtney. What a great ensemble cast! Great job of direction by Mr. Hoffman.
B000PMG16U|3.0|The Star Wars Prequels are a lot like the stereotypical supermodel.  It’s sure pretty to look at but there’s just not much there.  Sure the special effects, sound and video are crisp, clear and awesome but there’s no real heart there. Is there a plot? Are there memorable characters? Are there memorable lines, scenes and dialogue?  Great acting? Ummmmm not really.  I wish Jar Jar and young Anakin would fall off the universe, they’re so bad. Still..if you’re a Star Wars junkie needing to see your heroes in the highest definition and best sound then buy these.  Please JJ Abrams save this universe.. just do it without so many light flares.
B00BSHVSQ4|5.0|I Love the History of the Eagles Super Deluxe Limited Edition! it is everything that I hoped for & more!
B0054JELTI|5.0|Dreamwork’s Shrek may be one of the best animated movies of all time. Many of today’s animated features borrow from the Shrek formula. Where else can one have an animated movie that appeals to both kids and adults equally? What a fun movie where classic fairy tale creatures and characters get warped and turned “inside out” from their classically accepted and told tales. My grown-up “kids” have watched this movie countless times since they were young.  Now they laugh out loud at all the parts they “missed” when they were watching with younger eyes.
B00AS85ENC|5.0|Really great series.  My husband's father was there and I caught my Marine wiping his eyes more than once.  Very accurate.  His Dad told him many things that were here in the disks.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Very fun game. I be knocking those monkeys OUT! This game is really well made. I'm a gamer and this is truly one of the best boxing games I've ever played.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was an amazing thriller just like the first in series. Can't wait to read what is in store next!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|this nesbo book was much better than the one I read previously, red beast, which I did not like very much; more action in this one & the story was much easier to follow esp towards the ending; hole is quite a character in this one; book is a good read
B009NW9QE2|4.0|I like Kate too but the best is to see Jude Law and he cries sooooooo romantic! This is a cute romantic comedy :)
1401235417|5.0|its cool, fun, and really good. there is a few pretty graphic parts, incase you don't want your kid to see some of that like bloody dead bodies and all, but there not much of that, its really good and I would recommend it for any batman fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the greatest ever I always look for horse apps and this is a winner for shore I mean like why not don't hold ur horse app need back download today!!
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|What a great movie for us old time Trekkers! If you loved the original TV Series you will also love this movie(in our opinion)...
B009X011UQ|5.0|it works great.  the sound is good, color is pretty, light weight, easy to use, and does the job. :)
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I had this CD when it first came out and I loved it, and then I lost it. I had to have it again. One of the best albums of all time.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I TRIED to sign up for it, but it said my email and phone number were invalid.  So I signed up on the REAL Facebook and got in right away!
B00132D808|5.0|I'm a huge fan of their first album and this one is growing on me. It's a very different approach to their song writing, but still very good playing all around.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This movie was good, but I did not like the ending at all it could have been a little more suspensful to grab the audience attention
B000H7JD90|5.0|I love my turntable, great sound comes from this album.<br />I love this record, a great listen!<br /><br />Very happy customer!
B008220DGE|4.0|I'm surprised by the negative reviews of this.  The acting was brilliant, and it was a really interesting character study, as well as a look at manipulation of others and ourselves.
B000095K7A|5.0|Warm sound comes from this album, off my turntable.<br />I have strayed from my MP3 player and have been relying mainly on my turntable for music.<br /><br />A new great experience.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. It makes me fall asleep right away and I don't have to worry about anyone annoying me . It's so cool.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|No doubts whether or not this unit will do the trick in keeping a CPU Cool!!!<br />This Unit comes shipped with everything you'll need in order to get the installation done<br />and even comes with Thermal Paste. The picture shows 2 fans but only comes with 1<br />when shipped but another can be easliy added if needed. This unit is too large to fit<br />in a HP Workstation Mid-Tower Case and will not allow me to close my side panel<br />so I was forced to use the stock cooler/fan already with my System. I will be holding onto<br />it for any future builds. 5 Stars even though it didn't fit exactly the way I wanted it.<br />I should have paid closer attention to the specs when ordering so I cannot fault the<br />Manufacturer on this. The instructions given are a little vague to anyone who is new<br />to building or upgrading machines, fortunately I've had enough experience to breeze<br />right through without difficulties.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Fairy tales are a part of life. They teach us not to give up on who or what you believe in. So if you haven't read this book do so you will love it. For those who have seen this movie and haven't read the book I think you will love it too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is so fun me and my friend love it can't wait for further updates you can build any thing kids use your imagination.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a real brain teaser. I could do this for hours. Keeps you on point and focused to solve the puzzle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|totally awesome game!!! I cud spend an entire day playing this thing & it wudd never get old!! It's 1 of those games where u can always get better! Nothing negative to say about it!!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great and easy to locate words. Find similar words for crosswords and other puzzles.<br />Very good app for kindle users.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I'm giving this book to my granddaughters to read and take notes. It's too late for me, but not for them. Sheryl is amazing and has loads of good advice for young women.
B004I744AS|5.0|Use this also for puzzles and finding words to make sure things are spelled correctly, when writing the old fashion way.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I like this movie.  I am a huge science fiction fan and this did not disappoint.  But, I had to watch it twice in order to understand the scope of the plot because of the complexity of the story....with much of the explanation of why earth was destroyed and just who the enemy or bad guys were being divulged through dialogue of characters.  It could have been a little more descriptive about the aliens but that being said, I must say I really enjoyed watching the movie....even the second time around.  It was action packed as are most all of Tom Cruise movies and the plot was twisted, which keeps you guessing.  I would recommend this movie to all Science Fiction movie bugs.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is different from all the other games that I have downloaded recently. Is fun to try to figure out the clues to make all types of things, pop cultural, historical and everyday things are depicted in this game and that's what makes it fun.  It's definitely worth a try, I recommend it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This was so easy to use! My 5 year old granddaughter taught my 2 year old grandson has to use it! They have had tons of fun!
B000002IU9|5.0|Another magnificent album from the heavy hitters of power metal. This album continues the saga of the True Metal pioneers, MANOWAR. They never disappoint their fans with a weak, feeble album. This is powerful, melodic, and TRUE.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. However, there are these wrapped presents in the target areas that give you a special bonus!<br />The bonus is an opportunity to buy another angry bird game. If you click on it takes you to Amazon.com so you can buy it on the spot.<br />And it keeps coming back to haunt future games. The first couple of times it was cute. There after it was an annoying distraction from the game being played.
B00004IC9G|5.0|Anyone who has ever liked metal, will want the original Manowar starter record. With awesome guitar work to the unique sounding bass, and the most powerful drums I think I have ever heard, this is why 30 years later, this album is STILL available to metalheads around the globe. A must have for TRUE METAL lovers.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I enjoy Sudoku puzzles, but They can get boring after a while. Here there are 6 different games to break the monotony. I also appreciate the 8 levels of difficulty as opposed to 3 or 5 that one usually sees. It makes it easier to measure ones progress. Best part of all, no glitches in the game.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I don't find game chtallenging however just completed chapter2, perhaps will get more interesting. For now it is something to do when you have nothing to do.
B000050HTO|5.0|All songs are what would be from Dylan. Quantity and quality are excellent. Couldn't ask for better than this collection.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|So we started with season 5 and Matt Smith.  Then we went to seasons 3 and 4 with the 10th doctor, David Tennant.  It was hard to go back to the 9th doctor for season 1.  He's just so different from #10 and #11.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|this is a great game. Challenging but not impossible like some other games.  I would recommend it.  I wish it had moe then 10 levels though.
B003G94BZC|5.0|LOVED it - Season 5 got us hooked on watching all the new generations of doctors 8 through 11.  we'll miss matt!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I've been meaning to see this for a long time. I watched the one season Stargate Universe, and fell in love. I started watching the other series, and a friend told me that it was all based on this movie; he said that I had to watch it. That I did, and I loved it!<br /><br />If you're like me, and you've seen the shows, you'll love seeing the start of it all. Even if you haven't seen the show(s), it's a great movie! I highly recommend it. If you haven't seen the shows, and you like this movie, definitely check them out!
140006922X|4.0|Like so many others, I originally bought this book to thumb my nose at Fox's infamously bigoted interview with Prof. Aslan. But, after my ire at Fox dampened down, I found myself enjoying the book immensely. Though I knew much of it before, from other historical research about the life and times of Jesus, the retelling is delightful. He may be a scholar of comparative religion, but Aslan tells the story like a good mystery writer. So few academics can write well, so his book is refreshing. Reminds me of what Barbara Tuchmann did for the history of WWI and the Middle Ages. Or Manchester did for the life of Churchill.<br /><br />The other thing I think Aslan has done artfully is to separate the dogma of Christian faith from the reality of what probably actually happened--without making you choose between them. This book in no way challenged my faith, or made me doubt the history. You can read this book and retain your faith in Jesus Christ, if you are a believing Christian, and, at the same time, understand what Jesus of Nazareth, the human being, may have actually been like. It is also a wonderful introduction to the evolution of the early Church, of the politics of first century Palestine, of the schism between Paul and Peter, and how the New Testament came to be created and edited during the four centuries after the Crucifixion.<br /><br />Well done, Prof. Aslan. You've whetted my appetite for more.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Was not let down.  I am half way thru Season 3 now anticipating the Oct 10 premier of Season 4.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Overall, engaging reading. There are lots of characters and it takes a while to understand the family and social connections.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Never watched series in the beginning.  My son told me how good it was.  I have not been disappointed.  It's not about the &#34;walkers&#34;.  It's the story of survival and still maintaining some humanity.  Love it!! I'm hooked!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Attention getter from the start.  Hated to put the book down and return to real life. It's a must read!
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I hid this up in my dash for use with my carpc running Windows and Centrafuse. This runs a serial to usb converter to communicate with the GPS chip. Works well in Windows xp, 7, both 32 and 64 bit. I had some issues with noise but started using it with xport to clean that up. Gets very good reception compared to any handheld GPS or smartphone.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I think I was to old for this book if that makes sense. 10 years ago I would of loved it an probably would have read the rest in the series but it just didn't do it for me. I was actually really disappointed that Clary and Jace were brother and sister. Anyway if you are 14-17..maybe even 18 this would be a great read.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|I have seen it a million times but still an all time favorite! A definite must see for a laugh!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its free its addictive and my kid loves it so it gives me some free time.... so I give it two thumbs up...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book for read aloud in the classroom. 5th graders will enjoy this as well.  Complex text and vocabulary too
B005PK553C|5.0|I loved American Horror story 2nd season so I bought the first. Not only was it awesome but really great to watch without the commercials. Great that I could watch it on my phone , computer or kindle.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My wife has been watching this series on USA Network since it debuted.  I caught a couple of ads on TV and decided to check it out!  It is awesome!!  I love the story lines, the character development and the brashness of the show!  Must see TV.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|My two and three year old nephews love this movie, and can watch it over and over. It tells a lovely story as well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this second book, almost as good as the first one but not quite.  I would certainly recommend it to others.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|My two and three year old nephews love this movie, and can watch it over and over. It tells a lovely story as well.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|This game is pretty good, but it doesn't have all the features that glow hockey 2 has. And the thing is that glow hockey 2 is not available for the kindle fire but is available for aneroid and iphone. Also, one time after I finished my game an ad popped up and another time the entire game turned into a pixel game. WEIRD
B004C3DLJS|4.0|My two and three year old nephews love this movie, and can watch it over and over. It tells a lovely story as well.
B00C7LB20C|4.0|I never heard of this movie but I'm glad I gave it a shot. It was engrossing with a few plot twists. I loved it.
1451627297|5.0|This book begs to be read again and again to experience all of the possible interpretations.  It is thought provoking in so many ways!  Absolutely loved it!
1452126577|2.0|Mostly pictures with sarcastic comments.I'm glad to know who Grumpy cat is........I thought he lived with me, but I expected the book to be more like &#34;Bite Me&#34; by Max Thompson which I gave 5 stars.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|We love the Bakersfield sound and Vince Gill sings like an angel so how could we go wrong?  Very well done in every aspect!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The director has visual flair, no doubt. Throughout, some of the scenes looked like pure broadway extravaganza. The story comes through as Fitzgerald generally told it, but the overly glitzy sparkle was distracting, and seemed to be making up for some relatively uninspired acting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan has created a credible history with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the historical Jesus was a political and religious activist within the context of the Law of Moses (i.e; a Jew) in a time of political unrest against the invading Romans and the Jewish priestly class, and not by his own ministry neither claiming to be the Messiah nor the Son of God sent to form a new religion, each of which assertions came after his death from people who did not know him or hear him preach. This kind of academic treatment of the person whose life gave rise to the phenomenon of Christianity is truly enlightening, and should not be read as a threat to those of faith. A great read.
B007NRWLZ0|3.0|Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney<br />and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd<br />McFarlane's comic book. A murdered assassin is chosen to be<br />hell's ultimate weapon exacting revenge. This isn't bad, The<br />cast is good and I like how the characters are named after<br />McFarlane's real-life friends. This Blu-ray has nice picture<br />and sound plus some neat extras. I recommend this,<br />especially for comic book fans.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the genres of historical fiction and drama.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|We just found this series since we do not have Showtime on cable TV and we LOVE it!!  The writing is very good with a lot of dark humor blended into the life of this very interesting man.  Clearly not a series for everyone, but for us, it's just too much fun to watch.
B00CVDPQAS|5.0|Great book!<br />It's funny and very easy to follow. The best introduction to learning design patterns, also contains very useful practical examples.
0553801473|5.0|I was totally impressed with this one...MUCH better than Book 4.  Cannot wait for book 6 to come out soon!
B00866H7SS|4.0|Nice but similar to Fifty Shades. I lovrd it though and wil recommend it. Great tempo and a relaxing read.
0399160450|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series.  Even met Tom Clancy when he signed &#34;The Bear and the Dragon&#34; for me years ago.  What an amazing writer.  I wish he'd write about the Air Force a little more than he doues though...his books seem to concentrate on the Navy's power.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Well acted.  We loved the story and the action was fun to sit through.  It's a rare movie now that tells a story well and has action both.  This one gets my vote.
0553801503|3.0|This was the worst of the 5, but still a great book.  The Game of Thrones series is the best show on TV right now.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love English series to begin with, but this how makes me a aware that life even in a small place like Lark Rise and Candleford has its own intrigue, problems, miseries and revelations. It's a charming show and I have watch all 4 seasons.
0553106635|5.0|Love the Game of Thrones Series.  Can't wait for the future books to come out.  Please Hurry, George!!  Long live the Khaleesi!
B009GX69RK|4.0|Not quite as funny as the first season but still really funny.  There is a lot more yelling and arguing and I feel like Nick got a lot goofier.
0062515675|5.0|My wife loves this book and recommends it to everyone she knows.  If you have a chance, give it a try.
B00B1OWEVC|3.0|I won't go into too many details, but suffice it to say that I've only listened a couple times.  I originally thought that a band whose name pays tribute to a Coil album would be edgy, dark and esoteric.  Instead, this second album from Reznor's current project is just downtempo pop music.<br /><br />Whatever happened to music with soul?
0553108034|5.0|Love the Game of Thrones series.  Not usually a fan of medieval-type stories, but I am hooked!  Keep on writing, George!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I loved Scribblenauts for the DS and was excited to see it for the Kindle Fire. I ordered it and like it so much that I bought the extra worlds for it. Unfortunately, the Worlds never loaded properly. I contacted Amazon and, as always, they're great about refunds. They also suggested I uninstall Scribblenauts and try loading it again and buying the Worlds. I tried that, and, again, the Worlds never loaded. The game is a blast, but WB has to do something about getting the extra Worlds to load properly. If they fixed that, I would be a happy camper.
0553103547|5.0|Love the Game of Thrones series.  Not usually a fan of medieval-type stories, but I am hooked!  Keep on writing, George!
B000001FFJ|5.0|I'm a huge Waits fan and I think this is quite possibly my favorite in his extensive list of albums.  Most of the songs are very short and leave you wanting more, luckily there are 19 tracks.  Waits really explored his range during these recordings.  Recommended to anyone who is interested in Tom Waits or just looking for new music.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I read this because my son was reading it also.  The intro is a bit hard to follow, but the four agreements are common sense adages - sometimes difficult to adhere to, but certainly worth the try.  The book overall is easy to follow, and it will be one I will return to from time to time for a &#34;refresher course.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|My daughter and I have enjoyed this movie together for over 10 years, and we still love to watch it a couple times per year!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome if you don't buy it you don't have good taste of picking a game who  agrees
B004GHNH7Q|4.0|Sadly my over 40 eyesight did not see that this book was essays. I thought I was ordering the novel. My old paperback was falling apart, and needed a new version. Oh well, I will say it's interesting, but definitely not as good as the story.
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|The music is very powerful and even helps to develop the characters. In the tracks &#34;Newt&#34; and &#34;Kaiju Groupie&#34; you can hear a bit of a swagger to the music, which works exceedingly well for Newt's character and his &#34;Rockstar&#34; persona.<br /><br />While some really standing out and last long after the music is over (&#34;Pacific Rim,&#34; &#34;Cancelling the Apocalypse,&#34; and &#34;Hannibal Chau&#34; to name a few, others fall flat. The repetition of the Kaiju attack theme, while effective, leaves you wishing Djawadi had added more variety to it when you hear it in almost all the &#34;attack&#34; tracks.<br /><br />Other than that complaint, this is a fantastic score and I'm so glad I picked it up. I love listening to this while I drive; makes me feel like wherever the destination, I'm headed for victory.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Yes, I liked this book. Good Little autobiography of Tesla. It's fun, positive and gives an insight in to an unwritten history. Details the bankers and capitalists would like to forget.
B0035JRVBO|4.0|I like how the movie address challenges of the handicapped and how it shows the perspective of war through a veterans eyes. even though the movie is make believe, the truth does show through.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just enough cliffhanger and multiple plots going on while not getting too difficult to follow along with the over all storyline
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am in the process of watching Season 3 as we speak. This is a pleasant surprise in television programming given what is available today. Well written. Hope the writers can keep up the suspense.
B00EVVAXQU|4.0|There are a lot of songs in this 'New' song. Its a McCartney song, His style. It has a 1967 sound to it. There's no Information yet of who play's what on the song. One point about it, I wish his Bass playing was louder in the mix and its to short. I'm glad there's a new studio album being released soon.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Very engrossing series.  I love following all of the characters, though the battles get a bit tedious.  Not a book for light readers.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This special love story is so great because it follows a couple from their young love to their wonderful special love in their senior years.<br />It shows easy love to the kind of love that continue through the difficulties of life, aging, loss and patience.<br />The young actors are vibrant and the actors portraying the elderly are marvelous.<br />A must see film for men and women, couples and singles.  For those in love and those wanting to find love.<br />I fear dementia and failing health as I get older but, know that the love my husband and I have for each other will help us through what may come.<br />This film gives us a gentle reminder of loving can last a lifetime.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I'm a big Eagles fan and loved this DVD set!! Don't hesitate to purchase! Great music and very enlightening. Excellent!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very riveting. Can't wait to see the movie.<br />Exemplifies the strength of the human spirit and our will to survive.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great RPG A fun way to pass some time. Only drawback is the gems. They should make it for a console.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This is a good read. I really never knew there were people out in the world that had so little items in their homes. I for one have way too much, but, I got some fantastic tips for minimizing my wardrobe! Love it!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The bag has ample space. The quality of the cloth does not look like the branded ones but it does the work so no issues.
B004SBULWE|4.0|I know Task Killer from other platforms and it's always been a pleasure to work with. The app does exactly what it promises!
B0084AZXKK|1.0|I did not like it at all . I had to read it f or school and I wouldn't recommend it
B00957T6X6|5.0|My husband and son read this book series three times now.  I'm sure enjoying the characters and how their stories intertwine. I was thrilled when I saw this 5-Book Boxed Set for my Kindle. I had to have it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|My introduction to Gaiman was through American Gods.  I absolutely adored the book.  This book is consistent Gaiman's quirky and unusual plot lines and a must for his fans, or those who'd like to take a look at a most talented and ingenious author.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Love this show! It's witty and fun and maybe even a little addictive. Wanted to get the full back story so I purchased the first season and record everything else on dvr.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|The graphics are great.  The family really enjoyed watching it together.  We are into that magical, adventure stuff.  Reminds me of Lord of the Rings
B005VGMYZM|5.0|THERE IS NOT A BETTER MUSICIAN IN THE WORLD THAN ANDRE!!!  HE AND HIS ORCHESTRA MAKE THE MUSIC SING IN YOUR HEART AND YOUR FEET JUST WANT TO DANCE!!!!!  JOHN
B007NYPWS6|5.0|Loved this.  I love movies like this.  If you don't like dialog and adults acting like children (I do!) then skip the movie.  They never leave the apartment.  I saw myself in almost every character and it was fun seeing others I'm close to in these characters.  Great movie.  Why didn't they just leave?! LOL
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It is a neat and fun game that got harder as I went along. My friend got this app to after watching me play it.
B000001E3L|5.0|Outstanding show, wish I had been there.  This CD features the best arrangements, awesome musicians!  I am wearing it out!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|When I play this game I wonder why I play it but then I can never put it down till the coins run out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very good price for what it does.  You will not be disappointed.  I have not had any problems with product.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app all the time. I have always loved reading and it is nice to know that if I finish a book while I am out I can just pick a new one. A must for readers.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I found this book very entertaining.  Maggie finds herself in the middle of an international murder mystery.  The police seem less than enthused, and just want to close the case.  Maggie is the older, more modern  Nancy Drew.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|It is a good clean fun game. It is good for kids and adults. I like playing it and when I have to babysit it gives me something the kids to play too.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This helped me understand my mom's slow decent into dementia.  I look at her differently now. Thank you Lisa Genova!
0316069884|5.0|Has turned a few of my girl friends into straight vegetarians, just from reading this book. Read with caution. extra word
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love castle and the interactions between Beckett and castle. Can't wait for the new season to see what happens. Highly recommend this show to anyone v
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son was all smiles when he opened up this lego set for his birthday!  Great for kids that are into the Mindcraft games.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The fast pace and plot twist that were well known from previous movies made it real fun to watch. Its hard to follow up from the previous movie as more an homage to ideas previously explored.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Again I figured out some of it and now I'm stuck and don't know what to do and no place to go for help.
0062238868|5.0|With the movie being cast and filmed, I'd offer you to read this first, before you ever see the movie...Chris was a GREAT American doing a thankless job....
B0036S4B6M|2.0|The story gives you an idea of day to day life in a minimum security prison facility but each day is pretty much the same. I quickly lost interest but kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. I wouldn't recommend.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Yet another great read from this author. Another book you will NOT want to put down until its finished! :) Im sad ot see him lose his cancer battle!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Hard evidence for Jesus is very slim, so the writer choses to flesh-out the period in detail, in order to get a better understanding for how this &#34;jewish troublemaker&#34; became the foundation for a new religion. Copiously referenced from the bible, the gospels and contemporary historians, this fascinating read, traces the contours of the historical Jesus in much the way modern imaging technology reveals lost treasure at the bottom of the sea. I've been a skeptic regarding the historicity of Jesus, but Aslan makes the case for the probability of his existence. The chapters dealing with the subject of Paul, are sure to be of interest (and maybe some irritation), to folks for whom faith gets in the way of objectivity. But whether you are a believer, or simply curious, this book is a very engaging read; religion is after all, our first attempt at making sense of the world. This book gave me a better insight into Christianity, by opening a window into it's genesis.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Yet another of the Sigma novels that lives up to its name! Don't even bother skimming it to &#34;see if you might like it&#34; just get it! :)
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book really made me think of how I treat myself and others.  If everyone was willing to live in the four agreements we would have a better world.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Latest in the line of Rollins fantastic literary works! Some authors you wanna skim the book before you buy... not this guy! Everyone of his books is worth buying!
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|Woodkid does not conform. His songs are often deep or difficult, but always rousing and pulse-pounding. His unique voice brings his beautiful and haunting lyrics to life, and his songs are all memorable, different, and beautiful.<br /><br />This is truly one of the great underrated artists of our time. His songs Run Boy Run, Iron, and I Love You also have equally STUNNING music videos, which can be viewed on YouTube. Run Boy Run is blood-pumpingly good, with some AMAZING drums and beautiful instrumental sections. Iron's video is just chockablock of electrifying imagery, and the result is a feast for the eyes. I Love You is hauntingly beautiful and surprisingly poignant.<br /><br />Now, I like classical music. I couldn't care less about Justin Bieber or Katy Perry. When someone asks me what modern music I like...I say Woodkid. Highly recommended album! 5 stars!
B001KQBFAM|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars, but the material seemed dated. However, it is an inspiring story of courage, honesty and doing the right thing-no matter what! This should be required viewing for high school students.
B000002UA7|4.0|kate bush kinda grows on you over the years. i don't have many artist in my collection with high pitched voices. yet hers is calming and a nice change . yes her videos in the 80's were a little odd but it's the talent of her singing range that i enjoy so much.
B006CLTFP2|5.0|I've always loved the Animals version of House of the Rising Sun, but this version is even better. Try it out, you won't be disappointed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game lots of fun<br />Had lots of fun playing this game<br />You all should play this game<br /><br />I did
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Makes you think about what you would do as a parent faced w/ a situation such as this. It's a tough place to be.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This asphalt is the best one yet GAMELOFT has outdone themself but only one thing wrong....you can't enter adrenaline anymore
B000JMKRKC|3.0|Good book club book that promotes discussion. You'll come away w/ a better understanding of the story after talking about it outloud.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was excellent. If I could have given it a ten star rating I would have. Such a tender and sweet love story. Just goes to show God has a plan for all of us. It takes a brave person to escape an abusive relationship. Plus it also showed anybody can be an abuser.
B00CUKTGNU|4.0|Although the album is not my favourite from Franz Ferdinand, it is a great album. It has the feel of the Franz Ferdinand and You Could Have So Much Better put together, with the catchy vocal work like in the first album, with the more of a pop like sound from You Could Have So Much Better. The album is one that you can put in and listen to the whole way through and not get board, but Bullet, Evil Eye and Brief Encounters stand out to me as being \\"catchier\\". The second disk on the Deluxe edition is a great live in studio set and worth the extra money.<br /><br />The Deluxe edition packaging is really cool because its set up like a double LP. The CDs slide in to sleeves which slide into the CD case.<br /><br />I feel this is a solid buy although in my opinion its not their best album. I feel Tonight was better produced and overall a better written album Than Right thoughts, Right Words, Right Action.<br /><br />In Short, Buy this album. You wont be dissapointed.
B008YI91HS|4.0|Its a good movie to watch with your kids, and it make you intense what going to happen next. watch it!
0062255657|2.0|Rather depressing and a little verbose for it target audience of early teens.  Read positive review which is why I purchased same.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|How was it done? What are they getting out of it?<br /> You get fooled all the time! Great ending. Happy ending.
B009R659L8|5.0|I love to read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books.  I have most of them on my Kindle now.  I have kept the ones that I have in hardback, as well.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Saw it in the theater on original release, and just watched it again with my son. What a great flick! Action + all the history behind The Original Series (TOS).
B00E66QPCG|5.0|very simple plain and honest no hype or false promises i am looking forward to profitable trading with this but no get rich quick please
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I hadn't heard of Breaking Bad until last week. Now I'm on season 5. The first two seasons were best, but it's getting strong again at the end...
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love the game!  Would recommend it for anyone.  Even though it was offered for free, I would have gladly paid for it.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I hadn't heard of Breaking Bad until last week. Now I'm on season 5. The first two seasons were best, but it's getting strong again at the end...
B0032CVAQQ|1.0|I think the basis for this self-help book is good. I totally get the &#34;love languages&#34; thing. My husband's &#34;love language&#34; is Physical Affection and mine is Quality Time. I totally see that. But this is like a &#34;Love Language For Dummies.&#34; It talks to you like you're an idiot who has never had basic human social interaction before. And there isn't really any advice, just this guy rambling on about how smart he is for figuring out that people need to be loved in different ways. Like, his advice for someone whose spouse (not partner, not lifemate, and - in this instance, always the wife) prefers &#34;Acts of Service&#34; as a love language (because wives love when their husband does the laundry for them, basically) is just that -- do the laundry without being asked. Well no shit. That's not real advice, that's common sense. And if the husband were to argue &#34;I don't have time, I work a lot so that I can provide for my family&#34; blah blah blah, he just says &#34;WELL MAKE TIME.&#34; Super helpful, guy.<br /><br />Not to mention the book is sexist and heteronormative. Unfortunately, I did a little googling on the author AFTER the fact, and of course it is, because he's a Bible beater. I wish I had known that before I wasted my $7 on the Kindle book. I'd really like to see this concept updated and brought into the 21st century, written in such a manner as to A) actually include all walks of life, not just middle class straight white married couples, and B) actually offer advice that can be applied to a relationship.
B001NLKSI4|5.0|Enlightening. Unbelievable what people get away with in the world. A peak inside the crooked world of Wall Street. Enjoyable  read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'd call this medium in difficulty. Some places even challenging. At first it appears too simple, and then a stump comes along. I like that each item found in a room is used in that same room. Clues involve both numbers and colors. There is no hint. One just has to keep working until the solution is found...or you get help from a friend. All-in-all, I enjoyed playing it and wish there were a few more rooms.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Great animation, fun characters and valuable life lessons slipped in as well. What's not to like! What a great movie.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who enjoys the series, who would give it a high rating, I'm sure. Only the first one gets my vote, they made too many sequels that got progressively more violent and nihilistic. After seeing them, I feel like watching Mary Tyler Moore reruns for a few hours.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Favorite song is hear me but their are so many great songs on the album<br />Demons, Bleeding out always get my attention<br />I also have to mention Underdog, and on top of the world in here<br />And everyone probably know Its time and radioactive which are always on the radio
B000KX0IOA|5.0|A great movie and Ben Kingsley gives a great performance. Seeing India in all its beauty and squalor is something I won't forget, and I can't help wondering what Gandhi would think of the world he helped to create.
B00BEU3NI6|5.0|This is a timed, very fast match 3 game. The graphics are superior like all of 10tons' games. You have to match tokens that are the dragon's scales between several rows of flying dragons (the dragons are BEAUTIFUL) or the dragons crash to earth and you have to start that level over. The dragons fly along undulating and shimmying and the dragon's scales drop from one dragon to another below as you make matches.<br /><br />There is a story that is ok but power-ups that are great! There is a puzzle to work between levels that is straightforward and very pretty. The whole look of this game is very bright and well rendered...if you have played Sparkle and Sparkle 2 you know what I mean. Superior graphics.<br /><br />I find this to be a very challenging game when I've had a long day at work! But, I play it a lot and enjoy it very much on my KFHD.
B00640UICA|4.0|I like a game where I can play for a minute or two, and not get too involved if I have to stop.  This works well.  Also is simple enough for even little ones to play, but challenging enough to engage us OLD ones.
B00640UICA|5.0|This is a really, really cute game about darling little Peebles that want to hold hands. Each is contained in a hexagonal cell and they each vary in the number of hands they have...The challenge is to get ALL the hands joined, which requires some tricky maneuvering.<br />The look, story and sound are superior and I can see how kids would LOVE this cute, cute game. Me, at 63, not so much although as the levels advance, the game gets harder as barriers appear in pivotal cells and make the hand-joining more difficult. I can see adults liking the greater challenge. I am too devoted an HO point and click fan! I got this as a FAOD to play with grandkids during holidays and I'm sure they'll love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I give it a five star rating. The second book is a cute story about Katness Everdeen and the hunger games.It is cool.
B00631HASU|5.0|This is a Zuma-like game. Long lines of balls snake around and you have to shoot like colors down matching them with the color of the ball in your cannon. The patterns are intricate and difficult at higher levels and they are timed. The graphics are just gorgeous and there's a story, too. TONS OF PLAY!!! A great game, if a tad smaller than it's sibling, Sparkle 2. These are the best of the Zuma games out there and they are FAR and AWAY the very best. I highly recommend these for fast, pretty and challenging play.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Never gave thought about habits. As author correctly mentioned in the book - it is like water - all around us. Important is to be aware of it to change it.
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|Bowling for Movies Score: 124.781 of 300 (which kind of stinks, we wanted to love this movie)<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />The Great Gatsby - We own the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet Combo Pack<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />Nick Carraway, a somewhat reserved bond salesman in the rip-roaring 20's has an appointment with destiny when he accepts the invite of his `married to a blue blood' cousin, Daisy Buchanan and her husband (and Nick's college friend) Tom.  After Tom introduces Nick to his mistress (a strumpet and gas station owner's wife) and a multitude of slumming it friends, Nick begins to spiral into the decadent life which culminates in an invite from his next door neighbor - the very mysterious Jay Gatsby.  Very long story short (in a Bowling for Movies lightning round) Gatsby = new money; Buchanan = old money; Daisy = married for the money; Nick = go-between for Gatsby and Daisy (who apparently fell in love prior to the War to End All Wars but she couldn't wait for him); Mysterious Letter = Still Mysterious - and I watched the whole film.  Much drama and tragedy ensues.  Note to self: no swimming at Gatsby's house.<br /><br />You ever see an ad for some really good food... you couldn't help it, the T.G.I.Friday's rib platter just looked so good on the T.V.  You find yourself thinking about those delicious looking ribs all day until you finally just can't contain yourself any longer and you head on down to the nearest strip mall, pull in, and nearly run to the door - your mouth salivating painfully.  You sit down, it's noisy in here... real noisy but hey, those ribs will make it all worthwhile.  You exchange loud words with the waitress who can't seem to get your order straight (because she can't hear you any better than you can hear her) and you hope for the best.  Hey, at least you ordered the cheesy sticks appetizers, you know, to get the evening headed in the right direction.  While you wait (they still haven't brought the drinks yet) you realize two things at the same time... the sun is shining RIGHT IN YOUR eye off a Ford Taurus in the parking lot and you've stuck your pant leg to a wad of gum someone \\"thoughtfully\\" left under the table.  You look at your watch as you watch the sun move down the sky and 20, 30, 40 minutes go by... still no cheesy sticks, but hey, at least you got your Coke (but what is that aftertaste???  Did they give you a Diet Coke?)  Your waitress seems to have an uncanny ability to NEVER look your way every time she walks by and even your, \\"Excuse me, Miss??!!??\\" was ignored but it's so loud in here she probably couldn't have heard you even if you were right next to her.  40 minutes turns into an hour and you look at the `fun and wacky' farm implements, kitchen tools, old pictures, and other visual candy they have tacked up on the wall one more time... maybe you missed some interesting tidbit between the old license plates and the picture of dogs playing poker.... Nope, guess not.  Finally the waitress flies by and drops a plate of disappointment in front of you - still no cheesy sticks - and you get a good look at your dinner.  Are those ribs?  Why is the sauce that off color orange and dried on the plate.  The fries are soggy and insteadof cooked to a golden brown remind you more of a jaundice victim.  A McRib sandwich at McDonald's tastes better but at least you paid a premium to get it.  Yup, that's what watching The Great Gatsby was like this afternoon.<br /><br />Ok, let me be honest - I couldn't tell if I liked the movie or not after we watched this and neither could Mrs. Movie Dude or Little Miss Movie Dude.  Visually striking but cartoonish... musically extravagant and Hip Hop sore thumb... story about hope that had none... it was a movie of paradoxes.  Stylistically it was 100% Baz Lurrmann but in a very pedestrian, been there done that way - nearly feels like Moulin Rouge rebooted.  Admittedly, we are not really big on tragic stories but even still... this one just felt like it was missing something.  It left us feeling like microwaved and set under a heat lamp rib platter at T.G.I. Friday's.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />* The costumes and other period visuals were decadent... rich silks, art-deco everything, sumptuous over the top parties... everything was beautiful to behold.<br />* This movie was cast fantastically - Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Elizabeth Debicki were clearly the right team to bring the story to the screen - better direction and story development would have brought out their talent more vibrantly<br />* The third dimension - wowza, the 3D was wonderfully rendered; no ghosting or double images and also very artfully used - we are not the \\"needs to poke me in the eye to be called good 3D\\" people but rather we look for 3D to help draw us into the story, GREAT 3D makes you feel immersed<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />* Jay-Z failed miserably in pulling together a modern version of the jazz culture represented in the original novel - there is absolutely NO PARALELL between Hip Hop and authentic Jazz, the former not qualifying in many people's minds as music (it being rhythmic speaking set to borrowed sounds) and the latter attaining true art stature - the result was the soundtrack equivalent of a loud belch during a melodic opera - rude, crude, and NOT appreciated; to see anachronism done right, watch the Baz Lurhman prequel to this, better known as Moulin Rouge<br />* While I am nearly positive that the visually stunning first half of the movie dropping suddenly to a nearly dreary last half of the movie was done on purpose, the contrast in styles from beginning to end was clumsily done - almost like the art department changed hands mid-way thru and the new team had a different vision of what the flick should look like<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

078322933X|4.0|I got this movie cause I like reese witherspoon movie she playes in. When I seen this it may not be the best movie. But I still watch it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|My first time reading this author, and he didn't disappoint. My only issue is the<br />overall sense of depression that the protagonist (and me by extension) experiences<br />throughout the trial. The writing is taut and the first person perspective makes it<br />very much &#34;in the moment&#34;.  I have already recommended this book. I will find the<br />other books penned by this author. He tells a good story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My son absolutely loves this game! He has it on all the family devices and plays it every chance he gets.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thank you.  The experiments got me out of a stuck place.  Thank you, Thank you<br />I knew the concepts, you put them together in an easy way to work with.  Thank you<br />Reikidan
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I just watched this with my kids over the weekend. They were enthralled the entire movie. There is a little bit of language that may be inappropriate for the younger ones, but I think that I watched this when I was about 8 as a child. Highly recommend this and other Spielberg movies from the same time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Because it is free, there are some ads, but they really aren't that bad. Lots of options for games. No reason to pay for something similar.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I purchased this cd a couple weeks ago and I play it just about everyday in my house and in my car...I love it and recommend my family and friends buy it
B00ECU1A6C|4.0|I was a nice story, it could have easily been turned in to a season.  Now sure why they did not.  This is for kids, but everything happens quickly. ​
B00846WWVM|4.0|I really enjoy the simplicity of this game. The lack of violence and cute characters make it okay for my 4 year old son, who loves the jr version on my iPhone, to watch me play, but the levels are challenging enough to keep an adult entertained and stumped every few levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best online solitare games I have every played in my life. I love this game. Please release more free card games in the future.
B008NMT684|5.0|this game is fun for my 2 year.  it was easy to figure it, and she got such a sense of accomplishment for completing the puzzles.
B007CFL4WO|5.0|No need to go into here the destruction and bloodshed, the millions of lives crushed in Europe and elsewhere by Hitler and his misguided Nazi thugs, but how many of us ever considered what this did to the rest of them, the good  German people, those who feared and loathed and wanted nothing to do with this madman and his simple Simon psychos? I often wondered about that. Not only was their country totally destroyed as a result, but the guilt was deeply rooted and lasted for decades, and in many, many cases, I am certain, to this day.<br /><br />Firstly, they were made to suffer by Adolph, and then the unbearable guilt as a result of the atrocities he and his followers committed.<br />That's what this book covers, goes into. Yes, there is a love story, only used as a vehicle--but it works.<br /><br />It will make you think. And contemplate the whole thing. I don't care how old, or young, and you don't know much about what took place during World War II, this is a place to start. And then go and read Elie Wiesel's books, and see Shoah, and a few other docs and films that cover the war.<br /><br />No, you don't have to be Jewish, I'm not, but that's all the more reason to educate yourself with regards to this topic.<br /><br />Read the book. Do yourself a favor. Read it. And never, ever let anyone try to tell you that it didn't happen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|need to get more rooms added very soon, this is a game that really makes you put your thinking cap on....
B00006AG5N|5.0|Simply the greatest singer I have ever heard. Yes, there's Sinatra and James Brown and Marvin Gaye and Etta James and Eva Cassidy and Smokey Robinson and Jim Morrison and...and...and so many others who are terrific.<br /><br />Elvis remains Number #1. The greatest of them all.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|The games is ok.could be more challenging.please request some other five star free games.love playing them. Hidden objects are my favorite.thank you.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The series to include this book is great for fantasy lovers. The story is very well written including old English terminology for authenticity. The characters are complex as are there interactions with each other. I plan on reading it again.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I can watch some items, but app won't take me to signin or my ebay summary. I would love to use it to go to my watched items.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app. every night and even during day. It is one of the best apps I have out of 200 and some apps on my kindle fire hd!! It has got the best sounds and is so relaxing I've tried other apps but none compare to this one!! If you like sound apps to relax or sleep with get this one, I can't recommend it enough!! Linda M. Taylor
B004P8JPS6|4.0|A good thriller where Reacher meets his ultimate opponent with equal training and the same objective --to kill him. A &#34;could not put down book&#34; until the end.
1936608898|5.0|I've lost 12 pounds and am trim since changing my diet 1 year ago.  This was a great help in helping me understand how hormones in the body fuction and get out of balance.  I recommend this book to anyone one who wants to brush up on nutrition.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Best around! I like the soft blue lights, does not interrupt your sleep. I'll probably upgrade it to see what else it offers.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Call is easy to customize and has beautiful backgrounds. It's one of four weather apps that I always use on all of my devices.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|First of all, I saw the movie in theaters, and loved it. No issue on that aspect!<br /><br />BUT, I love audio commentaries and extras and behind the scenes and gag reels and all that other kind of stuff. So when I learned that the Into Darkness Blu-ray would only have about 40 minutes of extras, and the majority of the missing content stretched across different retailers and iTunes and so forth. I was quite annoyed. SO, I will NOT be getting this Blu-ray specifically and only to protest the lack of respect and greediness that Paramount has shown its customers. The audio commentary being only available on iTunes is a slap-in-the-face in and of itself. I'd post links to the relevant sources but apparently Amazon doesn't like external links. Well just look up den of geek and into darkness blu-ray on google for the full lowdown on this deception.<br /><br />The customer is being deprived of what should be the blu-ray's key feature of holding ALL the extras in one singular location, for the benefit of some already rich retailer's coffers.<br /><br />Bottom-line? Its B.S.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Fun series. A little dated but I am new to Dr. Who. I can see why it has a cult following.
B007AL48UK|4.0|There never seems to be end to the different combinations.  It is my first time playing any kind of Mahjong game and I know I will be interested in playing others.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I felt they took a great story and made it into a cartoon the way it was filmed. I felt like I was watching Batman in Gotham City. Some aspects I liked but most were way over done. The music didn't fit at all. Bad take on a classic.
B00821PCJS|5.0|You find yourself really caring about what happens next season. LOVE the show. Good character development. Not-so-short story arcs and a good spread of archetypes.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This is a good, actiony popcorn flick. Yes, it was often predictable, but what actiony, popcorn flick isn't? I enjoyed it quite a bit, and would probably watch it again.
B003FFEX8C|2.0|Pretty cheesy I didn't like the story line and I wouldn't recommend it.  I would rather count the holes in the ceiling.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It held my attention, but it was disturbing from a parent's point of view. It is definitely one that keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. I found myself hating a couple of the characters. From the author's description, you can clearly visualize the characters.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Between the time I placed the order and received the product, Google did a \\"update\\"? that killed almost all of the functionality of the Chromecast. Now the only Apps that work is Netflix, YouTube and Google Play. When I ordered the Chromecast there was third party software that you could use to stream everything from your computer or Smartphone to your TV. I already have a Roku, so I can watch Netflix, YouTube and a lot other programing on my TV . I bought the Chromecast to stream from my Laptop and Smartphone to a TV in a hotel room when I travel. After I received the Chromecast and found out how it works I realized that I probably couldn't do that because it has to be set-up through a router and the hotel wouldn't let me access their router. I could already display my Laptop and Smartphone on a TV before I bought the Chromecast by using a HDMI cable. After some research I found that the Chromcast is in beta development and Google \\"may\\" (at a later date) enable the Chromecast to stream all content from a computer and Smartphone. For now it's on the self.<br /><br />UPDATE: At first I didn't understand that if a video is playing in the \\"Chrome\\" browser you can chromecast it. I'm not going to go into great detail her but if you have \\"PLEX\\" running on a computer you can chromecast \\"Plex\\" through the \\"Chrome\\" browser with \\"Plex/Web\\". Google \\"Plex/Web\\" or go to the Plex website for more info. Because of the this updated info I'm going to change my rating to 2 stars.
0307476073|5.0|People have many different ways of coping with the death of a loved one, family upheaval, and marital woes. Most, though, don't do it by undertaking a 1000+ mile solo hike. But Cheryl Strayed did, and for that, we readers can be grateful. Despite all her preparations - gathering gear, reading guides, testing her water filter, and more - few people are as unprepared for the rigors of such a hike than she was. For that too, we can be grateful, because otherwise, there wouldn't have been much of a story.<br /><br />Sometimes, it's by not knowing what we're getting ourselves into that we accomplish great things. Due to a combination of inexperience, naivet&eacute;, and poor planning, Strayed faced challenges in which she could have been seriously injured. She could have died from starvation, dehydration or becoming prey to critters of all kinds. Yet despite near-constant pain and discomfort, and a nonstop assortment of difficulties, she persisted. Most people would have given up in circumstances far less menacing, and she could have easily been forgiven if she had done the same. The story of her experience - the physical and mental challenges she faced, the people she met, the insights she gained about her past and her future -- made me wish I had done something similar, or at least a small approximation of something similar, when I was her age. I didn't, but I'm as proud of Cheryl Strayed for what she endured and what she accomplished as if I had done it myself.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love it; I started to watch it when it first was televised; then I lost it on my DVR; so this has been a pleasure and I can't wait to get to season 3. Excellent series and great actors.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The only thing I hate about the series is the killing of soooo many good characters, but even that does not stop me wanting more... NOW!<br />I am hoping mr. Martin has the good sense to let Jon Snow live!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had to watch all three seasons over a week.  It keeps you wanting more.  Outstanding plot and great characters.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|Weak for a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost movie. All of their other films are much more enjoyable.  Not a bad movie, just a little disappointing.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie was good, entertaining and suspenseful.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />It was slow in spots and missed some of the nuances from the book.
B003JHKORK|4.0|Our six year old loves the gods of yore and this film puts in a modern day situation. As I said, good family fun.
B0026NBZDU|5.0|This novel by Sarah Waters is not merely entertaining: it contains suspense, a sense of history and treats its genre, one time taboo, with compassion and understanding bringing to light the injust treatment meted out to unprotected women, especially those with an inheritance.<br /><br />Dickension London comes to light, and the author exposes the carefully hidden pornography Victorians indulged in clandestinely.<br /><br />The love story between Sue and Maud is tender yet sensual but never distasteful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I began doing the 30 Day Shred I had been working out regularly (5 days a week) doing some running and weights.  After losing a substantial amount of weight I felt I needed something that would push me harder.  My wife recommended the 30 Day Shred and I being a guy joked that I wasn't trying to look like Jillian Michaels, and expressed my somewhat serious concern that the workout wouldn't be difficult enough for me.  Wow was I wrong!  Each level is a 20 minute, fast paced workout that left me dripping sweat.  The first three days of each level were the most difficult, but you never get used to the workouts (at least I didn't).  The workouts never really get \\"easy\\" you just realize you can complete the circuits without taking extra breathers.  About midway through the 30 days I did start to develop some knee pain like other reviewers have mentioned, but it was a dull pain that only accompanied a few of the exercises that I felt I could work through and endure during the day with a few Ibprofen.  I completed the 30 Day Shred about a week and a half ago and lost a total of 13 lbs.  I was very pleased with the results and feel my runs are much easier now.  I liked the workouts so much that I am planning on incorporating the exercises and circuits into my long term workout routine.  I will say that I have a hard time watching exercise DVDs because they can be kinda cheesy and annoying and at times this one is no different.  What I did was I watched the DVD a couple of times and wrote down the exercises, and then did them using a stop watch to keep time while watching one of my favorite TV shows.  I would highly recommend this DVD to people who are starting to get in shape and looking for a challenge.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very unusual as a mystery and a thriller.  It took twists and turns that I didn't expect but that I appreciated as being different and creative.  Good plot and character development.  My interest was maintained.  As a matter of fact I had a hard time doing anything else until I finished the book.  I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a well written mystery/thriller.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This is going to make a perfect Christmas Gift for a person that missed the first and best season!!!  Just awesome!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The test for this clock is good, but we'll worth the &cent;.99 upgrade so you can set alarms with your favorite music!<br /><br />Just don't lk the push to keep adding apps on my Kindle fire b/c it's kinda already full...lol.
1455510319|5.0|Michael Connely is a great author that keeps your interest through out. Write more Bosch books and I will like it more

Works well on my kindle fire and not slow at all. I love how everything looks and love that its multiplayer and that I can bet game tokens to people. I would totally recommend this game to anyone that loves pool. [...]

0679735259|2.0|Got this on the recommendation of a friend.  Haven't slogged through it completely, but so far all the author has done is complain about chopper schedules and hotel rooms.  Wish I had those complaints when I was there.  May update when I finish, but for now, I cannot recommend anyone who was there waste their time with it.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|I came across this book in the place we rented this summer. It intrigued me to see what Stephen King would say about writing. In fact, he had a lot to say. You may not like the  horror genre he writes in, but after reading this book, you'll have to admit he has talent. It was an inspiring lesson on writing. I recommend it.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Came preinstalled and I don't use it much because you cannot edit documents from this app. I have another app that is more functional and easier to use.

B00847KFDS|5.0|I cringed slightly to learn that John Fogerty's newest collection is both a duets album and a career retrospective. Both of these tend to be the product of artists ready to be embalmed. But at age 68, Fogerty has surely earned the right to secure his legacy however he deems fit. I'm just not persuaded his best work is behind him.<br /><br />In some ways, \\"Wrote a Song For Everyone\\" feels like a possible capstone for Fogerty's career. He could retire after this: by revisiting twelve of his self-penned classics (ten CCR tracks and two solo songs), melding his style with popular rock and country artists, asserts his broad influence in today's most popular guitar-driven music genres. Yet the two original tracks display a continuing creative vitality, suggesting that, if he chose, he could keep playing.<br /><br />Some pairings seem surprising. My Morning Jacket's dreamlike arrangement on \\"Long As I Can See the Light\\" brings new insight to the track's short-term melancholy and longer-term optimism. Bob Seger's take on \\"Who'll Stop the Rain,\\" complete with piano line pinched from \\"Night Moves,\\" turns this into a Seger track that merges seamlessly with his classic work. And Fogerty teams with Alan Jackson, another veteran prone to comebacks, to revitalize \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain.\\"<br /><br />Other combos seem downright natural. The Foo Fighters sound like they were made to record \\"Fortunate Son,\\" while Miranda Lambert, possibly the best thing going in today's moribund pop country milieu, pairs sweetly with my absolute favorite CCR track, \\"Wrote a Song For Everyone.\\" And the massive ensemble, including Jennifer Hudson, that joins Fogerty on \\"Proud Mary\\" manages to meld Fogerty's original with Ike & Tina's remake, bonded with a distinct zydeco/jazz flourish.<br /><br />Fogerty's two original tracks convince me that he still has distinct future possibilities. \\"Mystic Highway,\\" a straightforward country rocker with a gospel-style breakdown, could fit seamlessly on his 1980s albums, while \\"Train of Fools\\" could have come off Blue Moon Swamp. Considering his band's early dissolution and his long legal troubles have kept Fogerty from truly fulfilling his potential. But these tracks reassure me that, perhaps, his best work isn't yet done.<br /><br />In some ways, John Fogerty emblematizes today's music business. In particular, he represents the ongoing battle between the \\"music\\" half and the \\"business\\" half: should the need to make a profit trump the artist's prerogative to create art that feeds the soul? A generation from now, nobody will remember lucrative acts like One Direction. John Fogerty's work will long outlast the man himself, because it nourishes the human spirit. And this new album proves that definitively.0s albums, while \\"Train of Fools\\" could have come off Blue Moon Swamp.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is a great story. A ton of names and info thrown at you non stop. It does all tie in very well, but you will do some page turning to remember who is who and doing who from time to time.
B003TY3F06|5.0|My top three best flicks of all time! From the cast to the storyline to the directing...just a blast to watch. Don't forget about the Moors!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Purchased this item.  Very happy with it.  Nice details on construction.  Hope some parts of the truck can stand the punishment some kids have on them.  Overall happy with this selection.

B00B935SUY|5.0|An artist, is an artist, is an artist.  They love what they love for whatever reason.  For Dave Grohl to have documented 'the board' is a really beautiful story.
B009OYSFDM|1.0|Honestly, if BatMan were a total prude... this is what he'd look like.  No suspense, no grit. Like an after school special.<br />Trying to be BatMan and Lost in one. Ending up more like 9021.

B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun to play, but could use better instructions at the start. Lots of different things to do so it never gets boring.
076781326X|5.0|I recently purchased this DVD after not watching the movie for a while, and was able to enjoy the movie again.  I like all the songs and the story - They don't make movies like this one anymore (modern entertainment is much different).  I see a lot of people complaining that only half of the movie is present.  Nothing is missing - The DVD uses an older double-sided design that's a little confusing (this is the only thing I don't like).  If you see the intermission when starting to play the disc (which happened to me the first time I played the movie) eject the disc and flip it over to start from the beginning.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The nine experiments are absolutely amazing!  I found myself laughing with amazement when events proved out or results came in.  I downloaded this to my Kindle and have now ordered paperbacks to share with others.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was very easy to set up on my TV.<br />It connected right away with my Netflix subscription and began &#34;casting&#34; some old Twilight Zone episodes I hadn't seen in over 50 years!<br />Very COOL!<br />It only works with a very limited number of &#34;apps&#34;, but I'm sure they'll develop more in the future.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|It's okay. It's a bit boring but it fine. I do t feel anyway toward it. It's gives me something to do when I have nothing to do so it  kind if just takes time up and nothing else really

B00DIFARQ6|4.0|This game is awesome. It would have been better if it didn't make you pay for the rest of the game but so far it deserves 4 stars. It feels like your actually flying a plane

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had not seen seasons 2 and 3 and watched them all Labor Day weekend.  Such a great show.  Love the house or should I say castle and all the beautiful clothes.  It's fun seeing how upstairs and downstairs lives.  But don't like what happened to Matthew.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|It was not only an engaging story that reinforced the right way to improve IT life, but also a great example of what happens when you do things the wrong way, how to right the ship and take new  ground.  In the end you not only help IT life, but also the business.  Transformational thinking.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I lost many hours of sleep reading this wonderful book, wanting to know the mystery of Nell and the Authoress. A very intriguing story!
B005544V6A|5.0|One of the best shows to come out in the last 5 years.  If you don't want to be Harvey Spector by the end of season 1 you haven't been watching.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|This was an amazing sequel to The Selection with many new twists! The way the book is set up is brilliant and I ended up reading through the night until I fell asleep reading. I highly recommend this read, but to start with the first book in the series before beginning.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down.  It kept me in suspense until the end.
B006RXQ27O|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and it was totally worth the rental. It's classic 90's style. Where else do you see cartoons and real people acting together?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is epic. it is like you are right next to the horse. get this game. it is awsome.
B005SLS3VY|5.0|Whether 'the guy' is Michael Connolly, Harry Bosch or Micky Haller .... You can't help but fell an affinity with all three. Harry is again in the supporting role in this one, but he plays it well. Micky Haller is sublime and his wife maggie is also a joy. How does Michael write so brilliantly? Couldn't put it down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The storyline keeps me coming back for more. One problem gets cleared up and another one appears. Love all the characters.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I found this game fun and very interesting  I would recommend this game for anyone it is addictive I enjoyed it very much wish it was longer
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|The album is very solid up and down. the really enjoyed 'Lonesome Rider', 'Room 24' and 'The Nameless One'. I haven't heard King Diamond (Room 24) in years. Very well done by Volbeat. Give it a listen.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|It's a fantastic movie and it makes your really rethink your life :P<br />The movie ultimately is rather depressing, but that doesn't take away from it's greatness.<br />Have your kids watch this movie in their early teens and they will never do a drug in their life. ;P
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|The album is well done with songs that have a 80's rock sound ('Doing Time' and 'This Means War') and a some classic rock thrown in for good measure. The guitar sound is very well done with 'Coming Home' and 'Acid Rain' being my personal favorites. The sound of 'Requiem' and 'Planets' is a bit different from their recent albums but very good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is interesting enough to help me focus on something other than problems for a while. I like that it remembers my scores.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|This is quite a progression from their earlier excellant work. Great sets filled with driving thought provoking and soulful tunes.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Easy reading and great tips on reducing waste and excess in one's life. Highly recommended!  Author has great suggestions and provides thoughtful insights into cultural excess.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We were given a hand-me-down exersaucer which is great, however, it had way too many toys that it made my daughter cry. Also she wasn't heavy enough to make the exersaucer bounce so she just sorta stood there looking stunned.<br /><br />With this jumperoo - there aren't too many toys but enough that she stays entertained. Also because it's on bungee cords its intuitive for her to bounce up and down. It's a little tall for her (she's 25&#34;) even on the lowest setting but we just put some books under her feet and she's perfectly happy.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this toy for a baby who is just getting their jumping legs.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|it was very exciting all the way through.  It was also very moving within my heart.  I cried at the end, but realized it was the best anyone could give.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|It really had some laugh out loud moments! Made me feel happy on the inside and optimistic that there really is someone for everyone!
B00957T6X6|5.0|An epic medieval fantasy of unimaginable complexity.  Imagine a story that is so layered it can have Beowulf, King Author, and Henry II as secondary characters to a pair of 14 year old girls, a dwarf and his incestuous twin siblings, and an eunuch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was very easy to order and download, what a great show!  I watched it on my mini ipad more than once.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Apparently I missed this series when it came out in 2002, and now I am watching at least one episode every day. Joss Whedon was a genius ling ago, and I love all the characters and stories. Worth the time to watch!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Use it almost every day. Keep track of temperature and alerts. Like the Rader map. Can check on temps of other family when we travel.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|Hey it's cheesy, but it is supposed to be. It is Evil Dead after all! I thought it was worth renting and I have no regrets! Loved the effects and the references to the original movie. I think the car in the beginning is the same one that was in the original. looks like it anyway.
B00DW5IKJI|5.0|I received the package with the delay, but the cd is flawless apart the cardboard top that was wet and the packaging was removed but the cd was not affected merçi, it is very beautiful
B00CFITJKW|3.0|Graphics are just good, not great! You have very little control over the aircraft. wheels, brakes and throttle is about it. No flaps, ailerons, or any other flight controls are available. Yes, you can turn right and left, but that is about it. Kind of boring!<br /><br />The developers really need to have a dictionary/spelling guide what they are adding text to the app as there are many misspellings in the instructions.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A trustworthy alarm clock, love the weather and temp features too. Easy to use and a nice display. The only alarm clock you need.

B008RA3X5E|3.0|The free and the 99 cent versions both contained add-ware.  I don't like paying for an APP that includes add-ware.  I've remove both from my 7\\" Kindle Fire HD and from my account in the Cloud.<br /><br />However, I have gone ahead and given the APP 3 STARS because the program is otherwise good and some people will not care about the add-ware.
1451629192|3.0|There's no doubt that this woman has survived an incredible ordeal and her story has great potential. However, the writing style is very clumsy and the editor seems to be missing in action....Such a pity! The one advantage of the awkward grammar is that it seems to represent the perspective of an eleven year-old girl trapped inside a twenty nine year-old woman, but this style gets old very quickly and it felt like a chore to read most of this book.
B0081336FO|5.0|Thriller. Keeps us on the edge of our seats.  Intellectually stimulating.  Great plot twists and continuity between episodes.  I'm sure the U.S. producers are already working on a crappier version.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|Just this once, I care enough to write a review for a product purchased on Amazon.  A book no less, and yet I am not really sure why exactly I am writing a review.  It could be that I feel somehow obligated to the author to indeed say, yes: this was a marvelous novel. Or, perhaps, this is a poor man's distorted ode to a protagonist who has haunted his mind all evening.  Whichever the case may be, there is as much surprise as pain in having enjoyed this novel.<br /><br />The pretense of the book centers around one, Charlie Gordon; a mentally disabled, thirty-two year old man living in New York City.  In a story that only science fiction can provide, he is given a chance at intelligence in the form of breakthrough hypothetical surgery.  What ensues is an emotional reckoning; as Charlie comes to terms with himself and the world through new thoughts and views of conception.  While searching for his balance in the world, Charlie must also face his own inner daemons.<br /><br />Personally, I've felt more anger and sadness from this novel as any I have read before; injustice, cruelty, malice, and heartache resonate through-out.  Yet, there is a sliver of pure humanity and love that baffles me to no end upturning my feelings and causing a quandary in my mind.  Truly, this novel is an achievement to literature in my most humble opinion.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to: a friend, a family member, a fellow customer on Amazon, whomever.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I loved this book.  I could hardly put it down which is odd for a history book.  Our country was so fortunate to have a man of Lincoln's wisdom, skill and compassion as president at the time of the Civil War.
0143122916|5.0|This book is a great book about the unbelievable atrocities being committed in North Korea. I was stunned to learn what is going on over there and rallied for the main character. It is an eye opener and I couldn't put it down until the end.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A perfect, short read. Neil Gaiman never disappoints! I would highly recommend this book. It puts you in another world.
B0006VBFM0|4.0|This watch always gets complements when I put it on. It goes with everything and the numbers are easy to read. My only complaint is the ticking is loud. During the day it's not noticeable, but at night, you have to take it off, and maybe leave it in another room, if you need quiet to fall asleep.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well written.. great story line...More substance to the story other that what the media chooses to focus on. great read. men would enjoy this book also. I've recommended this to a few friends and they have enjoyed it also
0312944926|5.0|Dan Brown's trademark as an author is coming up with totally fun plots. Seems to be the case of his earlier work as well, as Digital Fortress clearly shows. If you thought that the Da Vinci Code was easy to read, it will be the case with this one too (even more so). It is said that Brown neglects research (I agree; that's where he could improve), but he's a really engaging writer: I couldn't put this book down; he really knows how to draw you in and keep you interested, always impatient to know what will happen next. The thing is, if you're going to be ultra picky and expect a programming manual or a cryptography treaty, this is not the book for you. But if you dig easy-to-watch action flicks with a fictional hi tech touch, you'll love this book.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I am very pleased with this watch.  I prefer watches with the minute numbers emphasized around the edge, and this one has the hour numbers in smaller print on an interior ring as well.  The quality and finish of the watch are better than I expected.  It looks like a watch that is much more expensive.<br /><br />A few comments on some of the other remarks I read when researching this watch:<br /><br />The watch is mechanical, as opposed to a quartz watch, and does not keep time as exactly as a quartz watch.  In fact, a cheap digital watch will keep time more accurately than this watch.  My watch gains around 50 seconds a week, which I find is more than close enough.  If I don't remember to correct the time over a month, I show up places about 4 minutes early... not enough time to worry about.  Despite not being as accurate as a quartz watch, there are advantages to having a mechanical watch.  First, there is no battery to change, especially important if you find yourself traveling to countries where batteries are not readily available. Second, the winding mechanism automatically winds the watch throughout the day using your arm's motion, which is cool.  If the watch ever needs to be wound after not being worn for a couple of day, you just shake it for a bit and it is ready to go.  Third, I think a mechanical watch is just cool, its a good piece of engineering.<br /><br />The watch is smaller than the massive fashion watches you see around (which I expected from the description), and the band was a bit thinner than I expected.  I have smaller wrists, and it looks fine.. just be aware.<br /><br />I have had no issues with the watch running out of power.  I give it a couple of shakes in the morning, then put it on.  I take it off in the evening, and give it a couple of shakes before I set it down.  The next morning, its still ticking away.  I wear it every day, and it has not yet run out of power once (even on work days when I find myself sitting at a desk most of the day).<br /><br />The second hand does not stop when you pull out the crown to set the time.  But, if you rotate the crown so the minute hand moves backwards in time, pressure is applied to the second hand to cause it to stop.  If you do this, and hold a little rotational pressure on the crown, the second hand will stay in place until you release the pressure.  I don't know if this puts excess stress on the movement, but it allows you to sync up the second hand with another time source. rotating the minute hand forward in time does not affect the second hand.  So, when I want to sync it perfectly, i set the watch back a couple of minutes, then do the second hand trick until the second hand is synced, then I move the minute hand forward to where it need to be.

The loser falls over with a scream, followed with a foolish expression, mouth agape, eyes akimbo.  Those old biblical kings, setting their feet on conquered necks, stringing up rival kings on trees, rejoicing in piles of heads -- there was an element of childish glee in all of that.\\"  - MaddAddam, Margaret Atwood<br /><br />I remember my discovery of Oryx and Crake, the first book in the MadAddam trilogy.

I wasn't sure what to expect with Oryx and Crake, but I was blown away once I started reading.  Despite my aching stomach, I read the book all the way through without stopping, moving from chair to floor and back again trying to ease my aches from the flu.  I think Oryx and Crake is easily one of the best apocalyptic novels of our time, and I recently listed it in my list of the best apocalyptic audiobooks.<br /><br />I bought The Year of the Flood, the second book in the trilogy, shortly after its release.  The Year of the Flood takes place in the same dystopian period as Oryx and Crake, but can stand alone as its own novel.  Margaret Atwood has created a new world in these stories, and the possibilities of her imagination are endless - both books are funny, sad, and brutal.<br /><br />And now comes MaddAddam, the third (and final? let's hope not!) release in what is being called a trilogy.  If you haven't read the first two books and are considering checking out MaddAddam, I'd say to read the other two first.  There is much more to appreciate in this novel with an understanding of the story thus far.  That being said, I haven't read the first two books in quite a while and the brief summary at the beginning of the new book helped me recall where each of the stories ended.<br /><br />As with the sequel to Justin Cronin's hit apocalyptic book The Passage, MaddAddam has a lot to live up to.  I could barely wait to see which direction Atwood would choose to take things.<br /><br />And go off in a direction she did - MaddAddam reads like the Waiting for Godot of the trilogy, all wit and wait.  This story begins where the other two books ended - with Jimmy and the Crakers (characters from Oyrx and Crake) encountering Ren, Toby, and Amanda (protagonists of The Year of the Flood).  Those hoping for the quick pace of the first two books may be disappointed - much time is spent on debating  the next move, on waiting for others to come back from various missions, and on reminiscing about times before the fall of man.  At one point Toby wonders what she is supposed to do, where to go from here, and we are all right there with her. There is a feel here of a post-apocalyptic version of David Eggers' The Hologram for the King.  Where The Hologram for the King leaves us waiting in the harsh landscape of a foreign desert nation, questioning the purpose and productivity of American business, MaddAddam leaves us waiting in a harsh dystopian future, questioning our own potential demise and what is left to do for those of us who survive.<br /><br />As heavy as this sounds, MaddAddam is a book full of jokes and jesters.  The Crakers (leaf eating, genetically modified semi-humans created to flourish in the new world) act as a Greek chorus of sorts, commenting on all they don't understand from before their creation, inadvertently asking us to evaluate our most basic assumptions.  As she illustrated in The Penelopiad, a beautiful book of Penelope's thoughts on The Odyssey, Atwood is a master of myth.  MaddAddam could be a study in the creation of myths (as could much science fiction), as the Crakers' mythology continues to evolve on what they hear from humans.<br /><br />Aside from The Crakers, who steal the show in this novel, the other star of the story is Zeb.  Zeb is a unique character for Atwood to take on, as many of her books feature strong female characters, and readers may be predictably dismayed that he is the focus rather than the more gentle Adam or the matriarch of the group Toby.  Zeb is masculine to the max - swearing and crude, he picks on his scrawny brother, he kills without regrets, he woos the women around him.  In the same pre-apocalyptic flashback style used in the first two books, we get to learn of Zeb's history and his role in the disasters which struck the human race.  Atwood writes at one point \\"The old symbol systems follow us around,\\" and they surely do here.  Toby's struggle with loving an alpha-male like Zeb could stand just as well in a tale from the frontier West or current suburban America.<br /><br />As always, Atwood's writing is stellar.  Her descriptions are short knife slices, her dialogue is smart and funny.  A woman in the group  \\"looks flinty-eyed, like a wood carving of herself.  She'd make a good executioner...\\"  As with Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, part of the joy here is reading Atwood's vivid creation of a future gone mad - nefarious corporations, company backed oil-worshipping churches (\\"Church of PetrOleum, affiliated with the somewhat more mainstream Petrobaptists\\"), porn devolved into simulated or real violence, genetically modified animals grown for human profit (Mo'hairs - \\"Hair Today, Mo'hair Tomorrow went the add when the creatures had first been launched.\\")  \\"Funny old thing, the human race,\\" Zeb says at one point in the story - and Atwood's future shows the human race to be a funny thing indeed.<br /><br />Atwood's dystopian world has now spanned over a 10 year time period (Oryx and Crake was published in 2003), and I have to wonder if MaddAddam will really be the last addition to the series.  By the end of MaddAddam it is clear there is so much more to be explored - especially regarding Blackbeard, the charming Craker who becomes Toby's shadow early in the story.  MaddAddam feels more to me like an interlude than a final chapter.  More is revealed here, and enemies become allies;  but this world is enchanting, gruesome, and hard to let go.ow in this novel, the other star of the story is Zeb.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|When a book features a blurb from Justin Cronin, author of the massive dystopian masterpiece The Passage, I'm ready to read.  Cronin says of Wool, \\"Howey's WOOL is an epic feat of imagination.  You will live in this world.\\"  And he is for serious, as this book is the real thing.<br /><br />I discovered Wool via an article on Howey's underground success, and found I could download the first Part in the series for free for my Kindle through Amazon.  The book is broken into small easily consumable parts, short-story length interconnected tales of a future in which humans live in an underground silo.  I read Part One quick, and purchased Parts 1-5 right away.  This is everything that makes scifi worth reading:  the commentary on our social structures; exploration of our weird rituals and lore in societies; the struggles for control over knowledge, material wealth, and power in social systems.  I think this will be the new Hunger Games, a series that gets non-readers reading.  It is simple to understand and draws you in quick.<br /><br />Wool - Part One blew my mind right away.  It reminded me a bit of how sucked in I was by the first chapter of Ender's Game, called Third, when I read that for the first time in my childhood.  In the chapter Ender gets his monitor removed and brutally beats Stilson to prevent future bullying.  I thought it was so crazy the way Orson Scott Card drops in Ender's age near the end - \\"Ender knew the unspoken rules of manly warfare, even though he was only six.\\"<br /><br />That first part of Wool was so intriguing that it really brought me back to that Ender's Game level of interest - I was dropped into this dystopian world, and right away I could see it all happening, all the rituals and beliefs and fears and concerns of these new people made so much sense to me.  I feel like the greatest science fiction I've read doesn't stop to explain itself to the reader, it just lets the story play out while the reader watches from the sidelines and picks things up as the story goes along.<br /><br />The concept of Wool, humans living in a silo underground, is one that has such a sweeping amount of plot to play with.  I'm always so interested in the myths and rituals and culture that build up in a society not like our own, and what these things say about our own culture.  I love the development of an entire world after ours in dystopian fiction (The Passage does such a great job of this, as does Oryx and Crake), and this book definitely leaves room to create a history of a people.  There are questions of maintaining power and control within the silo, and, without giving too much away, the daunting prospects of the entire world outside the silo's safety.  And above all this, the constant sense of claustrophobia that comes with containment.<br /><br />A group of people in an enclosed space always makes for interesting fiction - think of Stephen King's Under the Dome.  I love cozy mysteries, and some of my favorite cozies take place in enclosed areas.  And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie takes place on an island during a storm, so guests are stranded.  The Beautiful Mystery by Louise Penny takes place in an isolated monastery, where the monks have little contact with the outside world and must be reached by boat or plane.  Science Fiction as a genre has a great opportunity to play with this tension by building situations where people are stuck together in enclosed spaces.<br /><br />I'm excited to read the next part in the Wool series, called Shift.  I'm trying to put it off a bit for now, as I know I'll just compulsively read it once I kindle it and get nothing else done in my life.things up as the story goes along.<br /><br />The concept of Wool, humans living in a silo underground, is one that has such a sweeping amount of plot to play with.

B00E8B1358|4.0|Excellent Sci-Fi action Movie. Action, action and more action. beware of bad reviews. Some people just don't know the difference between having a good time watching a bang bang! movie and a mind-bending or Les Miserables type of films. you gotta know your genres.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best Angry Birds game so far. I like to play them all but so far I love this version the best!!!!!!
B00C1C0WCQ|5.0|The Dinos still look real and I still love this series. Had a Jurassic Park watch-a-thon on big screen.  Even got teenagers to watch and they all thought it was cool.  Funny that now Jurassic Park is considered 'old school'!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is very addicting but so much fun to play.  I play it for hours at a time. I just love it....
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|Ayn Rand philosophy is sometimes a little too obvious....but Gary Cooper salvages it all....even if a little cheesy. From the first time I saw this....I can't help it....I love it.  The courtroom scene is a classic.  I really wished that Atlas Shrugged had made it to film in this same era.  It would have been more appreciated and in context.  This movie is what made me pick up the book, and consequently other of Ayn Rand and become a fan.  Re-read Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged, and The New Intellectual, recently with the eyes and mind of an 'older and wiser' person.  Everyone should read these classics......and pop some popcorn and get the girls together and watch this movie!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|It's a great game plus if u have a ton of things ur doing or alot of apps  this app will remind u to take a break train ur brain n have a lil fun
B009GED3HS|5.0|Really good Love story.  I really enjoyed it and can't wait for the new season.  I was also able to get this on my television with my Blue Ray player.
0439023513|4.0|I agree with a lot of the other reviews on this book. It definitely wasn't as good as the first two. Mockingjay left me a little clueless. I didn't expect a happy ending, but I really didn't expect a mediocre ending . I don't like the weakling Katniss became. I get the whole life changing experiences she went through, but it's just as realistic if she would've sucked it up and moved on, happily. I do, however, thought it was worth the read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|So far so good. I got this just to stream Netflix to tv and the price was right. However setting it up was not as easy as advertised. A cinch on tv but on my iMac not so much, finally my sister got it to work, not even sure how.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Good game helps kill time lots.of fun play it a lot to unwind after a day at work all and all good fun game
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting from medical point of view regarding bacterial meningitis, but his description of near death experience is not convincing proof that heaven exists.
B000F3AJUS|5.0|I had wanted the vinyl version of this album for awhile, but never had luck finding it, as it had sold out after its initial run.  Thankfully, it appears as though there was a second pressing run, as there was a flood of new copies available on Amazon.  I grabbed this as soon as I saw it.  The vinyl is ruler flat and dead quiet, and the mastering is top notch (thanks to Steve Hoffman/Kevin Gray).  The vinyl version helps with the bloated bass that is present on the CD and DVD-Audio releases of this title, and despite being digitally sourced, the analog playback does help warm up the sound a bit.  Musically, I've liked this album for the most part, so it is a treat to have it on vinyl.  (Wish I could say the same for Sunken Condos!)  If you like and collect vinyl, I strongly urge you to pick one of these up before they disappear again!
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|This series is so much better than the American imitation it doesn't make sense even comparing the two.  By every measure, script, acting, directing - this is the one to have.
0394818237|4.0|This is a great book to read to children and I do that in my local elementary school but the pictures are small and so not sure how to share them with the children.
B004132HZS|5.0|Many of my Amazon fans (rolling eyes) know that I chide them for being overly emotional and swayed by specious arguments that rely on their turning a blind eye to facts, data and evidence. These people would not like Sherlock Holmes, in fact I found two of them here giving it a one star rating disparaging the character for not having emotions and relying \\"too much on his intellect\\" while \\"not caring about people's feelings\\".<br /><br />Much like the character on this show I don't care what you \\"feel\\" I only care about the facts, data and evidence and what I (or you) can prove. If this sort of empiricism and rational thinking is something that you like than you will love this series. If on the other hand you are more concerned with someone's feelings rather than getting at the truth then you should avoid it.<br /><br />The acting is superb, actually it's some of the best acting all the way round that I have seen in a long time. The story lines are challenging and I've only found two errors (or assumptions that couldn't be the only way something happened.)<br /><br />Now my only wish is that more people in the world were like Sherlock rather than ideological dullards that follow talking points no matter how ludicrous they are; seriously how dull. As Sherlock says \\"Don't any of you people think?\\"<br /><br />Cheers
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Great stories and good movies.  I enjoy both the reading and the watching to see how the stories will be played out.
1451662432|3.0|Upon review thought this book was going to be a coffee table book with lots of pictures. It certainly has a lot of pictures that I have never seen before. It was interesting to read from Arnold's view and get his take on things. Thought the book was well written and the picture that were there were very awesome. This was an interesting read and it was filled with a sense of humor and that most of the world has been spoiled and somewhat lazy. Tend to agree with his thoughts on the world. I would suggest getting this book it has a lot of common sense in it and is loaded with good tips on life. would just like to say this man came from nothing and has made something of himself, and tends to help the people around him. I would buy this book and do recommend others to read it.
B00ANMA9L0|5.0|I have only in the past few years had time to explore the Peter Gabriel era Genesis recordings, and Selling England By The Pound has become my favorite of all of the albums, catching the band at a peak in performing and writing skills.  This 180g LP reissue, though, is the remixed version done as part of the box set reissues.  The remixes I have heard of the albums from A Trick Of The Tail forward are absolutely abysmal (basically, &#34;smashed&#34; and devoid of any of the dynamics that made these albums stand out), but surprisingly the Peter Gabriel era remixes stay closer to the original.  I can hear minor differences in the mixes, but the dynamics are still closer to the originals than how the later albums were treated.  As I like both the original and the remix, I wanted to have clean vinyl copies of both.  The quality of this 180g vinyl pressing is top notch!  Dead quiet surfaces, ruler flat, and distortion-free playback from outer to inner grooves.  I am glad I picked this one up--I may get the others while they are still available.
B004KPX4W2|1.0|The author obviously has not had any real exposure to the counter terrorism culture.  If he/she did they ignored the experience when putting pen to paper.  Very improbable scenarios throughout.  Fire fights were over done and very unrealistic.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a good brain exercise although I would suggest the availability of hints for those stuck or frustrated.  I enjoyed working through each level.  I was interrupted while in the middle of solving one floor and had to start all over again.  That was the only draw back for me which is pretty minor.  If you want a nice challenge, give this a try.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Best Kept Secret is part of a group of novels built around a family tree. I found it raced along; I liked the main characters; I found the ending disappointingly abrupt. But then, I guess the idea is for me to buy the next in the series and get completely engrossed all over again.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy playing jigsaw puzzles on my kindle. This is the best one I have tried so far. It offers everything from 35  pieces to over 200. This makes the puzzles great for almost any age. The photography is beautiful with many different sets to choose from. There is probably five different sets of puzzles that are free with probably five puzzles in each set. After that you do have to buy or pay for the new sets if you wan them. With all the additional sets available you could be playing this jigsaw puzzle game for years. If there were anything I would change you would have the ability to change the puzzle piece area background so the pieces for darker puzzles would be easier to see.

B00920HMNM|1.0|I've been an avid Donald Fagen and Steely Dan fan ever since I discovered both upon the release of &#34;The Nightfly&#34; back in the early 1980s. I started listening to the Steely Dan albums in reverse order from that point on, then kept up with them as they released their albums in the new century. I've liked just about everything, although Becker's solo albums never were to my taste, and the Dan album &#34;Everything Must Go&#34; was a bit too by-the-numbers for my liking. I really like &#34;Morph The Cat,&#34; Fagen's previous solo outing, and even have a warm spot for &#34;Kamakiriad&#34; which many others are now not fond of.<br /><br />Having said that, I cannot exactly put my finger on why this album did not warm to me. The sound is as you'd expect it--clean and clear. Meticulous, even. Yet, the production feels as though it is lacking energy. The songs just don't fall into a groove or have the rhythmic drive like they did with The Nightfly or his other albums. The only song I found here that stands out and reminds me of his past recordings is &#34;Memorabilia&#34;. Other than that, I don't find the songs to be memorable as they were in the past. There is nothing in this set that really reaches out and grabs me like all of the other solo albums. &#34;Out Of The Ghetto&#34; is the most embarassing production of Fagen's that I've ever heard committed to a recording: not only are the lyrics misplaced from his point of view, the production reeks of cheap nightclub jazz, like a band of washed-up jazzers trying to sound hip and cool.<br /><br />The whole album sounds like aging hipster Muzak to my ears...and it hurts me to say it. The weak production does the music no favors either. Maybe bring Becker back on board to produce the next one.<br /><br />As for sonics, I have both the high-resolution 24/96 download and the vinyl edition. I must say that the vinyl is also a disappointment. I have never been a fan of clear and/or colored vinyl, and this pressing is a prime example: clear or colored vinyl is noisier and scratches easier. I haven't scratched this one at all, but there is a very faint background noise which I hear on none of my other 180g vinyl pressings. The vinyl just doesn't sound like it is clean. It is like a combination of hiss and very fine crackle. A cleaning on the record vacuum might help it, but I doubt it--this just sounds like inferior vinyl to me. The digital version is in the typical antiseptic Steely Dan flavor as of late.<br /><br />If you're a die hard fan or completist, the vinyl edition might be of interest. Otherwise, I'd pass on it and find a cheap CD. Musically I also found it to be a disappointment, and I find myself going back to the other three DF albums to get my fix. There really isn't anything I can say to recommend this album, except to fill a spot in your collection. &#34;Memorabilia,&#34; as the song says. Give this one a pass. There are far better recordings of his out there.ime example: clear or colored vinyl is noisier and scratches easier.

B00DP3IESY|5.0|Good story, very good special effects.  Only one minor negative comment: The cliche of super tech Tom Cruise using bubble gum to fix a hardware problem with a drone.  But other than that two thumbs up! I originally rented it.  But after I viewed it I bought a copy.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The one and only reason I didn't like this game was because I suck at this type of game play.  My daughter insisted that I give it a try because she likes it a lot.  The game itself, for the genre, is very entertaining.  It's just that I rarely play this type of game and can't get past the first levels because I'm just no good at it.  If you like this kind of game play, by all means give it a try.  I'm sure you will enjoy it.  My granddaughter likes to watch her auntie play it because the characters are so cute and there is a lot of action.  I don't fault the game for my inabilities.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is the best book of the series. I think the negative reviews here are people upset that book five doesn't wrap up the story and ends in another cliffhanger.
0375869026|5.0|Congratulations to the author of this wonderful book.  Although it is technically a children's book, I think the beautiful lessons of compassion should be shared with everyone, young and old alike.  After reading it, I purchased it as gifts for my friends to read.  Everyone I know has absolutely loved it!

B00BWE96JY|5.0|Band of Brothers is excellent.  The actors, equipment, action, sets, and dialogue are exceptional.  In contrast to contemporary movies that typically contain irrelevant sex, swearing and liberal use of the \\"F\\" word, Band of Brothers is a well-scripted history of paratroopers enduring difficult training and the horrors of war. The exchanges between the soldiers is sharp, realistic and captivating with just enough foul language typical for guys under stress. The two-year story is also historically very accurate which makes this production an added bonus for military historians. The DVDs are imaginatively packaged in a metal case that includes an accordian dispenser with one DVD in each sleeve. I found this set on Amazon for about $18.95, a super bargain.
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|Not as good as the original.<br />The original had humor to it, while this one did not.<br />This one just had levels of grossness.<br />Stick for the original.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of my all time favorite shows. Just gets better each episode. Season 1 takes about five or six episodes to really get rolling and then it's just fantastic television. The succeeding seasons are also amazing.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|At first I didn't know what to make of this book.  The longer I read, the more the words roped me in and just fell under it's spell.  What a unique perspective on an awful time in history.  It has really stayed with me.

However, it has one major flaw with the format: there is an obvious and audible break between the tracks that gets to be more irritating with each track change.  JTF
B0041D843M|5.0|For 20 years I have been doctoring and nothing they did for me helped (yes I gave up on my doc. for my pain problems). This book has changed my life for the better. I am now and will till the end of my days live pain free and losing weight as well. My thyroid numbers are coming down and will most likely be off my med for it soon. If someone would have told me about this book 3 months ago I would not have believed them. I have lost faith in doctors for the most part! Doctors need to be educated in nutrition not how to hand out pills. My experience since eating WFPB has been my miracle drug. Thanks to T. Colin Campbell major big thumbs up
B008NW67E0|5.0|The song Babel itself is worth the price of admission. A rousing paean of hope, redemption and overcoming if there ever was is just the start to an album full of rich sounds of the human spirit crying out for love and companionship. Get the album with The Boxer on it. Trust me, as a lover of the Simon & Garfunkel original, this is a beautiful version of this powerful song. Ahh harmony!
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Greta movie. Saw it a long time ago but now seeing it again and it is still great. Great sound.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Once you start this game you want to keep on going and I also completed the last level!<br />It is almost like a thinking game too....Kind got
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I'm a big Kate Morton fan, and I think &#34;The Distant Hours&#34; is more mesmerizing and suspenseful than &#34;Riverton.&#34;  Morton relies on her &#34;then and now&#34; format to showcase varying points of view from several characters over the same sequence of events. A gothic feel with the old castle, combined with tension between the twins as they age through the decades helps pull this rather slow-moving story along at an interesting pace.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Yes, we became Fringe Fanatics before the first season was over. Then we stuck with it till the bittersweet ending in Season 5. Any season is great, but if you're new to Fringe, start at the beginning and work through the seasons in order. It will enhance your appreciation of this fine show.
B009AP4MGE|4.0|Glee is the best show to come along in years.  Great writing and terrific music. I am in my 60s and I love it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Once again, Jo Nesbo hits the mark with both character and story line. This was a book I had somehow missed. I can hardly wait for his next one.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I LOVE IT  It really kept you interested.  I couldn't put  it down  I can't wait for the next book of the Camel Club.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it, if your thinking of getting this app you should get the free one then if you like it you should get the full version!!!!BTW it need upgrades!!!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A quick read from Gaiman, told from the voice of a 7-year old boy who just reports events as he sees them, remembering the details that would most impress a child.  Magical moments of childhood interrupted from time to time with ugly realities of adulthood leave the reader wondering what was real and what was imagined.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a complicated story about people being there for each other, and failing each other. The story unfolds subtly with humor and pathos. I came to really care about the characters and went back to re-read parts and make sure I understood what happened and what was said. There are no magic wand solutions, but the author shows the same understanding that we all are neither inherently evil or good, but defined by our choices as in her earlier books. Very well written.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|its a really fun game, that can make you think, &amp; passes time by quick. i really enjoy it. buy it iguess
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I've never seen a movie quite like this one - I could never tell anyone what it was about, exactly, and at any given time during the movie, I was at a loss to explain what just happened, or was happening. And, I loved it! It is a movie, I think, that I will watch again and again, and am sure that each experience of it will bring it new. It helps that there are actors I know and love like Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Hugh Grant, who are all superb. It also helped that it underscored my own personal belief that time is of our own making and that, really, all time is really now, this moment. So, in this movie, several eras are splayed out across a present timeline. Make sense? No? Well, that's my point...in some part of me, it really does make sense...the part of me that is not confined by words and descriptions, but just, somehow, knows. I definitely would recommend it...and my advice to you while watching it is: suspend rational thought, all sense of time and place, why and wherefore, and let your imagination go. It will be quite a ride!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I do love Pentatonix, but this christmas album was pretty great. It's not got too many songs, but they're well done. Complex, beautiful, and I love listening to them when i'm out walking in the snow.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Nice to see the return of Khan and Carol Marcus.  A hint of the plot from the &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; and &#34;The Search for Spock&#34; movies with the original cast rolled into one movie was a nice touch with a twist on who saved the ship and crew.  The best part is they'll probably have a second movie with Khan since he and his crew were put in stasis and not killed off.  Hopefully, they won't resurrect Spock's half-brother or the extinct whales plots.  It would also be nice to maybe have Spock with a slightly deeper voice since he sounds a little feminine at times.  Can't wait for the next movie.
6304806434|5.0|This is a great prison break movie. Just because you committed a crime does not mean you are a bad person that can not do good.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|I am only writing this review to warn the unsuspecting. This film is amazing and wonderful and one of my favorites. However, I would never categorize it as a comedy. Yes, there are funny moments, but in it's entirety it is a drama. The story is set during the days of the Holocaust. I was dumbfounded that Amazon stuck it amongst comedies. If you are down and looking for something to cheer you up, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I thought this story was strung out too long. I enjoyed her other books more. Still, it had some good twists.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love that my godson has to put his age so that the game follows his age backed. The game is very entertaining.
B007QNRMUU|2.0|Too happy for me. Which sounds silly but I like emotional music where you can feel it. This just feels boring, blank and like I said, way too happy for me. I like a couple songs on it, but really, I was not impressed by this work.
B006R6ZP6U|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for a while and I found it here for a very reasonable price. It arrived very speedily and in perfect condition. I am very happy with it.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I downloaded and did enjoy the graphics but I found that I was confused and after playing for more than two hours I STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING!  But it does have wonderful graphics and a great experience of what it means to be CONFUSED!  Please create a more in-depth tutorial so that I understand how to play.  Adieu.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I'm writing this review assuming you have watched the Orange is the New Black TV series on Netflix. If not, step away from the computer and binge watch it immediately. It is a MUST SEE. Great storylines and fantastic acting.<br /><br />The book Orange is the New Black is decidedly less dramatic than the TV series. After reading it, I understand why the series is \\"inspired by\\" rather than \\"based on\\" the book. For instance, in real life, when Piper ends up with an extra screwdriver, she freaks out for a moment and then tosses in a Dumpster, never to be thought of again. The whole incident takes about two pages. In the series, an entire episode was based on the screwdriver and it caused an uproar in the whole prison.<br /><br />The book shows more graphically how horrible Danbury actually is and how inequitable and arbitrary sentencing can be from prisoner to prisoner, usually depending on class and race. Piper doesn't rant and rave about this or the ineffectiveness of prison as a rehabilitative tool, she just lets her experience and what she observed speak for itself.<br /><br />I did find Piper to be a little pretentious in the first half of the book. It seemed at times like she thought she was the only well-educated white woman to ever be in prison, which I don't think is the case. However, I felt like she redeemed herself to me in the last couple of chapters. And I still definitely enjoyed the book. It wasn't as compelling as the TV series but it was more educational. It's a good read to get your fix until the next season of Orange is the New Black is released. (And the book is so far removed from what is happening on the series at this point that I don't feel like reading it will spoil the second season for you.)
0743270754|5.0|Wonderfully well researched and written book about President Lincoln and his team. The book shows the strengths of humanity such as leadership,  loyalty, patience, trust, persuasion through the art of storytelling, retaining composure in spite of  slander and gossip and bravery. Weaknesses such as overreaching ambition, slander, excessive caution, personal spending excesses and egotism are also exposed. President Lincoln, according to rankings, has been classified as one of the Great Presidents ( possibly the Greatest). Another President, Harry S. Truman has been rated as either near Great or Great. It is interesting to observe that when President Kennedy was assassinated, several comparisons were made in the media between Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. However, in reading this book, comparisons can be made between Presidents Lincoln and Truman as well. The first comparison is that President Lincoln assumed responsibility for errors or failings of his team and President Truman had the saying \\"The Buck stops Here\\" on his desk. That is not to say that they wouldn't speak in private to individuals concerning errors or failings if the situation warranted such action. The second comparison is that both Presidents exerted civilian control over the military which in President Lincoln's case is reflected a number of times in this book. President Truman exhibited civilian control over the military in the case of General Mac Arthur. A third comparision between Lincoln and Truman that I perceive is the ability to make a decision to use the assets that they had in order to end horrendous wars. President Lincoln used the assets of the manufacturing capacity and the greater manpower of the north.  President Truman used the atom bomb to end a war which probably would have resulted in millions of further fatalilties and injuries if Japan had to be invaded. A fourth comparison involves reconstruction. Unfortunately, President Lincoln did not live long enough to view reconstructionbut he was involved with the planning. The Marshall Plan which substantially rebuilt Europe was part of the Truman administration accomplishments. The final comparision between these two Presidents is that President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and pushed for the passage of the 13th. Amendment to the Constitution. President Truman issued Executive Order 9981 Desegregating the Military. Both saw their actions as moral necessities.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Team of Rivals\\" is a wonderful read.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|The new side tabs are great but still working on getting used to the new changes. Im sure it will work itself out.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I had suffered through not calibrating my monitor.  Would have to do multiple prints to get it right by trial and error.  Was afraid of the calibration because I thought it was complex to do.  Boy was I wrong.  Simple to set up and easy to use.  Now prints come out correct the first time.  Think of the ink savings.  Would recommend this product to a friend.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|finally,  a game that's absolutely mindnumbing and addictive.  its as if your not actually playing and yet there you are. feeling like you'll never get that time back. lol
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This movie was not nearly as good as the original with Robert Redford. The acting was OK but all the extra stuff, the house parties and the sneaky stuff was just too mucy
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I had been avoiding this movie. Now that I've watched it, I am pleasantly surprised. The movie had none of the bs I associated with the Stallone version and that makes me happy. If it hadn't been for a few comments over at the AoSHQ I might have missed a fairly good movie.
0307474259|5.0|This book is well written with much research. It makes so much sense. If you're not sure what to eat anymore. Read this and confront the inevitable truth: carbs are the enemy.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really love this app. It's a game that the whole family can play together.  It can also help children with words.
0143120581|1.0|As an Asian American daughter and mother, I was eager to read this book after all of the controversy surrounding it.  I waited until my local library got it so I wouldn't have to spend any money. After reading it, boy, I'm glad I didn't give Amy Chua any of my money.  I'm sure that with all of the publicity, she is already laughing all the way to the bank.<br /><br />I found the book to be poorly written, full of prejudiced generalizations about groups of people, offensive and boring.  She seems really narrow-minded and shallow, despite her high level of education.  For example, she talks about the kids she didn't get along with and how it's ok because \\"those kids are janitors now\\" (I'm paraphrasing since I don't have the book in front of me).  What a horrible thing to say.  My Asian immigrant parents would never have said something like that - what I learned from them was that there is nothing wrong or shameful about an honest job and hard work, no matter what you do.<br /><br />This woman clearly thinks she is better than everyone else, and that \\"success\\" can be measured only by playing at Carnegie Hall, studying with a violin teacher who has had students \\"perform at the White House,\\" having a reception with shrimp and lobster and steaks and etc. etc. (manically long list of foods she bought for her daughter's reception) or visiting France and Spain and Germany and England and South Africa and Zimbabwe and Japan etc. etc. (manically long list of countries where she's taken her kids).  She takes a very superficial knowledge of the music world and violin and piano pedagogy and uses it to show off how knowledgeable or cultured she is.  Reading those passages, as the wife of a professional musician and music teacher (who deals daily with parents like this) I was honestly embarrassed for her.<br /><br />With regard to her parenting discliplinary style, even her own parents berate her for pushing her younger daughter too hard.  She has taken some concept of parenting and twisted and perverted it into something it was never meant to be.<br /><br />While reading it, I found myself wondering how her husband could put up with her abusive ranting and raving, and allow his children to be subjected to it.  But then I remembered, ah, yes, this is a tongue-in-cheek memoir.  No doubt many things were exaggerated for the benefit of the audience, and when we get all up in arms and foaming at the mouth, we're playing right into her hands and making her book even more popular!  So I'll just say this - at the end of the day, here is a woman whose book is disturbingly bereft of anything about how she wants to raise her kids to be good, kind or compassionate people - and goodness and kindness seem to have no presence in her definition of success for them.  If you're wondering whether her parenting style is good, that would seem to provide the answer.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. I believe there could be at least 5 hits to follow. Radioactive is still my favorite followed by Demons in a close seconds.
0375842209|5.0|Picked this book up originally while on vacation in Ireland.  It's &#34;different&#34; than most books but soon draws you in to a great story.  Try it, you'll like it!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|i have to admit this was my first time seeing this movie and i loved it!! I have been wanting to see this after seeing the avengers so i can have a better understanding of whos who.. i just loved this movie
B008XCJ03K|1.0|Yeah, I get it, it's labeled as [explicit] .... it's just sad that such great music has to be ruined with completely unnecessary curse words.  It's not poetic, it's just crass.<br /><br />The least they could do is provide a clean version of the songs.  I love the album and was looking for a clean version, but it seems there isn't one... or at least it's not available on any music store I've looked at.
3836531038|5.0|This book is a great inspiration and very stimulating.  Every photo makes my heart beat a little faster.<br />I compare the book to the work of ROY STUART.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Not as good as Sharp Objects or Dark Places, but still a worthy read.  Gillian is one of my favorite authors and I'm always intrigued by her characters and their experiences.  The twists are unexpected and leave one feeling like they just got off a monster roller coaster.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Big fan of these games when they have the characters interacting in the game and speaking. It has all kinds of interesting things about it but I don't want to be a spoiler...it is well worth the extra money for the whole game..still not done yet :)
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Me and my son love super hero movies and this is one of his favorite movies as well as mine.. can't wait for the sequel
B0064MGU98|3.0|The first few episodes were great, but it seemed as if the writers gave up after about the fifth episode.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|First impression, this thing is much smaller than I thought it would be (that's what she said).<br />Without reading anything I took this out and started running my Buck hunting knife through it, which had been professionally sharpened and then used to field dress 2 deer (one mine, one my buddy's). The Buck had been obviously dulled with the field use, but seemed very sharp after just a few passes. So, I ran a super-dull Henckels paring knife through this, which my wife uses to cut her salads (no matter how much I complain), and wow. After a few passes it was able to shave hair off my arm. Now I know Henckels are soft metal, but this did what the kitchen magic sharpener didn't - made this thing sharp from end to end!<br />These are first impressions and I'm going to play with it a bit more, but am thinking about picking up a 2nd. Given the price, I might buy a half dozen.<br />Update: After having this 2+ weeks I decided not to get another half dozen, and instead ordered 10 more for myself and gifts. This may be the best purchase I ever made. This thing works like a champ, I carry it everywhere, and I sharpen whatever knife I happen to be using at the time. Tremendously impressed.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|This is a great movie.  Good message.  Appropriate for all ages.  Modern fairy tale.  More movies should be like this one.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I had my two grandsons for a week and the older of the two, who is six,  asked if I would download this game for him on my Kindle. I did and he took it over with no help from me. He did quite well with it and his Grandpa told me later that it was great game. No problems running on the Kindle and he had a great time playing it while he was here.
0061969664|5.0|I've enjoyed about 12 of his books . Makes history come alive. Well researched and very good plot development in all his works
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This exotic movie was set in India.  It was an excellent movie, acted by top rated actors including many who had won awards.  However the actor from India was very good and funny.  I would watch another movie with him.<br />Highly recommended
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I absolutely love this watch! I personally like simplicity, and don't go for the huge or fancy watches that stick out like a sore thumb, At the same time, though, I am not exactly Mr. Moneybags and can't shell out the money for high quality watches either, so when I saw a $200+ watch on sale for $50-something, well...let's just say my interest was piqued. Honestly, this is probably the most beautiful watch that I have ever owned, and the chrome lining gives it a subtle yet still very attractive look to it. I think what ultimately sold me on the watch was the brand, Seiko. Had it been a generic brand like Casio or Timex it probably wouldn've been as appealing, but with the quality recognition that Seiko has, I knew that by buying this watch, and by taking very good care of it (even at night I put it back in its casing and pillow) that this will probably be the last watch I'll have to buy, hopefully ever, if not for many, many years to come. I've read in other reviews that analog watches such as this can initially go off track by as much as 4 minutes, which is something I mentally prepared myself for in case it happened. At this point I've used it over a week and have not had any issues with it. Again, I love its simplicity, and the color green, but more importantly I know that I bought a brand whose quality is beyond anything any generic brand can provide, and if treated well, can last for many years to come.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Great GC and effects.  Story line is a bit cryptic but understandable after a while. Character interaction was sparse but good action and scenery.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|This product does not cut bottles as easy as it is described.  I am wishing I had returned it and gotten my money back
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This is looking really good I hope they plan on making more with this cast.The way the story line fits the old with new is fantastic. The relationships of crew is beautifully written. And the special effects are .... well you just got to see them my description wouldn't do them justice. A must see even if you aren't a Star Trek fan
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is one of the better bingo games out there, however it has frozen up on me a few times.  It isn't easy to get a bingo, either.  There are powerups to help out, but you most likely would have better luck if you bought some as opposed to earning free ones.  There is a daily tournament that you can play...you get 5 free games, but that just mostly sucks up your power ups and keys.  It is fun and slightly addicting, though.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Although this movie was visually beautiful to watch it just wasn't my kind of movie.  I had a hard time relating to the main character's perspective.
6303269869|5.0|As a mental health technician, I have daily contact with persons trapped by alcohol dependency.  I recommend this movie to these individuals all the time.  More than anything, the movie underscores the pain inflicted on spouses, children, co-workers, etc. by the alcoholic's disease.  And it offers hope.  It shows there is no need for the addict to &#34;go it alone.&#34;  It is a very helpful tool.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is so cool!  You get to see what the picture is going to look like through your viewer and it's not just black and white like we see so much.  These pictures are in color and are great!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed the story immensely. I too am a relentless optimist and believe in happy endings. It is  heart warming to believe that people can come back from the tragedies in their lives and make a new beginning.
B0074QGGK6|2.0|Good information for those oriented to the popular culture views of creativity. Worth a quick read or a glance now and then.
034580709X|5.0|The book gave a picture of a younger, more innocent Harry.  Story was good, surprise ending.  Looking forward to the next book due out in October.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I am currently enjoying this game sometimes response time is slow but over all very fun and addictive. Currently playing for free and really don't have to pay. I will create another review after I get further and see if it is still worth playing for free.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Love this movie they did perfect casting in this movie wish they would hv continued on with this story line in lost boys 2 lol
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|How can you not love Lady Antebellum! This is truly one of their best cd's! Love to listen to this one over and over.
B008COD5OO|5.0|ANYTIME I even start to TALK with my friends it makes me get excited! This is no doubt one of my favorite movies!

B005UBNKZG|5.0|I got this processor for my HTPC to be used for home studio and its working great.  Overall very happy with processor.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I do like this ap but find that I miss the weather alerts that the Weather Channel sends out so quickly. The information they provide is nicely laid out on the page. I started out non-impressed as setting itself up it informed me I was living in Oregon in a town I've never heard of  - -not so I'm in Washington a long way away from the city they chose so had to  hand feed it my town to correct it. Now it seems to be fine but it does make one a bit uncertain of the accuracy when you first check it out.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Reads slow.  Characters are not well developed.  Simon is a little caustic  Spend your money on a burger. It will leave you with a better taste
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I just enjoy the game. The game play is fun and relatively easy to grasp. Nothing too challenging for most
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|HBO should be proud of such a fine effort.  Storyline beautifully developed with outstanding Characters all enhanced<br />by great acting.
B0063M22QO|4.0|So far so good on the Mahjong games. Like the way it builds up and not just large games to start.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I like the movie, is easy, nothing to deep, but has a good message and it is easy to follow.
007174889X|5.0|This replaces many of my student texts. Wish i got it much earlier in my med school education. It's not absolutely perfect (i found minor errors here and there) but no textbook is ever perfect. Some parts are less well written than others, in my opinion. But overall this helps build my knowledge base. It gives just enough pathophys and background to help deepen my understanding of disease processes. It's not hard to read at all, but like I said, I find some entries not written as well as others. It can be time consuming to read even just 1 chapter, but it's worth it. Great reference to have. Just wish I could carry it with me to work. Not crazy about the online version through accessmedicine but it will have to do. Ps- I think they could do a better job with the cover design.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Boring. Hard to follow. Confusing. Some scenes made no sense. Would not recommend to any. Dark scenes and audio was very poor.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|after having the otter box defender and gettin tired of the rubber stretching on it every time i took it out of my pocket and the dust particals building in all the openings, i tried this case and i love it!!!!! everything works fine on it! its thinner and doesnt grab your pocket. waterproofing really works! thanks lifeproof!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series was so great and easy to read. I had to force myself to stop reading at night, or shall I say early morning!  For those of you who have not read this series, be prepared for many late nights!  I felt like I lost a best friend after finishing this series.  Fantastic!
B005HED08I|5.0|This enhanced version is awesome. The color and sound is far better than I remember watching it on TV. It's hard to believe most of the actors are now in their 70's & 80's. I forgot how many stars appeared in this short lived series..
B003TGMFG4|5.0|A good read, took it with me on vacation and thoroughly enjoyed reading this story from start to finish.  I bought a used one and it was in excellent condition.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Even though this is not Stephen King's favorite version of his book, this movie is still a great classic full of drama and suspense. The picture quality is remarkable and so is the sound. The colors are so vibrant and the sound is theater quality crisp. Would recommend
B008383GE8|5.0|I have read previous books by Krauss and have found him to offer a most insightful guide to developments in cosmology for the intelligent layperson. I do not have the maths or the time to keep up with scientific papers in the field and I have to accept the underpinnings of the conclusions on trust. However Krauss presents a closely reasoned description of the cooperative efforts to understand where everything comes from. The science is advancing so quickly that a review like this for people like me is needed every year or two. Krauss's generalist books like this are vital to maintaining funding for science. I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|So the 35 dollar Chromecast is suppose to be the device of the future? I should have bought it at a future date. It is pretty much useless unless you want to pay $1.99 for any TV episode you want to watch. You can watch Utube videos on it for free (oh boy!) or you can subscribe to Netfix and pay some more money. It doesn't work with HBO GO, Kindle or really anything else. Three apps and that's it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|ITS SO EASY TO USE AND IF YOU PUT DIGITAL IN FULL VOLUME, IT WAKES YOU UP IN A SECOND!!!!! DOWNLOAD IT,? ITS WORTH IT
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Fun and easy to do.  I like being able to quickly reset it if I miss it the first time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app. Works as described. So pleased with the app and it's the right price, free. Keep up the great job.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Where 'Band of Brothers' gave you the misery of the European Front, 'The Pacific' shows the 'horror' and 'hell' the U.S. Marines went through in 'stair-stepping' their way to Japan.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Awesome movie.  The rock has it cooking again. I smell it do you smell what the rock is cooking. Baam.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Good specials effects and good acting from all the characters. All the comic characters had equally important role to play.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a really fun game. It is a extremely good time killer. If you like other bubble shooter games you'll love this game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Still giving it a full run throught, but in my search to replace Google Reader this is what I came to.<br />So far its pretty nice and easy to use.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Lois Lowry. I think it's perfect for adults as well as middle school age and up.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Masterpiece that gets better with time...  like many, the only flaw I can find is that Coppola hasn't found it in his heart to 'do' the 'Godfather Saga' on dvd AND Blu-Ray (the version he originally edited for NBC in the 80's that 'BEGAN' with<br /> 'Vito Corleone' from his childhood through his reign in the 40's-50's and through Michael's rise and fall....)
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Love this game. Good graphics, challenging levels. The mini puzzles in the middle are not my favorite, but you can sometimes skip them. I also like that you can turn off the timer and take your time.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I have the soundtrack and when they start crying I turn it on. I do wish they had a video of just the performances because that's what they love. I read some of the reviews comparing this to Glee and I don't think this is anything like Glee. The movie is a joke in itself about this life and it does make it funny.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A must read! A Muslim author, who became a Christian, then atheist, who writes exquisitely, a page turner, and historiography at its best..
B000FCKGPC|5.0|So far my favorite book after having finished ADWD. Take this book as half the story with A Dance with Dragons being the other half. So youre only going to get half the characters and story.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|the only thing I hate about it is that it won't let you save the photo you take.  Everything else about it is awesome.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|An ominous, 'industrial-like' atmosphere like 'Dark-Knight' ....makes great 'mood-music' while climbing Mt. Rainier.. ;-)  Zimmer has taken his place among Alfred Newman, Bernard Hermann, and John Williams.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Jumping back and forward in time, each chapter tells part of a story spanning three generations. A pleasure to read.
B001XULSG6|5.0|I loved it  down with the Borg!!!!  need to see more movies with Star Trek Generations characters  kickin Borg ass!!!
140006922X|5.0|A serious effort to dyscover the Jesus and his life as a man while at the same time his coming of age as the Biblical Christ , the most influential person who ever lived
B00BWDJILG|3.0|I love the orchestral stuff, the rest is good. Overall a nice cd, maybe a bit unbalanced.  Great playing by Joshua as always!!!
1416972242|5.0|Love the book. Great second part of the series. A must read. Book arrived in perfect condition and fast. Could not ask for better service.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've seen these movies from the director's seat as I was Spielberg's assistant's assistant (Kathy Kennedy).  Anyway I have this thing playing on my all new ship theater system and it sounds amazing.  The only downside I'd say that HD has really brought out some flaws on the set I've never seen before.  No I'm not sharing!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Mystery with an interesting explanation. I liked how it all came together.  Enjoyed it enough to consider other books by the author.
0618871713|5.0|At first, I was very skeptical. I was assigned this book for a class and was weary of it being written in comic-book form. However, after 10 pages I was sucked into the life of the Bechdels' and really enjoyed the way the written portions of the book and the comic pictures worked together to give the reader a sense of Alison's life. Give this book a shot! You won't be disappointed.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Too many scratches on the disk to be considered &#34;very good&#34; condition in my opinion. Have not yet tested the disk to see if it skips.
B005LAII44|4.0|I enjoyed G I Joe Retaliation, but I wish Channing Tatum was not killed off. Hope there is a third movie.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Helps people to understand colonization from the eyes of the oppressed and shows the compassion of the Jesuit priests in their pursuit of justice, grace, and mercy....exactly who was uncivilized?? I think this movie shows that answer clearly!
1594204217|5.0|I like to cook and have been learning the art for many years. I learned much from this history/philosophy/narrative. I highly recommend this to any one interested in food and food preparation.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|Great product even though some of the seasons were slightly used! But most of the seasons weren't even opened yet. Overall, very pleased!
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Still a good movie after 30+ years. Don't like some of the bad language. 8 and 10 year olds liked it too.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Fun,funny,very enjoyable! I will recommend it to my friends!! We, my husband and I enjoy Judy Dench in all her work.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is fun, kind of a cross between a modern zoo with a dash of prehistoric fun. Only problem that I have with this game is that it costs too much coin (you don't have to buy coins or peanuts unless you want to) to find the animals. Cross breeding a Gryphon is way too much!!
B004SEUJ0K|5.0|This movie is fantastic. The picture and sound quality is amazing played it back thru my surround sound on my 400 watts/ channel AR speakers you have to hear it to believe it. Loved every minute of it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the colors. It's easy to see at night time<br />If you don't like the alarms, you can make your own!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Using this on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  I liked the autocorrect on my Galaxy Nexus best, and the S4 didn't do it as well.  It seemed like I was constantly mistyping things and autocorrect wouldn't catch them.  I tried this one, but unlike the stock keyboard, this one doesn't include the numbers directly.  And it's more time-consuming to long-press the top row to get a number.  I thought with the paid version I might be able to edit the layout and add the numbers, but sadly no.  I like the prediction, and the cloud sync is promising as I also put this on my tablet (I did not realize I would have to buy both the phone and tablet versions of the app, so I am using this one for both), but so far it doesn't outweigh the downsides.  I will probably go back to the stock keyboard, though I haven't given up yet.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|It's clean and I don't have to worry about what he's watching unlike some of the current TV shows.  Recycling!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This books are a combination of Indiana Jones and a special forces novels needed together to get an amazing story line and great characters.<br /><br />When I start reading these books I have a very hard time putting them down.<br /><br />Please keep them coming
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Typical love story with a dramatic twist at the end.  Entertaining enough to not be to put this book down!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I'm not a critic but do enjoy Clint Eastwood in almost everything he does.  This is a great story and portrayed very well.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|This song was destined to be an instant hit. It has all the elements of a good club/dance hit, and all the elements to make it Lady Gaga's own. If you don't love it the first time, listen to it again...eventually you won't be able to stop listening to it.  Promise.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|A beautiful film about love, loss, mistakes, and a second chance (in this case via a parralel universe). I really love how the sci-fi is downplayed though (even though I love sci-fi), here its just a back drop for an amazingly acted and directed human drama. It's sure to touch your heart and leave you thinking about all the decisions you've ever made and will make.
B001B51B9M|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies I really like musicals and this was one of my mothers favorite shows
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's like a modern day X Files with a scientific base. Plot lines are great and characters are well developed
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this wonderful Brittish romance. It wasn't what I expected, I cried as much as I laughed, but I cannot imagine anyone not loving this book.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|Incredible cycling.  The story was good but the cycling was excellent.  I'll be watching this one again and again.  No critic here just enjoy movies
B002JI94J4|5.0|Aaah … to be nine years old again for a little over an hour! Excellent audio and visual restoration! Most enjoyable.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Only played two levels, but seems a little easy. Maybe it will be more challenging as more levels are played.
B0036TGSJ4|4.0|This is a fun movie just goes to show you that people will believe anything.  I liked it alot and so do my children

B00DIFARQ6|1.0|The delay in the controls made it impossible to control the plane.  I tried it for a few minutes and deleted it off of my Fire.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|it is good but be ready to test ur brain cud it can and will stump u till u want to throw it out the window
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I had heard this was better than people thought and they were right. Not fine cinema or anything, just fun!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Love being able to read on the go. The ease of the kindle is so nice. Would definitely recommend to buy.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|It is good as the second installment of JJ Abrams take, and even if you enjoyed the original series and movies. The acting is superb, the writing was VERY well done! The editing was a little off in certain parts, but that's forgivable when overall the whole thing came together as a brilliant film! The main/supporting cast could not have been any better!
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Great Purchase, I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of this movie or TV series. Really Good Deal
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is the best show ever and season ten is one of the most intense seasons this far! Got to have it to prep for the premier on September 24th!
B00007LTIL|4.0|Just got this to back up my album.  There is nothing needed to be said about the Dead.  Weird on the first few albums but true Americana, throughout.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|I purchased this video game for my youngest grandson who had listed quite vigorously this title on his required playing list,
B0064W667Y|4.0|This is an interesting fairy tale story for adults. The book is nicely formatted so that you can read the captions and view the artwork on each panel on the computer. Both story and artwork are quite good and I look forward to reading more in this series.
B000W4D94I|3.0|Who's the big-haired floozie on the box cover? It's obviously not Helen Hunt and her straight hair. It's entertaining in a funny way. When they are eating breakfast at Meg's house while Hunt takes a shower, Jami Gertz asked if anyone had seen an F5. Everyone freezes and looks like someone cut the cheese and it was a bad one!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great Purchase, I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of this movie or TV series. Really Good Deal
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Nice reality check and follow up to the Secret.<br />I recommend it highly to anyone feeling out of sync with the Universe.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I got this app on my Kindle Fire. I definitely got very involved with this game. I didn't want to cook dinner because I needed to solve one more puzzle, which then lead to another (everyone did get fed eventually). It was beautiful, sort of creepy, and peaceful. Can't wait to enjoy the addition to this app.<br />This game didn't last as long as I'd hoped for, but it did have me stumped, over-thinking things when the answer was right in front of my face.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I have a HTC One X phone, and I have a Bose sound dock. Unfortunately the Bose sound deck does not take devices other than Apple products. I needed something that can hook up these 2 devices so I can play music on the sound dock. I ordered the DockBoss and it worked perfectly, within seconds. It was so easy, and the sound quality was nearly perfect. If you have a HTC phone, and want to play your music through anything with an ipod connector, this is the item for you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So good. I actually watched most of the season on my iPhone. It was still amazing. Amazon is the only place I could find Season 3. Thanks.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an addicting game. It passes the time when you are at the doctors office waiting to go in.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Great Purchase, I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of this movie or TV series. Really Good Deal
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Don't know when I have such fine acting, costumes, directing or writing.  Of course there won't be many characters left if we keep losing our key favorites!  But, I understand they have a life outside of DA even if we don't!
B002ODEJYE|5.0|This is a great video. The tour is unreal and this video does it justice. I love pink and cant wait for the next video to come out
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I can not stop playing!!! I have to play every day after and before work. I recommend this game to everyone.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it,  and I might be a tad addicted to it...though I have yet to see the bad guy on the third level...
B000ZOW96Y|4.0|This one was good, better than 12 but not as good as 11.Still great characters and chemistry. Was glad to see them back in Las Vegas. The European vacation in 12 was a little hard to track.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Purchased on a whim but LOVED this book. Have read it 3X already. Would recommend it to everyone,artist or everyday person.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Director and Writer: Paul Thomas Anderson.<br /><br />Staring: Daniel Day Lewis, Paul Dano, Dillon Freasier, Kevin J. O'Connor, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Russell Harvard.<br /><br />Running time: 158 minutes.<br /><br />\\"I don't want to talk about those things. I see the worst in people. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.\\"<br /><br />- TWBB's protagonist, Daniel Plainview.<br /><br />I remember when I first saw There Will Be Blood. It was about a month after the film came out on DVD in 2008 and my mother and I, on a whim, ordered the film On Demand just to see what it was. Within its first few minutes, it showed us its main character Daniel Plainview, hard at work and attempting to find some kind of trace of oil in the ground. Despite the injuries he sustains, he continues to go at it. This sequence only has one or two pieces of dialogue, coupled with an utterly horrifying and yet strangely beautiful score by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, but it already helps establish WHAT kind of character Plainview is: He is a massive determinator, willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.<br /><br />However, as the film progresses, this maybe one of the only few positive aspects of his personality.<br /><br />Let's get this out of the way: There Will Be Blood is not a pleasant film. The title alone should state exactly what it is. It's the kind of movie that outright shows us the ugliness of people and does not look back. While the film does show some redeeming qualities in others in the form of love and to an extent kindness, we see the worst aspects of people all over the place. Our greed, anger, how we trick others in to doing what we want, deceit, lies, zealotry and quite a few more. Though for all of its ugliness and hatred, its a film that will never leave in a positive way.<br /><br />Set early 1900's and partially based on the Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, Blood tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and his son HW Plainview (Dillon Freasier). Plainview, over the years, has set up a successful oil business and doing pretty well for themselves. A young man by the name of Paul Sunday (Paul Dano, who plays two parts in the film) comes to him and tells Daniel that they have oil where he comes from. Plainview agrees to see what all of the fuss is about and slowly starts to bud heads with Paul's twin brother Eli (Paul Dano again), a charismatic but over-zealous follower of Christianity. As the film progress, things start to spiral out of control and explode (both figuratively and literally) for everyone.<br /><br />I remember what my reaction to the film was the first time I saw it. It was something to the equivalent of a resounding \\"Wow\\" of sorts, simultaneously wondering what the hell I just watched and yet completely understanding it all. The film also was my introduction to both Paul Thomas Anderson and its lead Daniel Day Lewis, both of whom are wildly regarded as some of cinema's most impeccable talents and it most certainly shows.<br /><br />From a directorial standpoint, Blood has a ballsy degree of confidence from start to finish. The aforementioned opening with little to no dialogue to some sequences with characters violently attacking each other to even those quiet moments between Daniel and his son all have a surprising tightness to them. None of it feels out of place or some kind of mood whiplash. Not a single shot is wasted, either. Every scene makes sense for it to be there. This is a character study first and foremost and save for the segment which cuts to HW in his early adulthood, we never leave Plainview's perspective.<br /><br />Speaking of Daniel Plainview, this guy is easily one of cinema's most memorable characters. Plainview comes off as a darker version of a typical Living Legend: His accomplishments, power, influence, charisma. But as the film progresses, his true nature and personality slowly starts to show up: His unrelenting greed, absurd selfishness and finally, his mental and moral decay. Compare his dignified demeanor at the beginning of the film to his crazed nature at the end. But all of this is fascinating and, in the darkest way possible, a joy to watch because of Lewis's performance. There's a very good reason why Lewis won his second Oscar for this. Even when he performs at times laughable antics to harass others, such as humiliating fellow Oil executives or playing along with Eli's song and dance, it still manages to spark fascination. There's even some subtleties to the performance, such as Lewis walking with a limp throughout the film, reflecting that Plainview never healed from his earlier injury.<br /><br />But Day-Lewis isn't alone in giving out excellent performances. Paul Dano, as the over-the-top preacher Eli Sunday, delivers a great rivalry between Day-Lewis's character and creates, what I felt anyway, an excellent love-to-hate vibe from him. The actor who plays Daniel's son, Dillon Freasier, does a very good job, adding a small flicker of innocence to the nastiness of the film. An older version of HW, played by Russell Harvard, also leaves a lasting impression on the viewer though I won't say how for the sake of spoilers.<br /><br />While many films of today rely on computer generated trickery for beautiful visuals, its always nice to see some films either go all the way with practicality or do a mix and match. Blood, for its look, went for an all natural look to help suck the viewer into the film's time period. Cinematographer Robert Elswit provides stark imagery and haunting landscapes. The most standout part, which has been used in promotional material, is when an oil derrick lights on fire, setting an hellish tone to the scene and Plainview being covered in oil with a strange mix of horror, fascination and sense of accomplishment on his face.<br /><br />The musical score - as aforementioned by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood - is very haunting as well and comes off as something that would fit more with a horror film than it would with a period drama. But considering the tone and feeling of madness that carries the film, it fits incredibly well, especially when viewing it a second time. There's also several excerpts from different composers, such as Johannes Brahms and Arvo P&auml;rt, that get the job done in very fitting - albeit also very dissonant - parts..<br /><br />If there were any complaints I could give, there would be two. The first would be some of the acting. While the performances are nothing short of incredible many times over the course of the film, sometimes it can border on self parody, especially with Paul Dano's fanatical devotion and Day-Lewis scenery chewing insanity. And then there's the deliberate pacing of the film, which will irk and possibly divide viewers. This isn't the kind of movie to play in the background while you're vacuuming the house; If you intended to watch There Will Be Blood, you will sit down and pay attention.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood has already earned its place in cinema and pop culture due in part to its infamous \\"Milkshake\\" scene (which is in of itself is a spoiler). Granted, not to the absurdly popular levels of cinematic juggernauts like The Avengers or The Dark Knight. I would even argue to those who seek out the film will be very surprised and maybe even turned off for what they would be in for: A slow moving Period Piece crossed with elements of Psychological Horror story. Whatever the case, even with its darkest of depths, There Will Be Blood will always hold a place in my cinema loving heart.nts, power, influence, charisma.

0762777931|5.0|This book really opened my eyes.  I became a vegetarian for the health benefits and this book guided my way.  It changed the way I eat and I have been able to maintain a healthy weight.  If I need more motivation it is my \\"go to\\" book.  Don't pass this book up!
B004HMQ7BI|4.0|The best characters were everyone but Marisa Tomei. Couldn't have done the movie without her though.<br />Bonnie Hunt and Robert Downey Jr. were the best.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|A great collection of songs start to finish.  Edgy rock n roll with teeth.  A must have for hard rock music lovers
B00C2C637I|1.0|I was looking for Bradbury's Science fiction and this certainly wasn't what I thought it would be.  Next time I'll be more choosy
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book is well written, but really meant for a reader in there teens.  A love story for young people.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fun show.  It's not too full of drama yet it's smart, funny, and has just enough balance of long-term vs episode storyline.  Try episode 1 season 1.  If it doesn't suit you, then Suites wont.  If it does, well then enjoy.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|I loved this book it is so full of meaning. Every word has other words hidden behind them. It is very rich and full of wisdom, this book. The ending was unexpected and abrupt and it tore your heart in two. I absolutely love this book. It is the best book i have ever read.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Great fun. The problems get progressively harder and take a lot of skill. Well done to all concerned. Love it.
B001RCD2DW|3.0|These cans are made in China, not in Austria. The picture shown (with SalesProLC as seller) says Made in Austria - just expand the picture to see that. Clearly deceptive advertising. There is nothing wrong in principle with AKG deciding to manufacture goods overseas in China, but in practice the average quality of goods manufactured there is, as everyone knows, generally lower than it would be if made in Austria. This is not solely or mainly the fault of the Chinese; mainly AKG is to blame. However, the price is lower, so I will test them out carefully before deciding whether to keep them.
0812973992|5.0|read his latest novel and wanted to read this one - is a good addition to my personal library (amen)
B0089LOKHG|4.0|The book was great! I was disappointed in the ending though. I wish there was a 4th book to get some closure!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Interesting character development, great casting, good acting, and the plots keep you guessing about what will happen to the characters.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|As mother of a grown son, I saw myself and my son in this movie.  Lots of laughs followed by endearing moments.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Affleck is great, the cast is great, the story is true (albeit a wee bit overdramatized - Revolutionary Guards chasing a 747 down the runway at Teheran Airport - come on!)  A really gripping film - one very much worth watching!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|And that is all we really wanted when we made this purchase, a carry case to protect it and extend the charge life.
0525478817|5.0|My 14 year old daughter bought it and loved it so I read it also.  I really enjoyed it too.  My husband even read it and liked it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A great balance of action with enough backstory to keep the movie moving along. It will be hard to top this superhero team movie in the future.
B00BESM14U|1.0|Teens use drugs, get drunk, have sex, and it's all portrayed as okay.  This type of behavior is unhealthy and something that all teens should stay away from.  And if you don't want your teens to do these things then they shouldn't be watching it portrayed in a positive light in movies like this.  The plot is dark and heavy- not at all lighthearted and fun like the preview.  I was disappointed.  I wish I could get my time and money back!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy to use. I no longer use my old alarm clock. This one I can take with me whenever I travel.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Wonderfully told tale of suspense and horror. Written as diary entries from the perspectives of the characters involved, it is also a rich example of love.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was skillfully written so that the conclusion was surprising but plausible.  The main character was interesting and sufficiently complicated.  The novel kept my interest.
B002SF9YYI|4.0|name someone with a 40 year career whose best work is his latest work, or at least from the mid to late 80's, i was amazed at some of the tracks on this compilation, which has more than 50 of his songs, particularly Windswept and Slave to love from the 1985 Boys and girls album and Kiss and tell and Limbo from his 1987 release, some of which have been digitally remastered since. i think he's a treasure and even over 60, he's still kicking, as his songs were the best thing about the recent Great Gatsby movie.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|John Wayne is a gunhand for hire, a wealthy landbaron wants Wayne to kill a rancher for his water rights. He comes to town to find that the sheriff is his friend Mitchum. He quits the job then and leaves town only to be shot in the back by Joey MacDonald, during his absence the landbaron hires another gunman (Christopher George), and Wayne heads to town to let Mitchum know about the new hire. Instead of his old friend he finds a sad drunk.<br /><br />Mitchum's character had been drunk for months while his deputy has defended the town as best he could. Wayne has a bulletin his back that triggers an attack causing numbness and it gets longer each time. Along the way he aquires a kid named Mississippi who carries a shotgun instead he is a lousy shot. They join forces to defend the MacDonalds and save the sheriff from himself. All in all a fine film!
