6305736650|5.0|I watch this one once a year.  I can't help but notice recently that it is basically a propaganda film in behalf of the American war effort during WW2.  In less capable hands than the legendary Epstein brothers the script could have deteriorated into a jingoistic John Wayne, kill the Germans, flick.  Instead, it gives us some of the snappiest dialogue of American Cinema and the most romantic love story.    Bogart's Rick is an American icon.  The tough guy with a broken heart bleeds whiskey.  Ingrid Bergman has hurt him.  She scoots when her husband Laslo, the resistance hero is found to be alive.  Rick retreats to a bistro in Casablanca, last stop for Europe's refuges.  Claude Rains plays the flip flopping Frenchy commandant.  Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorie, and a host of Hollywood character actors populate the back lot of Hollywood Morocco.  Every one of them gives the performance of their life.  It's almost like they knew this movie would be very special.    Will Ingrid get on that plane with hero Laslo or a hero of love, Bogey?  This is a tough one for the women in the audience.  Convention says she should go with her husband.  He's a brave and kind man.  Or should she stay with capable, tough, unbelievably romantic Bogey?    Round up the usual suspects and play it again, Sam.

I don't know how this will play out on stage, I don't feel like slamming into the guy next to me after listening to the album.  However, the lyrics still have the edge without the music sounding like the new wannabe punk that's out there from kids that haven't lived long enough to be upset at the world.  Keep it up guys and us old 30 somethings that listen to your music will keep listening.
B00005QK5X|5.0|Wow on the reviews. They are much deserved.<br /><br />I saw the Wipers live a number of times. Remember they formed in about 1977. So I wouldnt call them post punk, but maybe the first westcoast punk band.<br /><br />The Nirvana connection is warrented, since Kurt Cobain was a big fan of the Wipers and saw many live shows.<br /><br />I agree with the others, the Wipers arent a punk band. What is punk anyways. Im 44 and heard the Ramones in 1974, were they punk, no, they were pure Rock N Roll.<br /><br />Greg Sage has a style that defines original.<br /><br />Greg if you read this, I saw you a bunch of times at the Satyricon. Also some industrial part of Portland when the microphone hit you in the teeth. You missed about a half of sec, then kept singing.<br /><br />Greg and the Wipers, thx for the memories.<br /><br />Zenorecords.com  go to buy Greg and Wipers itmes.<br /><br />BTW, Roky Erickson rocks. Check his music out also.
B0002OERI0|5.0|ok, so i go to best buy to buy this cd. ive waited like forever for it or at least since green day's last cd, and finally i get it. so i pop it into the car cd player and rite from the start it kicks ass. obviously everyone has heard american idiot and we all know its a sweet song, but then rite into jesus of suburbia...wow, just wow...great song/songs...i love this whole like chapter type song writing they got going on. ok and so all of a sudden, my mom goes, \\"whoa, this is pretty good, i can actually listen to it and it actually has a beat.\\" ok sweet the cds good, so i get home and pop it into my computer and upload into my ipod. alrite super, and so now its playing out of my computer and my dad hears it...next thing i know he whips out his electric guitar (thought i was gonna say something else didnt you) and starts playing boulavard of broken dreams..haha wow, my 54 year old dad is playing green day and loving. so it just goes to show, it really is that good
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Reality is still Bowie quality; I think most fans should purchase it if they haven't already. However, I find that I'm not listening to that one as much as Earthling, Heathen or even Let's Dance (a timeless classic). Most songs on the CD are amazing, catchy and highly creative; in this, Reality is pure excellent Bowie. \\"Looking for water\\", however, is the reason why the CD stays on the shelf most of the time. It's noisy, repetitive and downright annoying if you ask me.  <br />One of the things I enjoy most about Bowie is that his albums are usually pure pleasure to listen to from beginning to end; no bad songs, it's success after success. For Reality, I have to actually get up and go skip that one song, which bother me.
B000005IS1|5.0|Simply one of the BEST hard rock live albums EVER made. Recorded during the band's prime era, in 1968. Starts off with \\"Ramblin' Rose\\" and their sole hit \\"Kick Out The Jams\\" as the five members rip through, what proves to be a timeless as much as memorable blistering set. Who could turn away from \\"Motor City Is Burning\\" and their astounding cover of Sun Ra's \\"Starship\\"? Talk about a trend setting lp. It's safe to assume that without the MC 5, there probably wouldn't have been Motorhead, Sex Pistols, Melvins, Soundgarden, Monster Magnet.....you get the point. Comes with a full color two-sided six-way fold-out that includes some nifty band photos and memorabilia. Recommended.
0553260111|2.0|After seeing the movie, I was pleased to discover that it was based on a novel by a reputable author. I had already read two Ludlum novels, so I immediately purchased the Bourne Trilogy with high expectations from my other Ludlum experiences. <br /> <br />All three books are disappointing both in their numerous plot twists and especially in the character dialogue. The main characters all sound like Mensa-Wannabees with every other line a new metaphor or witty reference. I regret purchasing the trilogy. The first movie is superior in every way.
6304698623|5.0|Although those who have read and loved the original book may be dissapointed by some of the liberties taken in this movie, it is lovely to watch and the ending is enchanting.  <br /> <br />Sara Crewe, played by Leisel Matthews, is more real than the Sara of the book - she has a mischievious side that makes the movie more fun to watch. The movie is very family friendly...for example, the fact that the school has a young black servant is glossed over, and the adults and girls show no racial prejudice. A few details, including Miss Minchin's final, comic, fate, Amelia's elopement, and the fact that sara is strong enough to pull herself up onto a ledge with only her finger tips to detract from the movie, but other parts more than make up for these. The visual imagery in the movie is beautiful, if somewhat unrealistic in cases, and the soundtrack, especially the song \\"Kindle My Heart\\" suits the movie exactly. The plot is enhanced with sara's telling of the story of rama and sita- a detail that is not in the book but makes the movie more poignant by paralleling the events in sara's own life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves happy endings. It has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it 7 years ago.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but I don't like the fact that Lucas released the Special Editions without the option of getting the originals. Some of the changes are good, but I love the Ewok dance and song from RETURN OF THE JEDI.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Too many of you people...way too many of you people have grown so cynical and jaded that you can no longer see your own hand in front of your face. I am sick and tired of hearing such nitpicking on something that is just good clean fun. For crying out loud you people act as though you had just undergone botched surgery in a  Mexican prison. It's just a fun bunch of films that I had fun watching when I was 7, 10, and 13. It was fun to see them again and I am very thankful that George Lucas was able to contribute to myself discovering I should be an artist. I would tell you people to grow up but that would be a mistake. You have grown up too much and are far too critical. Watch the films with some 7 year olds and see if they talk and think as you do. I doubt it. I am ashamed to see what you have written about these films. It makes me sad.<br /><br />I have more to say...<br /><br />I have a theory that the harsh cynical critics. You know who you are. You actually still love these films, even in their slightly altered forms and you get as silly as a schoolgirl when you watch them. These feelings that are linked to youth embarrass you and you feel conflicted therefore you consciously or unconsciously criticize the films, nitpicking at everything, writing reviews, telling George that he is out of his mind. This is all so that you can still be a part of the discussion and still exist on the fringes of something that is important to you. Of course when I see films that I do not like or I see something from my youth that no longer interests me I just move on. You won't find some big hoopla, and long winded convoluted explanations about what is not exactly to my liking. It's Georges film and he can do what ever he wants. You want something different go make your own fool film. As far as sound quality goes I felt that all 3 sounded amazing. I am using a good Bose system with 5.1 sound. Perhaps your ears are damaged in one frequency or another. Perhaps your system sucks, or you have it hooked up wrong, or your rooms acoustics suck. Or your DVD player is broken. Or you just lost that part of childhood that let you enjoy these films without being so critical and that makes you mad and you don't know why so you blame the messenger rather than look long and hard at yourself.d up wrong, or your rooms acoustics suck.

B00003CXCT|1.0|While I must concede that I have been anticipating the release of Star Wars on DVD since the format became mainstream - I am severely disappointed in the treatment presented here. <br /> <br />These films are not the original Star Wars films from '77-83, these are not even the versions released in '97 as definitive.  What we are given here is what Lucas would like us to believe is his \\"true vision.\\"  Be that as it may, the movies pale in comparison with his \\"half-finished\\" works from 25 years ago.   <br /> <br />With that in mind, these are great DVDs.  The picture is good throughout (aside from a few skips).  However, an important note is that the Audio is horrible through most of the trilogy.  Not only are there major adjustments to the volume of the score in comparison with effects, but the channels are botched in 5.1, and there are also sequences of drowned out dialogue. <br /> <br />
0380789019|4.0|This is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" for adults.  Gaiman has captured the magic of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and placed it in his book.  The protangonist Richard Mayhew has stumbled into an underground version of London and it is chock full of colorfull characters, both good and bad.  Gaiman's character is caught in a world that doesn't look quite like his own, but is connected.  Magic rules here and there is a quest that Richard and his companions are on to defeat evil.  The two man evil characters, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are delightfully evil, just like Fagan from \\"Oliver Twist\\" and they work for a bad guy that is posed as a good guy.  they are trying to kill 'Door' with Richard caught in the middle with no idea how he ended up there.  This is a delightfull read and is very fast.  Nice job by Gaiman and is highly recommended.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the CD that true Green Day fans have been waiting for.  Multilayered songs that get rediscovered and deeper with repeated lessons and 2 epic punk-rock tracks, 9+ minutes long apiece, each with an initial theme and then 5 distinct progressing stages, making for some of the best green day material to date.  I especially enjoyed Jesus of Suburbia, which grabs you from the onset and is henceforth compulsively addictive.  The best part about the album is that it flows from the first track to the conclusion, probably the most complete Green Day album I've yet heard.  This record is a masterful classic that, in time, will probably be known as Green Day's best to date.

0345446798|5.0|I have many dog training books in my possesion but I confess that I am not an avid reader and get bored easily with reading the whole book and find that I read small sections throughout the book.  The Other End of the Leash was not such a book however.  I found myself so engaged with each page that I couldn't put it down and read it cover to cover!!!!  I found the book to be insightful, humorous, though provoking and encourages the reader to look through different points of view on the relationship with their dog.  I encourage this book to my dog training clients as it is just an excellent book.  I hope you enjoy your read through it as much as I did.  If you have ever heard Trish McConnell speak, you will find this book to make you feel like Trish is reading this book directly to you.  It is written like she speaks....so enjoyable.
0876855575|5.0|Depending upon your taste in literature, Charles Bukowski was either a brilliant writer who has yet to receive to respect he truly deserves or nothing more than a drunk with a typewriter.  Most of those who love Bukowski seem to have discovered him through his poetry, but Ham on Rye was my introduction to the author, and it remains my favorite work of his.  In fact, I think Ham on Rye is probably the best coming-of-age story in American literature, far superior to Catcher in the Rye.  Although Salinger's novel captures your attention when you're thirteen, it tends to suffer terribly when you reflect back on it as a more mature individual and recognize the narcissicism and insincerity at the heart of Holden Caulfield's attitude towards the world.  Ham on Rye does not romanticize the innocence of children and depict adults as \\"phonies.\\"  It is Bukowski's own thinly veiled account of his childhood and adolescence in Los Angeles between the two world wars, as told through the eyes of his alter ego, Henry Chinaski.  Ham on Rye shares the same brutal humor and breezy prose style as Post Office and Women, but it is much more tightly focused than any of Bukowski's prior novels, which tended to be more episodic than anything else.  For that reason I think it ultimately achieves a sort of lasting resonance with the reader that is lacking in much of Bukowski's other prose work, for all of the energy and spontaneity his writing always possessed.  Ham on Rye is alternatively hilarious and horrifying, but it always remains truthful in a way that few coming-of-age novels are.  Anyone new to Charles Bukowski should start with this.
B00003CXCT|3.0|These movies are not the originals - they have the re-release graphics in them which almost make me want to return them. George Lucas - why have you done this to these classics? The new scenes and additions are a) obvious b) ugly in juxtaposition to the rest of the movie c) unnecessary d) an abomination to the original film(s). At least give us the option of choosing your new \\"Crap version\\" or the classic \\"Original Comfort-food version.\\" Everytime I see one the additions, I cringe and realize how much it has ruined the experience.

0440178002|5.0|Many of us loathe the lengthy historical novels that grace the shelves of book stores today, intimidated by their size and impending substance. My fascination with Japanese culture, samurai and the orient, coupled with a recent trip to 'The Last Samurai' drove me to the nearest bookshop in search of something to quench my thirst for enlightenment. Clavell's novels, being classics and well acclaimed, caught my attention and I turned to Shogun for a challenging read.    Not since Lord of the Rings have I become so involved in a story, often staying awake until midnight to comfortably conclude a chapter or missing one or two meals to find out how another one of the Characters dilemma's was solved. Shoguns roller-coaster of action, adventure, romance and history culminated in a saga that entangles itself in your mind. All the characters display their unique personalities, traits, vices and virtues. Blackthorne, the typical 17th century english 'Sea Dog' is civilized by Japan through the beautiful and lovely Mariko, the cunning, masterful and lovable Lord Toranaga and the rest of the gang.    Historically the book keeps on the tracks, changing a couple of names along the way (Eg: Tokugawa &#62; Toranaga) however there really was a war involving Tokugawa for the shogunate which he won, defeating the armies that stood in his way left behind after the 'Taiko' died. There was also a 'Goroda' dictator figure who ruled and was really assasinated, but the story of an english pilot landing in Japan, and developing a relationship with the most powerful daimyo in the land is all fiction.    The triumph came for me when i realized how much this book puts The Last Samurai to shame, and only  on completion of the novel did I realise what a pathetic and inaccurate interpretation of Japanese culture the movie really is, forgetting it hopeless story and personality crippled characters.    Unchallenged still, Shogun remains the pinnacle of english literature on Japan (Story Based Anyway)with its twists and turns, you become engrossed in the story, secretly (in your heart) rooting for the characters you like. By the end of this novel I found myself thinking like a samurai, after all it is all down to karma, neh? And would recommend the book to anyone of open mind and possessing an appreciation for great literature!  Can't wait to read Gai-Jin and Tai-Pan!!!
044651652X|5.0|If you're a miserable cynic, you'll hate it. I am not a fiction reader. I am purely a lover of non-fiction. But a friend pleaded with me to read this book. When I finally broke down and picked up the book, I could not put it down. I finished it in about 5 hours. <br /> <br />People can say whatever they want about it being contrived romance, but this book puts you inside of what it feels like to be in a very intense romance that some (real) people really experience. I've been there, I know the anguish and intensity of the love this book describes. There really are people who love, speak and act this way.  <br /> <br />People who don't get this book are bitter and angry that they can not concieve of such intense loving and living. If you love to love, and love an incredible quick read, this book is for you.  <br /> <br />I wept for a good half hour when I finished this book despite myself. Enjoy! <br />-- A non-fiction loving, non-sap from New Jersey <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Étant un grand fan de GREEN DAY, j'ai acheté le cd le jour de son lancement et je l'ai dévoré d'un bout à l'autre. J ai été heureux de constater que le groupe n'avait pas perdu de son énergie et de sa fougue avec les années et que tout en gardant la &quot;Drive&quot; de dookie ils ont continués leur évolution commencé avec Warning en faisant des tounes plus mélodiques.On dirait même que la voix de BILLIE JOE est encore mieux qu'avant (elle est CRYSTAL CLEAR)<BR>En résumé, c'est un très bon album et peut-être même leur meilleur<br />Je le recommande fortement

B00000JGOJ|3.0|\\"Talking about love is like dancing about architecture.\\"<br /><br />This quote is only one of the perceptive and witty barbs that the characters of \\"Playing By Heart\\" utter, and despite it, they talk a lot about love. Unlike most movies like this though, these characters have something fresh and fascinating to say. \\"Playing By Heart\\" is a sadly underappreciated gem of a movie with a great script and a cast that is almost too good to believe. That said, the movie lacks a focus that draws everything together (other than the foreseeable denoument).<br /><br />We meet several groups of characters who are all exploring different aspects of love. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, whose subltle acting is a marvel to behold, play an old married couple whose marriage is facing old obstacles. Connery is dying, and Rowlands confronts him about a supposed infidelity twenty-five years before. Gillian Anderson plays a stony theatre director who finds love in the unlikely person of a pre-\\"Daily Show\\" Jon Stewart, while Dennis Quaid and Madeline Stowe are both exploring ways to live outside of their unsatisfactory marriages. There is sensitive, quiet acting in the persons of Ellen Burstyn and Jay Mohr. Burstyn plays Mohr's mother, who is staying by her son's bedside as he dies of AIDS. I only wish there had been more of them.<br /><br />But most astounding of all is the story of two young clubbers played flawlessly by Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe. The two actors are so real and raw that you can't help but be sucked in by their story, and ultimately their emotional openness makes you cry. I wanted to see an entire movie based on Jolie and Phillippe, they were that good. And in a cast like this one, that's an accomplishment.<br /><br />\\"Playing By Heart\\" is wonderfully acted. It's the only movie where you can have Ellen Burstyn, Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillippe, Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart, Jay Mohr, Dennis Quaid, Anthony Edwards, and Madeline Stowe share the same screen. Even Patricia Clarkson makes a brief appearance. The script is wonderfully witty and the directing is very good. Although it ultimately fails to form a definite whole, its bundle of loose threads is fascinating to watch.Stowe share the same screen. Even Patricia Clarkson makes a brief appearance.

B000002MZ6|5.0|Having read the novel by Arthur C. Clarke, imagine my suprise upon discovering a CD that was inspired by the novel.<br /><br />Because of my great fondness for ambient/non-traditional music, I had to pick up a copy.  I was not disappointed.  The blending of various concepts in the music - voice, synth, percussion - all lead to a pleasing mix that is soothing and just perfect (at least for me) to read by.<br /><br />Until I got a copy of the soundtrack to Solaris, this was my 'read by it' CD of choice.
B0002IQNAG|2.0|There may have been arguments over watching this movie and I lost miserably. I'd already seen the remake, didn't particularly care that much about seeing the original, but seemed like an appropriate movie to watch in the dark with plenty of alcohol. (And I still needed more) I wanted to watch The Mummy Returns, but I just watched it when I got home. I managed most of this movie, I did close my eyes a couple of times, cos it was really getting that boring. (A trick I perfected during Evil Dead 2, except I kept my eyes closed longer)<br /><br />What didn't I like about this movie? Two main things that spring to mind. The \\"zombies\\" for one. Almost every \\"zombie\\" movie portrays them as almost robotic. Some imagination could be used. Sure, they're the undead, but they're all pretty similar. It's not like Beetlejuice, where this person drowned, or this person got cut in half, or this person smoked too much. The \\"zombies\\" are just splattered with random bits of blood. I'd rather something like Beetlejuice, or where they seem normal until the very last minute. That would be more original.<br /><br />My second problem was the characters. I'm sorry but I did not feel any sympathy for them! Unless you're a very special birthday boy, or Mekhi Phifer, then you don't get any sympathy from me. Sorry characters.<br /><br />The special effects were quite good, considering this was made in the seventies. (Another thing, I rarely like seventies movies apart from Grease, and a couple of others. Give me Halloween and I'll throw it baack in your face) The blood looked slightly dodgy at times, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I've noticed reading a few of the other reviews, they're done by men. I'm female (I can give you someone who can vouch for that). Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much?<br /><br />Watch the remake or Shaun of the Dead. Much, much better.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Wow.  That was my reaction while watching this film.  Filled with Blood and guts and the whole 666 yards.  I was left in a state of shock while watching this film.  Not in the way that I found it revolting (it takes a lot to do that to me)  But I was in this state of mind while watching it.  The best way to describe it I guess would be like playing a really good survival video game running for your life (without actually running) and having a slight adrenaline rush.  As the credits rolled by, I said to myself \\"Whoa...\\".  No film can do this nowadays.  No film can have as much blood as the Evil Dead has and get shown in theaters.  On a friend of mine's copy it says rated R.  On Amazon.com it says NC-17.  On my copy it says NR (Not Rated).   I ordered it from Amazon, so this is probably and error on their part.  Either way, you know you're in for a hell of a ride when/if you check out the Evil Dead.  Definitely not for those with weak stomachs and definitely not for someone who works in the MPAA who wants all movies made for kiddies.  A woman gets raped by a tree for Christ's sake!   <br /> <br />The special features are good (Like the 18 minutes of raw footage), but it appears as though there are more features on the other editions.  One thing that is lacking on all of them (I think) is that there isn't a Within the Woods movie as a special feature.  For those who don't know, Within the Woods was a low budget prequel of sorts to the Evil Dead.  Read more about it (and all of his movies) in Bruce Campbell's autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B movie Actor.  This movie can not be redone in any way shape or form.  <br /> <br /> Notice how there's all the remakes and sequels/prequels nowadays?  If they tried to remake Evil Dead, it would be less gory.  Probably something like 50 percent less and no body fluids (the white stuff) other then blood.  No one can redo this classic and they would fail miserably if they tried.  Well, I hoped this helped.

This fits two of the three and I'm trying to figure out how to fit it into the last.  I think I'm getting closer. <br /> <br />There is no such album as \\"Stabbing Westward\\", even that one good song So Far Away must have been from a soundtrack or something such as that. <br /> <br />Back to where I was, or where I never got, or whatever.

0393035158|2.0|I really enjoyed Harris' critiques of the Big Three (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), but I found his conclusions startling and scary. He suggests that we ought to take action against fundamentalists simply for their beliefs. While I agree that fundamentalists of any stripe are a massive threat to democracy and freedom, the idea of persecuting religious people for their beliefs -- even extremely dangerous ones -- is, to me, a chilling one.
B0000028UK|3.0|Vs. represents to me the most boring of Pearl Jam's records, just because I don't really care that much about many of the songs, especially in the second half of the album.  Most of them are good songs, catchy and all that, but I don't feel that intangable feeling that I do when I listen to some of their later stuff.  Maybe I just don't express myself all that well, you've probably picked that up from reading my reviews, if you have bothered to read them. <br /> <br />Unless I'm being self-efacing.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I am.... Not a huge Star Wars fan. Far from one. I consider the original Star Wars films to be classics, but my knowledge of the Star Wars 'universe' is hardly up to expactations. Even so, I consider Lucas's edits and changes to be offensive. So... All you psychologically abused elitists who rant on about \\"LolO sTOp coMPLainiGn StAr WErs NerdS\\" can be quiet. <br /> <br />As one 'genius' raves, \\"GORGE LOOKAS HAS TEH ARTISTIC FREEDOM!!

He has the right to make his movies crap, and we, the consumers, have the right to state the fact that these new 'special editions' ARE crap.  <br />Everyone I've seen ranting on about 'artistic freedom' completely miss the point, because they're too busy consuming Lucas's half-*ssed edited garbage. <br /> <br />Overall, Lucas is an egomaniacal hack who refuses to put in minimal effort to please his REAL fans.. Instead, he'd rather advertise his terrible prequels in the context of once-great films, and edit \\"ADULFT CONTENTW@1\\". <br /> <br />Absolutely terrible. I hope stuck-up directors who respect themselves more than their real fans are in the minority. I'd give this a zero if I could.
B00005B36H|5.0|I once heard something about Tool that gave me a sorta new perspective.  Someone somewhere (coulda been the radio or from a friend) asked about a Tool Greatest Hits record, and the response I heard from someone else was if you want a greatest hits by Tool, go buy all their albums and listen to all of their songs and you'll have your greatest hits.  Simple.  Takes a lot of time, but what's a weekend for other than to waste a lot of time.  Go try it, you have nothing to lose except your hard earned money. <br /> <br />I don't want to go and try to review all of their stuff, so I'll just say that everything thus far has been golden.  So if you are interested in trying them out, do what I always suggest and start from the beginning and work your way to the present.  Its a good time and its worth your cash, or somebody else's, whatever your case may be. <br /> <br />Have I led you wrong yet?  I think not.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day has finally matured in their music writing and execution, the album shows a new level of maturity in their music.
B000002BYD|4.0|Yield is the enigmatic album from Pearl Jam.  Do I love it or do I just like it.  Well, I guess its both.  I like the first song (Brain of J), I kinda but not really like faithfull, feel about the same about No Way, but then, ah yes, right in a row we get Given to Fly, Wishlist, Pilate and Do the Evolution.  Then the untitled, and then I kinda like MFC, but I really like Low Light and In Hiding.  The last two songs I just plain haven't really gotten into yet, probably haven't given them as much of a chance as I could, but I never seem to find the time.  Oh well, no time like the present I guess.
B0002IU988|4.0|I have read several reviews where people say that Alter Bridge are not that much different to Creed, but I could not disagree more. Firstly, the vocals are very different to what Creed delivered, secondly, the lyrics are very much unlike what Creeds were and lastly the guitar work and music is much more mature, faster and edgy than on any Creed album. <br />Mark Tremonti is unbelievable on guitar on this album and anyone who has an interest in guitar should pick this album up solely for this reason, the solo's are fast and very 'Vai-esque' in places but the inclusion of warm acoustic picking intros are a nice polar to the soaring solos. <br />However I did not give this album full marks because not every song was of the same quality as 'Find The Real', 'One Day Remains' and 'Burn It Down'. On the contrary to what most people say I feel that 'Open Your Eyes' is one of the poorer songs on this record. <br />Overall, this album is very much so a rock album and one that will please any rock music fan. It is a CD which all songs are solid and you wont feel the urge to ever press \\"track skip\\" when you listen to this album first time around.
B00004T8RK|4.0|This album seems to suffer from the same problem as Yield.  I really don't like the first three songs, although Evacuation isn't too bad.  But then you get Light Years, Nothing as It Seems, Thin Air, Insignificance, and Of the Girl (which is probably my favorite).  Then, eh, I guess I just don't have time again.  Oh well, no time like the present I guess. <br /> <br />Soon the present will be the past and the future with be the present.  Check in, maybe I'll change my mind and say this blows the rest of 'em out of the water.  But I doubt it.  However, even if you are an ignorant jerk like me about what's good and what's not (could I be wrong?), the 5 songs listed above are worth enough for the price of admission, but maybe you'll want to try to find a used copy of this.  I don't say its the worst because I really, really really like those five songs, but its far from the best.  And no, I'm not going to review Riot Act, haven't gotten around to getting it yet.  Money's tight, probably from buying too many darned cd's over the years.  Once again, my fault. <br /> <br />Sigh.
B00000K31Q|4.0|This movie is one of the better teen movies that have been made.<br /><br />Inside of people trying to change others to conform we have a lead character with some spunk and a 'take me as I am' attitude which is refreshing.<br /><br />It has the normal teenage theme of romance with the wrong kind of person but is still one of my favourites.<br /><br />Parent note: no offensive language - something which isn't that common anymore.
B000002BFZ|5.0|If Vitalogy was my favorite, then this is Favorite pt. 2.  Don't really care for I'm open, but it still sounds nice so not much of a complaint there.  I know this is probably a controversial release as far as how good it is in some reviewer's minds, especially those who still love Ten more than life itself, but I've gotta say that I think I'm on the right side of this one, but hey, I've been wrong before, I was one of the three people who watched that show Skin on Fox last fall.  Anyway, enough about me and my stupidity.  Who You Are was the lead single and I was unimpressed after my first listen.  I later got this album as a gift with no intention of buying it myself, and I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a whirl.  Like Vitalogy, it took some time and a lot of patience to keep me from pushing it to the back. <br /> <br />Why didn't I, you might ask.  Because I sensed something there.  I wanted to like it as much as I did Vitalogy.  So I stuck at it.  Over time, it would begin to grow on me one song at a time.  I think though that one must be more mature to fully enjoy and comprehend this.  Everyone can enjoy the simple heartbreak on Black or the angst in a song such a Jeremy.  But it takes more complex thought, and more perspetive, to see the beauty of this.  I think falling in love helps you see it.  A great example is the final song, Around the Bend.  On first listen, too damn soft, I had outgrown lullabyes.  But today it means more to me than it ever did when I was younger. <br /> <br />There are still the complementary rockers such as Hail, Hail which might be the best song on the album, and Habit which is a breakneck, rousing adventure.  Off He Goes is a morose track with a nice piano under the acoustic guitar.  The weakest songs are I'm Open and Present Tense, but even they are listenable.  I can find nothing on this record that is UNGODLY BAD while much of it is simply great. <br /> <br />You want my advice?  I know you do, just admit it.  Get PJ's albums in chronological order.  Begin with Ten and work your way through time.  See the bands progression from what was expected to be an arena rock band to what they are today, the only pure ROCK band left.  Not metal, not hardcore, none of this new-metal crap.  Just plain old-fashioned rock and roll, the kind that seemed to die years ago but is still alive and kicking on these albums.
B00028HBKC|1.0|This movie was too violent for me,it felt more like a snuff film than a religious experience. I didn't even actually watch most of it. That said, the violence isn't the only reason I didn't like this film; Mel Gibson completely abandoned the general rules of story telling with this one. The characters weren't developed, or even introduced in some cases, if I hadn't read about the movie and the role of the devil before going to see it, I wouldn't have had a clue about the sexually ambiguous character who popped up at odd moments,and unless you're a person who has heard the story over and over again in church every Easter, the motives of these characters were a mystery. And even to those people it might not be entirely clear, as Mr. Gibson has chosen the old version of the bible as his source material. I only knew what some of the more obscure references were because of recently taken renaissance art classes. There were historical inaccuracies, but what costume drama doesn't have these, so these didn't bother me too much. Don't bother trying to recall those dim memories of the stations of the cross either, Jesus falls so many times you would swear Mr. Gibson was showing us the same footage over and over again.   <br />Basically, the movie left me feeling sick to my stomach and wanting nothing to do with  Mr. Gibson's (who it turns out, really is a violent old dinosaur) Christianity. Maybe if it hadn't been so relentlessly brutal, maybe if there had been more than five minutes of Jesus' message, even the five seconds of the ressurection at the end seemed tacked on like an afterthought, than it would be more palatable.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This, along with one other album, which you will have to read the rest of my Pearl Jam reviews to discover, are my favorites.  If there is any complaint to be made about it, its the 4 stupid experimental tracks that are useless: Pry, to, Bugs, Aye Davanita, and Stupid Mop (a fitting shorthand title).  However, Last Exit and Spin the Black Circle are great thrashers to start out the album, Not for You and Tremor Christ are great, slow building chunkers that upon reaching their climax are incredibly moving, the two ballads Nothingman and Better Man represent their best softer side, Satan's Bed and Whipping are nice rockers, especially the former with a little jazzy tint to it.  Then there are Corduroy and Immortality, possibly my two favorite PJ songs to date.  I can't say much more about this that hasn't been said, but I guess you either really love it or really hate it.  It took me awhile to get into it, but once I did, I found it to be one of the most rewarding records I have yet to find. <br /> <br />Certainly I would never recommend it to a new PJ fan; go get Ten and Vs. first, but after growing tired of those all too quickly, hold on to your hats because the best is yet to come.  Read the packaging while listening to it too, it certainly adds to the enjoyment.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|At first glance at the cover the style of animation put me off a little, but please don't let that stop you!  <br />This is a wonderful movie.  The characters are stunningly well crafted and real and the story is fascinating and fun. Funny, sad, wise, madcap, by turns this movie makes you smile and get weepy, it thrills, worries and surprises you. Seriously! I totally love the story and the ending is brilliant. <br />Give this movie a try, you will totally not regret it! <br /> <br />Synopsis: Three homeless people in Tokyo - Hana (a wonderful transvestite)Gin (a protective soul) and 16 year old Miyuki find a baby in the trash on Christmas Eve. Gin and Miyuki are prosaic and want to take her to the police but sentimnental Hana (abandoned himself as a child) wants to find her family. Along the way little Kiyoko seems surrounded by coincidences and almost miracles as her new friends find her home! <br />
B0000027RL|3.0|First album I bought, first (and still the only) one I despised.  It is a little better, however, in some respects than Vs. which I find to be their worst, but this album gets on my nerves just because its so overplayed. Now I'm no indie or underground fan, but I do believe in some sense of moderation on the radio, and playing the same three songs from one band every day 13 years after it was released is going overboard. Sure they are good songs, but there are, in my opinion, better songs than Jeremy, Alive or Even Flow on this album.    What are the highlights then, since there must be some. After all, I did give it three stars. Well, Black, no matter how often I hear it, is still one of the most beautiful songs I have heard, and it still breaks my heart to hear it. It got me through some lonely nights at a younger age, so it gets that credit. Once and Why Go are wonderful rockers with plenty of testosterone for everybody. And Garden is probably the moodiest on the album; listening to it and some of Pearl Jam's newer releases causes my head to spin believing that this is the same band. Anyways, certainly get it if you are new to Pearl Jam. Its a good album, but after you get it, be prepared because you will hear it just about every day on the radio.
B0002Y4TZG|3.0|I was quite disappointed by this. The original album is amazing. The added bonuses do nothing to enhance the experience. The DVD interviews are just recycled from the \\"Westway to the World\\" DVD, except for those with Kosmo Vinyl. The Vanilla Tapes are just rough, rough demos. Interesting to hear, but be honest, how many times are you actually going to listen to them?  Due to the fact that there aren't any new interviews with Jonesy, Simmo, or Topper, I'm lead to believe that this was just a way for Sony to cash in on the 25th anniversary. VFM goes out the window. Definitely not worth the price. Stick with the plain Jane version, unless you're an EXTREME Clash fan.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|This movie was a huge letdown after all the hype about it. It's  predictable and the story line isn't all that great.  Also it wasn't really scary.  After struggling to stay awake, I fell asleep watching it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|While it's probably true that these films are not improved over their theatrical originals by the tweakings and additions George Lucas has made, including those done for the 1997 twentieth anniversary theatrical re-release, the changes are minor in comparison to the stunning beauty of these DVDs, their rich color and unprecedented sharpness of image.  Forget VHS, even if the \\"real\\" Han does shoot first on your old tape.  I've seen Star Wars a gazillion times, but the best time of all, barring only the first time, was watching these DVDs.  Maybe it's true that a better DVD set is in the offing for 2006, or whenever.  But I was 30 in 1977 (though I became a small boy again for two hours that day in the theater).  Who knows if I'll live to 2006?  Grab them and enjoy them while you can.
B000002U82|5.0|The Dark Side of the Moon has great sounding tracks from start to finish.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|VAN HELSING, though a tadbit weak in storyline, is a great popcorn fun fest that is sure to please action/adventure fans. <br /> <br />Full of hair-raising special effects, Van Helsing is fast-paced and fun to watch.  But the weaknesses were mainly semi-weak plot with Dracula being portrayed by a B-movie actor.   <br /> <br />But I'll be buying it mainly because I dig Hugh Jackman and Stephen Sommer's style of movie making.  I hope he just get's grittier stuff than the Mummy type movies.  I liked Van Helsing better than the Mummy movies myself, because the look of this film and it's pacing were excellent. <br /> <br />Great mix of horror characters.  I will be looking forward to his next endeavor in films...
B00005JMAH|5.0|I hear complaints everywhere; 'the plot changed' 'My faborite scenes missing' and so on.  As I have not read the book, and probably won't read in the future, I just don't know whether these dissatisfied voices can be justified, or not.  I just want to fill in my commentary as someone who loves films, and I say, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' far exceeded my expectations.  It shows more sinister aspect of magics, darker side of it, and moreover, the three centeral characters are no longer kids, who act and speak on the same level as the adults.  That last thing never happened in the previous ones. <br /> <br />As many reviewers have already made good points about the story, I only write this -- Gary Oldman (who hadn't made a good film these days) is the titular 'Prisoner' Sirius Black who is said to be very dangerous; so dangerous that the Ministry of Magic says no one should try to catch him.  But of course, he comes to Hogworth, where Harry studies with Ron and Hermioni. <br /> <br />Some of the best actors from UK joined the cast -- besides Oldman, you see David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Julie Christie, and Timothy Spall.  But the last two don't have much to do -- perhaps, we should wait for the next time. <br /> <br />The greatest asset of the thrid film of 'Harry' is the production designs by Stuart Craig (who also did the job for the other Harry Potter films).  The school is no longer a British public school made in a big castle with a slight Gothic touch.  Now it is Gothic itself.  The film shows the buildings with the more elaborate interiors.   The sense of space is emphasised with extensive descriptions about the lake and woods surrounded by the mountains, and in this way the school gives another aspect of it -- very isolated place where anything evil and dark can happen.  This new vision is due to Alfonso Cuaron's imagination, which could have never been found in Chris Columbus. <br /> <br />Some characters are given too short time (especially Ron), and the story gets confused a little at the end.  But the characters themselves show the definite sign of growth -- mentally, and physically.  Look at Emma Watson as Hermioni who now wears jeans. <br /> <br />Small fries might find it too scary, and the story hard to follow, but for adults this 'Azkaban' is a welcome change of pace for 'Harry Potter' series, especially if, like me, love the darker side of the characters and story.
B00003CXCT|3.0|The first thing you will notice on this boxed set is that there is no mention of \\"Special Edition\\" anywhere. But these are. I was never a big fan of the SE versions, as I grew up with the originals. But so be it. I can't understand all these people on both sides cursing at each other- what is this? Politics? Everyone seems to think Lucas is some sort of genius, but if you look at he ideas presented in the films, you can see he took ideas from all across the map. He took from Doc Smith's Lensman books, Samurai movies, Kurosawa, followed Joseph Cambell's works to the letter. He even used ideas and dialogue from \\"The Dam Busters\\" a film about WWll.(Look it up!) Sequences like the trench, bombing runs at low altitude, and even some of the dialogue from that movie were almost verbatim! One pilot even says to the other  \\"How many guns do you think...?\\"  The other responds  \\"I'd say about 10 guns- some in the field and some on the tower!\\" If that's not plagiarism, i don't know what is. Anyway, apart from stealing ideas from all over, he did make a wonderful movie- in 1977. The special editions are a little too much for my tastes, (I feel there are way too many CGI effects nowadays. What happened to the slight- of-hand and tricking the eye- it gave more realism. You looked at it and said- How'd they do that? Now everything is in your face and obvious.) and I do look at the original Laserdisc versions from time to time, But I did buy this because I was terminally curious. I had hoped to see some of the cut scenes form the original in the special features, particularly the Anchorhead scenes, but there are none. The 4th disc really isn't that interesting, with some of the material already having been released before. I probably won't view the documentary again. The films themselves seem a little darker than before, and the colors seem stronger. That's a plus, but you can see easily that they were all digitally enhanced. 3Po has a fuzzy halo around him in the desert scenes! Some things appear blue when they shouldn't be (The escape pod lid, etc.) The stuff that was added for this release, I'm not sure of. I don't get the Hayden image superimposed onto Sebastian Shaws' image at the end. He was redeemed as an old man, right? How come Yoda doesn't look young or Obi-Wan. I'm not trying to nit-pick, I just want an explanation why. It doesn't make sense to me. At least make Christensen look like an old man there. Will Lucas redub all of the stormtroopers' dialogue with an Australian accent once it's revealed that they are all clones of Jango Fett, too? Anyway, yes, this will make more sense if you view them 1 thru 6, and I guess it will be more seamless. With the dialogue between Vder and the Emperor changed, it presents a softer, lighter Vader than ep 4, rather than the original megalomaniac we all thought he was. In the new version of Empire, he seems to want to protect Luke from being killed. The revamped Jabba in ep4 looks more like the one from ep 1 rather than from Jedi. This seems strange because there are about 20 some odd years between ep1 and ep4 but maybe only 1 year max between ep 4 and 6. Did he change that much in 1 year where there is no change in 20 yrs? The puppet looked better anyway. Anyway I can't tell you or George Lucas what to do, so buy it if you want or don't. I don't believe the nonsense about those are his films, he can do what he wants. I don't believe that is entirely true. Once he showed them to the paying public starting in 1977, they became part of the public consciousness, and part of all our youths. Yes, they are not he same films from when I was 9 years old, and would prefer both to be released, but whatever. I'm not 9 anymore, and so what. Yes I lived and breathed Star Wars when i was ages 9 thru 12, but you know what they say- You can't go home again. Oh, well.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Cyndi Lauper, Chunk, and some deformed freak.  This movie is so corny it will make you laugh.  Don't expect academy awards, just good, clean, sunday afternoon fun for the whole family.  With a little teen age skin thrown in to keep the ticket sales up.  It was the 80's don't forget.  Have fun, make some pop corn, and watch Gonnies with the kids.  It sure beats Fear Factor!! <br />
0930289234|5.0|I first read it at 15 years old when it first came out - and i loved it for its ground-breaking and innovative aspect, at a time of stereotyped single-minded super-heroes.<br /><br />I read it again as a mature man and still liked it very very much - but now im able to understand the whole phylosophical theme and political critics, the deep psychological analysis of men and society - and the story is still the great sci-fi thriller that kept my full attention as a teenager.<br /><br />A must read for anyone serious about comics - it changed my perception of adult comic book potential impact - Watchmen can be an artwork as truly inspiring and disturbing as a picasso or dali picture, a chaplin movie or a Dante book.
B00005JN7O|4.0|No one needs to be told that the effects are stunning. It is equally obvious that the story does not live up to the gradeur of the visuals. There, we've dealt with its strengths and weaknesses. Except for one thing. Its not SUPPOSED to be the most intricate and complex story ever to hit the screen. Its an incredibly deft homage to the serials of the 1930s and 40's. It succeeds admirably. <br />     It's unfair to accuse \\"Sky Captain\\" of placing style over substance when style and substance work in pitch perfect harmony. Did anyone go into \\"Sky Captain\\" expecting more story than what was there? Furthermore, wouldn't narrative complexity have detracted from the sense of adventure that pervades EVERY FRAME? I think so. If you disagree, and believe as I usually do that substance should never be subordinate to style, even if that subordination serves a valid purpose, then consider this a warning and stay away. If however, you are willing to trust me and believe me when I say that the somewhat hokey storyline actually serves to enhance the film, you will not be disappointed.
B000002N2N|5.0|This CD is full of vibrant music.  The Ramones, at thier high, were one of the best bands ever.  The CD is a great deal its cheaper in price and richer in music.  This Cd is a must have for all Ramone fans.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Today (9/21/04) is the release of Green Day's new 'do or die' album called, American Idiot. The single (American Idiot) from the album, 'Idiot', has been getting heavy TV and radio rotation, and I think deservedly so.  <br /> <br />Green Day has been around for a pretty good while, over a decade, and people seem to have sort of chalked them up as a one-album-wonder. However, I think they have been vastly misunderstood since Dookie, and they have actually been maturing ever since. The new album is supposed to be a punk rock roots type of album, complete with crunchy guitars, (less cranky) vocals, and a political agenda.  <br /> <br />I anxiously awaited the release of this CD, and bought it on the iTunes Music Store as soon as I could. I've always liked Green Day, and ever since the new single I've been re-listening to their stuff and I just still really love it.  <br /> <br />The CD got a very good review from Rolling Stone (though that doesnt mean too much) and something I thought was cool is that the album is 57 minutes long, not bad for \\"punk rock.\\" There are two 9 minute tracks on the album, which is even more curious than the album length itself, as well as what Rolling Stone calls, \\"a more mature song in the style of Good Riddance (time of your life), called Wake Me Up When September Ends.\\" It also contains some very different stuff than Green Day fans will be used to hearing.  <br /> <br />Rolling Stone wonders whether it was necessary for Green Day to have to preach about the media, George W, and terrorism, considering that's kind of been done. I agree that those topics are getting repetitive in music, but they found a niche and did it in an interesting way.  <br /> <br />I am not a Democrat, and I do not agree with their dubious labeling of W as the American Idiot, I just love the music and enjoy it for what it is; fun, sometimes overkill, catchy, and just very enjoyable. I think that's how people have to take music. Like Alice Cooper was quoted saying, \\"Ifyou decide who to vote for based on what you hear in music, you're a moron. Rock stars are morons, that's why they became rock stars in the first place.\\" <br /> <br />I think Green Day still has something left to contribute to the music scene, even if you do not consider them originals, they are one of the most influential bands after Nirvana in the 1990's. Their catchy melodies, tongue in cheek lyrics, and signature guitars make them always a fun listen. They are true punk revivalists. <br /> <br />Hopefully Billie Joe has more great work left in him, after this record is played out, and hopefully it doesnt take them 4 more years to unveil new material. Punk Revivalist fans everywhere should take notice, because I think this album will have chart dominating potential. If nothing else, it gives Green Day a new lease on life and shows that even in their 30's they can rock with today's \\"hip\\" crowd, as much as they did a decade ago with Dookie.
0671015206|5.0|If someone asked you to pick a millionaire out of a crowd, how would you identify him?  Would you look for expensive clothes, jewelry, late model foreign luxury cars, a big house in a posh neighborhood, all the \\"toys\\"?  Guess again.<br /><br />In this high-consumption society, many have bought into the lie that we must look the part before we can afford it.  Just because someone looks the part, doesn't mean that they have accumulated any significant wealth.  Rather, it could very likely mean that they are spending far beyond their means.<br /><br />One of the key messages in this book is that wealth and income are not the same.  It's not how much you make - or spend - that is important, but rather how much you keep.  Authors Stanley and Danko's research reveal how a large portion of society is setting itself up for financial ruin, all in the name of social status.  They paint a profile of what a real millionaire looks like -- and it will probably surprise you.<br /><br />Successful wealth builders value financial independence over social status.  They live well below their means.  The life of a millionaire is not the life today's media would have you believe.  It is a life of sacrifice and discipline.  It is a life of hard work.  Many millionaires own their own businesses, drive modest vehicles and live in modest homes.<br /><br />This book is a much-needed wake up call for all of us who have been seduced by the media's idea of the \\"millionaire lifestyle\\".  It's time to break the conditioning and realize that financial independence is available to all -- it just comes in an unexpected package.  Would you rather look like a millionaire, or be one?  The Millionaire Next Door reveals what it takes to be one.  The choice is up to you.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory

Does this mean we have to fight?\\" - Selena Kyle & Bruce Wayne celebrate Christmas a little early, by unmasking each other in \\"Batman Returns\\"<br /><br />Michael Keaton returns as The Dark knight, with Tim Burton at the helm, directing the more gothic and darker second installment to the \\"Batman\\" quadrilogy simply titled \\"Batman Returns\\". I give the film four stars, but, it just made the cut.<br /><br />Even as Gotham City celebrates the holiday season, crime doesn't take a vacation. Batman goes up against two villians in \\"Returns\\".<br /><br />After blackmailing Gotham's most corrupt businessman & socialite, Max Shreck, The Penguin rears his ugly head (& flippers) trying to fit in with society, by trying to impeach the mayor and running for the position, while, winning over the citizens of Gotham City. But, the birdman has a more secretive, darker plan in store for the city & its children.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Max Shreck has problems of his own. After his new mousy secretary, Selina Kyle, uncovers a plan to control all the energy being generated through Gotham City, he decides to terminate her by pushing her out the top window of his own company tower. But, due to some bizarre feline circumstances she survives & becomes a lot more \\"yummier\\" as Catwoman.<br /><br />With Gotham City once again in danger, it looks like Batman won't be having a very Merry Christmas.<br /><br />A lot darker in tone than 1989's \\"Batman\\", \\"Batman Returns\\" is a somber film that takes itself a bit too seriously (I always wondered if this film hit too close to home with Burton). The cast is the best out of all four \\"Bat\\" films. Devito was born to play the role of The Penguin. Keaton is great as Batman, but is too brooding as Bruce Wayne (we first see Wayne sitting in a chair in a darkened room, in Wayne Manor, doing his best impersonation of \\"The Thinker\\", when the bat-signal streams into the room. Your parents are dead - get over it already!). Michelle Pfeifer is just the p*ssy this film needs as she gives a great, sexy performance as Catwoman. Christopher Walken gives the film a boost as the menacing, Max Shreck.<br /><br />All the bat-gadgets are back with a few new cool ones thrown in (the bat-glider was cool), but, the sets are what give the film its downfall. There aren't that many and it seems like the same sets are used over and over and over again. It reminded too much of the Kenner playsets you can buy at the store for twenty bucks (action figures not included). It seems there were, all total, 6 to 8 sets used for the film.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's score to \\"Batman Returns\\" is decent at best using only the main theme from the previous film & using original material for this installment (the results are a mixed bag).<br /><br />The film isn't bad, but, I've watched this a few times over the years and with the new crop of comic book films coming out (\\"Spider-Man\\", \\"X-Men\\", etc.) this film looks like it needed a shot in the arm. For me, the film stays at a certain somber level thru out the course of the film only waking up during the action scenes.<br /><br />The DVD definitely needs a much needed Special Edition kick in the ass. The audio is the standard Dolby Surround with no special features at all. Nothing. \\"Warner Bros.\\" what the hell are you waiting for?!?!onation of \\"The Thinker\\", when the bat-signal streams into the room. Your parents are dead - get over it already!).

It seems there were, all total, 6 to 8 sets used for the film.  <br /> <br />Danny Elfman's score to \\"Batman Returns\\" is decent at best using only the main theme from the previous film & using original material for this installment (the results are a mixed bag).  <br /> <br />The film isn't bad, but, I've watched this a few times over the years and with the new crop of comic book films coming out (\\"Spider-Man\\", \\"X-Men\\", etc.) this film looks like it needed a shot in the arm. For me, the film stays at a certain somber level thru out the course of the film only waking up during the action scenes.   <br /> <br />The DVD definitely needs a much needed Special Edition kick in the ass. The audio is the standard Dolby Surround with no special features at all. Nothing. \\"Warner Bros.\\" what the hell are you waiting for?!?!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Did anyone notice when Obi-Wan and Vader are fighting that Obi-Wan's Lightsaber turns Purple at one point? And what's with those flashes of green during the lightsaber duel? They can clean up the whole movie making it look like it was made yesterday but they couldn't fix this?<br /><br />What's up with the Tie Fight scene after they escape the Death Star? What's with those boxes of miss-matched black surrounding the Tie Fights? The rest of the space action was excellent, but you couldn't fix this?<br /><br />What's up with the sound? Throughout most of the movie the sound rocks, but that scenes where the sound is horrible. In the final Death Star battle, remember those glorious horns that kick in as the X-wings begin their attack down to the surface? Guess what? You don't hear them anymore. That was actually one of my favorite scenes that's now gone. I don't know about you, but I think the soundtrack is very important!<br /><br />Who did the editing on this DVD? They should be fired!<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the experience of watching A New Hope on DVD. I haven't watched the other two yet...so you may see another comment from me....
B00003CXCT|5.0|\\"I want to learn the ways of \\"The Force\\" & become a Jedi, like my father.\\"<br /><br />\\"Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.\\"<br /><br />\\"You, like your father, are now,... mine.\\"<br /><br />- in \\"Star Wars\\", Luke Skywalker, with the help of his career counselor Obi-Wan Kenobi, picks the path to destiny, while in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", Darth Vader is about to change The Skywalker family photo album forever, making The Emperor underestimate the families bloodline in \\"Return of the Jedi\\"<br /><br />On 9/21/04, \\"The Star Wars Trilogy\\" was finally released on DVD, ending the trilogy's, roughly, eight year reign as the #1 most requested title to be released in the format.<br /><br />The good outweighs the bad in this must own DVD collection (that is, unless your one of those p**sy a*s \\"purists\\" who refuse to buy this. I'll get to you in a moment)<br /><br />  The Good<br /><br />All three films are re-mastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround (no DTS) that should blow you through the back wall of your living room.<br /><br />The films themselves look better than ever, with all the grain, dirt, and blemishes taken out and cleaned up. I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Lucasfilm\\" struck new prints from the negatives to use just for this DVD release.<br /><br />The bonus features are great and well researched. The Ken Burns documentary is fantastic with a lot of archival footage that hasn't seen the light of day until now. The featurettes are decent with George Lucas explaining the genesis of the \\"Star Wars\\" characters, The Birth of the Lightsabre (the three scenes during the credits on this featurette are not to be missed. They are hilarious!) There is also the derogatory featurette on \\"Star Wars\\" & its influence on filmakers. Trailers, T.V. spots, poster ad campaigns, & an extensive photo archive of each film round out the features. There is an easter egg on this fourth disc. Go to the Main Menu and highlight \\"Main Menu\\". Using your DVD remote, type 11 - enter (if done correctly a yellow box will show up to the right of the \\"Main Menu\\". Don't press on that - nothing happens because your not finished yet), then 3 - enter, then 8 - enter. If done correctly, once you press on the yellow box, the DVD should access the DVD credits and a blooper reel from all 3 films.<br /><br />  The Bad<br /><br />There are a few changes, but, nothing catastrophic, in my eyes. In \\"Star Wars\\", Jabba the Hutt looks more like himself (actually he reminds of Francis Ford Coppolla for some reason) getting angry and making a fist, & getting ready to slug Han Solo after stepping on his tail (its a lot better than the '97 Special Edition version).<br /><br />A 27 year old film gaff has been finally taken care of for the DVD edition. Just after the death of Ben Kenobi and Luke blasts the door shut so that Darth Vader and his troops can't get thru, on an older VHS copy, take a look at Vader's lightsabre - its rotoscope white! Its been fixed here to match the classic sabre red.<br /><br />Although, the other three gaffs still remain.<br /><br />1. Notice in the scene where Tarkin & Vader find out that Leia did lie to them about the location of the Rebel Base, Vader's line is \\"I told you she would never conciously betray the Rebellion.\\" Keep your eye on Vader, two beats after he says the line & for no reason at all, he shakes an accusing finger at Tarkin!<br /><br />2. After the boys are caught on The Death Star & are climbing out the concealed compartments of the Millenium Falcon, keep your eye on Kenobi as he struggles to get out of his. Since he can't he nods to someone off stage, but to who?!<br /><br />3.The classic Stormtrooper banging his head on the control room door happens when the troopers break into the locked control room. Keep your eye on the third trooper as he enters. He bangs  his head so hard, its no wonder these guys can't shoot straight!<br /><br />The audio for \\"Star Wars\\" has been changed also. The morning scene where R2 & 3PO arein the sandcrawler arriving at the Skywalker homestead, before 3PO wakes up a snoozing R2, the line \\"We stopped.\\" is inserted before the line \\"Wake up.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Lots of talk about what's good and bad about this 9-disc collection, but the bottom line is that it's the mother-lode for fans of the four movie series.  A couple of versions of each film, directors' and others' commentary, enough feature material to keep you watching for months... what's not to like?  Sure there's some fluff, but this is the greatest multi-movie science fiction/horror series ever made.  The movies are so different from each, it's fascinating to explore the creative processes of each one, and perhaps re-evaluate your own opinions.

But, when The Joker, once a hitman turned ass-clown due to a chemical accident, wants to destroy Gotham City by way of a chemical gas known as Smilex (you literally die laughing) & seeking revenge against the mobsters who set him up, its up to Batman to get the last laugh and rid the city of this original insane clown and his posse.<br /><br />After the rise & fall of the 60's T.V. show with a successfull 1966 film released by 20th Century Fox, it seemed Batman would be forever grounded to the pages of his DC Comic (in the 70's if you wanted a Batman T.V. fix it was either watching reruns of the 60's show or tuning in to ABC on Saturday mornings to watch \\"The Super Friends\\").<br /><br />In the late 80's with \\"Warner Bros.\\" owning the publication rights to all DC Comics, the company decided to take a stab at bringing Batman once again to the big screen.

With Frank Miller's comic mini-series \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" released in 1986, it was only a matter of time before Batman returned to theaters.<br /><br />Die-hard fans were protective of who was to star in the film, however & when, comic actor, Michael Keaton was chosen to star as Batman, fans were pissed, to say the least. Only when the film \\"Clean & Sober\\" was released in theaters, 7 and 1/2 mths. before the release of \\"Batman\\", did some bat-fans relax.

Keaton is good as Bruce Wayne, but doesn't say too much as Batman. Kim Basinger is hot as Vicki Vale. Screen vets Michael Gough & Pat Hingle are great in their roles Alfred Penneyworth and Commissioner Gorden.<br /><br />The sets are monsterous. \\"Star Wars\\" veteran, Billy Dee Williams who plays District Attorney, Harvey Dent in the film has said that the sets for \\"Batman\\" are as big, if not a bit bigger, than the sets used for \\"Empire\\" and \\"Jedi\\". The film, I think, got an Oscar nod for best set design.<br /><br />Danny Elfman gives a memorable score to the film that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />The DVD itself is a bare bones affair with the film both in the widescreen & full screen versions with 5.1 Dolby Digital and no special features.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|It does not surprise me that, even when taking on a new format, Alan Parsons does it better than anyone else in the genre. This work shows his genius in engineering multitextured, thought provoking music, and his talent for surrounding himself with remarkable artists. While fans of AP and APP will miss the rich vocal harmonies and accessible melodies, I hope they will give this CD a listen or two. It's truly remarkable. And,for fans of electronica, it's something not to be missed.
0823003035|5.0|This book is the most comprehensive one I've read to date, along with \\"Keys to Drawing\\". <br />It breaks down Ryder's over-the-top work into a simple drawing process which consists of an envelope (4-5 lines) that encapsulates the form, then a rough block-in to act as the basis for a detailed contour, and then scanning across the form as you start to draw out and push in the shapes themselves, utilising your knowledge of anatomy (which I suggest you get other books for, like Loomis, Villpu, Hogarth, Hale and Bridgeman). <br />You will find alot of valuable info about checking for tilt, relationship of shapes, non-parallelism (i.e. nothing in nature is parallel), behavior of light and shadow, pathways of form, gestural current, etc. <br />There's not much more to say other than, if you have the cash, you probably won't regret spending it on this great assembly of text, pictures and sound advice.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|To answer the question 'Will YOU like THIS movie?' It all boils down to the fact that this is a Bill Murray movie. If you like Murray you WILL like this movie because Murray is Murray regardless of the production he is in. But be forewarned--Cadyshack this is not. Keep in mind you are watching two very bored people try to cope with their situation. If you're looking for something funny Lost in La Mancha might be a better bet.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I've seen this movie twice now, and in the interest of full disclosure, have been a Moore fan since \\"Roger & Me\\". I've seen/read everything he's done-\\"Roger...\\", \\"The Big One\\", \\"Canadian Bacon\\", \\"Bowling for Columbine\\", his TV shows, \\"TV Nation\\", and \\"The Awful Truth\\", and his books, \\"Downsize This!\\", \\"Adventures in a TV Nation\\", \\"Stupid White Men\\", and \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\"-but don't take that to mean I'm a non-critical viewer. <br /> <br />Moore has been known to exaggerate, and some of his stunts come off as more juvenlie than effective, it's true. I'd be the first to admit that. <br /> <br />\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" even contains some of that kind of grandstanding, but not a lot. This movie finds Moore comparatively restrained. He lets his facts and documents speak for themselves, for the most part. Theatrics and confrontational stunts take a back seat here. (Although, the scene of Moore reading the actual text of the USA Patriot Act through the loudspeaker of an ice cream truck on the driveway of Capitol Hill after being told that many members of Congress had simply not read it by a member of the House is particularly choice, and an example of Moore's trademark style being a very effective satirical tool to illustrate his point.)  <br /> <br />But that's the thing about this movie. If even a half...a QUARTER...of the allegations made are true, we already have what John Dean called \\"Worse Than Watergate\\" in his book of that title. And Moore is more than willing to show his sources and back up his factual assertions, leading one to believe that the ratio is far higher than that. <br /> <br />Look at the poor reviews on these boards. The vast majority of them are simple pot-shots. Pure ad hominem, with no real critique of the actual content of the film. The few that do address the contents, and cast them as distortion and flat-out lies, do absolutely nothing to back up their assertions. <br /> <br />What's clear is that Michael Moore loves this country enough to beoutraged, and put his money (and celluloid) where his mouth is when those in power betray it, as he sees it. Last I checked, this is simply participating in the public dialogue at a level he's earnbed with his previous efforts.  The current President is not the institution of the Presidency, George W. Bush is not \\"America\\" and to take issue with the former is not the same as taking issue with the latter.  <br /> <br />As a sidenote, some may take issue with the whopping 10-15 seconds of film which might, to some, give the impression of Iraq under Saddam as being somehow idyllic, but he never says that, or even implies it strongly. Rather, I saw that sequence as a somewhat ham-handed visual depiction of \\"calm before the storm\\", and only the tiniest part of a much larger (and more relevant) whole.  <br /> <br />Don't miss the forest for the trees in evaluating this movie and making up your OWN mind. See this movie and do that.
B000002BPS|5.0|This indeed is the best of the best. Its a mixture of the early offspring era from mixed in with the Americana era. Every song on the cd is amazing. It is rare that you never skip a track when you listen to a cd, this is one of those prodigies. <br />  <br />The cd starts off with a message from Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. It has a great classic offspring guitar line and sarcasm. Perfect for what your about to be exposed to. <br /> <br />This cd is the impediment of greatness. I cannot describe it. You have to find out what its like for yourself. You will really be amazed....
B0000C8AVR|5.0|There are many dividing lines in rock and roll.  Before Elvis and after Elvis, before The Beatles and after The Beatles, and so on.  \\"Highway 61 Revisted\\" invites such a watershed moment in rock and roll.  Prior to the release people such as Steve Allen would gather great laughs just from reciting the lyrics to rock and roll songs.  For example, Steve Allen would read \\"Be bop a lu bop, she's my baby\\", and audiences would guffaw loudly.  When \\"61\\" was released, it was evident that rock and roll had meaning, it was an viable art form.  Dylan's fury and wounded ego can be heard throughout the album snarling and pleading to those seemingly unaffected by the times they lived in.  \\"How does it feel\\", is rock and roll's preeminent and ultimate question.  How DOES it feel?  This album, in my humble opinion, is the greatest rock album ever produced.  Dylan, Bloomfield, and Kooper on organ, transcend popular music and sent it spinning into areas artists are still exploring.  Rock's first great masterpiece and Dylan's ticket to immortality.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I grabbed \\"American Idiot\\" the day it came out, as I've done for all their recordings.  As all the others have said, some songs reflect the maturity of the band, and others, like \\"St. Jimmy\\" and \\"She's A Rebel\\" are vintage Green Day.  I liked their old CD's \\"1039\\" and \\"Kerplunk\\" too, but I'm glad they've moved on.  Those who haven't matured along with the rest of us, like ol' \\"Joseph\\" below, can keep thinking that all bands who get a major label signing have sold out.  Do you think most bands want to stay on an indie label?  So they can make less money and reach fewer fans?  Or because they like the crap production value?  Keep it up, Green Day.
B0000691TJ|5.0|\\"The solution to peace isn't clear,<br /><br />the terrorist threat is a modern fear.\\"<br /><br />No, that's not from a new 2004 song...that was Dee Dee Ramone writing \\"Planet Earth 1988.\\" As he made abundantly clear on \\"Jungle,\\" he was becoming the Ramones' new secret weapon, either penning or co-writing nine tracks on \\"Too Tough To Die.\\" If the heaviness of \\"Mama's Boy\\" or the obvious band statement of the title track didn't get you, then nothing could. Even the obvious bids for radio acceptance, \\"Howling At The Moon\\" and \\"Chasing The Night,\\" were as good as anything from the brilliant \\"Rocket to Russia.\\"<br /><br />Producers Tommy (Ramone) Erdelyi and Ed Stasium probably had a better understanding of a Ramones sound than anyone outside the band, so they fit \\"Too Tough To Die\\" like naturals. Johnny's guitar is prominent, new drummer Richie Ramone gave the band a much needed power shot in the arm. Joey hadn't sounded this committed vocally since \\"End Of The Century.\\" Listen to the way he attacks \\"Mama's Boy\\" and the bonus remake of \\"Street Fighting Man.\\" Even Dee Dee's vocals on his drug addled \\"Wart Hog\\" and \\"Endless vacation\\" added an air of fresh vitality to the band.<br /><br />The Ramones may have been fractious for the previous three albums, but during the sessions for \\"Subterranean Jungle,\\" Dee Dee and Johnny overcame their differences and became friends again. While that didn't save \\"Jungle,\\" it sure did jazz up \\"Too Tough To Die.\\" The most vital of their 80's output, this caught the band at their 10th anniversary and tackling mature issues. \\"Too Tough To Die\\" was the Ramones re-staking their place in the Rock and Roll hierarchy at the time when U2 and the Clash were making commercial inroads and social statements. It remains the last truly classic Ramones album, every bit as essential as those first four albums and proof that punk rock could grow up.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It is rather juvenile to have all the Star Wars fanboys bashing Lucas for tweaking the original trilogy. The newly released versions of these three great films on DVD is simply astounding and beyond my wildest hopes. The restoration is a work of technological genius. <br /> <br />Obviously Star Wars has been a \\"work in progress\\" since 1977. Nobody knew whether Lucas would be able to do any more of these films and so the first one was deliberately set in the middle of the story (at the most exciting part) yet filmed as a \\"one-shot.\\" When it became obvious that the box-office success of the 1977 film would allow Lucas to make two more episodes, he made his first tweak with the original film by rereleasing it in 1979 as \\"Episode IV\\"...nobody complained about that. It was a work in progress and it still is. Though \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was clearly billed as Episode I, most Star Wars fans refused to see it that way but instead looked at it with blinders on. The first part of any story rarely achieves the same level of drama or action as the final parts. <br /> <br />The contention that Lucas couldn't make the films that he envisioned in 1977 is evidenced by the existence of unfinished scenes such as the one from the 1977 film featuring Harrison Ford talking to a non-existent Jabba. The scene was never finished because of costs. Other scenes were not possible because the FX technology simply did not exist, such as depicting Corruscant. Casting Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine in Episode VI was a brilliant decision, and hopefully in Episode III most fans will recognize how brilliant an actor McDiarmid is to have first played a later version of a character, then, as an older man to play an earlier version of that same character. Lastly, some FX shots simply had to be redone. Some people may wince at the additions; I, for one, always winced when they showed the cheesy scene of Alderaan blowing up in 1977. But have you seen it on the 2004 DVD? Wow. <br /> <br />It is simply marvelous to watch \\"A New Hope\\" the way it was originally intended to be shot. And it will be even more incredible to watch all six episodes together when Episode III is completed. To get a feel for what that experience might be like, watch the Larson home scene on the Episode II DVD, and then take a look at the same set as it appears at the beginning of Episode IV on DVD. This will give you a greater appreciation for the level of detail and consistency Lucas is bringing to the entire series. It's marvelous. As for somebody's comment that Darth Vader only appears in two minutes of Episode III, don't you realize how long two minutes is? Watch any Star Wars movie and watch your clock. You'd be amazed at how much story is covered, and how many different characters appear, in just 30 seconds. <br /> <br />I'm already having a greater appreciation for The Phantom Menace now that we have at least 5 episodes presented the way they were meant to be seen, and on DVD in widescreen. The Phantom Menace is a wonderful beginning, visually spectacular. <br /> <br />George Lucas has given us a wonderful, modern mythology. Even Joseph Campbell recognized this fact. Although the mystical elements of Star Wars get overlooked, it's hard to imagine how anyone could not see the analogy between history (or, for that matter, current events) regarding how a Republic turns into an Evil Empire. This compelling epic saga is the brilliant vision of one man...George Lucas. Anybody that can't see this cannot see the forest for the trees. Future generations won't give a crap about what the fanboys here are whining about...they will see all 6 episodes consecutively as they were meant to be shown. <br /> <br />And I'll admit Star Wars is still a work in progress. Something tells me Lucas isn't finished yet. I can't wait until he replaces all those damn Ewoks with more interesting CGE creatures...please!!! Thank you, George!!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is aboslutely the best Green Day album out to date. It's well-edited, the lyrics are thought-provoking and intensely socially conscious. The musicality is top notch, as anyone who has actually seen Green Day live will tell you they are excellent musicians. I love this album and American Idiot is probably my favorite Green Day song already, though some other tracks give it a run for its money. Particularly Jesus of Suburbia and Holiday.
B00003CXCT|5.0|While most of these reviews rave about how great were the \\"old\\" masterpieces,  most miss the point of how awesome this DVD release is. I will elaborate on this below. However, let me start by stating I could not disagree more strongly with the indignant whine: \\"How could [George Lucas] tamper with a masterpiece?\\" `Reviews' of this sort are really not telling us about the DVDs and actually miss the most salient aspects of the movies altogether. Star Wars was a great movie both because of the themes it portrays as well as its characters, which are subtle variations on archetypes, and how they reinforce the movies both dramatically and thematically. The special effects do not define the movies, and unfortunately detracted in some ways from the originals. <br /> <br />My 5-star assessment is based on the following points: <br /> <br />New scenes: Let's face it, the original Star Wars trilogy had a couple of flaws (gasp!) They lacked wide establishment scenes, and the continuity was a bit spotty as some scene changes used gimmicky fades in lieu of more rich representative transition scenes. They also do not integrate that well with the more rich canvas of the episodes 1 and 2. The added scenes for the most fix these issues. They actually help the overall arc of the story by smoothing the pacing and flow of the individual movies while tying together, visually and thematically, episodes 4-6 with 1 and 2. I cite the Sand Crawler drive across the desert or the much reviled new drive into Mos Eisley both in ANH.  <br /> <br />Sound: Puhlease. Listen to one of the lightsaber duels. `Nuff said. The sound remastering is amazing. To get a rough approximation of how the movies would sound, watch one of the old trailers included on the DVD set to see how different the sound and score are in the old format versus the new THX / Digital. <br /> <br />Visuals: The visual remastering is so good; the movie does not look any where near its age. Crisp, clean scenes look as though this flick rolled of the presses in the last year not 25 years ago. From a visual standpoint, these movies stand close to episodes 1-2, which as most know were 100% digital. <br /> <br />Extras: The extras are good but not spectacular. They include a long but not so deep documentary, original trailers, game previews, stills, art, and my favorites: three featurettes, and what is referred to as Episode III preview (this is really a feature on Darth Vader's story arc.) Episodes 1 and 2 extras were as good or better. The reason being is their extras were created during production with the DVD releases in mind. Fans of the Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings DVDs will find these documentaries a little pedestrian. That is not really an indictment of the Star Wars DVDs as much as a credit to the LOTR folks and how high the bar has been raised. <br /> <br />These movies are a must have for fans of the entire story, episodes 1-6. The additions create a much more consistent and cohesive story. And they are just so visually and sonically spectacular.  <br /> <br />If you are a die hard fan of the originals and don't like the recent additions to the ensemble including episodes 1 and 2, the extras will probably frustrate you. So keep watching your worn-out betamax versions. <br />

B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy DVD Collection.  Billed as all three classic movies plus a bonus disc. Not the true classics as first seen in theaters.  In my opinion better.....All the enhanced effects of the (Special Edition)...Plus ADDED FOOTAGE! Yes there is some new content.  10 out of 10.
B0002OERI0|5.0|In this volatile time I just want a cd I can rock out to and feel like getting the anger out.  I've rolled down the windows and blasted this cd as high as the volume goes.  The message of American Idiot is loud and clear and I love it.  I've been waiting for this cd for a while and I haven't been let down.  I love Green Day!
0553260111|5.0|Having seen the movie of the same title and really liking it I decided to try this book.  The movie takes some aspects from the book but both are absolutely different stories.  And as good as the movie was, the book is about 100 times better! <br /> <br />It starts out with some newspaper articles about some assassinations and the hunt for a man named Carlos.  That is just fodder to be stored away till much later in the book.  The story then jumps ahead to a man being shot and falling into the ocean.   He hangs on to some floating debris for life and is fished out unconscious much later by a fishing boat. <br /> <br />The captain of the boat brings the man to a \\"retired\\" doctor working in a small coastal town.  The doctor treats the patient for about 5 months in which we learn that the man has amnesia but has some incredible skills related to fighting and covert military type terminology.  He also had some face altering surgery.  The only clue to the man's identity is a Zurich bank account number that is contained on a piece of mircofilm that was surgically implanted in his hip. <br /> <br />The man makes his way to Zurich after pulling a \\"con\\" on a wealthy aristocrat to obtain money to create a false passport.  He seems to have memories of a hotel so he goes there and is recognized by the concierge who calls him Mr. Bourne.  With a name to go on, he heads to the bank and there learns his full name is Jason Bourne.  What he doesn't know is that his bank account has some special instructions to a network of killers, should anyone try to access it.  From then on Jason is a marked man, with faceless killers coming out of the woodwork after him. <br /> <br />Jason later winds up at a hotel and when he senses men are waiting to get him, he kidnaps a woman (Marie) from the hotel to use as cover.  He ends up keeping Marie to the point where she is also a target for the unknown killers so she is now in it together.  Jason ends up saving Marie twice and she realizes that heis not a crazed kidnapper, but a desperate man trying to save his life.  Marie decides to help Jason regain whatever he can of his memory and put a face to the man who wants him dead.  They piece together that the man is in fact Carlos, the super assassin mentioned at the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />The book is full of all kinds of great escapes and excitement.  It is also extremely interesting the tactics that get used by Jason to act as a \\"chameleon\\" to blend in to any situation and to be able to social engineer information to help explain more about himself and to learn the whereabouts of Carlos. <br /> <br />On top of everything, the covert US government operation that Jason was working for thinks that Jason has turned against them, so they are also trying to kill him.   <br /> <br />This is a massive book that you cannot put down so try to read it on a long weekend that you have little to do!
B000005HLV|2.0|in my eyes mayhem are way over rated. their riffs get boring and albums sound the same. there is plenty of better black metal available, bands that dont repeat the same 4 chords and dont think that unorganized vocals is art.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The few one-star ratings come from brain dead conservatives who have never even listened to this album. By the way, it is \\"buy\\" a CD, not \\"by a CD.\\" Another begs the answer to \\"don't we go to concerts to hear their music?!? Save your political speeches for conventions.\\" Uhhhm, what planet are you from? Most songs have some sort of message buried in the lyrics. What a bunch of tards.
0440237688|4.0|I believe this book is a must-read for everybody.  The background information in the story is very thorough while managing to not be revealing.  By the end of the story pieces of the plot that may have initially seemed jagged fit together and leave you with a powerful message about the superiority of an imperfect world to a perfect one and the tendencies of human nature.  The unfolding of the plot was very well crafted as well as the the conclusion of the story and its illustration of the strength, courage, and humanity each of of us possess.  The result of these constituents is a superior piece of literature and a must-read book for everyone.
B0002S943O|3.0|I have been a long-time Depeche Mode fan. Seeing them in concert the past 3 tours several times each, I was really expecting a lot from this DVD. Although, this DVD is a great documentary of the 'Devotional' period of Depeche Mode, there are a few things that stood out compared to the recent DVD releases from Depeche Mode, including the re-release of 101 on DVD: <br /> <br />1: The picture is very grainy. <br />2: The sound has volume flucuations. <br />3: The sync of audio to video could use some improvement. Although the music/vocal was probably ripped from several concerts, there was not a lot of effort put into syncing them together. There is even parts when Dave is heard singing, but Dave is clearly not singing...   <br /> <br />4: Lack of extra features compared to other Depeche DVDs is a bummer. <br /> <br />The DVD has some things I really do like though, like the live performance of some of my favorite songs, only found here, like \\"Mercy in You\\", and \\"Policy of Truth\\". But, unfortunately, the sound quality is so bad on some of the other songs, that I wanted to skip past them. Listen to \\"Everything Counts\\" on a decent stereo, and the songs instantly turns into something I dont want to hear ever again. Ive gotten so used to the band with a Live Drummer, and considering most of 'Devotional' is a Rock CD, youd expect that at a concert. Instead, more than half the tracks are crappy Midi Drum Machines, which dont mix well with the Live concert element because the Dynamic is completely dropped, and they are recorded straight from the (drum)machine into the board; then released on this DVD. <br /> <br />Overall: To experience a good Depeche Mode Concert, get the latest DVD concert, \\"One Night in Paris\\". You wont regret that.  <br />This DVD is a good timepiece, but not for entertainment purposes; other than to see Dave in his Drug-induced state... <br />

Do you dread EVER having to go back? <br />  <br />Are you simply going through the motions?  <br />Do you feel like you are in a white-collar cubical prison? <br /> <br />Then this movie is for you!  <br />There is lots of understated office humor in this one.   <br />Rating: 5+ stars for all of the office workers in the world - Even if there aren't any additional behind the scenes extras on the DVD <br />This is in my top 5 of all time funniest comedies.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm completely in awe of \\"American Idiot\\". Although it is still very weird to use \\"Green Day\\" and \\"Rock Opera\\" in the same context, they pull it off very nicely. It's impossible to put a label on the album, because all of the songs are so diverse. I mean, it's still Green Day, but the album finds them exploring new ground. \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Saint Jimmy\\", \\"Letterbomb\\" and \\"Holiday\\" are vintage Green Day, while \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", \\"Are We The Waiting\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" are a new sound for the band. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are in another category completely. Both are over nine minutes long and include five different songs. The whole album flows beautifully, and the story is more involved than one might think. Overall, the music is the most anthematic sounding of any Green Day record, and is well worth several listens. SOmething very different, but something increidibly worthwhile.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|What a lineup! This session was a veritable \\"who's-who\\" of what would bloom into the jazz-fusion movement:  Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, John McLaughlin, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Tony Williams, and of course Miles.  But despite that, this is an amazingly spare, peaceful, relaxing album.  It just chugs along on its minimalist but slightly funky track, through two long, mostly improvisational numbers.  Miles and company would soon shake up the music world with his rock/jazz/funk masterpiece, \\"Bitches Brew\\", so this was, in a sense, his warm-up exercise.  But man, what an exercise.  It remains one of the most beautiful jazz sessions ever recorded.  If only it were longer.... (Is that a cue to buy the three-disc \\"Complete In a Silent Way Sessions\\" box set?)
0800177177|3.0|I think the early sequence where Vlad the Impaler strikes the cross with a sword and the cross starts bleeding like crazy happens too fast for my taste.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock has made a smash hit here! This movie shows normal suspence and on the edge of your seat suspence. <br /> <br />This is the plot; when a photographer named L.B. Jeffries has broken his leg, he is confined to a wheelchair and is forced to be in his apartment. For fun, with binoculars and cameras, he watches his neighbors. Every one of his friends,(an old lady named Stella, played by Thelma Ritter, his girlfriend named Lisa Fremont, played by the very glamorious and socialistic Grace Kelly, and his detective friend, played by Wendell Corey)dont agree with him doing this. Then all of a sudden, weird things start going on in the apartment across the courtyard. After a few more clues, Jeffries is sure a jewelry salesman names Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, has murdered his wife. At first nobody believes jeffries, then after seeing some things, they all start to begin to see what might be going on. The  dectective doesn't really think anything is going on until the last part of the movie. When Thorwald finds out that somebody knows that he killed his wife and is watching him, namely Jeffries, Thorwald comes into Jeffries apartment and the last suspence scene of the movie takes place. <br /> <br />The film was released in 1954. It was restored by the same people who restored Vertigo, and my goodness they did a great job. This collector's edition DVD has lots of bonus features that will make you enjoy Rear Window even more.
B00003CXCT|2.0|While the video is better, the color restoration is inconsistent (some things change color, even in the middle of a scene).  Worse, the audio is really bad, especially in some of the dialog scenes in A New Hope.  The noise it so bad in some, it sounds like someone off-camera is using a power saw.  Don't buy this one if you already have the VHS version.  Wait until Lucas actually does a non-half-ass job of restoring these.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I just watched \\"A New Hope\\" and I am so disappointed with the poor quality of the image. Contrast way to high, lack of most image detail & color saturation. Compared to \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" \\"ANH\\" is terrible. \\"ESB\\" looks great though I have not watched \\"Return Of The Jedi\\". I am sure that it will look fine. I would like an explanation from anybody on the poor image quality. Bummed!!! One star for just the fact that I now own all three movies and One star for a poor reproduction. Why?!

B00005JMJG|5.0|My eyes welled up so many times during this movie! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet really had us believing in their love... truly you remember that one love you never got over and it haunts you long after you leave the theater. What person has not had their heart broken and wished so hard that they could forget it ever existed? And in the same way, after we have thought that, haven't we remembered the tried & true: \\"it is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all?\\" Watch this movie... if you have ever loved so hard and never loved that same way again... it hits your heart and stays stuck in your gut.
0156027321|5.0|I originally read Life Of Pi for a Literature class. I expected it to be an excellent book based on the reviews I'd heard, but...  I wasn't prepared for the actual content of this. The general plot revolves around an Indian boy named Pi, who sees no reason why he can't be Hindu, Christian, and Muslim at the same time since he agrees with many of their precepts and sees them as similar. His family owns a zoo, and they sell so they can move to Canada. They set sail on a Japanese boat for North America when the ship sinks. Pi is stranded in a lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangautan, and a tiger. Not only must he survive against the elements of the sea, he also needs to outwit the animals to survive. Soon only Pi and the tiger are left.  While this is an excellent book for readers who enjoy survival stories, there is also a religious backdrop to the story. Yan Martel weaves an unbelievable story but the way it is told it seems so real. In the end the author almost directy asks the reader if they believe the events could ever happen. This then leads to questions about religious belief on things unseen. Its really a thinking reader's book.  This book is well deserving of all the acclaim it gets. Yan Martel tells such a convincing story that the reader has almost no choice but to immediatlly attach themselves to Pi. I have heard that there is a plan to turn this book into a film, directed by M. Night Shaymalyan. If that is true, then that movie will be a huge psychological trip. Try reading this book at least once. You may find yourself going back to it over and over again.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Made obvious by other reviews here, a fragile piece of childhood nostalgia has been utterly disregarded and destroyed by the creator that bestowed it. <br /> <br />Frankly, I lost all hope (pun intended) after Return of the Jedi, so there wasn't much to live up to with this DVD release, my youthful excitement and admiration wholly betrayed by the time ROTJ's end credits rolled back in '83. It was clear by then that Lucas had lost his center and had become an pusillanimous, arrogant megalomaniac, which he holds fast to this day. This is the same guy that made THX-1138 and American Graffiti? George, we hardly knew ye. <br /> <br />Let's consider a few points: <br /> <br />1. Star Wars (one of the worst movie titles ever, by the way; makes Star Trek sound like a William Faulkner title) was a landmark for its time. It hasn't held up very well over the years (nice 70s haircut there, Luke), but should be left alone and appreciated for its time and place, and for restoring the fun and mythology of old cinematic Republic Pictures-style serial storytelling during such a lost and cynical decade.  <br /> <br />George's claims that he didn't have the technology back then to \\"make the films he wanted\\" makes absolutely zero sense when considering his \\"new and improved\\" changes for the money-grabbing theatrical '99 re-release and this so-called official DVD version. For example, if he wanted to emasculate Solo, ruin his character arc, and have Greedo to shoot first (and miss at close range, amazingly) all along, he would have filmed it that way in '77. No special effects required, no CGI needed. Just two guys with prop guns in the middle of a soundstage. Why didn't he? Because Lucas hadn't yet lost his noggin to empty adulation, fame, and fortune, or felt compelled to pander to children as he perceived them (give them more credit than that, please). I'm just glad I secured my DVD copy of American Graffiti before Lucas decides he was too harsh on Terry the Toad and edits out Steve's car getting stolen. <br /> <br />2. The Empire Strikes Back, easily the superior film of the entire series--I won't even qualify the two recent stunningly bad efforts--beautifully combined pathos, darkness, high adventure, mystery, mythology, classic battle sequences, and real character development; they even (barely) pulled off disguising Sesame Street's Grover as a gnarled little condescending Leprechaun-mongoloid Jedi master (wax on, wax off). And Leia is Luke's sister? Whoee! Holy make-it-up-as-you-go-along, George! But OK, we'll go with it, incestual implications aside. But you better justify this later (which he never did). <br /> <br />Glaring story problems notwithstanding, let's now remind ourselves that ol' Geo didn't actually direct ESB--it was helmed by Irv Kirshner. I wonder how Irv feels about Lucas tinkering with his movie. Hm.  <br /> <br />3. Onto Return of the Jedi, where it all went horribly wrong and Madison Avenue took over. I could write ad nauseum (if I haven't already) about the ridiculous plot, character, and stylistic decisions, but I'll only touch on a few unfortunate standouts for those with short attention spans, including myself. Apparently Geo decided to alienate the relatively sophisticated audience of Empire and pander to the lunchpail and paint-by-numbers crowd with Jedi. Let's see... Crack elite stormtroopers with sophisticated miltary weaponry and tactics being thwarted by spear-wielding teddy bears? Nice. (By the way, in the original version, they were supposed to be Wookies. Thanks for your input, Mr. Spielberg.) Vader, arguably the best sci-fi villain ever conceived this side of Ridley's Alien, is reduced a blubbering sap who looks like the bastard brother of Archie Bunker, while David Prowse gets the shaft over an ego rift. How about finally seeing Jabba the Hut? Oy. Pizza-the-Hut in \\"Spaceballs\\" was more menacing, not to mention more interesting. Then there is the ludicrous Emperor-fights-Skywalker outro, where the ol' wizard can't even get his lightning fingers to close the deal. This guy is the personification of the dark side of the Force? Get this geezer some Viagra. \\"Now I'm REALLY going to kill you, Luke! Really, this time, I'm not fooling!. Okay, so I was joking. But this time, I'm not! Take that! No? Ah, this eleventh jolt should work... Darn. Hold a second, don't move...\\" Yawn. And Vader, whose pure evil up until this point would make Asmodeus blush, suddenly sees the light, has an epiphany in 22 seconds, and turns into Albert Schweitzer? Total character and audience betrayal. <br /> <br />The rest is history, and it's not worth mentioning.  <br /> <br />So give it up fanboys and fangirls, save your money or Xmas gift slot and turn your wistful gaze to Mr. Jackson if you want fantasy filmmaking integrity. He's the real New Hope. Despite it's flaws, Lord of the Rings should make George Lucas eat his heart out, if it hasn't shrunken too small to suffice as at least a dry hors d'oeurve.  <br /> <br />Go away, George. Far, far away. And take your Star Wars movies with you.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi is a book about our place in the world as human animals. The plot is simply a literary device designed to reduce this to a manageble size for Martel, so when the lifeboat is cast off we have several categories of animal life aboard, set against the backdrop of the natural world in all its inhospitable beauty. A lot of the reviews below mention (scathingly) the lengths Martel goes to in the early chapters to describe Pi's multiple religious affiliations - whilst I agree that the religious insights aren't particularly deep, I'd argue that they don't really need to be - they're there to make the point that God/spirituality is a part of human experience, whatever his/her/their/its earthly interpretation. I agree that the final 'return to reality' is weak - its almost entirely unnecessary and yes, insultingly simplistic. To leave the reader with a shade of doubt, an inflection, would have served Martel's purpose better. For a book that believes it's firmly un-disney the last 31 pages have an uncomfortable echo of Dorothy's return to Kansas. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Life of Pi not only intends to celebrate man as a spiritual, rational, animal being in the natural world, but also to pay homage to man's fellow animals and our co-dependence in the ongoing struggle for survival. Had Martel chosen a lion rather than a tiger, i'd be humming Elton John right now.  <br /> <br />Lastly, In response to Stephen Schwartz (below) I'd say a) its a bit pretentious to be making any comparisons with Kafka in the first place and b) if comparison is to be made, its that Life of Pi is DELIBERATELY Kafka-lite. All in all though, its mostly just a good yarn - not to be undervalued!
0517548232|5.0|This book is extremely good. Its prose is extraordinarily lucid, its arguments are clear and irrefutable, and its organization and development are superb. <br /> <br />I have only two complaints. First: in the Introduction there are a few thinly veiled and unsupported pot shots taken at major economists with whom Hazlitt disagrees (Keynes). Second: The title of the book is misleading. This book is a polemic and not a survey of the field of economics. <br /> <br />I should also address the very silly criticisms made against this book by some of the other revewiers. Most of these critical reviewers entirely misunderstand the point of the book. The book is intended as a lucid refutation of certain extremely common anti-capitalist economic fallacies. That is all. Thus, criticisms like \\"this book fails to address: game theory, natural monopolies, the pricple-agent problem, labor market friction, some advanced math technique, etc\\" are simply irrelevant. It would be an absurd detour were Hazlitt to address those things when they aren't the topic of his book, and aren't relevant to the fallacies he's refuting. None of the fallacies he refutes use game theory, even if economics in general does. And \\"this book is simple and doesn't advance economics in any way\\" is another ridiculous criticism, because OBVIOUSLY any book entitled \\"[subject] in one lesson\\" or \\"intro to [subject]\\" is not intended to advance the state of the science.  <br /> <br />In its intended purpose, which is to refute certain specific fallacies and in so doing explain a certain kind of thinking, this book succeeds incredibly well. <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|Millions of fans around the world adored his films, bought the toys, made him millions, perhaps billions of dollars. And in return, he takes the original films, butchers them with CGI and scene alterations, then procalims he will NEVER rlease the original films, because to HIM these ARE the originals. What an ass.  <br /> <br />The SE revisions are horrible. In A New Hope Greedo shoots first, making Han look like a pacifist. He was supposed to be a scoundrel who slowly transitions into a good guy. We see Jabba in a pointless conversation, ruining the suspense and tension throughout the 3 films. Originally there was a sense of dread caused by Jabba...who was he? What did he look like. You never saw him until the last film. But now he shows up in the first film like some skinny weakling. Han steps on his tail and he does nothing. The Jabba in the third movie would have thrown him to the Rancor. In Empire, when Luke jumps into the chasm, he screams like a little baby, ruining the powerful moment in which he was supposed to COURAGEOUSLY jump into the chasm rather than join the dark side. The scream only makes sense if he were pushed, but he CHOSE to jump. This was supposed to be the scene where Luke becomes mature, a change in character from when he was a teen on Tatooine. Ruined. In Return of the Jedi we get a horrible musical scene with a thing that looks like the Honeycomb guy singing. Unwatchable. Also, Boba Fett's death is put on the level of a fart joke with Lucas adding a burp in after he is swallowed by the Sarlaac.  <br /> <br />There would be no complaints if he released BOTH and gave the fans a choice which they want to buy. But no. It's his way or nothing. Imagine if this happened with every old film. Dirty Harry could have some CGI explosions, they could update Al Pacino's hair in Scarface, dub dialogue into silent films. Where would it end? Lucas is a one trick pony who got lucky with an idea and now his ego is ruining the franchise that was one the most powerful on the planet.  <br /> <br />Buy the LOTR trilogy instead if you don't have it, or look for some original trilogy bootlegs. Dont give any more money to that bloated ass Lucas. Lucas has been known to be full of crap, so perhaps he will release the originals in a few years to rack up on some more money.

B000002KBU|5.0|This album is never far out of my reach. By many considered Joni's best album and it certainly deserves that title but after Blue, Joni started experimenting more and I consider that period as her best. Still, this is her best folky album with songs that will stick in your head for a long time because they are catchy and the lyrics are just from another dimension. She often told the press that she was really insecure during the recording and everything that she felt that time found it's place on Blue. This is one of those albums that will teach you a good lesson about life and a lot of people use the statement, but everbody should own a copy of Blue. See, an average of five stars, that's not common here!
0440180295|5.0|This must be my all time favorite book. (among many)<br /><br />The story is disjointed, but not jarringly so. Vonnegut starts with the story of why the book is subtitled \\"The Children's Crusade\\", and segways seamlessly into a brief lesson of one of WW II's most shocking and little known occurances.<br /><br />You feel like you are there, a fly on the wall, throughout the many stages of Mr. Billy Pilgrim's (the protagonist's) life.<br /><br />Vonnegut writes with an amazing economy of words, and lesser authors would do in 500 pages what Vonnegut accoplishes in little over 100 pages.<br /><br />I could not put the book down, and re-read my copy so often, it is falling apart.<br /><br />God bless you, Mr. Vonnegut.
B00003CXWV|2.0|This film seemed to drag out for hours and hours.  When you find the occasional high point in this film, where you can be mildly entertianed, it ends to quickly and you are thrust back into the world of monotany that makes up 90 percent of this film.  Johnny Depps acting was good, and his portrayal of the character was good, but this movie just seemed to never go anywhere.  Never exciting, never thrilling, you feel like youre just watching hours worth of random consecutive events of some man's life.  The ending of the movie is heartbreaking, and the message that his father give him becomes cruelly ironic all throughout the film, but i cant give credit to the filmakers for either of those thigns because they were real facts, not anything the directors thought up.  Overall, just plain BLAND
B000059XUP|4.0|I've never seen the original Crow movie, so i can't really have a biased opinion about this movie.  And if people really say this sucks compared to the first Crow, than i'd really like to see the first becusae it must be amazing.  I did have one major problem with this movie, and that was the fact that the villans were just overly-done.  They have such a defined character and everything they do has to reek evil, and it gets to be repetitive the point of nausia.  Other than that, this was a pretty good film.  The dialouge is sparce, making most of the characters rely on their movements and thier looks to give you a feel of whats going on.  Obviously not everyone will like this kind of thing, its rather slow paced, and best for just sitting there and kind of laying around watching it, not really for people into intense action or comedies.
0790729377|5.0|Superb and terrific film about the desperation , the disaffection and bitter loneliness of a disturbed woman with deep inner demons who wished to be loved for a man who never came to her life .<br />Tennesse Williams masterpiece was supported for a very fine cast where everybody were abosultely outstanding . Kim Hunter as the wife , Vivien Leigh as the disturbed woman and Marlon Brando as the macho man in a lonely home with the hopeless and disillusion crossing the emotional borders of their miserable souls . Every one of them hiddes something and nobody is really sure about nothing ; the future is just a sum of equal days where the time does not seem change anything .<br />The bitter metaphor is more than obvious . Brave and incisive film filmed with a resource economy but a powerful message to state . One of the superb masterpieces of the american cinema in that glorious and creative decade .<br />Stella ! is the last scream .
6304493681|5.0|Ghost In The Shell, when it came out, pushed the borders of anime outwards, into true movies, not just long cartoons.  Japan already knew this, but Ghost In The Shell allowed those outside of Japan, who were not already anime fans, to understand this.<br /><br />The artwork was TRULY art, the soundtrack was stunning, and the settings looked like real sets.  The mixture of 3-D and 2-D effects made one sit up and notice, even when on a tiny TV screen.  There was violence, strong language and nudity, treating the story like a mature story.<br /><br />My only complain is that the DVD is made for surround sound, so unless you're wired for it you might miss some of what is said by people off-screen.<br /><br />Otherwise it is almost a perfect DVD, with lots of extras, including a 30 minute making-of-the-movie feature.  A must for fans of the manga and for people who wish to watch Ghost In The Shell 2!<br /><br />Please remember that, while the DVD is not rated (at least mine isn't), that the film is NOT for kids.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I spent years hating this band, until I saw them live. I have all of their albums these days, and I must say if \\"Dookie\\" was the Green Day equivelent to the Beatles \\"Please, Please Me\\" (lots of fun fairly low content) this has to be their \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" album. It's amazing, a semi-concept album with amazing production. The songs flow through eachother but there are some standouts. Personal faves of mine are \\"Whatsername\\", \\"Wake Me When September Ends\\", \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Give Me Novacaine\\". That's not saying much considering at this point the album has only been out for a day. All the songs are solid and it's by far their most consistent record. The political and social based content shows that the band is still on the path to the origins of punk. Very Ramones meets Sex Pistols at times. For me the more drawing material is the personal more rock oriented material. Put this CD in the car and go for an hour long drive somewhere. Trust me, it's a great trip.
B00003CXCT|3.0|As of December 2005, I've now had more than a year to live with this DVD set, and as a longtime \\"Star Wars\\" fan-even if not a rabid one-I find that I'm less forgiving toward the changes George Lucas made to the original trilogy than I was at first. Arguably, it's Lucas' prerogative as the emperor of this particular movie universe to revise his work, although whether he also has the prerogative of basically thumbing his nose at the purists is another matter. But it's not the fact that changes per se were made that bothers me; it's that too many of the revisions are so clumsily managed. The new material is visibly, and sometimes audibly, spliced in, and the seams show-whether it's cluttered and overlong new CGI effects shots that don't match up with what was filmed in 1977, small but nagging changes in the storyline, or additional dialogue that doesn't enhance our understanding of the story. A few of the emendations do represent minor improvements: e.g., the more turbulent motions of the Rebel and Imperial spacecraft in the Death Star shootout that concludes what is now known as \\"Episode IV,\\" and the substitution of the Imperial alphabet in any signage appearing throughout the trilogy. But from the viewpoint of an old-timer, Lucas apparently didn't know when to leave well enough alone, and the movies' rhythms are usually disrupted when either the circa-1997 \\"Special Edition\\" or the circa-2004 DVD changes are incorporated. The thought that Lucas has vetoed the idea of releasing the original versions on disc, and that we'll have to live with these \\"rewrites,\\" does leave a sour aftertaste.    With that said, I don't believe in throwing out the baby with the bathwater: Lucas' fiddling has marred the original trilogy, not ruined it.  On the plus side, the movies look and sound terrific, thanks to painstaking digital remastering (one or two anomalies on the soundtrack of \\"Episode 4\\" notwithstanding). The disc-length documentary on the making of the original trilogy is a major bonus. And after all, we've been waiting years for this trilogy to be issued on DVD. Whether it's the original movies as first seen in theatres 25 years ago or the slightly compromised versions that comprise this DVD set, these remain touchstones of pop culture-and they're a blast to watch. Still, the original \\"Star Wars\\" fan base can be excused for wanting the option of seeing the trilogy as they first encountered it, and excused for thinking Mr. Star Wars is a wee bit arrogant in telling them, \\"No, you can't have it.\\"
6305657947|4.0|After a forgettable debut film also starring Pierce Brosnan, \\"Nomads\\" 1986, director John McTiernan had an incredibly successful trifecta of blockbuster films:  \\"Predator\\" 1987, \\"Die Hard\\" 1988, and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" 1990.  The films that followed were duds by comparison: \\"Medicine Man\\" 1992, \\"The Last Action Hero\\" 1993, \\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\" 1995, \\"The 13th Warrior\\" 1999, and a remake of the James Caan film \\"Rollerball\\" 2002.  In the middle of these films, and released the same year as \\"The 13th Warrior\\" was a remake of a classic called \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\"  Say what you will about the original, there is no denying that it now looks incredibly dated.  This newer version is sleak and sexy.  After so many mediocre films, it seemed that John McTiernan had officially lost his inspiration.  With this version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" he found it again, with particularly large amounts of kudos handed out to cinematographer Tom Priestly who keeps the camera moving left and right, back and forth at different speeds and angles mixed in with tracking shots that keep the movie accelerating constantly forward even at the most relaxed moments in the film.  The script is surprisingly intelligent with a refreshing liason between two attractive middle-aged actors who are both believable in their characters, sharing some phenomenal chemistry besides as actors.  There was a time when I thought John McTiernan was the most under-appreciated director working in Hollywood.  This film reminded me that at one time he had both talent and inspiration.  Hopefully, he becomes equally inspired more often in the future.  Recommended.
B0002QXAD6|5.0|NIGHTWISH,  how do you describe them and their music????  There is none like it in the world today, and there are no musicians like them.  I recently saw them in concert on their \\"TOUR THE WORLD\\" tour in Scotsdale Az.  On stage they have a presence that reaches out and grabs you, not only with the music which is unsurpassed, but just by their precence there. <br />Tarja - The angelic voice that has men crying, you are the most gracious person i have met, thank you for your time. <br /> <br />Marko - My friend, you rock and your humor and energy is unsurpassed.  Your talent is unbeliveable. <br /> <br />Jukka - My Buddy thanks for the time you spent with my daughter and myself, your the greatest, and far as drummers go your the best in the world. <br /> <br />Emppu - Such talent you are a guitar god, there are none better, and such a caring and gracious person. <br /> <br />Tuomas - What can i say your a genius there is no doubt your music comes from your heart and soul. <br /> <br />Their CD ONCE is head and shoulders above anything out there today, and on OCT 5 all of North America will experience the world that is Nightwish,  open the \\"DARK CHEST OF WONDERS\\" and \\"WISH FOR AN ANGEL\\" you won't be disappointed.  Take it from and old metal head NIGHTWISH is on top and will be for a long time

American Idiot 8/10 \\"when i heard this i thought green day like they have always been, the only thing that lowered the score was that i heard it 100 times before the album was released. <br /> <br />2.) Jesus of Surburbia 10/10 \\"a hell of a long time but brillant, this is a work of art, specially when the piano comes in after the first part of the song. it blends together so brillantly, i love this song. its more of a mini musical then a song\\" <br /> <br />3.)

B00028HBKM|5.0|When I put this DVD in the player, I was mesmerized.  I had to go back to the bible to see if he stayed with the facts, and YES HE DID.  It took courage for Mr. Gibson to put money where his mouth is and make this movie.  In doing so, he has made one of the most memorable pictures this year and for years to come.  The cinematography is crisp, gorgeous and the cinematographer should be a shoe in for the Academy Award.  The performances from Jim Caviezl and the woman who played his mother, Mary...no doubt nominations for the Academy Award. <br /> <br />I wondered if it would be anti-semetic and I watch with an open mind and heart and it was not.  What happened to Jesus is what is still happening to humans today.  We turn on each other.  Jesus own turned on him, due to power, and we all know what power does to anyone, can we say corruption?  As for the Romans, the Jews were given a choice and they chose to free Bararabas and cruicify Jesus.  Those people were swayed, and this is still going on today, can we say \\"it was justified to invade Iraq?\\" <br /> <br />This movie needed to be made, because in this time right now we really need to look at ourselves and those around us and say, \\"is all this really worth it?\\"
B000268QB2|5.0|Yep, some of Keane's songs are derivative, but who cares when they're so exquisite? I was introduced to Keane by the video for Somewhere Tom Chaplin's voice does bear a resemblance to Freddie Mercury's on some tracks, although Tom definitely has his own sound. What sets these guys apart is the maturity of their lyrics. Their words are worth listening to.
B00003CXCT|4.0|....that these would be released eventually on DVD (and the my title eludes to what is possibly the worst delivered line in any Star Wars movie).<br /><br />Just releasing these on DVD earns them 4-stars.  It was a no-brainer.  The cleaned up prints are done nicely.  Had they been released seperately, 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' would have been 5-stars each.  It is 'Return of the Jedi' (3 stars at best)that brings my rating down to a 4-star.  'RotJ' has its moments, but it's clearly the weaker of the three.<br /><br />Yes, Lucas continues to tweak at the original releases.  Most of them are fine and not critical to the moderate fan....but even I have a hard time w/the update of Anakin Skywalker one of the final shots on 'Return of the Jedi'.<br /><br />As bad as the acting can be during some shots - it is still not as wooden as Hayden Christensen or poor Natalie Portman in the new trilogy.<br /><br />As for extras, there are a good amount of them.  Not as many as say, 'Lord of the Rings' series - but movies are now made to include these things - 'Star Wars' wasn't made in that era.<br /><br />The teaser for 'Revenge of the Sith' was disappointing at best.  It's not a trailer by any means - mostly Lucas going on and on.  The documentary is pretty good - and wow - there are some BAD auditions for the Star Wars characters (how did Cindy Williams ever get a job?).<br /><br />The best are the trailers for the movies.  HORRID (but in a retrospective amusing way).  Had I seen them in the theatre, I doubt I ever would have thought of going to the actual movies.  Even the 'TESB' and 'RotJ' should have been better to capitalize on the original movie's success - but their trailers were just as bad.<br /><br />Definately worth owning.  No longer the best trilogy on DVD - The 'Lord of the Rings' gets that title.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I think \\"American Idiot\\" is a great listen. With all the garbage that the bands that Green Day spawned(Good Charlote,SUM 41, <br />New Found Glory)& their \\"3 minute recipe\\" for boring pseudo-punk, <br />it was nice to see the old boys(I'm 32 as well as all of Green Day!) churn out a truly inspiring record. Let's face it boys & girls, the kids are allright! Which is what the intention was.... <br />i think. This album is a wink & a nod to The Who & Queen & some of the other more \\"UN-punk\\" influences that Green Day channels. <br />I know a lot of people hate to \\"think\\" about music, but that's <br />not always a good thing.. I mean Billie Joe sites The Clash, The Replacements, The Jam, & Stiff Little fingers as influenes..... <br />not exactly \\"mindless drivel!\\" ... MAll rats.... get over yourself & the fact that this is not \\"Dookie II\\" or for some of the Hipper kids(& they'd be the 1st ones to tell you that!) <br />\\"Kerplunk II\\"  Evolution is natural, in fact it's required by <br />human beings so we don't let the Apes take over the world!!!! <br />Embrace this record!!  It's Bold ! It's Fresh! & NO one else whould even dare to try it!!! So.... What's more Punk rock then that?????? <br />c-ya in the Pit!!! (i just watch now, though!) <br /> <br />
0765301598|4.0|I read the original dune as a kid, & I enjoyed the prequils. However this book seemed disproportional. <br />    I spent most of the book waiting for the title battle. When it finally came, it was less than sixty pages from the end of the book! I enjoyed this book, but it could have been better if divided into two books. The Battle Of Corrin, is excelently written, but the post-war happenings are all compressed into about ten pages. <br />    I recomend this book, but it is not on par with the other five prequils, or Frank Herbert's original works.
B00005JMEW|5.0|She played this movie to the T. Miss she seek revenge throughout the who film. I love the way the film took you backwards and then forward it was great. The music was excellent along with all the fight and cursing. It was all done with class and tastefully .I highly recommend that everyone who loves action grab KILL BILL
B0002OERI0|3.0|It's been almost 15? years since Green Day came out and their music is still solid. 'American Idiot' is a great first track...So why the 3 stars? Well, afterawhile these political albums get annoying, sorry GD. <br /> <br />Be sure to pick up Bonnie McKee's debut album 'Trouble' on the 28th, she's just great ;)
B00028HBKM|5.0|Like it or not it was the truth and Mel Gibson was the only one to put it on screen and he took the HEAT. It was the bible come to life. The truth hurts and people don't want to except the fact that this really took place.I thought the whole movie was excellent maybe one of the best movie I have ever seen. I think we all forget sometimes how Jesus was crucified for our sins but for it to be put on screen should be enough to change someones life.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this album, with some of my favorite songs being Fallen, World On Fire, Stupid, and Train Wreck.  As others have pointed out, this is kind of a sad album lyrically.  Rather than writing frivolous yet fun songs like \\"Ice Cream,\\" Sarah seems to be writing about world affairs (World on Fire) and being heart broken (Fallen, Stupid, Etc.)  The result is a collection of melancholy, but beautifully written and performed songs.  Most of the songs are rather contemplative and quiet, with the exception of Stupid, which actually has some guitar rifts.  This is a satifactory record of quiet, yeat emotional soft pop/rock that I still haven't grown tired of listening to over and over again.
B000066I6N|2.0|I have always looked forward to every new release by Robert Plant, but when I heard Dreamland, I almost broke into tears. It made me realize that larger-than-life music legends like Robert Plant also get older and the years begin to show in their vocals.  Robert sounds very tired and threadbare.  While this album was more \\"accoustic\\" than his other albums over the last ten to twenty years, it did him no favors to go for a more unplugged sound.  He is going to have to rely more upon the magic of the recording studio now in order to remain salable.<br /><br />I am, sadly, not going to keep this CD, and it does very much bother me not to keep one of Robert Plant's works. However this work was a distinct disappointment.
B00003CXCT|5.0|For people who have NEVER seen ANY of the Star Wars films (like my 1 yr old grandson) Lucas's changes have made it possible for newbies to watch the films from the beginning and not be confused (ie, \\"hey grandpa, why does the emperor in The \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" look different from the emperor in \\"Return of the Jedi\\"?)  Without the improvements, future fans of Star Wars would be hopelessly left with films that don't quite fit together in a nice, tidy package.  Kudos to George Lucas for having the guts to make the changes necessary to insure future generations will enjoy this wonderful story. <br /> <br />For those of you too selfish to see the big picture Lucas is trying to paint - GET A LIFE!
B00001NFCY|5.0|when i bought this cd i was VERY impressed. i have had this cd awhile and i still love it. this cd is clean and awesome! here are my personal ratings on all of the songs on the cd in order. <br />#1.Are You Ready?- This is a very heavy rock song and is one of the best on the cd. it gets a 9/10 <br /> <br />#2.What If- THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD AND ONE OF THE BEST THAT THEY HAVE EVER WRITTEN! it is very heavy. 11/10 <br /> <br />#3.Beautiful- it is a little softer but still is very good 9/10 <br /> <br />#4.Say I- another heavy rock song and one of the best on the cd. 10/10 <br /> <br />#5.Wrong Way- This is softer but i still like it. it respectively gets 8/10 <br /> <br />#6.Faceless Man- this is softer too but comes in with 9/10 <br /> <br />#7.Never Die- it is softer to but this one still gets 7/10 <br /> <br />#8.With Arms Wide Open- if you don't already know this song is awesome you should it is softer because it talks about his baby but gets 10/10 <br /> <br />#9.Higher- This is one of my personal favorites this song is a heavy rock song 10/10 <br /> <br />#10.Wash Away Those Years- this is soft and talks about the death of his grandmother. 6/10 <br /> <br />#11.Inside Us All-this is a softer song 6/10 <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I really am clueless at what these clowns are complaining about. I just finished watching the first 2 movies of my new Star Wars collection and am speechless. The changes are minimal and in NO WAY distract or make you feel like youre watching a different version of the movie. The only thing entirely new to this fabulous presentation is the genuine love that went into the time consuming restoration of each and every frame. Don't believe what the critics are saying. If you fail to buy this piece of cinematic history you'll kick yourself in the end. The movies are flawless not even a spec to ruin the overall beauty of this collection. My hats off to George Lucas and his company of fine artisans. I was 20 when the original hit the screens and can tell you, you will not even see the small changes in the first 2. And quality wise, it looks fresher than when it hit the silver screens back in the 70's. The colors are fresh and bright, candy comes to mind when you see the pinks reds blues and violets, the flesh tones are scrumptous, it truly sets the standards for the DVD revolution. As ground breaking as his films were, the restorations to these timless gems are magnificent. And given to you in perfect sound and color for 41 bucks, its insane!!. Only wish the fools that presented \\"THE GODFATHER\\" would have taken their cue from Lucas....BRAVO George Lucas!!! You've done it again!!<br /><br /> As for the third film, I am with the other commentor as to leaving Anakin as he was portrayed in the first rendition, It doesn't feel right, with the more mature Obe W. and Yoda. If there needed to be a change it should have been overall. A younger Yoda, A younger OBE won. But hey thats just my opinion:) Other than that guys ....BUY IT! You wont be disappointed.
0380002930|5.0|\\"Watership Down\\" was Richard Adams' debut novel and was first published in 1972. He originally told it to his children to help pass the time on long car journeys. It won the Guardian Award and the Carnegie Medal in 1973 and is set in Berkshire, where Adams was born in 1920. It is, of course, about rabbits, and was made into an animated film in 1978 - the soundtrack of which featured \\"Bright Eyes\\", by Art Garfunkel.  <br /> <br />The book opens at Sandleford Warren in May, with Hazel, a yearling, and his brother, Fiver, feeding at sunset. Although brothers, the pair are very different. Fiver was the runt of the litter and, as a result, is a lot smaller and much more nervous than his brother. He is, however, also something of a seer and - not long after the book opens - foresees the destruction of their home warren. The pair bring the prophecy to the Threarah, their chief rabbit - who, despite Fiver's success rate, refuses to accept it. The brothers decide to leave anyhow, and mean to bring whoever wishes to come along with them. A number of others join them, including two Owsla members : Silver, a nephew of the Threarah, and Bigwig. Although they have little idea of where they're going, Fiver knows what they should be looking for and have an excellent leader in Hazel. <br /> <br />This book has so much going for it, it's hard to write a review that will do it justice. Bigwig was a great character - an all-action rabbit (yes, really !!) whose name comes from the strange tuft of hair between his ears. However, he's not the only star. Other notable characters include General Woundwort, the leader of another warren and the baddest rabbit in England. (A vicious character, he'd leave your average bunny-boiler with badly burnt fingers and causes our heroes a great deal of trouble). Kehaar, a somewhat foul-mouthed (or is that foul-beaked ?) seagull, provides a certain amount of humour. He also helps the rabbits establish themselves after they arrive at their new home. The story is very engaging and is very well told. Adams explains the way rabbit society is structured, for example, including the role of a Chief Rabbit and his Owsla. As the story progresses, he includes a few words of the rabbits' own language and a few of their myths : these are very much centred on the great rabbit hero, El-ahrairah. An excellent book, and highly recommended. <br />
068987474X|5.0|I went to Barnes and Noble and they were all sold out! Then I went to Borders and there were 4 copies left. I sat down and read all of it in one sitting and when I went to put it back, the other books were GONE! Its an easy read and a slim book but its full of wit and good advice.  <br /> <br />I must say I feel a lot smarter after reading this book and I cant say Im gonna fall for any lame excuses anymore. Its time we stop settling for less and stop feeding ourselves pety excuses for being in mediocre relationships. Or in other words, you get what you \\"settle\\" for ladies. That is of course if the idea of being lonely is a lot worse then being with Mr. Ok  or Mr. He's Good Enough For Now. <br /> <br />This book takes out a lot of the drama in relationships that some of us cant seem to get enough of. But when you see the relationship for what it is (minus the drama)then its really not so bad that \\"Hes just not into you\\" and you can get on with your life. Remember when your standards are classy and respectable then people are going to HAVE to treat you better if they want your attentions. Otherwise, if hes to lazy to treat you fairly or like the saucy vixen you are... then hes not worth it and you shouldnt be that into him.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Being a die-hard Star Wars fan for all the years of my life Ive grown to love the original trilogy and find a special place for it no matter where I was. Being a collector and big movie buff the movies meant a lot to me and when I heard the news that  they were coming out on dvd i flipped out. Very unpatiently waiting for months I realized that the versions to be in the box set were not the originals, but the special edition (or the director's cut). I was never a big fan of George Lucas's directers cut of the 3 classics but I could live with them. Waiting in line at 12 in the morning anxious and excited for these movies was one of the most exciting moments in my Star Wars agenda. Although when I watched the movies for the first time, it was very shocking and disappointing. I would never give a Star Wars movie under a 5 rating (even the new ones which I can't really stand myself) because the movies are a part of me and its hard to say that they are bad. But thanks to the master mind of George Lucas the Star Wars trilogy no longer exists. Numerous scenes and voices have been added for the dvds. No longer does the awesome voice talent of Jeremey Bulloch heard through Boba Fetts helmet in Empire, Naboo and the gungans are at the end of Jedi along with a fruity ewok tribe tune, Jabba was touched up again in both episdoe IV and VI. Ive waited so long to hear my favorite lines of any movie in the world right here on this dvd set, and now thanks to itz creators that will never happen. Hayden C. (yuck) is also taken the place as Anakin at the end of Jedi..totally out of place and makes it look like a whole other movie. On a bright note the fourth disc of special features are amazing. Good care and effort went into collecting some rare and awesome footage for a spectactular bonus disc. The artwork for the individual boxes, and the dvd menus itself are all very similar to the episode I and II dvds and are bad as well..both the cases and menus do not give the feeling of the classics we watched for the past 27 years. I hope George Lucas is recieving all this negative feedback from this cite, the papers and other fans so he can think twice on how he crushed and ruined his biggest supporters.
0312263120|5.0|An excellent novel.  This is the first Dan Brown book I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. <br /> <br />It was well researched, well written, moved quickly, and was difficult to put down.  Interesting characters and plot development.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't buy every Green Day album.  I've never seen them live.  However, I've always appreciated their music.   When I heard about this album I was inexplicably excited.   Without hearing a song, I bought this because it seemed \\"right\\".  Boy did I get paid back.   <br /> <br />The \\"editorial\\" reviewer disparagingly compares some of this album to \\"68 Guns\\" by The Alarm (but then, what do music critics know anyway?).  Oddly enough, 20 years ago I bought \\"Declaration\\" by The Alarm (which contains 68 guns), and it became, to me, one of the best albums of all-time.  When I was 14, I would sit for hours with giant headphones on, listening to the the tales of youth rebellion, alienation, and frustration from The Alarm when it was simply not en vogue.   The album hit me in the gut at the right time with the right material.  No album has done that since...until now.  At 34, I sit at work with headphones on listening  to this new album from Green Day, and I get the same internal reaction.    <br /> <br />In the 20 years in-between, when I could not find many records that spoke to me like \\"Declaration\\", I thought *I* was the one who changed.  Now I know, I never changed, the music was just not all that good.  Well it is again, an we can thank Green Day because \\"American Idiot\\" is one of the best albums of the past 20 years. <br />
B000005Z0E|5.0|I made this review because i saw that this album got only 4 stars. This album is the real thing, everybody should skip everything and start straight here. This is the album that set it off. It's not the best album of 2pac, but it's a very good start. It seems like a digital underground album with 2pac on the vocals. The beats are like the ones of digital underground but the lyrics are much harder then any digital underground album. I must say that without digital underground, there is no 2pac. The best songs are Trapped,  Soulja's Story, If My Homie Calls, Brenda's Got A Baby and Rebel Of The Underground. Anyone who wants to know 2pac should start here
B00005OM4N|5.0|1.) I'm A Slave 4 U (The Neptunes) - : This track changed Britney, helped her crossover and became an instant hit in the US & UK. This 1st single featuring the beats of the Neptunes & Sexy & Sultry lyrics.  <br /> <br />2.) Overprotected (Max Martin & Rami) - : This song expresses Britney being Overprotected and wanting to go just have some fun without having body guards and papparazzi everywhere. <br /> <br />3.)Lonely (Rodney Jerkins) (Co-Written by Britney) - This is one of my favorite tracks. It has a great beat and good lyrics. <br /> <br />4.) I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (Max Martin & Rami) (Co-Written by Dido) - :  Proved to be more hitworthy in the UK than the U.S. but is still a good track. Britney changes to a woman through this song. <br /> <br />5.) Boys (The Neptunes) - Another Neptunes track. Very hot. Sexual. <br /> <br />6.) Anticipating (Brian Kierulf & Josh Schartz) (Co-Written by Britney) - It is fun and makes you wanna dance. <br /> <br />7.) I love Rock & Roll (Rodney Jerkins) - : This version of ILR&R is very urban and new age.  <br /> <br />8.) Cinderella (Max Martin & Rami) (Co-Written by Britney) - This song is good. Max Martin & Rami are great writers and Britney also co-wrote it. It seems like this song is telling of a new stage in Britney's life. <br /> <br />9.) Let Me Be (Rodney Jerkins) (Co-Written by Britney) - This track is very independent and Rodney Jerkins does a great job producing it. <br /> <br />10.) Bombastic Love (Max Martin & Rami) - I love this song. The beat is haunting kinda but it's cool. <br /> <br />11.) That's Where You Take Me (Brian Kierulf & Josh Schartz) (Co-Written by Britney) - Not the best track but still a good one. I love her voice in this one. <br /> <br />12.) What It's Like To Be Me (Wade J. Robson & Justin Timberlake) - This is probably one of the most different tracks on the album. Produced by choreographer: Wade & Ex: Justin. Justin puts his vocals in this. Its good. <br /> <br />
0446608955|1.0|This is surely a drivel for pimpy girls without boy friends (but dreaming of Tom Cruise)and bored housewives with doughs in their laps, who long ago left analysing, thinking and making any intelligent decision. If you are below 15 years old or your mentality age is around that you can like this...and it is ghastly that this book received so many five stars and many people cried for it. I could have cried a little only for the blandness of the nation.  <br />Oh well-someone still makes bucks and laughs all the way to the bank.
B0002OERI0|5.0|man i can't belive this band still has it in them to keep thier style and not to sell out  this is a great cd go buy it now!! dammit...
1591840562|5.0|I'm now working on my sixth startup, an affinity network. Our mantra, as Guy would call it, is \\"the love you take is equal to the love you make\\" (The End, the Beatles, Abbey Road). The last chapter of the Art of the Start, Obligation, exemplifies this philosophy. <br /> <br />Despite years of experience starting companies, I still had things to learn from Guy's book, and it also was a great refresher course on many of the basics, such as writing a business plan. I've recommended that our entire management team buy and read the book. I write a blog about startups, the Digitalyst, <br />[...] and it was a lot of fun for me to compare  what Guy has written about, for example, the process of naming your company, with what I've posted. <br /> <br />I can heartily recommend Guy's other books as well, in particular, The Macintosh Way and Rules for Revolutionaries. Guy writes clearly, concisely and with a great sense of humor. He breaks up the text with useful tables, most of them very funny as well as insightful. <br /> <br />If you are going to read just one book about startups - and I don't think you should spend any more time reading, as Guy exhorts, start doing - this is the one to read.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I thought the movies were great! They look as if they were just released. Very good sound and great picture. I think it was money well spent.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|They did a wonderful job putting this cd together. I really enjoyed this cd I can't believe I waited so long to hear it. If you are a fan of music you need to put this in your collection today.
B00005JN7O|3.0|I think I can say with some confidence that Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is not quite like any other film you've ever seen. Whether that's a good or a bad thing depends on what you think a movie should be.  <br /> <br />Sky Captain is set in the years between the World Wars. Ace big-city reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets wind of a shadowy world-domination plot involving a German uber-scientist, named Totenkopf. As she begins to investigate, the city is attacked by giant robot storm troopers, who wreak destruction and attempt to steal the municipal generators. (I am not making this up.) Polly and the city are saved by the timely arrival of Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law), who turns the tide in his trusty P-40 fighter plane. Polly and Joe, who have a bit of a history, reluctantly join forces to find Totenkopf and foil his evil plans. They are aided by Joe's whiz-kid sidekick, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), and his old flame Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook (Angelina Jolie), who is the commodore of an armada of flying British aircraft carriers. (Still not making this up.) The good guys brave sundry fantastical adventures involving many more mechanized henchmen before they finally locate Dr. Totenkopf's lair in Nepal. The ultimate confrontation that ensues between good and evil brings the earth to the brink of apocalypse.  <br /> <br />Okay, so much for the plot, which is pretty negligible. And while we're at it, let's dispose of the acting; Law, Paltrow and Ribisi are capable actors with good range, but Sky Captain's script wouldn't overtax the thespianic skills of a wombat. All of which is beside the point, because this movie is about other things.  <br /> <br />The first thing to know about Sky Captain is that pretty much everything you see on the screen, aside from the actors themselves, is created whole cloth out of CGI. That gives creator Kerry Conran almost unlimited license to do whatever he chooses - and what he chooses is very odd indeed, if rather intriguing withal. Conran goes to extraordinary lengths to make Sky Captain look convincingly like a very old science fiction movie; even the \\"film\\" stock seems aged, the color bleached, the images burred with slight haloes. The very conceit of a lone mad scientist developing technology to destroy the world as we know it is hopelessly antique (although admittedly the plot has rather a lot in common with 1979's Moonraker). And the gargantuan, bolted and riveted, bucket-headed robots look like they marched straight out of the 1950s.  <br /> <br />Conran gleefully adopts the logic holes, discontinuities, and plot conveniences that were standard in movies before audiences developed a taste for realism. Early in the movie, for instance, Dex is grabbed by a robot and carried off, but somehow finds time to leave a clue stuck to the underside of a desk by a wad of chewed gum. Following the clue, Joe and Polly fly all over the globe (including an ocean or two) in his little P-40, managing to pack along a few cases of Vienna Sausages and an apparently inexhaustible supply of wardrobe changes. At one point, the plane gets a big rock lodged in its tail assembly, making it impossible for Joe to maneuver, but then a few moments later the rock is conveniently gone. And how the heck does Totenkopf build a monumental fortress, complete with armies of giant automata and a rocket launch complex, in the inaccessible wastes of Nepal?  <br /> <br />What's significant is not that these implausibilities exist in the movie, but that the writer/director flaunts them and demands that you notice. Conran emulates even \\"flaws\\" like these from the old movies he evokes, because those flaws arose out of a romantic mindset that he is making every effort to recreate.  <br /> <br />On one level, the film is a straightforward story about Joe and Polly and Dex and Totenkopf; but on another - and ultimately more important - level, it's about nostalgia. Not only nostalgia for old science fiction movies, Ithink, though Conran clearly delights in them; but even more for the innocence of a world view that made such movies possible. In a way, Sky Captain - with its indestructable hero, its moral certainty, and its inhuman, otherworldly menace - is more about Iraq and September 11 than it is about monster robots. It's about decisive, cinematic victories instead of messy, real-life quagmires. If your idea of a good movie is one that places complex characters in realistic conflict, go see The Door in the Floor. But if you'd rather suspend disbelief for a couple hours, flying your P-40 into the sunset of a happy ending, check out Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. <br />
B00000IPAX|4.0|I wanna say that I am one of those people who thought this was just a goofy version of GreenDay. But I thought some of there stuff sounded so catchy i thought I'd try a used copy of this album. I've only listened to it once so far but was already impressed by the merry noise these guys make, comparable with GreenDay. More suprising was finding myself not just amused but touched by lyrics like in \\"Going to College.\\" I don't know if I'd place them up there with GreenDay yet, but fans of BillieJoeArmstrong might find this darn fun.
B00003CXCT|4.0|George Lucas has said that he will never release the original versions of the classic trilogy in any format, ever.  That is not speculation or innuendo but practically a quote.  Apparently Lucas was and is unhappy with the technological, monetary and time constraints placed on him during their filming, so new and \\"improved\\" versions of the classics will most likely keep popping up every decade or so for the next eon, and guess what?  Their existence will increase exponentially.  That's right, for every new technology, (VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, god knows what else) there will be 4,5 or more \\"Special Platinum Director's Cuts\\".  And as more media viewing technology pops up, there will be a version for each one.  So get ready to spend. <br /> <br />George Lucas is a very smart man.  He used to be a god to me, and I still admire him greatly.  But he is greedy.  Now, there is nothing wrong with that, we are all greedy to some extent.  But I wish he would realize that many fans love his classic trilogy in it's original form, and just release it on DVD. <br /> <br />After reading all of the Star Wars books, and playing with all of the Star Wars toys, and sleeping in Star Wars bedsheets and paying to be in the fan club, I now realize those things were just distracting me from the greatness of the essential mythology, filmmaking and fantastic story of Star Wars. <br /> <br />Mr. Lucas, I still love you, please release a boxed set with a cleaned up, widescreen, digitally mastered, etc. etc. original classic trilogy on DVD, the scripts for the movies, your rough drafts (Anakin Starkiller etc.), the screenplays, Ralph McQuarrie's production paintings and conceptual drawings in some sort of bound book, the making of the movies DVD with interviews etc. and some sort of documentary chronicling your journey of the creation of the original Star Wars Trilogy. <br /> <br />I'm giving this product 4 stars because it is an adulterated, alloyed version of the original, which gets 5 stars.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is much better than Kevin Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" which was released around the same time, thanks to great performances from Russell and especially Val Kilmer. It's a bit overly dramatic at times, but far superior to Costner's plodding script. Kilmer completely steals the show, sometimes overshadowing Sam Elliott's equally excellent casting. Highly recommend as a great adventure, and certainly over \\"Wyatt Earp.\\"
0792165020|2.0|I was very excited to see this movie because I have always been an admirer of Jude Law's work, Gwenneth Pawltrow and Matt Damon are extremely talented as well. But I have to say (with much regret) that in the long run this movie was a big dissapointment for me. The main reason being that I felt that after Tom Ripley had committed his first murder, there was no suspense left in the movie. There was no mystery involved, you know who the killer is, who is killed, and basically every important piece of information in the first half of the movie. Honestly, I found myself badly wanting to turn off the movie during the last forty-five minutes because I didn't care anymore what happened to the characters.  <br />This is a good movie if you just like to watch actors act though. Matt Damon is incredible as Tom Ripley, and manages to truely understand the character, and Jude Law and Gwenneth Paltrow play wonderfully together as Dickie and Marge. But even that was not enough to make this movie a captivating thriller, or even give it some suspense. I tried very hard to enjoy the Talented Mr. Ripley, but in the end I found it a great dissapointment, with a lack of suspense, and all together exceedingly tedious.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles... not exactly the most popular artists around younger audiences these days, but I don't see why.  I'm 16 and I just started getting into the Beatles about 2 years ago.  My friend had this album in her car, and I'm not so sure she's getting it back ^____^ <br />I haven't exactly researched the band or anything... and this is the first actual /album/ that I've listened to... but I am so hooked!  All of the songs are so incredibly awesome... I particularly love \\"Because\\" (I wish I could sing that with a few other people... beautiful harmony) and \\"You Never Give me Your Money\\" (I don't know what it is about that song... the first part is really pretty... and then it gets funky-cool.  Best of 2 worlds.).  Each song is completely different... unlike some artists where you feel like one song is on repeat, it's so generic.  It's like a puzzle of an abstract piece of art.  It comes together to make a great, crazy sort of picture. <br />The great thing about the Beatles is that it's classic, yet so different from anything else.  It reminds me of home and days past... very comforting, in a way. <br />If you're a Beatles fan, want to get into the Beatles (without knowing a bit about the Beatles, you don't know real music...), or sick and tired of listening to the same crap over and over again, this won't dissapoint you.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is simply awesome. Your emotions will be tested to the \\"nth\\" so carry a hankie. The Bushies were trying their best to keep this film out of the theaters. They failed fortunately and then attempted to smear the work-most certainly with some of Karl (Truth doesn't work for me) Rove. Michael Moore's scenes showing W. at work are ALL documented with places and dates on each clip. See this film and be informed about this bunch of lying liers at work. and BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID for America and Democracy if we have another 4 years of G.W.!!!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Mr. Moore has brilliantly misdirected movie audiences everywhere. I enjoy watching documentaries, because I enjoy learning. This documentary was fun to watch just from the standpoint of how distorted and slanted the facts and the editing was. I, however, like more truth than fiction in the documentaries I watch. I give it a low rating because of the way it was marketed and presented (as a documentary presenting the truth). If it had been marketed and presented as a work of fiction, I would've given it a much better rating, just because they did a good job making some of the footage look good on the big screen when in fact they had recorded it off the internet. They also did a great job editing to suck the audience into believing what was presented was true. It reminds me of when Orson Welles did his radio program \\"War of the Worlds\\" and people actually thought that we were being invaded..... Congratulations Mr. Moore on making millions off of a country you obviously don't care about and don't have any respect for.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Look, I agree with both camps. Lucas should be able to make whatever changes he wants to make and release updates every year if he so chooses. It's his work of art and it isn't done until he says so. Just because he has given the public a glimpse into the first drafts of his vision, doesn't mean they were ever truly finished in his eyes.     However, the reason he has been able to finance his artistic vision of a 6 part saga is because of the ungodly amount of money he made on the original three movies. These movies have won countless awards and are an important part of our cultural history. For this reason they should be preserved for future generations to appreciate in the form in which they were originally presented. As much as Lucas doesn't want to, he will eventually give into pressure from the Hollywood community and release these films for archival purposes, although this will most likely not happen until HD-DVD becomes a standard and is in all likelihood many years away.     What I think he (and everyone else) is missing is the fact that the movies do not have to (and in my option, should not) be viewed in the order events take place (parts 1,2,3,4,5,6) in order to best enjoy the story. The public that has grown up with these movies viewed them starting with part 4, and I think in 100 years that this will be the preferred order of viewing these films. By then people will have moved on from movies to some newer form of story telling/viewing and these films will be seen as a historical slice of art in time (from the late 20th century). Most people who view an artists work (such as Lucas's) will want to see it presented in chronological (production) order, and will get more from it that way. You can see an artists progression as their work changes over the years. When it comes down to it, he doesn't need to make the films fit together so people and can watch them in the \\"correct order\\" because they were made in the correct order already. Anyone who views thesemovies in the future should start with Star Wars (part 4) and go from there, as we all have.     Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a prequel and the opening of Last Crusade contains the opener where Indy is a teen. Does anyone suggest that I should pop in Last Crusade first for the opener, then take it out and watch Temple, then watch Raiders and finally pop Last Crusade back in to finish it all off in the \\"correct order\\". I'm sure someone has done it (as I know people have figured out a way to play the Pulp Fiction DVD in the order events take place), but does that make it the \\"right\\" way???    Play them in the order they were made and know the history of the films and you will enjoy them for what they are. No one should care that may actors change, minor plot points may not be in sync or special effects may be of different quality if they have an appreciation for the process (and history) of the making of these films.
0441172717|5.0|This novel is quite simply the greatest work of imagination of all time.  The time: the year 10,191.  The place: the planet Arrakis.  This is the story of humankind in an inconceivably distant future and a divergent society that is utterly unlike our own.  Nevertheless, the triumph of this novel is that Frank Herbert makes this strange setting utterly real to the reader and every bit as internally consistent as today's world, despite its frank alieness from \\"modern day\\" 21st century society.<br /><br />Essentially, many millinieum from now, mankind has spread throughout the Galaxy by way of a hazardous faster-than-light means of space travel.  The danger of space travel is mitigated by a single resource: the spice melange, which is available only on one planet in the galaxy: Dune, the planet Arrakis. Melange makes it possible for spaceship Navigators to foresee, and therefore avoid, the many hazards of space and space travel. This novel is the story of a struggle to control Arrakis and thereby control the Galaxy by controlling the one essential resource that makes all interstellar commerce possible.<br /><br />Herbert's characterizations are incomparably brilliant.  The discerning reader will never forget Leto Atreides, the Lady Jessica, Paul Muad 'dib Atreides, the Naib Stilgar, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and a host of other characters that Herbert conjures up seemingly effortlessly.  This is a great story of human struggle on a titanic scale.<br /><br />Although this novel is somewhat hard going for the first time reader, the rewards of seeing it through are great, for this is a wonderful story of imagination, intrigue, struggle, and triumph.  This review cannot begin to do justice to a novel that is quite simply a masterpiece of imagination.
068987474X|5.0|I must say that after watching OPRAH I got this book and read it all in about a couple hours and I feel that it is a book of great funny witty advice from both writers. I love the format , you can book mark pages to refer to after that not no good phone call, date, ETC :-)  <br />Pefect gift for the single women in your life and works for many ages.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd is the best cd ive ever listened to. It is AMAZING! Christina has such deep, amazing lyrics. I played this cd so much I wore it out literally, and I had to buy another, its just sooooo incredible and I have so much respect for this woman. It is a must have for ANYONE...
B00005M91K|4.0|Suppose a talented alien filmmaker came to earth and created a ~90 minute documentary on the human species and its place on earth for broadcast on an alien cable channel. The result might well be Baraka.     The being behind the camera is a great cinematographer and has a striking ability to capture human activity, some of those activities the result of great emotion, but has no insight into the actual human joys, sorrows, dramas that motivate our actions. None of that appears. Nevertheless the result is riveting! More than 1 and  hours go by with no plot, no narration, and yet the viewer is never bored.    I agree that this is not a film for kids, but the \\"chick beak burning\\" scene commented on by another reviewer is not traumatic (to me). The DVD version looks fine on my TV which is not HD...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Britneys best work so far! The songs are much more creative and mature.     Me Against the Music (4/5) Great dance track, at first I thought it was alright but it grew on me quickly.    Ive got that BOOM BOOM (4/5) This song is good, its has a hip hop vibe to it with the ying yang twins joining in.    Showdown (3/5) This songs go0d. Though it seems to get repeative towards the end.    Early Morning (3/5) At first this was my least favorite track on the album but as time went by I began to like it more and more.    Toxic (5/5) One of her bests songs! Its a fabulous pop song!    Outrageous (4/5) This song is go0d. It was written by R. Kelly, it has a lil hip hop vibe also.    Touch Of My Hand (5/5) THE BEST SONG! This is my favorite Britney song. Its beautifully done and Britney songs great!    The Hook Up (2/5) My least favorite track. Its got a reggae sound, I dont like it to much.    Shadow (4/5) A great song, I believe its about some guy *wink*    Brave New Girl (4/5) This song is great, its a fast, fun pop tune.    Everytime (5/5) My 2nd favorite track. The melody is great and lyrics are beautifully written. Britney sounds gorgeous!    MATM Remix (3/5) Im not big on remixes, this ones pretty go0d.  (...)
B0002OERI0|5.0|I had the incredible fortune of being one of the first people in the world to hear this album live when they performed it in its entirety in Hollywood last week. Despite the fact that the crowd only knew one song from the album, the entire crowd loved it, and Green Day blew the roof off the place. It has fast past, \\"oldie\\" Green Day songs, along with nice ballads, and some new styles as well. This is definately on par with Dookie, but since I am a diehard Green Day fan, I love all their albums. Green Day still has it, and will never lose it. Go buy this CD now and you won't regret it!!!!
B0002858YS|2.0|This is pretty dull and there are many bad things about this piece of plastic. For one all I can here is a repetative guitar in the backround and the lead singers terrible voice. The lyrics to 'Somebody Told Me' are an utter disaster, I mean \\"Breaking my back just to know your name x5, anything goes in place like this x5, somebody told that you had a boyfriend that looked like a girlfriend (?) septuary abasterd??? Its not confidential I've got potentail rushin around\\" are not poetic and are VERY uninspired, a lot like Good Charlottes songs except not poseur. The bass player also has no idea what he's doing...looks like we got another one bringing a bad name to the instrument players. The guitarist is trying too hard to sound like Eddie Van Halen and failing so freakin' miserably, I mean at least be a little original here!! The drummer also has very little talent that I dont understand as well, he usually cant keep a rhythem going and he cant start any song very well at all. The only reason why I am giving this two stars is because all in all they are being themselves (excluding the guitar player) unlike S*!tty Plan and G@y Charlotte...who are some of the biggest most useless poseurs that ever lived. I dont recommend this but then again its better than most crap out today.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said?  These guys are simply some the most talented musicians on the face of the earth.  This album is no exception.  If you want to get into more thoughtful and melodic music with killer rifts and work by perhaps one of the greatest drummers to ever live, then you want Dream Theater.  This album is as good as any of theirs-the best.  I'm not quite sure what one of the previous reviewers was talking about, but oh well. <br /> <br />I give it 9/10 stars.  This is one great album!
B00006V9A0|2.0|I love Nirvana, in fact they are my favorite band but this was not released to gain more fans to Nirvana, it was released so those greedy b@$t@rds at Geffen records and Krist Novoselic could faaten their already loaded wallets. I used to like Krist, but ever since the death of long time pal Kurt Cobain its like he went into denial, becoming a pot smoking drunk politician. Kids, the first rule about politics...never trust them especially Krist, the fact that a respected bass player from one of the most revolutionary bands has decided to stop rocking and start stocking (stock market) is enough to tell you that he's hit rock bottom. Anyway the only reason why I'm giving this two stars is because of how much I respect the band and even though Kurt was not the greatest guitarist he still made some of the best music ever, hell I can think of better instrument players than these guys.  Guitarists:  1. Jimi Hendrix  2. Eddie Van Halen  3. Jimmy Page  All much better than Kurt  Bassists:  1. Cliff Burton  2. Paul McCartney  3. John Paul Jones  All much better than Krist Novoselic  Drumming:  1. Neil Peart  2. Lars Ulrich  3. Dave Grohl, he really is the biggest musical talent in Nirvana  Vocals:  1. Robert Plant  2. Freddy Mercury  3. James Hetfield  All much better than Kurt  You see now? Kurt wasn't the greatest musician of all time (even if Dave was one of them) but he still managed to make some of the best music I've ever heard and thats why I respect him so much. I dont like the point of this album, even if 'You Know You're Right' is on it it still isn't worth the money, anyways you can just download almost any song on this off the internet. Dont buy this unless you are a newcomer to rock music, if you are a newcomer to Nirvana then buy Nevermind, then In Utero, then Unplugged, then Incesticide, then Bleach, then Wishkah and then enjoy any other imports\singles you can find.    Oh yeah, if Geffen is going to make a \\"remake\\" of this album then I suggest a double disc including:  1. About a Girl  2. Swap Meat  3. School  4. Blew  5. Smells Like Teen Spirit  6. In Bloom  7. Come as You Are  8. Lithium  9. Polly  10. Drain You  11. On a Plain  12. Aneurysm  13. Sliver  14. Dive  15. Been a Son  DISC TWO  1. Serve the Servants  2. Heart-Shaped Box  3.

B00009V7T2|5.0|So great, so original and different. Amazing really, this album is near perfect. I never really listened to At the Drive-In, so I was completely unbiased when I picked up this CD. Wow. That was all I could say. <br /> <br />In a review I read somewhere the author said this album was about 40% percussion, and I believe it. Jon Theodore's drums and percussion on this album are rediculous. Just listen to Drunkship of Lanterns.  <br /> <br />Truly, an album to be remembered years from now. Best 10 bucks you will ever spend. <br />
0440236738|5.0|I read \\"Tell no one\\" and liked it very much.<br /><br />But actually \\"Gone for good\\" is even better. The characters are deeper, the story is great and very well built.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book.<br /><br />Go for it, you won't be disappointed!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I can't even begin to fathom why anyone would have any complaints about this new DVD release. Finally, the STAR WARS movies are complete and have never looked better! Perhaps the most noticeable difference is the incredibly polished look of the films. The picture is sharp and everything from the Death Star to blaster shots to lightsaber blades look so much more realistic. Most die-hard fans have voiced their complaints, saying how Lucas has \\"ruined his masterpeice.\\" Well, that's tough. The fact is, that nobody under 35 is going to enjoy the original release. When I was a kid, I wasn't very impressed because the storyline was fabulous, but the effects were too primitive. Now, everyone can truly enjoy the movies.
B00003CXCT|5.0|All right, I'm as nutty a Star Wars fan as you'll ever find.  I still have all my toys, I spent significant time and money as an adult making my own Boba Fett costume, and still seek out those Star Wars rarities on e-bay.  That being said, I must say that, while I'm not a huge fan of the majority of Lucas' changes to the trilogy, many of them are the result of what has occurred in Ep. I and II and probably III.   Ep. IV, V, and VI are now part of this larger saga.  The funny thing is that most of the people who are complaining, sobbing, and threatening the life of George Lucas were most likely peeing their pants in anticipation of Ep. I and II.  Then, when they saw that Ep. I (which was god-awful, I must admit) and II (which isn't nearly as bad as everyone likes to make it out to be) were not carbon copies of the original trilogy they declared their god (Lucas) dead and mourned the loss of their life's purpose.  <br /> <br /> I can't believe I'm saying this, but THESE ARE JUST MOVIES!  They should not be your reason for being.  If you want to go a step further and call them the closest thing we have to a modern mythos, I'm with ya'.  But to not recognize that, without many of these changes, the FULL story would become very confusing and disjointed is to reject the mythos entirely.  If that's what you're willing to do, then I submit you are not a fan of Star Wars, but more a fan of your own conception of what Star Wars is, or was.  This is what we have to deal with.  THIS is Star Wars. From Jar-Jar (puke), to Boba Fett, this is what you have to accept as the full `Star Wars package'.  Besides, isn't there something kind of cool about seeing something for the billionth time and seeing something new?   <br /> <br />Look, I can definitely do without the Jabba scene in Docking bay 94 (\\"Jabba, you're a wonderful human being\\" what the hell is that?  That doesn't even make sense!) And I can definitely do without the retarded dance scene in Jedi.  But to scrap the whole thing because it's not EXACTLY how you remembered it when you saw it for the first time is just ridiculous.  IF YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING YEARS TO SEE IV, V, AND VI ON DVD, IN CRYSTAL CLEAR COLOR, AND BRILLIANT SOUND, BUY THIS SET.  IF YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT THE TRILOGY IS NOW JUST `A PART' OF A LARGER WORLD, STICK W/ THE CRAPPY VHS COPIES AND PLAY THEM TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT (OR UNTIL THEY SNAP), YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR YOUR LACK OF VISION! <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I find it incredible the sort of baseless criticism that is being thrown at this film. One reviewer labelled Mike as 'Blasphemous'. What is this? The Middle Ages? Are you going to start burning people at the stake for being Atheist next? Another reviewer called him a 'Trador'. I don't know what dictionary you use, but if you can't even spell 'Traitor' it shows how ill educated and ignorant some of the people who oppose this film are. <br /> <br />Sitting at the bottom right hand corner of the world in cosy Australia, I cannot understand the American people and their fundamental lack of the ability to laugh at themselves. Your humor is generally poor (laughing at others misfortune, terrible catchphrases etc.), you don't understand Monty Python properly (members of Monty Python like Michael Palin are the first to admit this), in fact you're such backward rednecks that you can't even pronounce the word 'Python' (it's pronounced 'Pie-thin', not 'Pie-THON'). <br /> <br />Your health system is terrible, your education system is so bad that most of you don't even know where the countries you're bombing are. <br /> <br />Michael Moore is simply pleaing for sanity, he hopes for a time when you elect intelligent people who want to let everyone have the right to a good education, healthcare and not get shot at by loons with assault weopons when they go shopping. I cannot understand how a man like George W Bush, a D-grade student, a born-again christian and a religious bigot could ever be elected for anything - let alone leader of the free world. For God's sake, he can't even string a sentence together. <br /> <br />In case you hadn't noticed, since the ruskies went bankrupt from trying to build as many nukes as you, you now rule the world. Apart from a few third-world countries who hate your guts (with good reason), you are the supreme rulers of everything. If you really think you have the greatest democracy in the world, try to make your own country better, along with the rest of the world. Stop those corporations buying your politicians, elect people who say 'NO, I will not be bought!' At the very least let other countries and other people have their own opinions, stop all this \\"If you're not with us, you're against us\\" nonsense. Let people worship someone other than Jesus. Accept the fact that even though there are brutal dictatorships around the world and there always will be, bombing civilians in these countries will not change this. Sucessful Regime change comes through other means, look at India and South Africa, learn a little from history. <br /> <br />Of coarse all of those who gave this film five stars already know how corrupt and rediculous your political system is. You have no leader of the opposition and no independent media. All you have is a supreme ruler, Someone who gets voted in by about 15% of you every four years and is never questioned by his people or the media or else they will be labelled as \\"unpatriotic\\". <br /> <br />This film is a wakeup call and I think it is a historic milestone in your countries history. The unbelievable success and the huge proportion of Americans that went to see it is something to be celebrated. Michael Moore finally has the freedom to make any film he wants, he's got $200 million up his sleeve and I can't wait to see his future work and the work of film makers that are inspired by his example. <br /> <br />Now you all know the truth, get out there and make your country and the world a better place! <br /> <br /> <br />P.S. I realise this review wanders from the topic of the film, but heck! Some of the other reviews don't really stick much to the point, I don't think discussing Michael Moores gut size has a lot to do with this film either.  <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|this album is perfect in every way possible. the song structures are brilliant, the guitars are jaw-dropping, and it flows perfectly. every song is flawless, all 10/10. if you are a metal fan and you do not own this album, you have not yet lived. in fact, even non-metal fans should give this one a shot; with a few listens they could possibly realize its brilliance.  <br /> <br />the remastered version is awesome; it has improved sound quality and bonus tracks. also, it has different vocals on \\"take no prisoners\\", \\"five magics\\", and \\"lucretia\\", a neutral but fun change.
1400031354|2.0|A real yawner!  It didn't help that the characters names were too difficult to remember.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I had to only hear one song from this CD, to make me go out & buy it.  It was Over the Rainbow, it gave me goosebumps and brought tears to my eyes, it was so touching.  Little did I know who else was on the CD at that time, but it is just awesome.  I can't listen to it enough.  Even though I could have saved $$$ by buying it here, it was worth every penny and then some.  It is truly a must have CD!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I don't think I've ever met any real human beings with as many eccentric mannerisms, facial expressions, tics and affectations as those exhibited by the three leads in this film.  Perhaps that's just how people acted back during the Civil War.  And maybe lovers in those days all spoke in that odd, hesitant style, with plenty of sidelong glances and.....dramatic pauses!  Then again, maybe not.  In spite of all that, I was still drawn into the story itself and the beautiful cinematography.  But this is no 'English Patient'...
B00006RINF|5.0|One word, Beautiful. I think Lacuna Coil has a perfect balance of heaviness and gothicness along with serenity. I love all the songs on the cd and I always find myself singing the songs. Simply beautiful.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|While this trilogy of MGM musical tribute films have been available on VHS as a boxed set, the sheer quantity of unforgettable musical highlights showcased make them 'naturals' for DVD, with the format's superior 'search' accessibility, and improved picture and sound quality. There should be a 'warning label', though; these movies MAY cause you to start singing and dancing, and turn you into a musical 'junkie'!<br /><br />Each film, besides offering a spectacular array of showstoppers, has a style uniquely it's own; the first, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! (1974), is the glossiest, with an array of 'guest stars' introducing clips (Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Elizabeth Taylor, Kelly, Astaire, Jimmy Stewart, and more) that is matchless; the second, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, PART II (1976), provides a last opportunity to see hosts Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly do a bit of singing and dancing together, and expands the 'musical' format to include montages of classic comedy, and tributes to Tracy and Hepburn, and other 'non-musical' MGM stars; the oft-overlooked THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! III (1994) eschews the 'soft-focus' approach of it's predecessors, adding a 'behind-the-scenes' look at the demanding work of creating 'classic' routines, and an unflinching acknowledgement of the prejudices of the era, to the mix of musical highlights.<br /><br />My only quibble is that the musical output of the other major Hollywood studios tends to be downplayed, particularly in THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!, implying that MGM had the 'corner' on the market. Certainly, the Warner collection of Busby Berkeley spectaculars of the 30s, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, and the Doris Day musicals, Fox, with Shirley Temple, Alice Faye, and Betty Grable, Columbia (Rita Hayworth), Paramount (Bing Crosby and Bob Hope), and, most significantly, RKO's classic series of Astaire and Rogers vehicles, all deserve as much recognition and credit for their input to the genre of 'classic' musicals. In terms of sheer 'star power' and overall quality, however, MGM was unmatched.<br /><br />Whether you grew up loving musicals, or were introduced to the genre through recent films like CHICAGO or MOULIN ROUGE!, this collection of highlights should be essential viewing!ality, however, MGM was unmatched.  <br /> <br />Whether you grew up loving musicals, or were introduced to the genre through recent films like CHICAGO or MOULIN ROUGE!, this collection of highlights should be essential viewing! <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />

031286504X|4.0|'I Am Legend' by Richard Matheson, at least in the current published form, actually contains the novel of the same name plus several short stories.  The main novel deserves all the accolades by the other amazon.com reviewers; it is a truly original, ghoulish apocalyptic tale where vampires take over the world.  It is tightly written and completely enthralling.<br /><br />Unfortunately the collection of short stories generally tarnishes the overall package.  I found them either barely interesting or down right amateurish ... hard to believe they were written by the same person who wrote 'I Am Legend'.  However there is one very notable exception - the short story 'Prey'.  It's about a tribal figurine who unmercifully attacks a young woman in her New York apartment.  Terrific.<br /><br />Bottom line: certainly a mixed collection, but the main story 'I Am Legend' is an absolute must read.
B00003CXCT|5.0|(...)  And as for the new changes, all I can say is, Thank God Lucas was smart enough to ignore the psychotic ramblings of his so-called fans. What few seem to realize here is that Lucas is trying to make a six part movie. In order for this six part movie to make sense, changes have to be made.     Case in point, someone was decrying the fact that Jabba appears in ANH, and that it ruins the suspense of knowing who Jabba is. But if you watch Episodes I through VI, you will have seen Jabba in the first movie, so either way it doesn't matter.     Ian McDirmid, who plays the Emperor in FOUR movies (I, II, III and VI) would not be in V if not for the changes. How much sense would it make to have a woman with babboon eyes filling in for Ian in part V, and ONLY in part V? Whether the changes make sense or not doesn't even seem to matter to these nuts.     Here is another example: virtually everyone seems to hate the idea of inserting Hayden Christensen at the end of ROTJ. But just how upset would anybody be if the Star Wars Sextet were released in order? Wouldn't it make more sense to finally see the actor who played the \\"good Anakin\\" in Episodes II and III make a cameo appearance? This would not only bind the six movies more closely together visually, but it would also be a nostalgic look back at the actor who first portrayed Anakin. Sebastian Shaw did a fine job playing the dying, deformed Anakin, but having him as a ghost doesn't really make sense. Think about it, Anakin as a ghost would appear as an old man who NEVER existed. Anakin, as an old man, never had hair, never aged to such a state as he appeared in the OT. Obi-Wan Kenobi made it pretty clear to Luke that his father had suffered a \\"spiritual death\\" when he became Darth Vader, so invoking the image of his \\"good self\\", portrayed by H. Christensen, an image that actually existed in physical form, just makes sense. The only reason many of you hate it is because it's new.    The truth of the matter is a lot of people here are bitter 30 and 40 year old guys still living with their moms, and simply cannot accept the fact that they are no longer 12 and the reality of Star Wars isn't quite what they remember. My nephews, on the other hand, who are 7 and 9 years old, are loving every minute of the new DVD's and could never even comprehend the incessant rambling of these old gasbags. Thank God my inner child isn't dead yet. I'm going to finish my marathon now. Thank You.
B00003CXCT|1.0|In ROTJ, when they showed the Pit of Carkoon, I could have sworn I heard \\"FEED ME SEYMORE, FEED ME ALL NIGHT LONG\\". LOL! What if dumb a** Lucas put Jar Jar Binks at the end of the movie with Yoda, Anakin, and Obi. Now That would be funny! F*** these stupid @#$ movies. Star War Trilogy was my favorite movie. I had every single toy. Now I hate Star Wars.  <br /> <br />I read an interview with Lucas in the Star Ledger. He basically said he don't give a d*** about fans and that he won't waste his money tranferinf the originals to DVD. He said if anyone wants the originals they can buy them on VHS. What the h***? <br /> <br />Lucas isn't that dumb after all. Make tons of money on the originals. Sell these crappy movies to non-Star Wars fans who don't know any better (I think they would buy this set if Lucas released this as a cartoon). Then, wait a little while longer and release the original and say \\"There was an overwhelming demand for it, so...\\" <br /> <br />I believe all of the positive reviews (2 stars or better)either work for Lucas, are his relatives, or were written by Lucas himself. Do yourself (and every true Star Wars fan) a favor and let them rot on the shelves. I have a blockbuster freedom pass so Lucas see virtually no money from me. And he probably won't any more.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Music reviews are almost unimportant, especially by die-hard fans.  I, in fact, am a die-hard fan of Green Day but like to review music objectively.  Don't get me wrong, Billie's voice makes my hairs stand up on my arms, but on this album just barely tweaks my senses.  First of all, I'm 25 and have been listening to Green Day since around 1994.  I still listen to songs from all their albums and even the \\"Pinhead Gunpowder\\" era.  American Idiot has some great ideas, just doesn't quite cut it.<br /><br />Let me break it down more easily....<br /><br />1. Anyone looking for rhythms from the album Insomniac and before, look again.<br /><br />2. Did you like Good Riddance?  Then probably get this.<br /><br />3. Songs like \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Letterbomb\\", and most of \\"Whatsername\\" will find decent comfort in old school Green Day.<br /><br />4. Billie's voice is still on par, hasn't lost any touch.<br /><br />5. Four years of waiting and we get this?<br /><br />Like I said, I consider myself a die-hard fan, but after the past two releases, I'm gonna stick to the earlier albums.  My radio days are over and satisfaction has diminished.  I hope this review helps and I would suggest downloading the songs first before picking up the CD.  Good Riddance :)
B0002Y69NG|5.0|well i consider myself one of the biggest Matrix fans on the globe ... but if Package didn't include DTS & THX & all the Extras movie enthusiasts look for in Boxed sets .. then it's not worth buying ... i have all the 3 movies + the Animatrix on DVD ... so the producers simply have 2 impress me enough 2 buy this although i have them alll .....& i really do wanna buy it if it has DTS & THX ... i'll keep my fingers crossed ( maybe some of them r reading ) .. have a nice day all
0805062971|5.0|When I first saw Fight Club (movie) I watched it once and had to watch it two more times right after.  It screwed with my head...in a good way; I mean it is rare that you find a movie that follows the book well and conveys it so well.  The book is much better and I wish I knew it was a book prior to watching the film.          The way Chuck writes in this book is impeccable; the simple use of pronouns is soemthign I watch for while reading because I know the storyline prior to reading.  The usage of pronouns is ridiculous with this story and it chagnes the whole storyline, and by having it written out in full rather than a movie really can get to you if you read it right.  You must look past the Fight Club and the fighting and look at the symbolism of the scenes and the events.  You can learn lots about yourself from this book/movie (book I would highly suggest).  I know that I will be reading this soon again because I really can't get enough of how it takes such simple things and flips them.  I will be starting Survivor soon (also by Palahniuk); however I'm not sure how much better he can get than Fight Club.  Another great book that messes with your head is Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman...
B00028HBKC|5.0|I'm not going to state my bias or preferences on religion doctrine; the only thing I am going to write is my opinion on the movie itself.  In a nutshell the movie is about a man who willingly summits himself to be punished for the deeds of others, in the process he claims to be God in human flesh.  That's basically it, if you believe it or not, well that is a discussion left for another website.  <br /> <br />The movie gives you an account on how this man is punished and how he dies.  The images are hunting and the music is breathtaking.  It's obvious that the film was a labor of love for the director; it's something you can see by the amount of detail and the message he tries to convey thorough out the movie.  It is very disturbing and at the same time it has such an affect that it forces you to have some sort of reaction (positive or negative).  Similarly to a work of art it emphasizes what the artist sees and magnifies it so the audience can grasp it too.   In a few words, it's brilliant. <br />
B000002NFM|5.0|alot of people bash on techno at my high school and while it bugs me, i find lots of people listening to this album. everyone knows its and loves it. from \\"smack my bitch up\\" to \\"firestarter\\", the rockers to the rappers love this album as  i perosnally like \\"breathe\\", \\"mindfields\\" and \\"climatize\\". this album has not a bad song. while some are better than others, none are bad or worth skipping after the first listen. buy this album and enjoy the dark melodies. its a great album for techno-newbs, because its not so dance music-like and more rock or darker than your average mix. i find it also to not be very repetive as most mainstream techno such as like \\"fat boy slim\\". buy this album and you should like it.
068987474X|5.0|Beginning on 14 Feb, 2004, if I'd of had this book, 8 more months of my life would've been mine and not spent pining over some guy that was just not into me.  What a relief to be finally free.  I held out for all those calls when he said he'd call, those dates and weekends away and now after having seen Oprah and run out immediately to buy this book, I can honestly say that I feel liberated.  Of course, down deep one surely must know when one is not into one, but to see it written as such is a relief!  Wish I had my 8 mos. back.
068987474X|3.0|Man, this book was interesting.  I honestly can say that I think back to a past relationship in college and think Wow, I was stupid.  I wish I could have saw the signs then that \\"he just wasn't into me\\" and could kick yourself for falling into the trap. <br /> <br />However, I do reccommend The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene.  This opened my eyes to the games people play in relationships.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|That was the first Pixies song I heard, during the ending of Fight Club. I found out about the Pixies through that movie [which is very good] but although Where Is My Mind? went to the top 10 of my favorite songs, I never really checked out other Pixies stuff. But then I got a Spin magazine with them on the cover, and I read about how they influenced Radiohead and Nirvana, my 2 favorite bands. I cracked and bought this CD, and let me tell you, it was well worth it. There are some very amazing songs here, and pretty much all of the 23 songs are good. Repeated listenings may be needed for some songs, bu it was a great buy.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|It is very funny, and at times broadly humourous. The most touching scene, beautifully  done by the underrated Sophie Thompson, is the pivotal scene where she (as Miss Bates) is insulted  by Emma.  Miss Bates' brave face and faltering reply are heartbreaking and amazing to watch.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  The books are incredible, but this is the only movie so far that has come close to being as good as the book.  (All you people who have just seen the movies -- READ THE BOOKS!)  While it is true that Cuarn did make a few minor changes to the story, it must be understood that movies and books work differently. <br /> <br />What works well for a book does not necessarily work well as a movie!  You have to take into account things like a different sense of pacing!  So, small changes to the story are GOOD if they are decided on by an able director who knows the medium he's working with. <br /> <br />I think Cuarn did a magnificent job directing this movie, in terms of mood, and also the artistic aspects; the first two movies were nothing special, but the cinematography of \\"Azkaban\\" is stunning.  The composition of the shots and the colors are all extremely well thought out and aesthetically beautiful. <br /> <br />I do wish that they hadn't left out the explanation about who exactly the Marauders were--that's pretty important information.  But as a whole, I loved this movie.  Plus, the music is great (and that's important).
B0002OERI0|5.0|First off, I would like to open with, that this album is awsome. Yes, it holds the same Green Day \\"power-pop-punk\\" sounds, but there are new sounds from the Green Day boys, that really impressed me. Songs like \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is a fine example. <br />This is something special and well worth the purchase. <br /> <br />American Idiot - Standard Green Day still rocks! 4/5 <br /> <br />Jesus Of Suburbia - Really cool 9 minute song with many transisitons, pulled off real well from a band I didn't expect to have that level of though for writing! 5/5 <br /> <br />Holiday - A swinging number, very cool. 3/5 <br /> <br />Boulevard Of Broken Dreams - Nice acoustic, piano sections and has a very cool feel in the verses. 4/5 <br /> <br />Are We The Waiting - Very arena rock feel in the beginning and through out, but very modern, but it has an '80s feel in the chorus harkened to big chanting songs. You'll see what I mean. 4/5 <br /> <br />St. Jimmy - Very punkish...In the \\"Oi Oi\\" sense, with fast tempo...which breaks down to half time mid tempo round the 2min mark....with nice backin vocals. 4/5 <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine - One of the stand outs for me, very cool, 50's feel to the song in verses. Very impressed. 5/5 <br /> <br />She's A Rebel - Standard Green Day, with reminices of \\"Mollys Lips\\". 4/5 <br /> <br />Extra Ordinary Girl - Impressive percussion intro, nothing outstanding but something VERY different. Cuts into a very very pop rock song, which is a good song, but very poppy. Standard song. 3/5 <br /> <br />Letterbomb - Very cool song, very very Green Day again! 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends - Another gem on the album. Well written acoustic, drum and TRIANGLE based song, which cuts to standard Green Day mid tempo rock. 4/5 <br /> <br />Homecoming - The other 9min song with many movements, which is really cool to hear. A special song, to hear from a band which doesn't normally stray from 4 chords. 5/5 <br /> <br />Whatsername - Cars like song, pretty weak for a closing track, but still good.....might take time to appretiate its placement. The song is good though. 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br />This \\"rock opera\\" or \\"concept album\\" is great. Well done by the last band I thought could pull it off. It is not epic or mind blowing....its just a great album that deservse it's praise. <br /> <br />
B00007LTIC|4.0|With \\"Relayer\\" keyboardist Patrick Moraz making a hasty exit over \\"creative differences\\" (and later to be employed by the Moody Blues), Yes asked their old friend Rick Wakeman to return to the band. Wakeman had taken a one-album sabbatical from the group, having been displeased with Yes' direction on \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans.\\" But the vacation re-ignited Wakeman's appreciation for Yes, and he was welcomed back into the band with open arms. Recorded in Switzerland, 1977's \\"Going For The One\\" is an excellent Yes album. The title song is a strong Yes rocker. \\"Turn Of The Century\\" is a beautiful piece. \\"Parallels\\" is another winner, with some great church organ from Wakeman. \\"Wonderous Stories,\\" which was actually a big hit for Yes in the UK, is a lovely song. And finally, there's the classic Yes epic \\"Awaken,\\" a 15 1/2 minute extravaganza that is tremendous in it's power and beauty. It's easily one of Yes' very best pieces. Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Alan White are all in top form on this one. \\"Going For The One\\" is an excellent Yes disc.
B00005JNEI|5.0|It is amusing reading the reviews for this movie (on this site and off). Those who are \\"against\\" the Moore thesis generally throw out insults and epitaphs - with little or no evidence. Many admit to not having seen the whole film. It appears to be an emotional response based on faith and ignorance.  <br /> <br />Those that support the thesis - and this video have ample facts, sources and indeed, a rational approach to the mess that Bush made. The video may seem heavy handed at times...and it is certainly advocacy journalism, but it is not over the top or inaccurate.  <br /> <br />Whether you agree or not it is a must see movie. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I will break from my usual tradition of talking entirely too much about things that deeply affect me in the political realm and say quite simply that a refusal to see this movie by Michael Moore is synonymous with a refusal to actually be an American in the spirit of the founding fathers.<br /><br />Moore knew early on in his career that he would have to develop a marketable persona and larger (and more annoying) than life personality, such that the underlying messages of hope and faith in actual democracy inherent in his films would get out--along with the truth about the deadly direction some in America would like to take it. Like any skilled doctor needing to share a real diagnosis that no one wants to hear, he knew early on--from the days of ROGER AND ME--that the architects of the free market system that is slowly destroying democracy in America had far too much power over the media and interrelated institutions for his message to truly be heard any other way. This now near-iconic celebrity persona of his is what people of opposing viewpoints often debate about--forgetting, if actually ever knowing, that it is manufactured for one specifically noble purpose: get the truth OUT; out of the stale, impotent, universities; off the shelves of the dissident bookstores; out of the hands of the corpoarate leaders who know it will save lives and whole cultures but adversely affect their bottom line. In other words, getting the truth out of the hands of the spineless, useless and moral-less, and into the hands of everyday regular people, without whom the world would not even exist, let alone come to an end.<br /><br />In other words, do not make the mistake the marketplace has been hoping you'd make of confusing the messenger with the message. I saw this movie in the theatres with my teenage children months ago and it is still affecting my entire family. Hardcore Republican friends of mine who were also in the theatre were more dumbstruck and silent than I was.<br /><br />If there has ever been a little voice in your head that has questioned the inconsistencies of the very concept of terrorism as it has been defined by our current politicians; wondered why the search for Osama bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan--a country full of almost nothing but oil trade routes and the poorest people on earth--has somehow fallen off the radar screen with the (pre-planned) rise of Iraq; wondered if the manufactured image of our political leaders is what is actually guiding your support or refutation of their influence above and beyond their actual records of \\"service\\"--and to what they have  actually been serving...if there is any part of your soul still clinging to life in this soul killing quasi-fascist state our beloved country seems to be falling toward, you will find a CPR for the mind, body and soul the likes of which you never experienced before in life with this movie.<br /><br />Michael Moore and FARENHEIT 9-11 have had a multitude of detractors for some time now. But I have yet to hear anyone, literally anyone, refer to the actual facts consistently proven and re-proven when they condemn him. Facts that have been purposely and consistently ignored by the corporate media in the evening news and daily papers--even in the context of their reviews of the movie, its unprecedented success as a documentary, or irrational personal attacks against him. Even the most intelligent and patriotic people on the opposite side of the fence revert to screaming children when critiquing this movie, totally ignoring the movie as a whole, or the most vivid and damaging of the facts within.<br /><br />The facts that make up this powerful and frightening documentary are too disturbing to be taken lightly. And yet the courage and artistry it takes to actually present these facts in an entertaining and informative way as Moore does is nothing short of astounding.<br /><br />Agree with it. Disagree with it. Call him names. Praise his name. Love him. Hate him. Just forget what you think about Michael Moore the person and see this movie, if you have ever once said you love this country. This movie is an absolute masterpiece--and undoubtedly the most important movie of any kind made in the past twenty years.  And given the Orwellian direction in which our democracy seems to be headed, owning a copy of it may have already left the realm of necessary luxury and become a moral imperative.the person and see this movie, if you have ever once said you love this country.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I love 'em all ! Each Star Wars film (IV, V,and VI) is awesome in it's own right. I refuse to pick at each one for technical flaws, character/creature flaws(Ewoks seemed outta place--- too cute and fuzzy for some film goers and critics), story plot, what Lucas did or didn't do (if he altered them or not from the originals) or any kind of flaws that so many fans and non-fans alike have done. WHO CARES !!!... So many directors and film creators have revised or re-edited their own classics with newer technical effects or director's cut versions, deleted scenes, etc. and have really botched the job or decision making and end product that really stick out like a sore thumb! I have seen all the different versions of these releases of Star Wars Trilogy over the years (from original to re-released to re-whatever). They too are spectacular in their own unique versions. Do I wish that Lucas had given us the option to have released these dvds with their original-original theatrical releases. You bet! (but then it probably would have rendered this new trilogy package at a costlier or premium price range)! Also, the bottom line is that these are Lucas' own master creations and films and he can do whatever he well pleases (and he has)---much to the chagrin of some viewers and critics. The end is that he has not done something that is so blasphemous (like Ted Turner colorizing old classic films----that WEREN'T EVEN HIS)... <br /> <br />As for the technical aspects of this dvd trilogy release, not enough or maybe too much has already been said about the praise as far as the overall picture quality and THX surround factors go. Seeing these films on dvd in my lifetime for the first time is a technical video marvel to enjoy and not chastise George Lucas or his ILM company. My copies don't have any of the flaws like \\"drastic color changes\\" within a scene, or a disc freezing up or skipping, etc. I'm sure there are an x amount of copies around with these flaws as stated by some owners (no dvd release on the manufacturing end is completely perfect)! <br /> <br />Just kick back and ENJOY this latest release on the DVD format !
B00003CXCT|4.0|I bought the Star Wars Trilogy the day it hit stores. I thought I'd have felt that buyers remorse by now but surprisingly, I haven't.  <br />I enjoyed watching the cleaned up, polished OT movies as much as I enjoyed watching them on home video years ago (on Betamax nonetheless!) I did not mind the digital additions too much. I saw most of them the first time in '97. I'm assuming most of you did as well because you're all whining about them so much. So I wasn't expecting Lucas to f__ with this release too much. <br />Actually, putting Ian McDarmid in ESB was a *good idea*. Adding Hayden Christiansen to the end of ROTJ was a *bad idea*. It goes to show you how uncharismatic this young man is that he managed to *blow* a cameo appearance by standing there with that malevolent smirk (his only expression?) which totally ruined the moment.  <br /> <br />Oh yes. The glaring omission. I thought Lucas would be kind enough to bring back the Ewoks 'jub jub' song at the end of ROTJ. I miss that song so much and to me it was a part of the experience way back then.  <br /> <br />Two thumbs up for the whole package, two thumbs down for leaving the 'jub jub' song omitted! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I just recently viewed this film because I kept hearing everyone talk about how good this movie was. Well I finally sat one day and watched it for myself. Lets see... how can I put this...Donnie Darko is one of those matrix type movies were you really have to pay attention, if not you can be completly lost in a blink of an eye. BUT, I think that is what intrigued me the most. Not being able to figure out what was going to happen in the end, unlike other predictable chick flicks, was all I needed to keep my attention. So over all I did enjoy this movie, just remember to pay attention.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Okay, it's star wars on DVD!! Great picture quality, awesome documentery, worth the $40. Duh. Now, about the digital changes? I'm too young to have seen the originals in the theatres but they still bug the hell out of me! Not because they're \\"messing with classics\\" but because they just plain look like crap! I cringe everytime I see the CG, it just looks awful and amaturish. It completely detracts from the viewing experience. If someone were not to have seen the earlier versions at all, they could still EASILY point out what was changed. Unless lucas can make the changes transparent, then he should not bother, it only makes the movie harder to watch! I prefer the look of the plastic models and low budget sets to the pristine digital look that has been chopped into the original trilogy and plagues the prequels. I mean what's the point of having some CG monster walk in front of the camera (completely blocking the action on screen) other than to say \\"look at what we can do!\\" Trust me, George, we're NOT impressed! Either make the changes less obvious or don't do them at all.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Enough of wondering how good this is.  It's the best.  Period.  There won't be a better release this year, and it will make lists in years to come for one of the best of the decade.  Seriously brilliant.  Seriously classic.  Must you suck by not getting it?  No.  You musn't.  To quote Hanibal Lector, \\"GO NOW!!\\" ...to the Funeral.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I don't have much to say about the movies,I'm happy Lucas finally put them out and that they're 're-touched and re-mastered' but you'd think more money would be put in the starwars packaging,the box set is kinda flimsy and we are suppose to keep these for a long time. He could've put more money into it to totally satisfy fans.And,please don't (...) about the movies being redone, after all at the end of the day they are 'his' movies an 'his' vision and he has the right to do whatever he wants to do to them.
B00000K2XB|5.0|Behold the eyes of Cesare, the somnambulist, as he awakens at the carnival that is the human city under the shadow of the future. His eyes are full of desolation and dread, utter frenzy, and something like the power of rape.  Cesare is a puppet - a homunculus of someone else's dreams.  He is a passive victim, whose body radiates pure violation.  Yet he is a taut monster, a creature of deprival that stalks the tortured landscapes of our dreams.  He is Frankenstein's monster who would drown us all as an act of love.  In this film we find out that our hopes have been pre-programmed by the those who would betray them.  We learn that our father figures are gods of doom and that the insane asylum is being run by those who are most insane - this , the most terrible of all the discoveries of modern man.  In this film there is no Number Six hell-bound and heaven bound on escape.  The drive for freedom has been destroyed before the film even begins.

0375414053|5.0|Alison Pearson creates an archetype in Kate Reddy.  With great care and emotion, Pearson guides us through a world of emotionally stunted financial types, overpaid nannies, needy-cherished-and-deeply-missed children, competitive stay-at-home moms, family, friendship, dreamy internet romance, and real-life marriage. <br />Unlike other reviewers who seem to want to tell the rest of us what great mothers they are, I will actually focus on the book.  I've actually read it twice, the first time because a friend recommended it, then again as part of a book club.  The two readings were about two years apart.  The first time I read it, I was angered by the ending- how dare Kate quit her job- she caved!  When I read it the second time, I saw quitting her job as the ultimate act of love to her self and her family.   <br />From the beautifully crafted descriptions of a mother's love for her child, to her laugh out loud funny lines about the workplace and the modern working woman, she gets right to the heart of what it means to be a woman in today's world with all the temptations, dilemmas,impossible standards, and heartache that go along with it.     <br />It's easy to pass judgement on Kate Reddy, most of the reviewers in this forum have, but you must remember that she is a FICTIONAL character (an archetype or composite) who acts as a mirror to many of us.  <br />This was a heartbreaking and, ultimately, uplifting book.
0679720200|2.0|No one can deny that the Stranger is a modern masterpiece. This review deals not with the merits of the work, but with the merits of the publication policy that forces teachers of this classic to adopt a new translation of stop teaching the classic. <br /> <br />One can also not deny that the Ward translation offered to us by Vintage as the only available translation of the classic is competent. This review is also not meant to be an attack on Ward's translation. It is, however, in my view, markedly inferior to the previous Gilbert translation as a work of art and in conveying Camus's spirit and intentions to modern readers. I recognize that this evaluation is open to debate among intelligent readers. The point of this review is that scholars and teachers of the book should be able to make the decision as to the relative merits of the translations by themselves, for reasons germane to the artwork, not publishers for reasons that have more to do with money. <br /> <br />When a publisher comes out with a new translation of a classic, they have an obligation to leave the old translation in print, or allow it to be published elsewhere, to allow readers to choose for themselves. <br /> <br />It is a travesty that a generation of readers instead of feeling the power and strangeness of the opening lines of the novel, \\"Mother died today, or maybe yesterday ...,\\"  will instead wonder what Maman is and what a strange word it is to American ears. <br /> <br />It is an even greater travesty that the publication of classics in translation has become like the publication of other textbooks, with a new edition forced upon us every few years for monetary reasons. The fans of Ward's translation should not be happy about this trend either. When the expiration its copyright appears on the horizon, or when too many used copies of it accumulate in college bookstores, we can expect it to share the same fate as Gilbert's. <br /> <br />Faculty teaching this classic, no matter what their choice of translation, should not stand by and allow their choice of texts to be taken out of their hands.
B000089770|5.0|Smoke is a great off beat film that took me by surprise.  I just happened to catch it on cable one day.  For those of you that live in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, you'll love seeing that part of town on film including the \\"J\\" train as it slowly creeps up the track towards the Williamsburgh Bridge and BedStuy off in the hazy distance and the old Williamsburgh Bank in the foreground.  It's a long lazy shot and I find myself sometimes watching that scene over and over again.  It's a beautiful shot of that part of Brooklyn.  Close enough to hear the train but far enough to keep the other city noises in the background.  Utterly beautiful! <br /> <br />This film is full of quirky characters.  Auggie (Harvey Keitel) is probably the most off beat and quirky of them all.  Stockard Channing gives a stunning performance as Auggie's ex girlfriend and Ashley Judd is brilliant, even though she only has one scene, as their drug addicted, poor and bitter daughter.  The film also stars William Hurt (Altered States), Harold Perrineau Jr, (Romeo&Juliet) and Forest Whitaker (Panic Room). <br /> <br />The most unexpected moment in Smoke is Auggie's Christmas story.  I don't want to give too much away but it's sad, touching and funny all at the same time.  Don't look for special effects, explosions, car chases or gun fights here.  There are none.  Just good storytelling. <br /> <br />Also interesting are the bonus attractions on the dvd.  Seeing the director (Wayne Wang) direct another director (Forest Whitaker) and watching Whitaker accept and discuss Wang's directions were especially captivating. <br /> <br />All in all, a lovely film to curl up with.  Enjoy!
B000002J03|1.0|Not so much the lemon song as the lemon album.  The most remarkable thing about Led Zep is that they can be regarded as a serious rock band when in fact they are so tediously average.  A Whole Lot of Love... come on.  This album is one big yawn.
B00003CXCT|3.0|After waiting this long (and paying so much), one has to wonder why the original versions were not released along with the so-called \\"special edition\\". <br /> <br />Seeing as those were the films that made Lucas his millions and broght him fame he'd treat them better then he does. <br /> <br />I wouldn't be surprised if we see more DVD releases of the original trilogy. Hopefully one of them shows the version fans, historians, and critics want to see on DVD. <br /> <br />The original theatrical releases deserve 5 stars. This one the other hand, doesn't. For being the inferior \\"completed versions\\", poor packaging, flawed sound transfer, and Vader's pink light saber I give this an average 3 stars.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I bought the trilogy 2 days ago.  I had some trouble at the midway point of ANH, but when I turned off my DVD player and turned it back on, it ran smoothly, starting from the exact point where it hiccupped.  Go figure. <br /> <br />I was recently talking to a friend about how Lucas would justify Boba Fett's voice being different from Jango's.  And I knew that for the theatrical re-releases additional footage was blended in to give the films a bit more of the director's flavor.  So, for this release, when I saw the new Emperor in ESB (with new lines), I was surprised to know that Lucas made even more changes.  But when Boba Fett busted out the Crocodile Hunter-esque \\"What if he doesn't survive?\\", I said, \\"This is just ridiculous!\\"  Pardon my saying so, but I prefer the original voice for the freaking MOST FEARED BOUNTY HUNTER IN THE GALAXY!  If anything, they should splice the original Boba Fett voice in Clones. <br /> <br />Anyway, this trilogy stands as a staple of American culture, and it is the same story at heart, and it still has all the moments that fill us with awe, and the story is more continuous for it, but I wish someone would shake George Lucas and tell him to stop making modifications to these classic films just because he has the means, motive and opportunity to do so!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I was as many looking forward to this album. But to me it was disapointing. It's to &quot;poppy&quot; if you like the new wave punk scene like Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte, you'll love this. If you want the angst ridden punk found on Dookie and Insomniac, buy those. The only real good thing is, you can still definatly tell Billie still loves his writing, it's still about real life, and earily captures how everyone feels at that point in time. So I give this 5*s for the writing, 3*s for sound. There are good sounding songs, but it just doesnt give the feel of the true GREEN DAY EXPERIENCE.

0066620996|5.0|In reading the reviews of this book you will likely think that either this book is a piece of trash, or a road map to being the greatest company on earth.  However, this book is neither.  What Jim Collins and his staff of researchers did was to analyze 1,435 companies that had appeared in the Fortune 500 to find 11 companies with a specific set of characteristics.  A couple of the most key characteristics were that these companies had to have been good performers for a number of years and then gone through a transition phase where they achieved well above industry average in performance sustained for at least 15 years.<br /><br />Once these 11 companies were chosen along with comparison companies, Jim Collins and his research team looked for common characteristics between these companies.  What they believe they found they defined as:  having level 5 leadership; having the right people in the company; confronting the brutal facts of their situation; defining what a company is good at; discipline; and the flywheel effect.  Collins also discusses the role of technology with an interesting conclusion.  While you could likely have guessed some of what they found, Collin's assertion is that a company that has transitioned from good to great and sustained that performance would have each of these characteristics.<br /><br />What makes this book a great read?  The support Collins provides for his conclusions.  Collins rigorously assembled facts and then attempted to infer the common factors between the selected companies.  While you may argue whether the selected companies will be great in the future, or whether other great companies exist that also made a good to great transition, the fact remains that he and his team did not waver in their criteria and they were able to observe the common characteristics that are described in this book.<br /><br />The greatest difficulty with the book is that it does not provide a roadmap for any particular company to make the transition.  The reader is left to determine how his company might be able to achieve the characteristics of a good-to-great company, or perhaps, how to eliminate the characteristics of a company that would prevent the company from being great, or perhaps even good.  One general point of agreement is that each of the defined characteristics is worthy of achieving.<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses in book.  One question that we asked (the leadership team of my company) was whether level 5 leadership could exist with second tier management and not with the top leader.  Collins seemed to think that the top leader in the company needed to be a level 5 leader, but we thought that a level 4 leader with a strong level 5 leadership at the second tier could well accomplish the same goal.  We also looked at the recent stock market performance of the 11 companies chosen and discovered that more recently some of these companies had performed very poorly.  We believe that an effective follow up to this book would be an analysis of companies that went from good to great to good or less than good to see whether a failure in one of the identified factors was the cause of the drop.<br /><br />This book offers a lot of thought-provoking information.  It is a widely-read book because of the methodology Collins used in his data collection.  It helps that this book is well-written and a quick read.  Neither makes this book a perfect business book, but certainly the conclusions should make us all consider how we can make our companies better.

B0002S943O|5.0|Yeah, the video footage is wierd even for them, and Dave was approaching walking pharmacy status at this point, but close your eyes and listen: you'll find that this is the best 90 minutes of music Depeche Mode has ever performed.  I'll just touch on a few highlights: <br /> <br />1. Everything Counts - While I never considered it among their best songs BEFORE hearing this show, the version on here ranks as 4 of the best minutes of music I've ever heard.  They seem to have added a darker synth harmony to it which, combined with \\"In Your Room\\" style drum and bass lines, make the song extremely haunting.  It BURIES the 101 version. <br />2. In Your Room - They actually perform the album version here.  Typically, they perform the single version, with Martin playing that noisy grunge guitar part.  Not here!!!  They do the album version, complete with the Enigma style synth solo in the middle.  Love it. <br />3. Walking in My Shoes - The backbeat starts, there's a guy walking around wearing a giant duck's beak on his face being projected onto the screens behind the band, and this intense little synth line plays and actually makes a skipping sound just before the main piano riff launches you into the song.  That decending line returns just before the song ends, and carries the intensity of the tune into the outro.  Going back and listening to the album version will be painful after this treat. <br />4. Both Judas and I Feel You feature Floyd-esque video footage which somehow fit the songs better than anything MTV could have handled.  The former showing candles melting in reverse, and the latter showing Dave in various poses, occasionally going haywire and fuzzing out during the noisy parts of the songs intro. <br />5. The intro.  WOW.  Imagine the most original rock concert intro you've ever seen.  This'll top it. <br /> <br />Forget Paris 01.  Forget Pasadena 88.  THIS is the Depeche Mode concert to own.  Like I said: it's the best 90 minutes of their entire career.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Yes, it is possible to dislike both George W. Bush *and* Michael Moore.  I did not vote for Bush in 2000 and will emphatically not be voting for him in 2004.  This does not, however, make me like \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" any better.  <br /> <br />Moore's movie is a repellent pseudo-documentary and a tragic lost opportunity.  What could have been an intelligent and witty film emerges instead as a sleazy hatchet job embodying all the journalistic ethics of a supermarket tabloid.  From the notorious fake \\"news clipping\\" (really a letter to the editor -- with a false date) to the deceptive editing to the continuous barrage of grossly misleading innuendos, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is a masterpiece of distortion and con artistry worthy of Bush himself.  <br /> <br />Dave Kopel has put together a widely-read list of \\"59 Deceits\\" in Moore's \\"documentary.\\"  Be sure to read the full version -- with extensive references -- at davekopel.com, not the brief PDF summary.  It's true that Kopel includes some minor and debatable points, but most of the complaints are fair -- and devastating. <br /> <br />Moore's \\"Factual Back-Up\\" on his Web site (michaelmoore.com) is fascinating, in a perverse way.  He simply ignores many of the serious flaws noted by Kopel and others, while offering proof of other facts that no one has disputed.  Most amusing is his brazen audacity in citing references that actually *undermine* his position.  To defend his statement that \\"Gore got the most votes in 2000,\\" Moore quotes from articles entitled \\"Recount Provides No Firm Answers\\" and \\"Review of Ballots Finds Bush's Win Would Have Endured Manual Recount.\\"  No kidding!  Check it out for yourself. <br /> <br />Of course Moore falls back on selective quotation when necessary.  For example, no one disputes that Fox was the first network to call Florida for Bush, but Moore conveniently omits the fact that CNN and CBS were the first to retract it for Gore.  Moore's \\"Factual Back-Up\\" is a jewel of misdirection; he simply omits the following key segment from page 15 of the CNN report he cites: <br /> <br />\\"9:54 p.m.: The Decision Team recommends that CNN and CBS retract their Florida calls for Gore.  The two do so and are the first networks to retract ....\\" <br /> <br />It is depressing to think that more people saw this trashy schlock on its opening weekend than will *ever* see Jhally and Earp's superb anti-Bush documentary \\"Hijacking Catastrophe.\\" <br />

B00003CXCT|3.0|I bought this at a retail store and watched Empire and it was ok.  Then I put in A New Hope and 57 minutes into the movie, it paused and restarted from the beginning.  I went to chapter 27 and reversed it to a little bit after the error and it did it again.  I returned it today and the lady said \\"Oh, another one\\".  Apparently somebody else had the same problem I did but on A New Hope and Empire.  However, the exchanged version of A New Hope did not have the same problem.   Beware!  Watch all 3 movies before you throw away your receipt.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Looking at these new movies, it's obvious that it sure as heck wasn't just Lucas that made the originals so great. I would send these expensive coasters back if I could. <br /> <br />Instead, I have bought a laserdisk player and the original theatrical versions on laserdisk, secondhand, and will burn them to DVDs to preserve forever. <br /> <br />I have a feeling a small cottage industry is going to form around digital copies of the original movies. Shame that they may never be released on DVD, but I for one, will preserve the originals for future generations.
0800177177|1.0|I suppose if I had never read Bram Stoker's novel then I would be praising this movie for being so \\"faithful\\" to it just like so many of the reviewers here.  But I have read the book several times so I know how far off the mark this dreadful movie is.   <br /> <br />Dracula was never a swinging Transylvanian playboy in the novel but in this movie the character was so ineptly presented that I found myself expecting to see Dan Akroyd and Steve Martin show up as the Festrunk brothers to help Drac look for \\"wild english foxes\\".  Not that the shrivelled old grandmother Dracula with the kooky crimson robe and breakdancing shadow was any better.  Everything about the Dracula character was awful in this movie.   <br /> <br />The supporting cast was not much better although I'll say a good word about Bill Campbell.  It was a pleasure to see Quincy Morris in the action and an added joy that Campbell was able to refrain from the camp overacting favored by Anthony Hopkins.  Hopkins was simply dreadful as Prof. van Helsing in a role that was apparently written with Rip Taylor in mind.   <br /> <br />The narrative bears only the slightest resemblance to Stoker's novel in that there is a vampire who comes to England, causes trouble and then flees for home, chased by a band of friends.  A pity because the book would really make a wonderful movie if somebody had the guts to do it.   <br /> <br />Avoid this one at all costs.   <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|Through the first listen of the CD I was actually a bit disappointed, but after taking a closer second look, the CD is actually a very good album.  If you are looking for old Green Day, good luck, you will find about two tracks of old Green Day.  It seems the major problem with people who consider themselves into punk today is that they don't keep an open ear to music, trying to maintain some sort of \\"punk purity\\".<br /><br />Unlike Bad Religion's new ablum \\"Empire Strikes First\\", this is not an album ranting against Bush on every other tracks, in fact, most of it is talking about loneliness and alienation, looking into the lives of three characters, Jesus Of Suburbia, Saint Jimmy, and Whatsername.  They are introduced through almost theme songs of their lives, and they are all shown through the rest of the album to have flaws.  They are also self-destructive in some manner.<br /><br />Although the sound is not punk, the attitude is.  Artists, even Green Day grow.  What if Joe Strummer never got past the album The Clash UK/US in terms of music, we would not have London Calling, or any of his work with the Mescaleros.  Though, Green Day is no Clash, and I doubt I could listen to this CD as many times in a row as London Calling, they are taking their music to a new level.
0345350499|1.0|While Zimmer Bradley is a gifted writer, she should never have dabbled in a subject she knows nothing about.  I would have given this book a higher rating for the prose alone if it had been presented properly -- it should have been found in the New Age section or, better still, should not have been passed off as fantasy based in historical fact.  There isn't a single thing in this book that was historically accurate.  While post-feminists gush over the concept of a peaceful goddess religion in tune with a post-industrial romanticism of nature and modern notions of femininity, the fact of the matter is that such a religion is entirely a twentieth-century invention.  Rather than spending time with a gaggle of 'sisters' who still think the discredited Margaret Murray is a reliable source, Zimmer-Bradley  should have taken a trip down to her local public library and looked up Anne Ross's Pagan Celtic Britain.  It would have been less embarrassing to learn before she committed her book to print that the historical, real life Arthur was most likely a sixth century Scottish king (and a Christian, of all horrors) who never set foot in Glastonbury Tor and its glaring lack of archaeological evidence.  Even more so by being unable to make up her mind between using Celtic names (Gwenhyfar) and French ones (Vivianne).      But what is even worse is that the very culture Bradley bastardises in her book was a wholly *masculine* one.  Though various Celtic tribes have distinct differences, none were matriarchal and every one of them was ruled by male clan chieftans.  And while individual goddesses had followers and even cults, they were a far cry from the smorgasboard New Age goddess religion of today -- there was NO concept of a singular Goddess, certainly none where goddesses with distinct personalities were lumped together into a single 'Great Goddess'.  Lastly, the concept of the natural world in the novel is likewise a modern fabrication that Zimmer-Bradley naively swallowed whole: a post-industrial romantic worldview that would have been completely alien to ancient peoples and especially the Celts.  The Celtic tribes had no sense of 'sacred ground' -- to them, the whole of the earth was sacred.  They had no high priests, believing each person interceding the gods on their own behalf.    This novel represents wishful thinking and romantic delusion at its finest, and the reader who is able to suspend her disbelief and not take the dubious 'history' very seriously will probably enjoy this novel far more than I.  However, the reader who is interested in a genuine understanding of Celtic Britain is far better off reading one of Morgan Llywelyn's excellent and well-researched novels (Llywelyn provides extensive bibliographies at the end of her novels with serious scolarly sources that are historically accurate, and more to the point, is an actual Celt).      In fact, I can recommend an even better 'tale of Arthur from a feminine perspective': the source material itself.  Jeffrey Gantz's translation of the Welsh Mabinogion from which the Arthurian cycle is taken is not only a delightful read with sympathetic, three-dimensional female characters, but it has been theorised that the tales (taken from an eleventh century manuscript) were possibly written by a woman.  The difference between this novel and the Mabinogion is that the while the latter conjures images of an aged and crumbling Welsh caer and untamed moorlands, the former conjures manicured lawns and Sleeping Beauty's Castle in Disneyland.  One is the genuine article, the other the literary tourist trap.
B00005JN7O|5.0|This one went on my \\"must-watch\\" list from the moment I laid eyes on the trailer. It wasn't the cast the caught my eye, as I was a fan of none of them. The visuals grabbed my attention, sure, but visuals alone would not have kept it. No, it was the sheer sense of unabashed, heart-on-your-sleeve delight that the film apparently took in its 1930's serial inspirations. <br /> <br />Six months later, all I can say is...it's been well worth the wait, and more. <br /> <br />This is a gorgeous, rousing hi-tech marvel with good old-fashioned sensibilities at its heart. Every frame is stunningly put together, with a sense of light, color, and composition that elevates it far above any pedestrian depiction of a scene. The characters may suffer no angst, but neither do they need to for a movie like this; we're told just enough, and given enough unspoken hints, for us to get behind the protagonists and cheer them on. The visual effects are incredible--I knew beforehand that much of it was CGI, but not to what extent; during the movie I picked out a handful of scenes (besides the obvious stylized ones) that looked \\"too\\" CGI, but in an all-CGI film, a handful is nothing. There are a few things I could quibble with--the resolution of a scene here, some aspects of Polly's character there--but overall I really can't complain. <br /> <br />What drew me into the trailer was also ultimately what made the film truly click for me--the movie's whole-hearted revelling in the 1930's adventure serial genre, and its invitation to us to do the same. There's nothing the least bit cold, off-putting, or distancing about a CGI-heavy film with as much heart as this. Flying over maps, giant wing-flapping planes, visible radio waves, dedicated heroes...all are presented with a refreshing lack of irony (and a fabulous supporting score), and I was right along for the ride.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I got this album yesterday at around noon.  Nearly 24 hours have passed and I must have listened to it at least 5 times already.  I love it.   <br /> <br />I love old Green Day and new stuff alike.  I'm glad that it doesn't sound like their old albums, but still sounds like Green Day.  That's the mark of a great band, it's evolution and it's good thing.  Much like the Chili Peppers evolved (i.e., Anthony became a much better singer) and the Beastie Boys evolved (they learned how to play their instruments), here on this album Green Day makes a leap in their arrangements and lyrics while still maintaining their style.   <br /> <br />Believe it or not, not all of the songs are under 3 minutes and consist of 3 chords, which is something Green Day made into an institution.  Lyrically Billy Joe has always been clever, but here he throws out subtlety completely on the title track and a couple others.  At the same time, the whole album is not too scathing.  There's some straight-up brilliant songs on it.  I'm willing to predict that \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" will be a huge hit.  I can already imagine hearing it in a TV promo for Fox Football Sunday, or at the grocery store. <br /> <br />The year's not yet over, but I would be willing to call this release the album of the year.

0440237688|4.0|I think it's a good book because it tells a beautiful story very well.  The story could be percieved as an anti-communist book, showing how sameness is bad for people.  The story is enriched by the main character as he learns how things used to be.  A very good book that shows how emotions are important to human beings, so we don't becoem robots.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I thought the films looked and sounded great. I didnt like the new Emperor scene in Empire, but everything else I can live with. Ultimatley I would prefer the originals, but at least they did fix some stuff from the 1997 re-releases. Best fix up is the Rancor scene it doesnt look so fake when both Rancor and Luke are in the same shot. I read someone on here complaining about a botched scene with teh millenium falcon and tie fighters, I just checked it out and didnt notice anything? Biggest dissappointment is the lacking of real nostalgi extras, like no xmas special or orginal making of featurettes.
0380789035|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I had read (and loved) Gaiman's Adams-esque \\"Good Omens.\\"  However, comparisons must be avoided.  This book is in a different ballpark.<br /><br />First of all, the world which Gaiman creates is so engaging.  When I finished the book, I found that I missed visiting his world in a way I don't recall experiencing with any other book.<br /><br />Secondly, the story is fascinating.  Mixing ancient mythology (a hobby of mine) and great story-telling, he weaves a yarn which works on many levels: sociological commentary on mankind, modern fable, and so on.<br /><br />His style is good, although he's perhaps no Bradbury or Cervantes; but the story is so compelling and his imagination so engrossing that I cannot but highly reccommend it.  However, I ought to point out that it is a very graphic book, with some bizarre sexual situations and a lot of violence and language.  Watch out for that.  But all told, a great book.
B00002E233|5.0|I loved this movie! My brother saw it with his friends when it came out, and I loved movies like these but was not able to see rated R movies, but my mother made &amp;amp; exception because my bro saw it first and said that it good, this movie is probbly the most realalistic when it comes to the sharks, shark attack scene's and special effect's, the cast was great, and the cast is &amp;amp; inportent part of a movie, with a bad cast it reck's the whole movie, but everything about this movie rocked, the shark's are so real, it's scary, I'm still shaky about going in the water, the shark's are anamatronic, outside of the really gruseum attack's, that's another thing, if you like movies like this and want violence, gut's, blood, gore and scary diolouge, then this movie will be your favorite, I own the movie, and just to let you know about the badder stuff in it, such as Profanity and Sexual content here's the 411, they have the F- word in it 4 times, though on of the time it is not clear because the man is gasping for air when he say's it, it has G-D- in it like 3 times, (YUCK!) and other not so bad languge that you can watch on t.v., and as far as sexual content, there is none, except when a girl takes her clothes off so her clothes don't catch on fire, but she's in her underwear, you could see that part on t.v., that's another thing, DON'T WATCH IT ON T.V.! They butcher the scene's, it ruin's the movie, watch it on dvd, they take out a few shark attack scene's, This movie is probbly my favorite in this genera, all in all, it rock's WATCH IT! NOT ON T.V.!
6304539282|5.0|Ok, i have the DVDs, they're sitting on the floor waiting to be used. I haven't watched them yet, so the 5 stars is purely based on my viewing of the special edition versions on VHS. Despite getting the DVDs on the day they came out, i just can't bring myself to watch them. I know about Greedo, the new Jabba, the pink lightsaber, Anakin's ghost and other anomalies. I'm hoping that when i watch them, i won't be disapointed. I have a feeling i will. It's the same feeling i got when my PS2 broke and i converted to an xbox, transfering all my games only to realise silent hill 3 would not be released on xbox. So here i am stuck with 2 and 4 but no 3! I (...) like things to be orderly and neat. I also hate being cheated of great scenes in a film. Believe it or not, but i actually preferred the pink jabba with bulging eyes to the squinty eyed, shiney piece of s**t from episode 1. I never dreamt that the films would change so much, there was nothing wrong with the 1997 special edition films so why change things again. Why on earth fix something that isn't broken? George can do what he likes but it gets to a point where he just needs to accept what he's got and move on. Make Star Wars sequels, that's what everyone wants! Use your computer technology to make the original actors 30 years younger and continue from where ROTJ left off! Ok, that's going a bit far but it had to be said. The main qualm i have about the changed DVDs is that these are the versions that will be seen by future generations. I would want my children to see the films the way i saw them, with Han Solo frying Greedo without so much as twitching a muscle. That was a great scene and is now wrecked. Anyway, one more thing, the packaging is rubbish. Flismy or what! I'm even considering ditching the box and putting the DVDs in the holder with my others. At least then i can have all 6 films together without spending more money on box sets. I was going to sell my gold 1997 special edition collectors box when the DVDs came out, now i think i'll keep them, hidden somewhere safe.
B00006DEFA|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I just thought it was cute. Then as I continued my studies in Theatre... I fell in LOVE with Peter Shaffer (playwright) and Tom Hulse (Mozart)! He is the most wonderful and delightful actor I know! This movie was brilliantly shot and is just... a Classic movie everyone should have in their home! PLEASE.... PLEASE SEE IT! If not for the Historical value of the MOST AMAZING composer in history... then for the amazing music (There is SO much of Mozart's music and Operatic pieces) and brilliant acting and directing!!
6303534422|5.0|A goofie Movie is an excellent collaboration of fantastic original music and hilarious quotable lines. It is one of the funniest disney, or any movie, of all times. And it is entirely appropriate for all ages. Everyone, everywhere will most certainly enjoy this. And, you will surely be singing along to all the great 'Powerline' hits.
B00000273M|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THE BANGLES THEY ARE A COOL GIRL ROCK GROUP. I LOVE THIS CD IT IS GOOD. MY FAVORITE SONGS AND THE HAZY SAHDE OF WINTER, MANIC MONDAY, ETERNAL FLAME, AND WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN . THESE WERE ALL COOL SONGS. I LIKE THIS CD IF YOU LIKE THE BANGLES BACK IN THE DAY THEN YOU DEFINITELY LIKE THIS ALBUM.
0440237688|4.0|When I first began the Giver, I was not entirely sure that I liked it. The Community was so orderly and repressed, not my usual type of story. However, by the time I was about halfway through, I had come to really like the story. Jonas, the lead character grows and matures, drawing in the audience in the process. The missing pieces fit together, and by the intriguing conclusion, the reader is sure to be rooting for Jonas. I recomend this to everyone, it is a really great book!
B00003CXAT|4.0|Nearly 10 years on, this Spielberg classic is rivalled only by Jaws for originality, tension, and superb performances. Richard Attenborough plays the stoic billionaire who has discovered how to extract dinosaur DNA from a mosquito fossilised in tree amber, and decides to bankroll a genetics created theme park to wow the World. As always, with these schemes, you should listen to the age old maxim \\"Don't mess with Mother Nature\\" and despite the remote Island Location, the huge Reptiles get loose, and go on the rampage. This was the first and definitely best in the series of 3 movies, and I almost wish they'd stopped here, where the trilogy arguably peaked. Wonderfully realistic CGI blends seamlessly with superb acting performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (to name but a few). The best thing about this picture is it's longevity however. Like \\"Jaws\\" it is a non topical and timeless adventure for the whole family (with the exception of very small children). It's gripping, and often scary without being offensive or gratuitous and will undoubtedly be rediscovered by each succesive generation of viewers. Deservedly hailed now as a classic piece of Cinema. A great movie at a great price. Enjoy!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I just recieved my copy yesterday, and I am very pleased. They finnally are the films they were meant to be. Yeah, there are the changes, but these changes are for the best. And yeah, it is not the original relase, but those in the eyes of Lucas, were half baked jobs. These are the final product. However, it would have been nice if some of the deleted scenes, like the approch to the ships in the sand storm in ROTJ were put back in. Heck that scene was even part of the original trailers from the 1980's. But that being neither here nor there, these are a nessecity for any serious DVD collector.
B0002EXH5E|5.0|Most metal fans will say that \\"Risk\\" was Megadeth's worst album. Personally I disagree. I consider myself first and foremost a Megadeth fan, THEN a metal fan. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you're looking for the old fashioned Megadeth thrash music then Risk isn't for you, but I have to say that this is one of Megadeth's best albums. <br /> <br /> Most people will just say that the only good song on the album is \\"Crush 'em.\\" That'sa great song, but not the only one. <br /> <br /> \\"Insomnia\\" is a perfect song to start off the album with, it may not be the same as \\"Loved to Deth\\" but it gets the job done. I've always considered \\"Prince of Darkness\\" to be kind of cheesy, but it's a good song nonetheless. <br /> <br /> \\"Enter the Arena\\" in simply an intro to \\"Crush 'em\\" which I won't comment on b/c everyone else has. <br /> <br /> \\"Breadline\\" might be one of my favorite songs on the album. The haunting tones just struck a cord with me. \\"The Doctor's Calling\\" is another great song, even for you metal-elitists out there. \\"Wanderlust\\" and \\"I'll be There\\" are two hugely underrated songs (especially the former). <br /> <br /> \\"Ecstasy\\" is perhaps my second favorite song on the album, and \\"Seven\\" is awesome. Both \\"Time\\" songs are good, though I consider them to be some of the weaker songs on the album. <br /> <br /> I can understand how some people may not like this album, but it will always be one of my favorites.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Just finished viewing the sneak of \\"Episode\\" 3, and when we saw Hayden Christensen decked out in Darth Vader's costume, the room ERUPTED in laughter. Has there EVER been an actor so wantonly, and grossly miscast? There is absolutely no menace, no snarl, no underlying tones of darkness in the posture, eyes, face, or voice of Hayden Christensen. No edge AT ALL. Lucas, how COULD you send a BOY to do a MAN'S job? Oh, wait, that's right - you're the same \\"genius\\" responsible for destroying a legacy. Your poor casting choices should not and DO NOT come as any surprise. I cannot wait until \\"Episode\\" 3 opens in theaters. The feelings of awe and wonderment that should have been, will now be replaced with howls of derisive, scornful LAUGHTER. Can't blame Hayden though; his participation in these films has locked in his meal ticket for the rest of his life. If he (or Ewan MacGregor for that matter) had any integrity, they would have bowed their heads in shame and refused to cooperate in the ineptitude that has become George Lucas' whimsy. What an utterly tragic way to end it. Really, the best thing one can do is pretend the prequels were never made. At best, after watching the horror that is Phantom Menace / Attack Of The Clones, and probably \\"Sith\\", you can tell yourself that the storytelling DOES get better. But even then, you'll have to search and scrap to find the real and the true Star Wars. The original films are what have endured; it is the originals that have made Lucas RICH; to deny the countless millions of fans what's true and dear, is an out and out travesty and disgrace.
B00004RFFI|3.0|I was interested to read another viewers comments about Helen Hunts character in this movie, being interested in Tornadoes, because she witnessed her father being sucked away by one as a child. This is the biggest flaw in this otherwise fairly good escapist flick. I wonder why the Hollywood moguls think we have to have these back stories and then a dreary romance effort, in the midst of carnage, much like the more recent Day After Tomorrow. Was every weatherman inspired by a lightning bolt that killed his dog? Are Lumberjacks so inspired because a tree fell on their brother? the list of possibilities is endless. This could have, and SHOULD have been a great movie. The script and story in general aren't bad, and the special effects are of course impressive. This is a movie remember, so those who want to be disparaging about the lack of similarities to \\"real\\" storm chasers should wake up. I for one don't want to see a movie about someone sitting in a field all day waiting for weather. That said, the movies penchant for trying to walk a middle line here (not quite disaster movie, not quite love drama) leaves BOTH areas unfulfilled. Will Helen Hunt get back with Bill Paxton? will his new fiance run away? Will they beat the much better equipped and funded competition to the punch? Will they find a \\"Finger 5\\" tornado? - Frankly I stopped caring. I wanted to see a movie about a Twister, and although I was expecting something predictable, this was just too much, and that's a real shame. Getting a DVD makeover means of course clearer picture and sound, and those with a 5:1 system at home will doubtless get a lot from the reproduction here. trouble is however, it won't matter how you watch it, it's still a let down - I wanted to give more but 3 Stars is a stretch, and that's mainly for the CGI.
B00000K2W1|3.0|<br />When I was young I use to wonder who this hippie chick that my father is playing on vinyl. I fell in love with her music instantly because she was different and she made music \\"free\\". Now that I'm older I still till this day listen to her music and just recently purchased this album to have a piece of history. I just wish that they included additonal songs that she sang with Big Brother cause these 12 weren't the only ones that made her who she was. <br /> <br />Her music was raw and so so real, this is a piece of history in music that will last for centuries to come.

B00005JLEX|4.0|If television serves only to fill the void between commercials, as others more eloquent than myself have said, then Seinfeld is right up there with the best \\"fillers\\" of TV sitcoms of recent years. Having seen most, if not all of the episodes on reruns I am pleased to see the upcoming DVD release, finally being made available. What I am looking forward to most of all however, is the original episode length - most reruns are trimmed to allow for the aforementioned commercials on non network stations, and even episodes you may have seen countless times, feel more complete. Comparing the original network shows with reruns is almost like a \\"directors cut\\" I noticed little nuances and subtle scenes that made what were previously often disjointed episodes, make more sense - often with hilarious portions trimmed. The \\"show about nothing\\" as it was billed was hugely succesful, and like others I concur with some criticisms levelled toward the more fantastical plots (especially after season 3). All that said, if you are a fan, this will be an essential purchase. The DVD set is billed as being loaded with extra's from commercials to featurettes, and the all round package represents pretty good value. I am looking forward to getting the set, but will say that as much as I like Seinfelds wry observaional comedy, I think watching the whole first seasons back to back would be a bit numbing. However, as a long term viewing investment, I don't think any lover of great TV comedy will go wrong here. Enjoy!
0393035158|5.0|I deeply admire Sam Harris for writing this profound and extraordinarily important book. Few writers have the courage to tell the truth about religion and its anti-science, anti-intellectual roots. This book is a warning to the multitudes who foolishly view religion as a positive force in the world. Mr. Harris aptly points out that, although individual members of any particular religion may be quite ethical and admirable people, the major religions as a whole have been a moral abomination to mankind and quite literally now threaten the future of our planet.<br /><br />Innumerable other customer reviews have sung the praises of this wonderful volume. And I wish to add my own 5-star rating as well. But instead of echoing what others have said thus far, let me address how you, as a potential buyer of this book, should view the \\"official\\" Publishers Weekly review posted on this Amazon page. The Publishers Weekly reviewer should be perceived clearly as a perfect example of why religion is sending us all to hell (metaphorically speaking). The reviewer was obviously offended by the book because he is himself wallowing in religious superstition and ignorance. His objections to this book were based solely upon raw, uncultivated emotion, rather than any substantive objection to the content of the book. Ironically, the Publishers Weekly reviewer thereby proved (unwittingly) many of the points Sam Harris made in the book regarding religion's leading to undeserved and unjust prejudice and bigotry.<br /><br />This is one of the finest books I've ever read. Regardless of your personal religious beliefs -- or lack thereof -- you will benefit immeasurably from this priceless volume. I only wish I'd written it myself!<br /><br />David Mills<br /><br />Author of \\"Atheist Universe\\"
B000244EMO|4.0|Even more \\"beefed\\" than usual here, Arnie leads a bunch of elite Mercenaries on a rescue mission, into deep Jungle terrain, somewhere in South America. Trouble is, this is actually a ruse by former teammate Carl Weathers, to do some shameless weeding of gun runners south of the border, and the \\"honorable mercenary\\" Arnie is justifiably miffed for getting duped. More trouble is that the preceeding team of Soldiers were inexplicably wiped out and skinned by what we soon to discover is a very formidable (and not human) opponent. The action turns here into an escape movie, as Arnie and his team try to make there way to safety, and are hunted by the alien \\"Predator\\" of the title. The action is thick & fast, the special effects visceral, and the language more than colorful. This is a macho romp sure, but a good one - regardless of how over the top the characters are made out to be, the acting performances are spot on. Best of all is that this was a \\"scary\\" movie, that had you on the edge of your seat, and was gory and frightening to boot. Perhaps it is a sign of the times, that even with the advances in CGI, if this were made today, it would be a watered down version carrying a PG tag, attempting to make more money by reaching a wider audience(like this years Alien vs Predator). Maybe I'm wrong, but this is a horror film folks, should anybody under 17 be watching anyway??. The DVD itself is a let down, and looks like it should be in a cardboard sleeve in a dollar store - that's a real shame. If you want to see Arnie at his bone crunching and predictable best - this is it - Great Movie. Enjoy
B00003CXCT|4.0|This is a nice boxed set.  It has a lot of nice extra features on one of the discs.  The other three contain episodes four, five, and six of the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise.  Sure, they've been tampered with by Lucas, but they are HIS movies.  Gripe over it all you want, but at the end of the day you're going to buy this set because you want it, no matter what changes Lucas has made.  I don't like all of the changes, but some of them are very good and add to the story.  Other folks have cried about the \\"original\\" versions of these films.  The originals were great, and they deserved to be recognized as such.  However, there have been advancements in special effects and Lucas has every right to tweek HIS films any way that he wishes.<br /><br />You already know these stories, and some of you probably dress up and play them out frame by frame.  The sad thing is is that no matter what Lucas does, the purists will not be satisfied.  Some of them want the old film blurbs in the scenes, others don't.  Some folks want more scenes with Biggs in \\"A New Hope,\\" others don't. Blah, blah, blah.  Once you realize that Lucas has already made more than enough money on these flicks(and every tie-in known to man), maybe then you'll see that he doesn't care what folks think anymore.  He's going to do what he wants because he can, and that's his God-given right.<br /><br />So, in closing, if you loved the original films and hate the great Satan that is George Lucas, don't buy this set.  If you liked the updated versions released in the 90's and altered by billionaire George Lucas, buy this set.  If you're just collecting anything \\"Star Wars\\" in your parents' basement so that you can pretend to be Luke when you get off of work at the comic shop and pray at the foot of your altar to Boba Fett, get this set.  If you take this stuff way too seriously and want to off George Lucas for his immoral raping of classic cinema, skip this set and find a good shrink.  If you're just an average person who likes good action/sci-fi/fantasy with a great storyline who is willing to look beyond all of the changes made by a guy named George Lucas, get this set.<br /><br />Hope this helps out everybody.  Thanks for reading.ho likes good action/sci-fi/fantasy with a great storyline who is willing to look beyond all of the changes made by a guy named George Lucas, get this set. <br /> <br />Hope this helps out everybody.

B0001I561E|5.0|Just viewed the video for \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" online at Netscape.com, which video is included on the DVD.  Aiken again amazes us with his talent. His video recording of \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is fabulous vintage Disney! Sensitive, awe inspiring, lyrical, poignant, passionate, and utterly beautiful--the song is a showcase for Aiken's wonderful, wonderful talent! What a guy, what a soul, what a heart, what a voice. We are blessed to watch him grow as an artist, person, and man. How can we not love Aiken? He will make your heart sing!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Remember when Greedo shot first ? or when there was an extra ewok song? or when Boba Fett didn't have a new zelander accent? These things are wonderful memories.  All this aside lets take this box set for what its worth, a classic movie with a brush of new school.  Every thing about the movies are brilliant (or lucky?) and inspired (or stolen?).  With all the changes they are still the essence of what once was.  Lets face it, you still want to sit forward on your seat and go \\"WHAT?!?!\\" when Darth Vader says \\" NO, I am your father\\".  Its classic moments like this that make Star Wars great.  If lucas wants this to be what is remembered then i guess thats what it is.  If he feels the need to relese the orginals then great.  But either way we should be happy at all that we got them on dvd.  The picture is astounding.  Simply put it doesn't look like it was shot in 1977.  And the sound, lets put it this way, i love to hear the tie fighters blasting right behind me and the huge BOOM of the death star exploding.<br />Everything about this new release is great.<br /><br />So onward to Episode 3.  Lets hope Lucas comes through and brings us some thing as magical as A new hope.<br />I can't wait and see how he pulls this together.<br />So enjoy the new dvd's thier worth the purchase and they will be worth it for awhile.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Anyone who gave this movie less than three and a half stars deserves to get thier eye balls pulled out of thier sockets. You can't front on Tarantino's skills and you don't deserve to watch another movie for the rest of your lives. <br /> <br />Pai Mei is laughing at you from his mountain in the clouds. <br /> <br />werd!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Ok first of all, these movies are cool. Classic to say the least, but to go as far as saying the best movies ever made...LMFAO I feel sorry for you. I have 433 dvds and I can pick out at least 200 that are much better then star wars. I just bought the trilogy to add to my ever so growing collection. I was very displeased with the cheap packaging. The art is horrible and cheaply put together. The artwork in the cases was done pretty bad, un even spines that dont even line up perfectly, logos titles etc. If it were not for my creativity in creating custom cases it would be even more disapointing. They obviously rushed this release a little bit too fast...rant rant rant..
B0002OERI0|5.0|A lot of people have been slating this record for its political \\"sub-plot\\", but the reasons for this totally escape me. The references are so minor and non-obvious that even if I disagreed with Billie Joe's point of view, I would find it very hard to be offended. This record was not intended as political statement in the same way that you'd expect from an anti-flag record or RATM for that matter. There are a couple of songs with what I would call a minor political agenda, but they don't ever go beyond the expression of Billie Joe's feelings about being an American in today's world. <br /> <br />If anything, this album cements my long standing feeling that Green Day have an ability to take their sound (and their style) in a different direction with every release. When you look at this album in the context of their career thus far, you can't help but marvel at how they have grown and a generation of fans has grown with them. The little stylistic touches take this from a \\"good\\" to a \\"great\\" release. One thing I noticed (which I haven't seen Green Day do before) was lyrical themes spanning several songs. I thought this was a refreshing idea considering the modern music industry emphasis on creating albums full of potential singles, as many of these tracks are at their best when listened to in album order.  <br /> <br />The production on this album is brilliant. <br /> <br />American Idiot is a reminder that in a time where fickle trends and revivalist BS rule the 'rock' charts, Green Day still have something new and exciting to offer which is as relevant to us today as dookie was in 1994. Go buy it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It appears messing with a classic has created mixed feelings among fans even if the guy that did it made these films. The \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" has been accused of being recycled garbage and the reason that movies have been dumbed down \\"events\\". It's also been applauded for bringing fun back to movies even as it tackles some themes common to more serious films. Naw. They're both wrong. The \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" is just plain fun. Lucas attempted to recapture the wonder and excitement of cliffhangers all the while dealing with some heavy duty stuff he read in Joseph Campbell's books on mythology and heroes.<br /><br />I don't believe I have to recap the story here. Let's move on to how the discs look and sound. The big question outside of the quality of the DVDs is has it been changed yet again? Yep. The optical effects have been spiffed up one more time making the film look even better than before. It's not on the scale of the first facelift these films received when it was reissued in 1997. Voices and images have been replaced and the sound remixed as part of Lucas' attempt to make these three films more consistent with the prequels he did. \\"Star Wars\\" has become so much a part of our modern mythology that there's really nothing critical I can say and it wouldn't really matter. It's a pity that Lucas didn't release these versions along with the original theatrical cuts that played in 1977, 1980 and 1983.<br /><br /> First off, all three films look terrific. It's clear a lot of care went into these transfers. The image quality is smooth and, although it's clear these were transferred from film, there's little of the omnipresent grain that hints at an optical effect. Secondly, the depth, clarity and sharpness are among the best I've seen in a DVD transfer. There's minimal edge enhancement and it's rarely distracting like some other recent releases. Comparing this edition to the previously released laserdisc and video editions of the film, the DVD collection is like comparing a rich desert to a candy bar. While they both taste sweet, the desert belongs to a completely different class altogether.  The sound is, for the most part, outstanding. The website The Digital Bits indicated that there were some issues with the sound. Lucasfilm responded that the soundtrack was remixed a bit for this edition. While these moments are a bit distracting, they don't impact the overall experience of the movie. Overall, after a long, long wait \\"The Star Wars Trilogy\\" on DVD was well worth the wait.<br /><br /> With a 150 minute documentary discussing the creation of the \\"Star Wars\\" universe from conception to execution, \\"Empire of Dreams\\" is among the best original and most exhaustive documentaries ever on a film series. The documentary has loads of behind-the-scenes footage shot on locations and sets for all three films. I'm surprised at how much documentation exists for \\"A New Hope\\" as it was the first in the trilogy and Lucas had no idea if he was going to be able to make any additional films in the saga. Lucas discusses the script itself and how the three films in the series all have their genesis in the 200 page script Lucas wrote. Since he couldn't possibly get a green light for a 200 minute movie, he broke the script into its three acts borrowing the conclusion of the Death Star destruction from the end of the script and transposing it to the end of \\"A New Hope\\". There's also an Easter Egg on the fourth disc. Go to the menu where you can select the games. Browse over to main menu but don't push enter. Instead, hit the \\"10\\" on your remote and enter \\"11\\". This will take you to a spot next to main menu where you enter \\"38\\". Hit enter and you'll be takent to the DVD credits where there is about two minutes of bloopers from all three films.<br /><br />Original producer Gary Kurtz, optical effects wizards Dennis Muren and John Dykstra along with various crew and model makers are interviewed for the film discussing the creation of ILM in Van Nuys, California.  We also get three marvelous featurettes, a sneak peak at the new \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" (with Hayden Christiansen suiting up as Vader) as well as a sneak peak at the new X-Box game \\"Star Wars: Battlefront\\". Like the laserdisc edition of the \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\", there's audition footage shot on video from 1975 featuring a most unlikely mix of actors (everyone from Kurt Russell to William Katt). There's the usual assortment of trailers, TV spots and a few Easter Eggs along the way. The featurettes cover the creation of the Lightsaber (Which has behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage), the characters of \\"Star Wars\\" and an appreciation by film directors such as Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. If you're wondering how much these films have been cleaned up and improved, you need to compare the original theatrical and TV spots to the improved editions.<br /><br />The first three discs consists strictly of the movies with audio commentary from Lucas,  sound effects editor Ben Burtt,visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren and actress Carrie Fisher. All four appear together on a single track cobbled together from different sessions. While the result can be a bit distracting at times (as there's no interplay between the speakers), the result is a film commentary that's well balanced and never boring. We get everything from the difficulty in shooting in Africa to the origin of R2D2's \\"voice\\" (think baby sounds run through a synthesizer and babbling sliced and diced). The commentary track for \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" tends to be the most interesting because of the fact that Lucas was breaking new ground and challenging the preconceptions of the movie studios.<br /><br />The \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" has never looked better and the film has never received such an exhaustive array of extras covering the films. The inclusion of the 150 minute documentary provides all the nuts and bolts one needs to know about the films. Lucas along with Spielberg changed the face of entertainment in American film bringing back both a sense of wonder and fun that had been missing. While that may have overwhelmed more serious filmmaking, it brought back a quality that had been missing for far too long.marvelous featurettes, a sneak peak at the new \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" (with Hayden Christiansen suiting up as Vader) as well as a sneak peak at the new X-Box game \\"Star Wars: Battlefront\\".

B00005JN7O|2.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie, It looked right up my ally. I love Star Wars, the Indiana Jones movies, and special effects (even when their not 100% convincing), this movie seems to be a combination of these elements (plus other influences), right down to a \\"tip of the hat\\" to George Lucas by using the number \\"1138\\" on a door. And I greatly admire the creative efforts of the director to get this movie to the big screen. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, about halfway through, I realised that I wasn't being entertained, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. It lacks the charm that Lucas and Spielberg bring to their movies. I've never been SOOO BORED at a movie with SOOO much action. The reason why is that I just didn't CARE about what was going on, and I didn't care about the charachters. In fact I was HOPING Polly Perkins (Paltrow) would get stepped on by a giant CG robot at some point. Unfortunately she survives to the end credits. So needless to say, I thought Gwenyth Paltrow just plain sucked in her role. Her acting was too lame to call even '2 diminsional'. Jude Law was good, he did what he could to bring a little bit of life to a shallow role. The rest of the acting is good enough, but no actor could save this movie from itself. The FX are incredible, the 'look' of the film is AWSOME, but one thing did bother me about them, TOO MUCH HAZE!!! The whole movie I felt like I needed to wipe some crud off my glasses. LOL <br /> <br />Bottom Line: No Good. I know, I know... Im in the minority in feeling this way, and usually my take on a particular flick is right in line with the average user review, but I just can't give this movie a good rating. What I DID see in this movie is potential. I believe in second chances, and I would LOVE to see what this obviously talented writer/director/creator will do in the future.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie's director won the Oscar for best screenplay. What no one at the Academy seems to have realized is that it was grossly plagarized from Haruki Murakami's 90's novel 'Dance, Dance, Dance'. Characters are rearranged, subplots eliminated, but the basic themes, settings, characters, and relationships are identical.(Example: in the movie, the young woman is abandoned in a large Japanese hotel by her photographer husband and taken in tow by a middle-aged man; in the book, the young woman is abandoned in a large Japanese hotel by her photographer husband and taken in tow by a middle-aged man.) <br /> <br />In sum, the movie is a blatant, shameless, rip-off. <br /> <br />Murakami is one of the foremost Japanese authors of our time.   The fact that no one at the Academy caught the theft is a sad comment on the insularity of Americans. The Oscar should be returned.
B0000028WD|4.0|This concert, held back in October of '92, brought together a startling array of artists, whose presence alone was tribute to the musical significance of Bob Dylan. Thankfully, they all brought instruments with them, and somebody thought to record it. What we have here are some highlights of that show, which featured remarkably tight playing throughout. Some of the highlights are surprises, others quite expected: Willie Nelson gets the vibe of \\"What Was It You Wanted\\" just right, the Clancy Brothers do a glorious rendition of \\"When the Ship Comes In\\", and the O'Jays' (yes, the O'Jays) performance of \\"Emotionally Yours\\" is downright stunning. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are a powerhouse, with Duck Dunn guesting on bass and a dual drum attack of Stan Lynch and Jim Keltner. Hearing The Band (well, 3/5 of it, anyway) give what was their first performance in ages was a treat. And Neil Young pretty well steals the show. <br /> <br /> <br />For all the highlights, there are a few things could have been better about this set. George Harrison's performance of \\"If Not For You\\" somehow didn't make it on here. The sound mix is decidedly bland throughout. Chrissy Hynde's guitar is completely buried on \\"I Shall Be Released\\", as are Garth Hudson and Richard Bell's accordians on \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" (no wonder Neil Young insisted on mixing his tracks himself).  The greatest indignity of all, though, is saved for Roger McGuinn, who sang ALL FOUR verses of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" that night, not just the two that appear in this hacked-up version. The \\"Everybody\\" rendition of \\"Knockin' on Heavan's Door\\" is quite chaotic - despite the familiarity of the song, people seem to playing two different sets of chords. And, on a humorous but hardly surprising note, Bob's vocal on \\"My Back Pages\\" was redone later (I know - I still have the tape I made from the radio broadcast that night - plus, you can check the video, they don't show his mouth at all). <br /> <br /> <br />I think theSinead O'Connor incident would have made a worthwhile inclusion as well, as a document of what the Woodstock generation are like now. <br /> <br /> <br />In any case, none of these drawbacks should keep you from buying and enjoying this set.
0671027387|5.0|This was a page turner I couldn't put down. My second book by Dan Brown. I've read Angels and Demons; this was much better. I kept wondering when someone will make this into a movie and who would play the main characters, Rachel, Michael, Gabrielle, Sexton, and Hearney.  Pick this one up if you have time to read deep into the night!!
B00005M91K|3.0|I bought this DVD on the basis of rave reviews I read on this web site. I figured with all this hype, I just can't go wrong. Let me just say at the outset, it's a good film. It's unusual in it's conception and the sound-track blends with the images well and would be a good CD on it's own. But let's come down to earth. This is not the religious experience people are making it out to be. These reviews are way over the top. After a couple of viewings I was finding it dragged at times. OK nice mountains. Anytime you fly over big mountains they tend to be fairly beautiful. I would have prefered either a more hard-hitting treatment of war or for the movie to avoid the subject altogether (note: I have not seen any of the Qatsi trilogy).  Could be I'm jaded, but I was disappointed in the end, partly due to too much hype having been made about it on these pages. The ending itself is weak I think and leaves you wondering more about the process than the point of it all. I would certainly recommend a viewing before purchase. No doubt about it though, Ron Fricke's work has been incredibly influential, especially (and very obviously) in the medium of advertising. In general regarding reviews, I have a feeling that most of them are by satisfied customers, so it tends to be biased in favour of the product.
B00007LTIL|5.0|Im sure you all know how when a piece of music really impresses itself on you, it can become engrained in your mind with permanent associations and becomes in your own mind the soundtrack to your life. To try to describe how I feel about the Grateful Dead, let me just tell you a story about what I associate with this album. Me and my best friend signed up to do community service with a relief program similar to the peace corps in Ghana, West Africa. We were to stay in a small village called Amissakrom Akroful that you wont find on a map, and live in homestays with the locals while doing work projects within the community. My friend managed the task of taking his guitar across the ocean with him. When I think of the Grateful Dead, I think of kicking back on a bench outside a small hovel in West Africa after a long days work under the hot equatorial sun, lazily watching the sun set over the jungle landscape. I would just sit there while eating a coconut and feeding the scraps to the goats, and I would listen to my best friend playing tunes from American Beauty. I cant imagine a scene sweeter, and this album was a part of it. Perfect.

B00005JNEI|4.0|Where there parts of this documentary that were border-line?  Yeah, but then again, one should expect that.  In fact, I was exacting a whole lot more than there was.  I had half bought into the conservative claims that the movie was just one big smear job by Moore.  However, after watching the movie I was amazed by how much it wasn't a \\"i hate bush, but i wont back it up\\" movie. <br /> <br />Coming to the criticisms by Conservatives. <br />1. Many wont believe anyone who says anything bad about Bush anyway.  Heck, they still think that Iraq is in good shape, and that the economy is rolling like it's the 1990s again.  Those people will never be pursuaded that Bush is anything other than God on Earth. <br /> <br />2. You can tell when one side of a debate doesn't have an arguement when they start attacking their opponent personally.  That is what has happened to a large degree in the negative comments here.  They simply dismiss Moore's claims as lies (mainly because of #1) and then go on to attack Moore as a person. <br /> <br />3. I did visit the webpage listing 59 Moore lies or whatever.  However, after reading through much of it, a lot of it was irrelevant.  Does it matter that Gore was at the fundraiser too where Bush said \\"some call you the rich and powerful but I call you my base\\" (or whatever the quote was).  The examples of Gore's jokes seemed harmless (\\"and yes, I invented this dinner\\") while with Bush's \\"i call you my base\\" joke one can almost tell that it has a slimy feeling to it. <br /> <br />Also, in the part of the movie where Bush says \\"now watch this swing,\\" he seems to believe that Moore is attacking Bush for playing golf while talking about attacking terrorism.  However, the fact that Bush is playing golf is irrelevant.  The part Moore was going after was that Bush almost seemed to take his golf swing as seriously, if not more seriously, than his comments about fighting terrorism. <br /> <br />On top of this, he attacks Moore on menial facts.  Did anyone REALLY believe that Gore's \\"Victory party\\" at the start of the movie was in fact a victory party?  I was actualy surpised to learn that it was taped on election day.  I was actually thinking it may be a picture of a rally with \\"Victory Florida\\" edited into the video to make it look like a victory celebration. <br /> <br />Also, this movie is not about Clinton, it's about Bush.  Who cares if Clinton has ties to some of the same companies Bush does?  Clinton wasn't President after 9/11, Bush was.  The claim is that Bush may have allowed his, his family's, and his buddies interests in front of the national interest because of these connections.  That claim is not impacted in any way by what business dealings other people may have had. <br /> <br />Finally on this point, are there some cheap shots, such as showing Wofliwitz saliving up his hair? Yeah, but these can't be considered \\"deceptions\\" or anything.  Also, in his \\"rebuttle\\" of Moore's claim that the Saudi's hadn't been interviewed before leaving, he stated that something like 30 had been.  Well, 30 is no where near 147 or whatever the number was who left.  Also, I think WHEN the Saudi's left is less important than the fact that they got out ASAP, with apparently minimal questioning. <br /> <br />The conservatives are so bent up on little nit picky facts that they miss the big picture.  Even if Moore had presented a documentary that was unquestionably factual, most of his underlying premises would still be alive and kicking.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ is one of the films that have made film history before the actual release as it had a large number of followers before the release date. The prosperity of Gibson's film is based in its Christian theme, which attracted large masses of folks in the western world. The hysteria around the film was augmented through word of mouth as people were willing to discuss Passion of the Christ before it was released. This frenzy around the film brought the film a lot of free advertisement around the world, which made the film a huge success in the Box Office.<br /><br />The film follows the 12 hours before Jesus Christ's (James Caviezel) crucifixion, which is full of violent behavior. This violent behavior is brought to the screen through untouched brutality as the body of Jesus is kicked, desecrated, tortured, and whipped numerous times with monstrous tools before he was crucified. These scenes of violence progressively get worse as the film continues as Gibson makes an honest attempt to recreate a world of past where poverty and ignorance were common. There is not much room for compassion, but when it exists it offers some hope for mankind. It is for this hope that Jesus endures the pain brought upon him by mankind.<br /><br />Passion of the Christ is a cinematic experience that triggers a strong distaste for brutal violence as it is turned into a maximum in the film.  The violence is necessary in order to display the revolting behavior of people, which is nauseating, and it is for this violent behavior Jesus sacrifices himself to save mankind. Hopefully all the viewers learned one of the intended lessons from the story and can make the world a better place with less violence and brutality.
B000001Y2U|4.0|As a fan of Marilyn Manson, and since i have all of his albums, one of my top favourites would be- Antichrist Superstar, which is an album that contains many different genres, such as metal, goth rock, industrial, alternative and of course- shock rock. You must be a Marilyn Manson fan to like this album. It was made in 1996, his earlier years of his career. To enjoy this album, you gotta be a metalhead! where else you wont like the heavy features. Yes, we know we know.... the satanic style of alice cooper and ozzy osbourne is not 'cool' anymore but in MM owns style you will be sure to love it... contains the 3 hit singles - The Beautiful people, Tourniquet, Man that you fear. <br />I definately suggest this album (uh oh, explicit lyrics...think twice about letting your children listen...might cause disturbing nightmares...)
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The theory that a butterfly's wing in Asia can cause a Hurricane in the Caribbean is called the Chaos Theory.  Butterfly Effect is based on the Chaos Theory and time traveling, which has been introduced in several other science fiction books and films.  Nonetheless, Butterfly Effect is not a science fiction film as it incorporates these two fundamental elements of philosophical thinking that are often connected with the future and progressive philosophy.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) has memory lapses as a child through some severely distressing moments. Evan's mother becomes very concerned as she finds out that he has begun to display some bizarre traits in school and at home.  The mother is also concerned as Evan's father is institutionalized in a highly secure clinic and she is worried that Evan might begin to show the same traits as his father.  This leads the mother to contact a psychiatrist, who instructs Evan to begin to write a daily journal.<br /><br />Years later when Evan attends college as a psychology honors student he begins to have flashes of his past.  Evan returns to his childhood town to find out more about his past and he finds that his friends also suffer from the past traumatic events.  It troubles Evan that he and his friends endure deep emotional pain, which leads him to read his old journals in order to find a solution to the problems.  The reading opens Pandora's Box as he realizes that he can return to the past and change the future.<br /><br />Butterfly Effect has interesting premise, however, it falls short as it gives a serious attempt to depict two interesting philosophical notions.  The reasons for its shortcomings are the numerous plot holes and blunders in the story.  The film, at times, seems rushed and hurried as appropriate channels were not consulted before shooting several of the scenes.  This results in several awkward moments that are enhanced by the lead in the film.  Butterfly Effect begins extremely promising, but lands far from a great cinematic experience as the end credits roll.ng, but lands far from a great cinematic experience as the end credits roll.  <br />
0385512104|4.0|Through the whole book the main character Christopher looks at the world in every detail. He gives many astute observations and can do calculations in his head. But somehow he cannot communicate with other humans on a normal level. To him, there is just too much information coming in all at once. He cannot figure out that one facial feature can mean a myriad things and he cannot understand metaphors, but don't get him started on similes. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, he makes allot of sense; the world would be a better place if no one lied. But is it possible? In order for this to work everyone would have to follow the same rules and unfortunately that will never happen. <br /> <br />The novel was very good if you can stand a very frustrating main character. <br />
068987474X|5.0|In addition to being funny and a great read, this book really tells it like it is. Not the sugarcoated, politically-correct, picture of how dating is supposed to work, but the actual truth about how it goes in the real world. <br /> <br />It is like Sex and the City without the fantasy glitz. It is becoming my bible.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|This package is quite the deal: it comes with great music tucked into a book. The book comes complete with handwritten lyrics, beautiful photography, and heartwrenching letters written back home by \\"J\\" (aka Jesus of Surburbia), a demented Holden Caulfield who is trying to figure out his place in the world, and whether or not he truly belongs there. \\"Good guys don't wear red, white, and blue,\\" he comments in one letter.<br /><br />Pick this up. Now.
B0000C1733|4.0|As a fan who is in the process of getting all of this band's records, I fully knew this CD would be packed with all the classic favourites as well as modern hits. RHCP's are still going strong from their debut years in the 1980's to now.<br /><br />I recommend this CD for anyone who wants to try RCHP's for the first time. Only because this release has their hits spread across their reflective years of producing quality music.<br /><br />Under the Bridge, Californication, Otherside, Higher Ground and Universally Speaking are the best picks from this album and Save The Population ain't so bad either.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I expected that this record would be a mix of Green Day's Nimrod and Dookie, or even Nimrod and Insomniac. It is, in reality, a mix of Nimrod and Warning, Green Day's 2000 drastic departure from their classic \\"pop-punk\\" sound. However, it's good. In fact, it's great. The Warning feeling sensed in the record actually gives this record an extra boost because rather than watering down the music with too much imitation folk, it is dispensed in small doses in all the right places (i.e. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\", \\"Are We The Waiting\\", etc).<br /><br />This album also keeps Green Day a step ahead of all the other bands that are crudely imitating them these days (i.e. Sum 41, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan), because American Idiot has what many pop-punk albums try to achieve these but often don't: depth. Although you can very much \\"rock out\\" to tunes such as \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"St. Jimmy\\", this album will also give your heartstrings a through plucking with the interweaving stories of Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and Whatsername.
B000002LFU|3.0|It should be noted that REM have many great songs. Listening to this CD as I write this review I must state there are only 3 songs out of the 9 that get my attention, they are Orange Crush, I remember California and the 11th which is untitled.<br /><br />A band like REM have been around for a long time and cannot come out with chart topping songs in every album. What REM tried to do here was be experimental in their choice of style and the rythmns. I applaud REM's methodology but in this CD that played out against them.<br /><br />I will state that it is overall a strong CD with a more pop feel to it.
068987474X|5.0|I initially bought this book because Greg Behrendt co-wrote it and, let's face it, Greg is incredibly funny.  I figured, as a member of the Uncool Army, I should do my bit and go out and buy it.  Besides, it's been really hot outside and super-boring.  I thought \\"Hey, this will be quick, light, fun reading that will make me laugh and get rid of the late summer boredom\\".  It was all of that, but it's also very insightful.  I saw myself in this book and now I have a different attitude about guys and how they deal with relationships.  I'm going to keep this book handy just in case I feel myself slipping back into my old ways. This should be required reading for every woman.  I love this book and I'm going to make sure all of my friends read it. I brought it in to work this morning so that I could read bits of it to my co-workers.  I think you will have at least four more sales today Greg!  Knowledge is Power Ladies!!!!!!!!!
B000002MTR|3.0|This CD is the low point in the musical career of the RHCP's. This CD was just completed after a major change in the band from a viewpoint of band members coming and leaving and their own personal dilemma's. Success and the price of fame was the cause of all the band's issues and this is reflected in this CD. The second track Aeroplane, My Friends and Transcending are the pick of all tracks. The other tracks go all over the place and at times its a dissuasion of noise.  <br /> <br />I give it 3 stars because of being a die hard fan of RHCP's and my devotion to the quality songs that have come out from this band.
B00003CXCT|4.0|First the good news: The picture and sound quality is fantastic, beyond desciption.  This and the bonus disc will make it worthwhile to purchase the boxset.  All those annoying Special Edition additions come across less obtrusive when the whole thing is digitized.  Still, we don't get the originals, which is a letdown.  Those were great pieces of film making, truly lightyears ahead of its time.  Lucas and his team took puppets, plastic models, and so forth, and made a story that touched millions of people.  Lucas himself once said that special effects are there just to help you tell a story.  When he changed something that enhanced the experience, like most of his changes in Special Edition Empire-it was okay.  But when he starts having Gweedo shoot first, and changing little bits of dialogue, you have to start asking why.  There's no need for it.  The rhythem of the stories was there, and it worked.  Why does he keep messing with it?  In this boxset edition, on Empire Strikes Back, he changes Boba Fett's voice!  Again, I ask why?  Fett's voice was awesome.  He only spoke a couple of lines, but also became at least as popular as Vader.  His new voice sounds much less sinister and abrasive.  This just makes the Boba Fett we always knew to be obsolete.  And what is going on with putting Hayden into the end scene on Return of the Jedi?  Again, there's no need, not unless you also include Ewan Mcgregor along side him.  Why does he keep messing with these movies?  You had it right the first time Georgey boy!  If you want to change something, how about taking Jar Jar out of Phantom Menace?  He said it best himself, in one of the documentaries on the bonus disc.  He started as a hungry film maker, wanting nothing to do with the corporate jerks.  So he set up his own studio, and ending up becoming just another coporate jerk.  Oh cruel fate!
B0002HTZJI|4.0|Yes the CD is expensive, but the cost is justified by the collection of songs on both volumes on Disc 1 and Disc 2. The band has a great feel to it. What makes it better is that it is done LIVE, in show at Hyde Park London.<br /><br />Disc 1 has the pick of the songs such as Can't Stop, Around The World, Fortune Faded, Get on Top and Don't Forget Me.<br /><br />Disc 2 has a few good songs worth listening too more than once such as Zephyr Song, Right On Time, Under The Bridge and Give It Away.<br /><br />Overall its a must for any die hard Red Hot Chili Fan.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Undoubtedly John Turturro is one of the great actors of the modern era and this is his film - one of his best. Which is not to say it is a one man show, no Coen Brothers film is.  But the schmatta, Bernie Birnbahm, grifter, a \\"nobody\\", brother to the lover of the protaganist character Tom Reagan played by Gabriel Byrne, is the character around whom the action swirls and a rich part which Mr Turturro invests with his considerable skills.  See it and Mr Turturro and marvel.

B00028HBKM|2.0|Simple and short.  THUMBS UP to the movie, although extremely BRUTAL and not for the fant of heart.  HOWEVER, THUMBS DOWN to this DvD for the LACK of special features.  If you JUST want the movie, then buy the DvD, you won't be disappointed, BUT this was a MAJOR MOVIE and a lack of special features is a HUGE SLAP IN THE FACE.  I'm SURE they'll release a special edition sooner or later that'll probably be LOADED with extras, so I'd wait till then to buy it.  For now, just rent it and enjoy the movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Well, this being Green Day's first album in 3 years, it may quite possibly be the best album OF THEIR CAREER.  Their musical talent has progressed every album, and this album tops all. <br /> <br />For those looking for them to return to their \\"Smoothed Out,\\" \\"Kerplunk,\\" and \\"Dookie\\" days, I'm sorry, they didn't.  They just got better.  \\"American Idiot\\" is an outstanding album and an album EVERY music fan needs to gain possesion of. <br /> <br />The cd kicks off with their hit \\"American Idiot,\\" which is the heaviest song on the cd.  Then they make it good.  2 songs, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are 5 parted melodies, that both make up 9 minute songs each.  The song \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" (My favorite track on the cd), starts off with a drum machine that fades into the song.  It reminds me of an electric \\"Good Riddance,\\" but much better.  Billy Joe has really come into one with his lyrics now.  They are very good. <br /> <br />\\"Are We The Waiting\\" is a song who's chorus kind of reminds me of P.O.D.'s \\"Youth of the Nation,\\" (esp. when the background comes in).  But it really is a great song. <br /> <br />\\"Extraordinary Girl\\" starts off with a middle-eastern twist of a melody, then kicks in to a faster slow-punk (if that makes any sense). <br /> <br />\\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is a song that I compare to \\"Macy's Day Parade,\\" but much better.  It has a deeper feel to it, especially on the lyrics.   <br /> <br />This cd really shows Green Day's talent and staying power.  It is by far to me, their best cd EVER MADE...Yes, surpasssing \\"Dookie.\\" <br /> <br />It's a decision you can make for yourself.  But I am only telling you, I'd buy it...and quickly.   <br /> <br />Tre and Billy Joe have added solo's in these songs.  SOLO'S!  Something that wasn't so much Green Day prior to this album.  They have also experimented with vocal and musical bridges, going both very high and very low.   <br /> <br />This is an all-around BRILLIANT album.  A MUST BUY.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a stunning movie with extremely original ideas.  Nothing like it has been made or introduced to the American market.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I have been a fan of Alan Parson since day one. I have every album and have never been dissapointed with any of them. I have always thought that you could buy a Parson's CD site unseen and enjoy it. Until now I was right.... this CD offers no Parson fan anything to sink their teeth into. Add to that a couple of retreads and you have a poor excuse for a Parson album. Best try before you buy this CD. Someone said if you like Stereotomy, Gaudi, Try Anything Once Time Machine then you might not like this. I add if you liked anything since I Robot you might not like this. Sorry Alan...you missed the target....
B00003CXCT|1.0|1 STAR, do you really need an explanation? This is just awful. I can't believe he got rid of the EWOK song. What a loser. George Lucas is like the Devil's younger, more sinister, uglier, bratty, stuck-up little brother. This crazy old dude needs a babysitter. When are we getting the originals and not these lame @#% clones?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't impressed by the movie trailer when it first came out, but I actually sat down and watched this film.  I thought it was just great!  There are a lot of emotions that this movie takes you on, an emotional rollercoaster if you will.  Bill Murray is great and so is Scarlett!  They are two lost souls looking for one another, it is all together a great movie!
B0000029DD|5.0|I don't know if Jeff was a genious or not,... I've never met him! But  one thing I know, he could feel like no one I know. He surely felt things in a very deep way, and I say that only from hearing his songs. This man makes me cry with some of his songs and that's more that I can say about some other records that I've bought from other bands. I cannot say that he changed my life, but he surely changed my way of going through it, and when I'm sad or lonely, I know I can always count with Jeff Buckley and Grace to expell my sadness out...
B0002OERI0|5.0|Better or just as good as Dookie. Every song is good. After more than a decade Green Day keeps creating good music. It might be the best punk/rock cd of the year. 5/5 stars.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot\\" is an awesome compilation. There were not any songs that I disliked although \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Whatsername\\" and \\"Letterbomb\\" are the ones I liked best, in that order. I liked this album much better than \\"Warning\\". \\"Warning\\" never lived up to my standards for Green Day as \\"Dookie\\" set an extremely high standard with \\"Longview\\", \\"Basket Case\\" and \\"Welcome to Paradise\\". The lyrics are superb and I was definetly able to rock out to this CD. The track \\"American Idiot\\" is hands down the best one on the CD and makes this CD worth getting your hands on. <br />
0790729709|4.0|To be a bodyguard is not an easy task, particularly when you are dealing with showbizz people. They don't want to cut short their hazardous activities and attitudes of direct contact with the public and then it becomes easy for any would-be killer to perform their acts. This film also reveals that the contact between the bodyguard and the guarded person has to be entirely and only professional not to be disturbed by any personal and emotional element. This is hard to accept for a showbizz person who always sentimentalizes and personalizes the relations they entertain with their surrouding personnel. Yet the bodyguard in this mission will save the actress's son and then the actress herself in particularly public and dramatic conditions. The film will also create some justice when the killer executes the actress's sister who has been the one who paid for the elimination of her sister out of spite and jealousy. In other words the film is interesting because it erases as much sentimental mulk as possible only to retain the professional dimension of the mission.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

B0000CBY24|5.0|This film of a Maori chieftain's search for a successor who will keep the rural community's culture alive is also an appraisal of the culture itself and the values it represents.  The community is dying as its young people leave for the city and do not return, except briefly as visitors, and the chief, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) has no successor.  His own firstborn son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), who would normally have succeeded him, has left the community after his wife died giving birth to twins--a son who died, and a daughter who lived.  Naming the surviving daughter (Keisha Castle-Hughes) Paikea, after the whale rider who formed the culture a thousand years ago, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) abandons her to the care of her grandmother and the community and goes to Germany to promote his artwork.<br /><br />Paikea's difficult relationship with her grandfather, who scorns her because she is a girl and not the male heir he needs, is beautifully played here, and Keisha Castle-Hughes is a sensitive and winning actress who endows Paikea with the \\"strength, courage, intelligence, and leadership\\" which are the hallmarks of the culture.  Always trying to learn the old ways so that she can win her grandfather's love, she is, instead, constantly berated for trying to break the taboo of the marai by assuming a boy's role.<br /><br />The striking cinematography (Leon Narbey) captures the spirit of the land, while the underwater photography of whales, as Paikea's spirit is drawn to them throughout the film, is stunning.  Maori chants and ceremonial dances convey many of the Maori cultural traditions and illustrate their similarities with those of the Hawaiians, who share a common origin.  The exchange of breath between Maori as a greeting represents a sharing of each person's essence, a factor which achieves tremendous symbolic significance in a climactic moment at the end of the film.<br /><br />Because this is a film which conveys a message, it is not surprising that some of the characters here are two-dimensional, especially Koro, the grandfather, so consumed with the need to find a successor that he is unable to be a person.  But Paikea and the other children in the film more than make up for some of the adults' predictability with their palpable delight and pride in their culture and the fun they have learning the old ways.  A fascinating glimpse at a vanishing culture, this magnificent and moving film will itself help preserve its history and traditions.

B00018D44U|4.0|I really enjoyed Norah's first album, that one is must have.  This one is nearly as good.  It does have a country feel to it.  The lyrics are beautiful, as usual for her.  I give it 4 stars because while it's not as good as her first one, I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  She is awesome!

B00006IUL6|5.0|What a great film..  Cinematography is excellent, script award winning, and Pacino....does he ever act anything less than incredible?......I don't recall seeing one of his films that wasn't spellbinding.....this time there is a good cast that acts to the high standard Pacino sets.  Hillary Swank is especially good as a star-struck admirer of Pacino's Dormer character.  Robin Williams does a good job too (too many people seem to expect him to be capable of drama at Pacino's level....he's not.....it's not his strength....but he capably carries his weight in a film where he would be quickly shown the door if he couldn't keep up). <br /> <br />The psychology is set in the framework of sleep deprivation (due to the near 24 hr daylight in the Alaskan town where it is set), so Pacino has a great plot from which to explore....which he does to maximum effect.  This film is well worth the time to see.
B0000048V8|5.0|This movie has amazing artistry and beautiful music. It is obvious why this won numerous awards for the art and animation.

B000005RR0|5.0|Jump Back: The Best Of The Rolling Stones: `71-`93 was released only in the UK on November 22, 1993.  It was the *18th* compilation album released in the UK.  It was also the first release of the Stones new contract with Virgin Records.  None of the songs appear on either Hot Rocks or More Hot Rocks.  The album seems mis-titled because it does not include any of the single releases from 1989-1993 and in fact does not include *16* UK single releases from this time period.  It was an attempt to release the most the most popular of the Stones hits since they left Decca (London in the US) in 1971.  A better title would have been \\"Some Stones Hits '71-`89\\", but then who would have bought an album with an ambiguous title and the last hit 4 years earlier....other than those rabid Stones fans, anyway?  Well, this is what happens when you have such a huge catalog of hits and you try to do a greatest hits album.  Look at all the stuff that had to be left off of the 2002 release 40 Licks.  If they ever release the entire Stones catalog as a box set it will have to come in a trunk that comes with a dolly to get it out of the store. <br /> <br />These songs are the most popular from the Rolling Stones Records releases.  Here are the original UK release dates of each song (US release and re-release dates were often different during this period): <br />4-16-71 & 6-29-84  Brown Sugar <br />4-16-71  Bitch <br />4-23-71  Wild Horses (on Sticky Fingers - not released as a single) <br />4-14-72  Tumbling Dice <br />8-21-73  Angie <br />7-26-74  It's Only Rock `n' Roll <br />4-16-78  Hot Stuff <br />4-16-78  Fool To Cry <br />5-19-78  Miss You <br />8-29-78 & 6-1-82  Beast Of Burden <br />9-14-78  Respectable <br />6-20-80  Emotional Rescue <br />8-14-81 & 2-11-83  Start Me Up <br />12-1-81  Waiting On A Friend <br />11-1-83  Undercover Of The Night <br />3-4-86  Harlem Shuffle <br />8-17-89  Mixed Emotions <br />10-24-89  Rock And A Hard Place <br /> <br />Here are the *16* UK single releases that were NOT on the album.

0800141660|3.0|One might nitpick about how this or that bit of the original novel out to have been left in or taken out, but it is, on the whole, a good adaptation.    Unlike some authors of 'social' novels, Jane did not invite us to become angry about unjust social situations, nor did she counsel us to resign themselves; she simply presented them and left us to draw our own conclusions.    The Dashwood girls had to get married.  In Britain of that time, that was all that they could do.  Their father's estate was entailed, which means that most of it automatically passed to their half-brother.  Women in that time were not educated beyond basic literacy and numeracy, and most well-paying occupations were closed to them by either law or custom.  In a Catholic country (say, Spain or Italy) young ladies in the Dashwood girls' position would have had the option of becoming nuns, but in Protestant Britain even that was not an option--it was marriage or nothing.    Did Jane's unpitying, but nonjudgmental, portrayal of this situation lead to the nascient feminist movement of the later 19th century, which saw educational and occupational opportunities for women open up and legal reforms that enabled women to control their own money and property?  Perhaps, indirectly; certainly her novels brought the situation to people's minds, and probably got them thinking about it far more than more polemical writings would have.    I did think that the one sister's mooning after Willoughby got a bit tiresome, but I think it was supposed to be.  And, after he lead the other sister on so much and then allowed her to think that he'd married someone else (the someone else married his brother--nice bit of casting, the actor who played the brother did look enough like Hugh Grant to be his less-handsome brother) and then came calling to propose that she should have taken one of the pewter candlesticks on the table and whapped him upside the head with it before accepting the proposal.    My father has four sisters, and says that the way the girls bickered and fussed at each other is absolutely on target.    As for some of the actors/actresses being too old for their parts, remember that in those days people didn't live as long as they do now.  In terms of life-stage they were right; a modern performer of the chronological age of the book's characters would be too immature.    My main quarrel with this movie was the music.  Not the music itself, which I liked (it was specially composed, but sounded period; the main theme, for example, sounded like a snippit from a Beethoven piano concerto) but the performance.  The piano used was obviously a modern instrument; pianos of the period had a thinner, lighter, sound than modern ones do--the fortepiano was marked, after all, as an enhanced harpsichord.  To see the characters playing on little spinnets and hearing a Boesendorfer was a bit disconcerting.
B0002S94BG|5.0|Simply- <br /> For those who are already fans, this is a must-have. Included are all of the best Jeff Buckley songs, as well as b-sides and songs you probably have never heard him sing. The 3rd disc has the videos which is very important considering you will most likely never see them again on television. <br /> For those people who have never heard Jeff Buckley,  <br />you are missing something big. During his short life, he wrote and sang some of the best and most beautiful songs of all time. While the Grace album is a fantastic introduction to his work, this special edition gives you a little taste of everything. <br /> This is definitely well worth any amount of money you would pay.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is actually the second Coldplay album I bought (I started with Rush of Blood after getting addicted to \\"Clocks\\").  I recall enjoying \\"Yellow\\" when the song aired on the radio, but when I finally got around to buying this album, I was very pleasantly surprised by its cohesion and beauty.<br /><br />All of the songs here are good, but I'll pay most attention to the ones that are particularly striking to me.  \\"Shiver\\" is certainly one of those songs, a fast, catchy tune that pauses for a few sad lyrics about the one-sidedness of infatuation.  This song could have been my own personal anthem from the ages of ten to sixteen, which is part of why I like it so much; but anyone who appreciates heavy-hearted ballads should like this one too.<br /><br />\\"Spies\\" delves into much creepier territory, steeping the listener in a paranoid, nocturnal world where sleep gives no \\"peace of mind\\" and the waking hours aren't any better.  I sense that Chris Martin is getting at something through an extended metaphor, but what it is, I do not know.  It may just be what it sounds like: a spooked confession of xenophobia and fear.<br /><br />\\"Sparks,\\" then, is a welcome relief: floating, dreamy guitars married to lyrics so sentimental that they fall just shy of being maudlin.  \\"High Speed\\" works along the same lines, and is equally good.<br /><br />\\"Yellow\\" is of course the song that many will recognize readily.  It is probably the most radio-friendly and pop-oriented, but these aren't strikes against it; you just have to be in the right mood for it.  Has there ever been, or will there ever be, a song in which the singer is so obviously in love?  I doubt it.<br /><br />\\"Trouble\\" makes good use of piano to drive a sad and moving apology to a loved one.  Contrite lyrics and languid guitars complete the mood.  If \\"Yellow\\" is the honeymoon, then \\"Trouble\\" is the aftermath of the first fight.<br /><br />\\"We Never Change\\" and \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" end the album on a positive note, and at the same time they set up neatly the emotional plunge of the following LP, A Rush of Blood to the Head.<br /><br />Parachutes was a risky purchase for me, as I tend to be wary of buying albums without having a good idea of the songs on it.  But the risk paid off.  This is one of my favorite albums of the last few years, and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who can appreciate soulful, intelligent pop music.te, and at the same time they set up neatly the emotional plunge of the following LP, A Rush of Blood to the Head.   <br /> <br />Parachutes was a risky purchase for me, as I tend to be wary of buying albums without having a good idea of the songs on it.

0375756825|5.0|J M Barrie said \\"Over Treasure Island I let my fire die in winter without knowing I was freezing.\\" This is a captivating book that will make you forget little things like freezing to death. Barrie recalls his mother feigning disinterest in the book: \\"'Oh, I may take a look at it again by and by' she says indifferently, but nevertheless the probability is that as the door shuts the book opens, as if by some mechanical contrivance. I remember how she read Treasure Island, holding it close to the ribs of the fire (because she could not spare a moment to rise and light the gas), and how, when bedtime came, and we coaxed, remonstrated, scolded, she said quite fiercely, clinging to the book, ' I dinna lay my head on a pillow this night till I see how that laddie got out of the barrel.'\\" A well written story of pirates, buried treasure, sailing ships, and adventure, Treasure Island is also a literary treasure. Stevenson deftly creates a whole Piratical lingo for this tale. Parts of the book stick  with you like Jim Hawkins meeting marooned Ben Gunn. Ben tells him \\"Marooned three years agone,\\" he continued, \\"and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were.\\" How can we ever forget Long John Silver's parrot Cap'n Flint crying pieces of eight! pieces of eight! until Silver throws his handkerchief over the cage. You may even hear the surf booming about the coasts of Treasure Island in your dreams. Long John beckons to Jim during the voyage \\"Come away, Hawkins,\\" he would say; \\"come and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son.\\" and so Silver welcomes us all into this splendid yarn.
B00005JMUA|1.0|So I was saying to my wife, \\"Yeah, the first volume was so-so, but I keep hearing this second one is better,\\" and she was all, \\"Whatever, I guess I'll watch it,\\" because I think she liked the first volume more than I did, because I think she likes all that chop-suey blood letting more than I do. So she was all, \\"Where'd you hear this was better?\\" about fifteen minutes into the movie, because nothing was happening, just a lot of talking about junk we didn't care about. Huge meandering scenes of slow talking that needed an EDITOR in a big way. People are so in awe of Tarantino as a movie maker, the producers or whoever was in charge of this nonsense were afraid to use a talented EDITOR. This movie could have been boiled down to 45 minutes, because most of the movie is nonsense dialogue that isn't interesting, scenes that are unnecessary (Mexican guy, anyone? What the!), or scenes that make you roll your eyes (Uma digging herself up through all that grave dirt? What the!). If you haven't seen the movie, you won't know what I'm talking about. If you have seen the movie, you know what I'm saying...admit it, you might have liked a few scenes, and they might have been really good if they were edited and condensed, and some of the dialogue was sheered away (Superman mythology? Blah blah blah. Deadly snake babble, blah blah blah, the list goes on and on...). So I talked with my brother after I'd seen it, and he said he hated the movie. His wife hated the movie. My mom hated the movie. My wife hated the movie, and poured her anger at me for making her sit through it. She wanted to stop the movie about 3/4 of the way through, but stupid me - I had to finish it to see if there was one redeeming quality. I was so wrong. I talked to friends, and no one liked the movie. So I have to wonder: Who are these mythical invisible people that supposedly like the movie. The only person I know of that is REAL that likes the movie is Roger Ebert. And I suspect he only liked the movie becausehe saw it after the day he saw a really awful movie, like maybe Scooby Doo 2 or something. I dunno.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|In my humble opinion, I feel that this movie was significantly better than Gladiator - and Gladiator was a good movie. Great casting and excellent acting really put me in the movie. I felt like I was there.  <br /> <br />A must have for any movie collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of the most impressive albums I have heard in many years. The complexity and the constant changes in the music is a new forte' for Green Day. The movements in Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming also mark a extremely talented band. Being a music major, I am pleasantly surprised and personally prefer the new Green Day over the older Green Day. If you don't buy this album and like it you don't appreciate good music and should be thrown off a cliff.
6305882592|5.0|This is a classic black comedy about a teenager who enjoys faking his suicide to scare his mother, converts his sports car into a hearse and going to funerals for people he doesn't know.  At one of the funerals he meets Maude, a free spirit who is about 60 years older than he is.  He falls in love with her and decides he wants to marry her. <br /> <br />I won't say any more about the plot, because I don't want to spoil it for you.  The acting is excellent and if you enjoy this type of humor you should love this movie. <br />
B0002IQHZM|5.0|After a forty year run as the master of Mellow, not much has changed on Planet Donovan. The wisdom is still as abundant as the weed; poets in berets still blow saxes in the coffeehouse at night, and flowers still don heads of bushy hair in the audience. The man himself may be a little older now, but that doesn't mean that he's not coming on:<br /><br />If I was your lover I'd take you to the sky<br /><br />If you are feeling low I will make you high<br /><br />Let me be your lover baby I will be your beau<br /><br />This is not exactly the language of a man taking his social security check to the bank on the way to the golf course. In fact, Beat Caf&eacute; is an album that delivers the urgency and freshness one might expect from the debut album of a 20-something nobody, no less a nearly 60-year old flower-child of the original Woodstock generation.<br /><br />Hushed and haunted, Beat Caf&eacute; plays like a long, seductive whisper from somewhere within the listener's consciousness - a knowing and familiar voice spreading the rumor that utopia is not something that happens in the external world, but rather within the self. It is a sunrise of the soul; a placid and breezy terrain the mind brings you to when the gates of its imagination are unlocked. \\"Gonna do all the things I've never done before, gonna get myself together somehow,\\" Donovan sings on the downright wicked \\"The Question.\\" Many of these new tunes expand upon the kind of optimism with which Donovan managed to pit himself against that brooding, bitter and more famous American counterpart, Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Unlike Donovan's last album - the spare but alluring Sutras produced by Rick Rubin for American Recordings in 1996 - Beat Caf&eacute; explodes into a varied and distinctive musical brew. Danny Thompson's bass playing is worthy of Apollo's crown, and the legendary Jim Keltner turns in a surprisingly hip performance on drums and percussion, managing to keep up with Donovan as he slips in and out of beat after groovy beat.<br /><br />Whereas Rubin seemed to make a Rick Rubin record of Sutras - mired as it was in his minimalist approach - John Chelew allows for the making of a Donovan record this time around. Chelew, whose resume includes work with John Hiatt and Richard Thompson, proves a more sympathetic cohort throughout this musically fascinating project, even lending a hand on keyboards throughout the set. The atmosphere is much more relaxed and suggests that the artist was allowed to breathe freely during these sessions.<br /><br />The only resemblance between this latest album and Sutras is the mystic airiness of Donovan's lyrics, an eastern spiritualism cloaked in the psychedelic lexicon Donovan continues to employ. \\"You yin my yang/I'll yang your yin,\\" he directs on \\"Yin My Yang.\\" For an album as overtly conscious of its heritage as this one, it seems almost obligatory that Donovan would nod to Oar, Alexander \\"Skip\\" Spence's masterpiece of psychedelic folk/rock from 1969. \\"I could use me some yin for my yang,\\" Spence sings on his \\"Dixie Peach Promenade (yin for yang),\\" \\"that would make everything alright.\\" Spence's work is not only a direct echo of Donovan's \\"Yin My Yang,\\" but of the entire universe Beat Caf&eacute; evokes - from its \\"beatnik caf&eacute;\\" where \\"the reefer blow\\" to the time and place where \\"there'll be music in the air/flowers in your hair/life without a care.\\"<br /><br />But where the nostalgic lyrics retread familiar territory, the music reinvents an artist in his fifth decade as a performer. The beautifully brittle \\"Shambala\\" closes the album with a moving dream of yearning, escape and resignation:<br /><br />Take me home back to Shambala<br /><br />where peaceful rivers flow<br /><br />Take me home back to Shambala<br /><br />Where seeds of love they sow<br /><br />The appropriately titled \\"Whirlwind\\" - a song that wins the \\"coolest groove of the year\\" award - is dark and sly enough to suffice as the soundtrack for a landfalling hurricane. Most startling, though, is Donovan's impassioned cover of the folk standard, \\"The Cuckoo\\" which, amid so many interpretations of the well-traveled song, ranks as one of the most commanding and memorable.<br /><br />Really, though, only Donovan's own smooth voice manages to outdo Danny Thompson's pervasive double bass, which thumps and groans through every minute of the album, lending a jazzy depth to the distinctly international sound Donovan achieves here. Thompson raises \\"The Question\\" into a kind of frenetic street march through \\"the darkest hour of night,\\" while abrupt solos on \\"Love floats\\" or the instant classic, \\"Poorman's Sunshine,\\" fuse these songs with the spontaneity of a particularly inspired demo. It bears mentioning that Donovan tosses some killer guitar licks of his own into the mix, most notably on the deliciously fiendish title track.<br /><br />After following up a prolific period of creativity in the 70s with two decades of piercing silence, the release of a new Donovan album is unlikely enough. That the man would emerge out of nowhere with the coolest album of the year nearly forty years after his debut is nothing short of astonishing. Beat Caf&eacute; is further proof that something incredible happened in the decade of assassinations, flowers and weather factions, and the story is still far from over.n's impassioned cover of the folk standard, \\"The Cuckoo\\" which, amid so many interpretations of the well-traveled song, ranks as one of the most commanding and memorable.  <br /> <br />Really, though, only Donovan's own smooth voice manages to outdo Danny Thompson's pervasive double bass, which thumps and groans through every minute of the album, lending a jazzy depth to the distinctly international sound Donovan achieves here.

B00005JMAH|1.0|I am a huge HP fan right from the beginning.  I was amazed with <br />the first two movies, they were more than just cinematic special effects works of art but also shockingly true to the books. <br /> <br />I wish I could say the same for number 3.  I am a 1st gen. Costa Rican American and was sooo hoping that Alfonso would do all Latinos proud with this movie (though I couldn't help but wonder why WB would fix what was so obviously not broken by removing the first director).  Unfortunately this movie was a sad, sad <br />disappointment. <br /> <br />Broken up and disjointed, at turns ludicrously silly and suspenseful this story barely resembles the story that we fans have come to love.  Even if you have never picked up an HP book in your life -unless you are easily wowed by special effects- this will be at best an annoying waste of time you'll never get back.  At least if you have read the books you have some idea where the story is headed, it not this will be a study in confusion.  Alfonso not only took out huge (and in many cases important) chunks of the storyline he also added (in many cases both unneccessary and idiotic)weird bits to the story as well. (The premature and forced romance between Ron and Hermione for instance, was just creepy.  We're talking huge Eeew factor here.) It's almost as if JK Rowling's story just wasn't good enough for our man Alfonso. <br /> <br />I have heard many people refer to the \\"darkness\\" of this 3rd installment.  Wrong.  The real story was much darker.  This was a one dimensional cartoonish look at what was actually one heckuva whopper of a tale.  <br /> <br />While the acting on the part of the kids has greatly improved the acting for the adults seems to have dwindled (too little time on screen coupled with too little effort).  We saw far too little of the wonderfully sinister Snape for example and far too much of a divination teacher dumbed so far down as to be a caricature.  Emma Thompson did the best she could with what they gave her but it was absolutely painful to watch.  Most of our beloved characters were put on the backburner as Mr. Cuaron seemed determined to share his version of the HP story as opposed to JKR's.   <br /> <br />In short: choppy, spastic and intrusive directing, odd and bizarre characterizations, lackluster writing and \\"after school special\\" type over & under acting all adds up to a pretty lukewarm and disappointing movie experience (and a cold slap in the face of true blue loyal HP fans everywhere).  I don't know why WB thought they had to dull and dumb the whole thing down for us.  Do they really think kids don't know an obvious directors ego trip when they see one?  Hey, I'm young not stupid. <br /> <br />My advice? Save your money, wait for the Goblet of Fire.  It's got to be better than this. <br /> <br />
B000294SFW|5.0|I have been listening to this album for 2 days straight on the stereo, so almost 50 hours now,  leave it on while i sleep too,  <br />Just let motorhead entertain you,  everybody gets so mad, that motorhead won't die,  and keep coming back with lots of good stuff,  <br />And this is good , without comparing it to other albums, It has all the healing powers of the other albums if used wisely, and for real motorhead abusers, it will still allow you to overdose in style and comfort.  I hope there is more to come, if we just let lemmy be lemmy (and he won't be anyone else) and maybe say well done, from time to time,  he might continue to enlighten us, <br />Some fans seem to be afraid that motorhead will dissolve into something unpleasant and watery,  motorhead is the acid bath, that dissolves all around it, so just let this one, corrode you a bit, re light the fire, and then burn you alive, inferno!
0393035158|5.0|I may not totally agree with everything in \\"The End of Faith\\" but it is an extremely important work that has been needed by those of us that view religion as a personal commitment rather than an excuse for war, terrorism, establishment of legislation or persecution of others. I am personally tired of those with superstitious beliefs, be they Christian, Moslem, or what ever religion, that are only proven by statements of \\"FAITH\\" dictating how the rest of us should lead our lives. Those that condem this book claim to believe in freedom of speach but certainly do not practise it themselves. I commend Sam Harris for acurately stating what many people believe but are shouted down by the narrow minded proponents of what ever religion they happen to belong to! <br />
B000002AHM|5.0|We will never again behold such a great trio in action.  This three guitar gods going at it with fire and passion, playfully crafting a work of art for the ages.  Di Meola, de Lucia and Mclaughlin are simply the best at waht they do, no one can touch de Lucia's passion, power and velocity.  Sit down and pay attention to all the little details in this great album, you'll see what im talking about.
0671027387|2.0|I read The Da Vinci Code, then Angels and Demons.  I couldn't put these down, so I couldn't wait to start Deception Point.  While I would have to say the book was okay, it wasn't up to par with The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  It was just too far fetched for me.  Just when you think there is no way they can get out of their current issue, the unthinkable happens.  A submarine coming to the rescue?  Just a little too out there for me.  It would be a good place to start for someone wanting to read Dan Brown.  I, however, was disappointed after his wonderful books The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.
B00003CXCT|5.0|People seem to want to complain because George Lucas wanted to edit and redo the films. I like the changes, for all you perfection \\"gotta have\\" people. I don't think these edits make it bad, they make the saga complete, and I don't mean just IV, V, VI, I mean all six titles: from beginning to end. It allows the complete tale to be understood.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a short album, but a great one nonetheless. I was not previously a fan of Linkin Park, though I did like at least a few of their earlier songs. This album is full of the typical in-your-face sounds with a seething underlying anger/fury, which in fact is more often overt than not. I think that the music is great for: <br /> <br />- street racing <br />- street fighting <br />- lifting weights <br />- making one's last stand <br /> <br />I never consider mindlessly loud music to be good music, but I think that these guys really manage to get the formula down pat. If you can ignore, for a second, the fact that the vocals are screaming, the guitar is going nuts, and the drums are hammering, you'll realize that there is a talent to the songs. They are very catchy indeed.
0393035158|5.0|Read Mr. Harris' book and you will know the answer.  The End of Faith is an insighful view into the extravagant follies of the major world religions.  One does not need to be an antheist to come to the realization that the world is in grave danger and it is not from weapons of mass destruction but from the individuals who are unshakeable in their doctrine of beliefs.  That so many people of various faiths do not question but blindly follow ideas which in any other walk of life would be considered madness, is truly mind boggling.  What is the role of religion in the world today?  The answer to that question is not what you might think.  Mr. Harris makes extremely valid points about how political decisions are being made by people who believe without any rhyme or reason that their religious views are the only correct view.  The terrorists in the world are not being driven by political agendas but by religious ones.  Mr. Harris is right on his belief that terrorists are not the only ones being driven by religious fervor.  However, he does feel Isalm peoples who follow the Koran word for word are waging a war, not against the evils of America but against all who don't share their faith.  Sam Harris elaborates eloquently the foils of the major religions and how the myths have been written to control the masses.  I challenge the religious to read this book.  They may find that God is more awesome than their narrow minded religion allows them to believe and that each and every one of us must replace the myths with responsible action in the world.  It is very possible to still believe in God and be rational too!  Accolades to Mr. Harris, for this book is an excellent read and one that makes alot of sense.  Everyone who cares about what is happening in our world today needs to read this book.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Prog Metal/Rock...whatever you maybe call this group means a lot of things. Now normally I'm a huge fan of DT and I adored every single album that they created (yes...even FII). But this album has made me lose some faith in them. I mean...how the hell do you create an album in around 2-3 weeks? That's just blasphemous and outrageous! No band in their right minds (especially DT!) should be creating and at the same time releasing an album that early. Hell...psh...this pisses me off...this album had so much potential but they threw it all away (is it to promote a fresh new tour with Yes?) Anyways this album is my least favorite...why? Heh I'll go to the bashing later.  <br /> <br />First I'll defend it by saying that it is not truly nu-metal. Hell I'll refrain from call nu-metal even nu-metal...I'll call it rapcore. Now rapcore...has a concentration around more of the heavier and more jumpier riffs then they do on anything else. Then the lyrics...are more like rap like lyrics (which people only sing to though) Yes DT has at least one song that you can hear LaBrie rapping on. But that still won't do this one justice. I mean...okay they also have heavier riffs as well but I don't think you can look these guys in the eyes and say \\"YOU SUCK!\\" John Petrucci, James LaBrie, John Myung, Mike Portney, Jordan Rudess...they are all adroit in their instruments and I doubt anyone can deny that as well. You can say that this is the following predecessor of Awake. Although Awake was a much more better album since you can actually extinguish the keyboards to the guitar on that one. And they actually put time recording it and remixing it again.  <br /> <br />Now for some song analysis...Sure some of these songs are heavier then awake, but some songs just dig right into you and hang onto you and never let go.  <br />Songs like Vacancy is surprising since its only Keyboard + Bass + Cello along with Labrie creating the lyrics to the song. And I have to admit...it's probably the best songthere is (lyric wise) on this album. So soft...so comforting...Then afterwards it goes right into Streams of Consiousness...the real treat of this album.   <br />The style reminds me of Erotomania...Right after the instrumental comes the vocal parts...whew just too intense... <br /> <br />Okay now...as I look through the reviews I see that people are arguing that ToT should've been the next Metallica album. But I think NOT! Allow me to confuse the readers with my logics to why I think that this was never the next album Metallica would've created. <br /> <br />Metallica =/= Dream Theater (so therefore...) <br />Metallica =/= ToT <br /> <br />If that's too hard to understand I'll say it bluntly. Metallica will NEVER match the powers, technicality, and everything else that this band has. Now let's compare the band members to each other... <br /> <br />The guitarists (John Petrucci Vs Kirk Hammit!) <br />First of all, right off the bat who will you say is better? Obviously John Petrucci...Even though they were both taught by the same teacher it seems as though Kirk just gave up and went along with the whole mainstream idea now. I mean he really could quit the band and try to join another band or at least do a side project. Instead what he does is stay in mainstream Metallica and let his guitar get all rusty. Wanna talk about the days that Kirk did AJFA and before? His solos consisted of mainly fast thrashing (which Marty Friedman did better on) he didn't really change the whole \\"thrash\\" like solos. Oh sure he can change the sound of his guitar but it never changed until MoP and AJFA. But it was only a few solos that really sounded different. Plus John Petrucci has his solo projects to show how great he really is. And yes I have most of Metallica's albums (just didn't start getting from black album and up since I DOWNLOADED THEM!) <br /> <br />The drummers (Mike Portney Vs Lars Ulrich) <br />I think it's safe to assume the better drummer is Mike Portney. Transatlantic, Neal Morse's solo project, LTE, ISO, and hell whatever the hell he does vs. Lars doing...uh...Metallica and his trashcan like drum sounds. Yeah...very nice indeed <br /> <br />The bassists (John Myung vs ...) <br />I don't know who to compare Myung to since Metallica's bassists have changed 3 times...2/3 bassists suck but I gotta give props to Burton. That guy rocked while he was still alive...so I guess you can't really compare anyone but still...anyone who knows how Myung plays against Metallica's current bassists... <br /> <br />The Singers (James Hetfield vs Kevin James LaBrie) <br />Wahaha...professional singer from Canada vs an american singer/guitarist who tries to growl but he can't. And his voice dosen't get better until around MoP. Blah... <br /> <br />Keyboardist? <br />Eh no contest here... <br /> <br />So allow us to observe the long list I made (please I cut out so much) and to say that Metallica and Dream Theater aren't the same. And please don't say they are becoming nu-metal. It's just an insult to all the true metal heads around and plus your comparing some crap band like korn and linkin park to a virtuoistic, godlike band DT?  <br />
0316168815|1.0|In my opinion, The Lovely Bones: <br /> <br />is not a good book; <br /> <br />is waste of your time; <br /> <br />has one very disturbing scene; and <br /> <br />you would be much better off reading something else (or spending your money on a nice lunch even). <br /> <br />OK, so why isn't it a very good book? <br /> <br />The premise of the book is nice enough.  Susie is a sweet 14 year old girl who is raped and murdered, goes to heaven and watches her family and friends as she longs to return to Earth.  There is scope here to explore human themes of grief, love, loneliness etc (add your own possibilities here).  There is also scope here for a really positive book about the human condition (or even a negative book about the human condition if you like).  Unfortunately the execution of the interesting premise is so poorly done that no themes emerge at all and what we are served up is maudlin, boring rubbish about a 14 year old girl watching a vast array of people go about their (relatively uninteresting) lives.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. <br /> <br />I just couldn't understand what this book was supposed to be about.  There are no revelations about life, death or living.  It isn't a book about hope.  It isn't a book about grief.  As far as I could see, it didn't have anything to say about anything.  The best possibility (and the part that I enjoyed the most in the book) was exploring the different ways in which Susie's family grieved her death.  But even this didn't get very far.  I could almost sympathise with the father's grief, but found him ineffectual and weak.  (By the way - are we really to believe that he would send his surviving daughter into the house of the man he is convinced killed Susie in order to search for clues?)  And the Mother was too self-absorbed and selfish to have any emotional response to her daughter's death or any sort of connection with her family. <br /> <br />I think what the author might havebeen trying to do was show how the various people that had been a part of Susie's life when she was alive remained connected after her death.  But this didn't work either because the connections were tenuous at best and what the book really amounted to was a 14 year old girl watching a bunch of different people go about their lives.  Boring. <br /> <br />There were also too many characters that we didn't get to know and too many sub-plots that didn't add anything to the story.  What was the point of the people Susie met in heaven?  What was the point of Ray's cigarette smoking mother and never there father?  What was the point of the Grandmother?  Why did we keep getting cut scenes to the killer sleeping rough?  All of which created a fairly disjointed feel to the book.  I think some further editing and a better focus on what it was supposed to be about would have aided the book greatly.   <br /> <br />And then just to really kick you in the guts the ending is unbelievably trite and clichd.  Very disappointing. <br /> <br />Why is this book a waste of your time? - Because life is too short to waste time reading rubbish books.  If you want to spend your precious time reading books then go out and find one better than this. <br /> <br />What is the one incredibly disturbing scene? - That would be the scene where 14 year old Susie returns to Earth and has sex with a grown man.  What makes this particularly unpleasant is (i) she uses another woman's body to do this; (ii) her only sexual experience when she was alive was to be brutally raped (and murdered); and (iii) the guy knew what was going on (i.e. he was having sex with a 14 year old girl who had taken over the body of another woman) and didn't think anything was unusual.  I wonder why Susie chose to get jiggy rather than talk to her grieving family or tell people the identity of her murderer?  I found this whole scene quite unpleasant. <br /> <br />Why would you be much better off reading something else? - Because there are much better books out there.  I think this is an example of a book that gets tipped by popular reviewers (Richard and Judy here in the UK; Oprah book club in the US - you know the type) and then the masses go out and read it.  Next thing you know everybody is talking about it; everybody is telling you how great it is and you feel compelled to go out and read it.  So you do.  And then you are disappointed.  The Di Vinci Code is another recent example of this type of average book that gets hyped up.   <br /> <br />You'd think that I would have learned by now. <br />
B00003CXA3|5.0|What can be said about this landmark picture?  It's got everything.  You've got Gene Hackman commanding the screen as Popeye Doyle in every scene he's in whether he's busting a drug bar, chasing a sniper while driving manicly under the El tracks, or pursuing his elusive prey, Charnier, better known as \\"Frog One\\".  Roy Scheider gives a great supporting performance as Cloudy, Popeye's cooler headed partner as does Fernando Rey as the wily Charnier.  Kudos also go to William Friedkin for his sure-handed direction.  He orchestrates every aspect of this film perfectly from the establishing scenes in Marseilles, to the buyers in New York, to the police investigation of the connection.  Though we have been inundated in recent years with police dramas both cinematic and on television, this is the mother of them all.  Thirty plus years on this film holds up as well as it did on it's initial release.
B0000024RZ|5.0|I am officially obsessed with this album. In my opinion, the most amazing thing about it may be the fact that Dylan recorded this at 22 years old. While still only a child, his worn voice and cynical lyrics create an atmosphere of wisdom and maturity far beyond his years.  <br /> <br />Released in early 1964, mere weeks after the Beatles touched down in America for the first time and standing at the foot of the civil rights monolith to come, the title track has taken on an almost prophetic identity of its own. At times on this album, it seems as though the ghost of Woody Guthrie has taken over Dylan. And there he is, standing on a mountaintop, peering out into the second half of the 1960's.  <br /> <br />The times were definitely a-changin', and then there was Dylan.
B000000W5L|5.0|It's just the best rock and roll album ever, period.
B00005JN7O|4.0|When giant robots invade Manhattan, Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Law) is called in to save the day.  After stopping those robots, he is reunited with Polly Perkins (Paltrow), an old love and reporter.  Apparently, the robot attack is tied to the disappearance of prominent scientists.  Some research by Polly points to the mysterious Dr. Totenkoph (Laurence Olivier, in a computer-aided performance - he has been dead for a while now).  Sky Captain embarks on a quest to find Totenkoph, and Polly will not be left behind.<br /><br />To some extent \\"Sky Captain\\" is an exercise in style over substance.  That's not to say that there is no story, it is just that the story serves to give the audience all those glorious visuals.  The effects are amazing, and provide the movie with a look that I have never seen before.  \\"Sky Captain\\" plays like a movie from the early twentieth century made with the effects technology of today.  It is an original idea, and it is flawlessly executed.  The effects are so great to look at that you do not realize the story is not the greatest.  Perhaps it just seems a bit hokey in today's movie age...I am not a huge fan of old movies.<br /><br />Law and Paltrow do good jobs in the lead roles.  Angeline Jolie makes an appearance later in the film, but is by no means one of the leads.  The most memorable role is Dex Dearborn, Sky Captain's sidekick played with a bit of quirkiness by Giovanni Ribisi.  \\"Sky Captain\\" is a good \\"escape\\" movie, worth checking out, especially on the big screen.
B000002UAO|5.0|You want I should review a Beatles album?? This is like reviewing Van Gogh or Faulkner. There is nothing I could possibly add to the Beatles discourse, if you'll pardon the term. I lived and breathed these guys in the 60s (and I still keep up, lest you think I'm fossilized in that decade). There's nothing I can do but say Rubber Soul is probably my favorite. To describe it kills it. And by the way, what planet has somebody recently arrived from that they would need to check the reviews of a Beatles album before buying it? (Or maybe that *is* the fossil in me).
B00028HBKM|1.0|There is nothing \\"real\\" or \\"realistic\\" about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is, quite simple, an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in \\"Kill Bill\\" is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?), this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called, \\"The Dumbing of America,\\" save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens, not celebrates, the life of Christ. Pure drivel.
B000286RZM|4.0|I love the lyrics on this album, but can't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's as vital as his other work.  It's a great piece to own for frusciante's fans and people who dig devendra and the like.  I also think that it was a great way to start the series off because it is so different from his other work.  I would say if you're choosing releases to get shadows instead of this if you are only going to get one of the two, but both are cool.  For guitar heroics don't come here though there are none. check out automatic writing to get your guitar fix.
B000286S8S|5.0|Oh my. 3 new Van Halen songs with Sammy at the helm. Will they have a hip-hop beat or add new sythesized effects or trickery? Will the be overwrought emotional confessionals about hating ones parents as with so much nu-metal out there today? Will Sammy rap anything to give Linkin Park a run for their money? No, no, no. Just Eddie on guitar, Mikey on bass, Alex on the skins and Sammy screaming his freaking head off. Oh my, so Van Halen. So totally, unmistakably Van Halen. Like many posters I was way into \\"It's About Time\\" right off the bat, and \\"Up for Breakfast\\" has a nice \\"Carnal Knowledge\\" vibe to it, but take a moment with \\"Learning to See.\\" Eddie noodles. Then Eddie explodes. Then Eddie relaxes, with Sammy singing, and there's time changes and guitar changes and layered solos and just when it's getting back under control Eddie and Sammy explode with an outro unlike any other VH song I can think of. It's a heavy riff-- a big, monolithic, heavy riff that sounds like one guitarist only. It ends with this bloodcurdling scream and I go, \\"Was that just as good as I think it was?\\" I swear I've listened to the song over and over and I'm willing to say that \\"Learning to See\\" might be my favorite song of the Sammy Hagar era. But then, I'm a fan of the minor chord stuff like \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Humans Being.\\" Dark Eddie makes me happy, and \\"Learning to See\\" is Dark Eddie at his best. If you're a \\"Beautiful Girls\\" or \\"Top of the World\\" Halen fan, maybe \\"Learning to See\\" isn't for you. But if you think \\"Fair Warning\\" is as good as it gets, \\"Learning to See\\" should do the trick.

B00004RFFI|3.0|Are you looking for original plotlines?  Don't bother.  Are you looking for oscar winning dialogue?  Forget it.  Are you looking for compelling characters and interactions between them?  Not here.    Are you looking for a screen presence bigger then Arnold Schwarzenegger in Conan or The Terminator?  Well may I introduce The Twister as it works it's way up the category ladder to a 'Finger of God' barn trashing, combine throwing, house thrashing level five.  I like almost all the actors in this movie, with Jamie Gertz being the only exception.  They try very hard to pull something out of this movie, especially Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, but nothing can over shadow the brutality of the movies main celebrity, the tornadoes.  Of which the effects are incredible.     In true Hollywood popcorn movie fashion we are treated to a by the numbers, good storm chasers vs. bad storm chasers, 'I don't do this anymore because I'm a weatherman', female lead still in love with the male lead and he's still in love with her but denys it...oh heck with it, it's a fun movie to watch so just shut your brain down, break out the extra butter, artery clogging Reddenbachers and have a blast.
B0000524E5|1.0|I wanted to see this film because I heard it was a fun and fluffy \\"pro-feminist\\" story.  It was supposed to be engaging and sexy.  Instead, I thought it was demeaning, unengaging and poorly acted.  I know some might think I read into it a little too much because it is supposed to be one of those \\"fluff\\" films aimed at young teenage boys and women who need a little boost for their self esteem as sexy, independent beings.<br /><br />Violet (Piper Perabo) is a shy and ambitious songwriter, who leaves the shelter of the home she shares with her father in New Jersey to the edgy environment of New York City.  She doesn't know a soul and happens to wander into a bar filled with \\"coyotes\\" (women who dance on the bar table provocatively and also bartend for the many--predominantly male--customers).  This obviously male fantasy of a young, sheltered artist breaking out of her shell and becoming more in touch with her sensuality was just silly.  At the end, I found myself caring less and less what the resolution was and asked myself why I even wasted the $2.50 at the video rental to begin with!!!!
068987474X|5.0|Where was this book when I was in my 20's???  At one time I suspected this was the truth about men.  Then, later, I decided to just watch what they do and THAT was the truth, i.e. if they want to be with you they will.  All of this, however, was female guesswork.  THANK YOU, GREG, for stepping up to the plate and telling us females the truth from a guy's point of view.  You have helped me understand that they just weren't really into me and I can live with that now.  'Scuse me, gotta go...busy life, no longer waiting by the phone!    hahahahaha!  Catch me, if you can.  Thank you Greg, Liz and OPRAH!  You have saved ANOTHER life right here in Anytown, USA.  :-D
B000062XMI|3.0|I am definitely a huge fan of \\"food movies.\\"  Not only do I like to watch it prepared and incorporated as a metaphor connected to different aspects of life experiences, but I also love to prepare it myself...really personalizing every unique dish I prepare.  That was what I expected would be the case with this movie, \\"Woman on Top.\\"  I wanted to savor every ingredient that was sauteed and simmering for the audience.  Unfortunately, it was contrived, over-cooked and stale!<br /><br />Isabella (Penelope Cruz) is a cocinera (chef) in her native Brazil, who has an extreme case of motion sickness that occurs when she isn't in control of situations.  She is married to Toninho (Murilo Benicio), a man who needs to feel like the man in a situation and grows weary of his wife's control freak tendencies.  So, he does what any stereotypical example of a macho Latino would do.  He cheats on his wife (What else?!).  This is the motivation for Isabella to flee the environment she knows and loves.  Isabella runs to the comforting arms of her Brazilian compatriot--who happens to be a transvestite.  Isabella is not only worn ragged by her husband's infidelity, but happens to be gorgeous and a brilliant chef.  (Do you see where I am going with this??....)  As luck would have it, she goes from teaching a cooking course (with lots of hot peppers, of course), to becoming a celebrity chef on television.<br /><br />My main complaint  (besides the lack of chemistry between Penelope Cruz and her two would-be suitors--her philandering husband and Cliff Lloyd, played by Mark Feurstein, who works with her on her TV show) was that there wasn't enough attention paid to the food (luscious photography, for example) and the lack of spark in the would-be \\"magical realism\\" they attempted to forcefeed us, the hapless \\"Americano\\" audience.<br /><br />Note:  If you want to see REAL magical realism where food is involved, give \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\" a try.  Other good food films are \\"Eat Drink Man Woman\\" and \\"What's Cooking?\\"Man Woman\\" and \\"What's Cooking?\\"
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is one of the most successful, if not THE most successful recording artist of the past decade. She goes from strength to strength with her career and it's no suprise with the talent, music and looks she has she has sold almost 80 million records since 1999.     This her 4th successive #1 album in the USA (and many other countries) is a great moment in what looks like is going to continue to be a long career. From dance floor fillers such as \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Outrageous\\" to ballads such as \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\" this album is a classic by no stretch of the imagination.   Britney is the ruler of the pop world! Long may she reign!

B00003CXCT|3.0|I remember sitting in the theater in 1997 watching the revised Episode IV and thinking it more a strange oddity of Darth Flannel's (George's) brain than some brilliant update.  The new CG animals / creatures / robots flitting across the screen were more a distraction than a help.  It did not \\"enhance\\" the picture.  One enhancement that was done properly was refining and CG-izing the Death Star sequences.  That is the only right choice Lucas made on the \\"enhanced\\" Star Wars--OTHER than digitizing the DVD version, which was not just absolutely necessary, but brilliantly done.  The DVD trilogy is incredibly clear and crisp, no question.  One day when I have an HDTV and a HD-DVD version of this movie, I will be able to bring the full theater experience into my home. <br /> <br />The debate rages on about the versions.  I have my own set of reservations about \\"director's cuts.\\"  I think director's cuts are only helpful when they add ORIGINAL footage, not re-shot, enhanced, or newly created footage.  For example, the DC version of Terminator 2 was excellent; the DC version of Blade Runner, which we can credit for essentially starting the DC craze, is so trivially different than the original theatrical cut, it almost seems unnecessary.  Regardless, neither broke new ground.  Neither were artificially \\"enhanced.\\"  For fans, it was exciting to see new original footage.   <br /> <br />George has taken off on a DC bender though: he has decided unilaterally that Eps. IV-VI are his toys to play with.  This is the sad reality of the cult of personality around him that he has bought into--now he thinks because he has unlimited rights to change the originals, he should.  He wants to villify his creation as flawed and weak because it was the product of limited time, budget, and studio pressure.  <br /> <br />Frankly, George, so what.  <br /> <br />I was 7 years old when Ep. IV came out.  It became, like that of many children of the time, the center of my little universe.  I *was* Luke Skywalker.  Yes, I had the stand that held all the Kenner action figures and I had EVERY SINGLE ONE.  As silly as all the attention was to the actors (who, unlike us, were adults, after all), it was our world.  It became embedded into our mythic imagination and is forever an integral part of our nostalgia. <br /> <br />George doesn't care about us.  He could care less about our nostalgia and our history with Star Wars.  I honestly don't think he cares so much about the money--he can bankrupt most of the Third World just by writing a check--I think he honestly believes he has some unlimited right to re-realize his artistic vision, no matter if he should or not, no matter the opinion of what he sees as some small fringe of the fans that have been with him for almost 30 years now. <br /> <br />As director and writer, clearly George has a perspective and understanding of the original the rest of us don't.  I'll give him that.  Do artists, writers, and movie directors revise their work continually?  Yes, of course--but, at some point, they have to stop and move on to the next thing.  Very few masterpieces of literature were re-written or revised after they were published.  There isn't a single author that doesn't see room for improvement, but almost none go through the process of revising the text.  They let it stand on whatever merits it has. <br /> <br />George should have done the same--with very carefully chosen enhancements of original footage.  AT LEAST--at the VERY least--he should give us fans the cleaned and scrubbed originals on DVD, no CG, no enhancements.  He is adamant that he won't.  Wait, he's not just adamant, he's utterly indignant that he won't.  <br /> <br />Now, with all this said, I will say I have no problem with George  changing Eps. I and II all he wants--in fact, he can scrap them and start from scratch.  First thing to go?  Why Jar-Jar of course.
0780629450|5.0|I saw Franco Zeffirelli's version of Hamlet before this one, yet I've slowly warmed up to this one and think Branagh's is superior.  I've always loved Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth and was smitten by Mel Gibson's performance as Hamlet; plus, the filming was done in Scotland, Branagh's in Denmark.  Both versions are excellent.  However, one comes away with the understanding from Zeffirelli's take on Hamlet that what was so foul about Hamlet's father's murder was the moral depravity of his uncle who in Davidic fashion commits adultery/incest with the queen, then murders the king in a way no one will suspect foul play.  Branagh's version includes all of the scenes mentioning Fortinbras, the Norwegian prince who is on a rampage with his mercenary troops since he lost lands to Hamlet's father.  The reason why I think Branagh's is superior is that what made the 'murder most foul' was something much larger than a lustful/greedy bent on the part of Hamlet's uncle, something more akin to real estate scams/aggressions of the twelfth century.  His uncle does confess his sin later but not really in Davidic fashion.  (David, after his affair with Bathsheba and the arranged death in battle of her husband, Uriah, the Hittite, was totally broken in spirit by what mischief he had unleashed, please see Psalm 51).  His confession seems merely to follow a formula taught by his church; his repentance was not sincere or complete, and he continues to poison peoples' minds like Laertes and Polonius with the aim of destroying Hamlet and usurping all power in Denmark.  Please ponder Revelation 9:21-and they didn't repent of their murders, nor their sorceries, nor their immorality (not only sexual, think of the term perversion of justice) nor of their thefts.<br /><br />Hamlet has always been my favorite play of Shakespeare's.  The cast in Branagh's is as star-filled as Zeffirelli's, the acting as great.  In reading about Branagh's career, I'm amazed at what he had accomplished at age 36 when he directed this film.  I'm impressed, sold, amazed by this multi-talented actor.ected this film.  I'm impressed, sold, amazed by this multi-talented actor.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|\\"Van Helsing\\" is another movie based on a comic hero. With the success of Spider-man, I expected it to be as quality and emotive as \\"Spider-man.\\" However, the crude visual effects, weak plot, and poor acting proved stark otherwise. <br /> <br />The whole movie looks very dark, so the flashing sparkles are extremely uncomfortable to watch. Worse still, the effects look intolerable since they simply lack beauty and elegance. If images of monsters are deliberately created to be terrifying, there is also art to it that could have beautified them. <br /> <br />Some minor plots, such as Van Helsing's mysterious identity, could have been extended to add some appeal to the awful movie. I personally think that a few scenes of Van Helsing agonizing over his confusion might have very much aroused viewers' identification. Also, more information on Anna Valerious' doomed heritage could have been discussed as well if the movie is filmed to entertain the audience. <br /> <br />Both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are brilliant actors to be if they had not starred in this low cast movie. Owing to the unbearable flaws mentioned above, even a player proficient as Tom Hanks can never salvage it, let alone the two. <br /> <br />To sum up, the movie is one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen. Being so uninspired and almost gruesome, I would recommend \\"Spider-man\\" instead.

0440539811|5.0|Wilson and Shea penned one of the biggest cult classics of all time. Inspiring a game, a stage production and countless conversations, Illuminatus! launches one on a whirlwind tour of the bizarre and the ridiculous. <br /> <br />The underlying message? Think for yourself, dummy! An interesting introduction to caballism, discordianism and the always interesting mental trap of freeing oneself from mental traps. A must read for anyone who likes to both think and giggle, preferably at the same time.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's second album, and a sequel to the fantastic \\"...Baby One More Time\\". <br />#1. Oops! ...I Did it Again <br />This song is very \\"Britney\\", like Crazy and Hit Me Baby One More Time from her first album. 10/10 <br /> <br />#2. Stronger <br />This one is also very \\"Britney\\". 10/10 <br /> <br />#3. Don't Go Knockin' At My Door <br />This song is kind of club, kind of hip hop. Really cool, this shows that Britney's second album will be a lot different than her debut. Pretty good song. 7/10 <br /> <br />#4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction <br />Britney follows her tradition of remaking an old song. Before it was Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\", this time it's \\"Satisfaction\\" by the Rolling Stones. The lyrics are awesome, so is the beat and the music. The chorus is the best part. I think this song works even better as a Britney Spears song. The only part I don't like is the \\"I can't get no, uh, satisfaction\\" part. It sounds really corny. 7/10 <br /> <br />#5. Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know <br />The first ballad on this album, I really like this. It's better than most of the ballads from her debut. Her voice really shines on this track. Parts of the music sounds very ethnic. The beat on the chorus is reminiscent of Pat Benatar's \\"We Belong\\". 8/10 <br /> <br />#6. What You See (Is What You Get) <br />This is my favorite track on this album. Like the first two songs, this is very \\"Britney\\". She comments on how everybody complains about her image, basically saying she can look how she wants, and if you don't like it, too bad. :) You know I love those staccato notes. Really a great song. We should all be proud of who we are. 10/10 <br /> <br />#7. Lucky <br />Almost tied for my favorite song. It's about a girl with fame and fortune who still isn't happy. Maybe she's trying to tell us how she feels. More of my lovely staccato notes, and really pretty music. I like the beat a lot. 10/10 <br /> <br />#8. One Kiss From You <br />This is also a great song. Great melody and beat.This is a good dance song. KIND OF hip hop. This reminds me of Soda Pop from her debut, only this makes sense, is more developed, and is a much better song. 8/10 <br /> <br />#9. Where Are You Now <br />This song is a bit \\"blah\\" and forgettable. I like the guitar. The song is just too boring. Ballads can be interesting. This would work good on a movie soundtrack, but I really don't see how it fits with the rest of this album. Not a bad song. 6/10 <br /> <br />#10. Can't Make You Love Me <br />Another very \\"Britney\\" song, this isn't quite as good as all the others, but is still a pretty great dance song. Like a lot of Britney's songs, the chorus is the best part by far. 7/10 <br /> <br />#11. When Your Eyes Say It <br />This song is much better suited for Mandy Moore's voice. I like some of the sound effects, but the music could be a bit more exciting. Not the weakest song on the album, but nowhere near the best. 6/10 <br /> <br />#12. Dear Diary <br />The lyrics are really dorky and the song itself is pretty boring.  5/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good album.
B0001YRVN4|2.0|Episodes 3, 4 and 5 should be considered 2004 movies NOT movies from the 70's and early 80's.  So for movies that have taken 25 years to make (begun in 1976 and finished in 2004 - unless George Lucas is still \\"not happy\\" with the current results) these movies are quite average by 2004 standards. <br /> <br />I suppose as computing power gets more powerful in the coming years George Lucas will replace the whole thing with flawless digital characters.  George Lucas has joined the Dark Side...more machine now than man. <br /> <br />By the way,...when the Death Star blows up at the end of episode IV, all I can think of is the Klingon moon, Praxis, blowing up at the opening of Star Trek VI.  Apparently George Lucas had that effect in mind as well in 1977,
B000089CJI|4.0|I took notice of The Postal Service when my fiancee and I were haphazardly surfing the radio dial and heard \\"Such Great Heights\\". We were immediately transported back to our golden pre-adolescent 1980's days when New Wave ruled the music business and such bands like Human League, New Order, Howard Jones, Eurythmics, OMD, Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and Depeche Mode were on top of the world. Unfortunately, the radio station did not mention the name of the band and so I forgot about it....until I was in a local Target and the video was playing on their sound system. I snapped it up.<br /><br />Well, after listening to this disc thoroughly, and not being familiar with Death Cab For Cutie or the other bands these members came from, I felt the first five tracks were excellent. In fact, it's one of the best song sequences I've heard on a cd in quite some time. But, the second half of the cd does not match the quality of the first. I could not put my finger on it other than the last five songs seemed bland. This can be the case with other electronic bands, including my favorites listed above. It was as if The Postal Service ran out of musical ideas on the last half of the disc, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The songs are still strong, but I can not give this cd five stars because it just missed the mark.<br /><br />However, I would definitely recommend any fan of electronic music that has a pop structure to it to buy this disc, it certainly is a great cd. I am definitely looking forward to another cd by this band (if they ever do another). \\"Give Up\\" is an unusual listen because they have, indeed, re-created 80's New Wave and updated it, making it their own. As a side note, I also felt that there was some influence stemming from what I consider the godfathers of New Wave/electronic music--Kraftwerk and even Mike Oldfield who began making this type of music in the early 1970's. Check them all out!
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I first heard this album when I was living on the French dpartement outre mer, La Runion.  I heard a little bit here and there and decided to buy the CD.  It is fantastic.  In fact, I must have worn my CD out, because the last few tracks (which also happen to be my favorites) won't even play anymore.  So now I have to buy another copy (the other night I resorted to singing to myself, \\"Dieu que le monde est injuste\\" when it wouldn't play more than the first three seconds).  Thanks Amazon for carrying it!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|alright, so many people are bashing this album and i can see why. this album incorporates a lot of the usual slipknot stuff, but a lot of new things were brought in as well. many people don't like the new things (i.e. acoustic parts). this album has no swearing on it, which is a BIG change.... there are some bands that swear a lot and it sounds dumb, like theyre doing it just to sound like everybody else, there is no feeling behind it, slipknot is NOT one of those bands. corey has always put conviction into everything he says. whether he uses swears or not the lyrics mean something. the guitar work in this album is a big improvment from the other almums. they bring in some old school shred type riffs as well as the usuall nu-metal stuff. the first time i listened to this cd i hated it. i couldn't believe they were calling this slipknot. then i listened to it a couple more times and heard things that i missed, and now its one of my favorite cd's. it's one of the few cd's i can listen to all the way through without skipping any songs. there is so much content that it takes more than a few times to hear and process it all. some songs sound very different, almost stone sourish, but the energy and intensity is present on many of the tracks. not to mention that the video for \\"duality\\" is one of the best videos i've seen.
0553212737|5.0|I read Emma maybe a year ago, and I absolutely loved it!  It's my favorite novel from Jane Austen followed by Pride & Prejudice.  In fact I only like those two novels out of the six she wrote, but anyway, Emma was a really good read. The best part about this novel is that it isn't about a girl who is looking for love, it's about a girl who unexpectedly finds love where it has been all the time.  Talk about right under your nose.  Emma is friendly, kind, naive, smart, loyal, whitty, clever, innocent, and definatley worth reading.  I truly love this book because I love romance in it's purest form, true love, when you know that these two characters will spend the rest of their lives together and will love each other faithfully!  That's why I love this book, and Pride & Prejudice is the same way, maybe I'll write a review for that too, hope this helps you out, and buy the book!
B00004TDTO|5.0|I love the outtakes sections best of all the special features on this dvd. I found it great fun to see how they filmed this phonemonel masterpiece of a film. Would've liked a commentary too on the film by cast and or crew but can't have everything.
B000009EAD|5.0|I got into Iced Earth when I first purchased their live album Alive In Athens, and Days Of Purgatory (consisting of rerecordings of earlier material with then vocalist Matt Barlow) last year. I went into my local Sam Goody store in late winter this year, and I found Something Wicked This Way Comes. So I picked it up, and after listening to it twice, I loved it from beginning to end. The first three songs Burning Times, Melancholy (Holy Martyr), and Disciples Of The Lie are very addictive. Singer Matt Barlow's vocals on here kick ass. Jon Schaffer's rhythm guitarwork and melodies are just outstanding and Larry Tarnowski's lead guitarwork will blow your head away. This is my favorite Iced Earth album thus far along with Horror Show, and I'm looking forward to getting their older albums as well Other great songs include Stand Alone, Watching Over Me, 1776 (instrumental), Prophecy, Birth Of The Wicked, and My Own Savior. Awesome album.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I can remember when I saw this movie in the theater for the first time when I was thirteen. It was as if someone out there knew for the first time that SF could be intellegently for the big screen. The documentary DVD sheds a lot of light on how the movies were made. Surprisingly all the execs thought this would be a dismal failure. George Lucas was not the great director everyone thought he was while making the film.  He almost suffered a heart attack due to the pressue.<br /><br />I was surprised to discover that he tried to purchase the rights to Star Trek and Flash Gordon before going out on his own to write his own saga. I wonder what he would have done with Star Trek?!!<br /><br />It's amazing to know that Hollywood placed a fine on him for not having the credits roll until the end of the film.  No wonder he opened his own studio! Despite all his box office success he was still treated poorly by the people that helped him put up the capital for this film.
B00006AW2M|4.0|yeah this album is really good. i find it rediculous when opinionated beatles fans flame stones recordings. its like comparing apples to oranges... i happen to LOVE both bands for various reasons. <br /> <br />anyone who gives their satanic majesties request a serious listening will find that there are all sorts of \\"moments\\" in this album... where it comes together perfectly to form musical bliss. <br /> <br />in my own opinion, its not as good as anything from their 68-72ish stint. that doesnt mean its a bad album, just that its not insanely good... <br /> <br />if your a real stones fan, defenantly pick up this album. there are more than a handful of songs that will totally suprise you, in a good way.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Harry Potter number three is thought to be a little too dark by many.  I disagree this is a new era, kids don't play with barbies and hotwheeles as long as they us to.  This movie is something that will engage and entertain childeren as well as adults.  It's a great addition to any dvd library.  Is has the right amounts of suspense and drama to keep the most skeptic harry fan's entertained.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I was watching the new DVDs and I've finally had enough of Lucas's tinkering.  I enjoyed the special editions in the movie theater because I thought it was nice to see something different.  Now I realize I will have to live with them forever as being the Star Wars.  I will always be disctracted by the new scenes and the movies will never be the same.  Tinkering with something that was great does not make it better.  I'm sure you can find a list of differences if you want to look for what Lucas has changed.  It just does not make the movie better.
B00000JBFW|4.0|I love listening to this album, yet I find myself wishing the lyrics were written in a tongue I couldn't understand. In Deep Purple's past albums, there were some cool lyrics, and some terribly silly lyrics (Let's Go Space Truckin'!), but the words in songs like \\"Gypsy's Kiss\\" (Mind Body Heart and Soul/ We got Rock and Roll/ And there's nothing they can do\\") or \\"Knocking at Your Back Door\\" (Sweet Nancy was so fancy, to get into her pantry......)are hard on the ears! <br /> <br />No worry though, there are also some good lyrical moments, though no words as cool as \\"Highway Star\\" or \\"Smoke on the Water.\\"  <br /> <br />This was Deep Purple's first release in some time, and while their classic days were behind them, Ian Gillan's amazing vocals drive this album home. Gillan is mind-blowing on \\"Wasted Sunsets,\\" a song that would fall flat if any other classic rock vocalist attempted it! In fact, the best reason to buy Perfect Strangers is that of all Deep Purple albums, this release is the one that best showcases Ian Gillan's voice. The only other music that does full justice to Ian Gillan's talent is the original \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" where Gillan's Jesus is so great that it ruins the role for all who have attempted it since then!  <br /> <br />This is not to take anything away from the rest of the band, especially the great guitar work as only Ritchie Blackmore can do! The occasional bad lyrics aside, this album's appeal will catch you spinning the CD over and over. <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like a lot of people, this trilogy revisits my childhood. I didn't think I would get this excited about this trilogy, but I rank this release on a level of Lord of the Rings DVD's. Is there some eleven year old who sat in a multiplex and got as passionate over LOTR as I did in 1977? I hope so. I bought the bubble gum cards, models, Marvel comics, and action figures.  <br /> <br />The best digital remastering was Empire Strikes Back. I loved the movie when it came out, but even back then I thought the film quality could have been better. The sound quality is great and the documentary is required viewing for any SW fan. Carrrie Fischer talking about Jabba, the slavegirl outfit, and Lucas wanting her to lose ten pounds before the start of A New Hope is great.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am not a personal fan of Michael Moore , but I think 9/11 is a well done film even if it is off the mark in some areas. Some parts may be true and some parts may not be true, but it is a good documentary.  Remember no news story or documentary is perfect.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I grew up with Star Wars, in the theater sure, but the Star Wars I really watched again and again was on VHS - we've never been able to really see the movie, like it was in the theater.   <br /> <br />I just hope Lucas releases the original, un-enhaced format as well.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Best movie I have ever seen in my life PERIOD.  Thank you JESUS.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|When i was 13 i went to my grandparents to stay, As she collects movies and i had been a fan of the zombie genre since i was six i went through my grans books that catalogued all her films. I isolated all the zombie movies she owned and watched them over the course of 2 days. the ones i remembered (id already seen night, dawn and a few others) were the return series. One Two and Three are amazing. Two is well directed, slapstick but with very good make-up on the zombies which is a blessing (Non-Fulci) I'm going to buy it asap even though i have it on aged VHS. <br /> <br />All fans of zombies add me to messenger rottedzombieauthor@hotmail.com and if you want to read my story go here, [...] in the fiction section called \\"David's Story\\"
B000148KK2|5.0|I am new to Diana Krall, but what a discovery!  I have now heard some of her straight-ahead jazz work, which of course is brilliant. However, I can't for the life of me understand why some of her fans don't like this album.  Hey folks, people grow and change - that's life.  Her mother died, by all accounts they were very close, and that inspired a lot of the tone of this album.  The result is a lot of achingly beautiful songs - if \\"Departure Bay\\" does not give you chills, you are made of stone.  This is one of those rare musical works that just keeps getting better every time I hear it - we have a true genius here, and her collaboration with Elvis Costello just makes her even better.  Don't miss this one - who knows when you'll hear anything else like it. (Yes, there is a kinship with some of Joni Mitchell's best work - another towering Canadian genius - but it's wonderful that Diana had Joni to look to for inspiration.)
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore Hates America. This is evident in all of his movies and also proven when he goes oversees to make money by badmouthing us here at home. If you want to waste your money to see a film so horribly slanted in his own opinion, with quotes taken out of context...then by all means buy this collection. If you want to really find out what Michael Moore is up to...go to Moorelies.com...or read \\"Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man.\\" You can find the book here at Amazon.com and I promise it will be a better way to spend your hard earned money.
B00003CXCT|2.0|These \\"bonus\\" scenes and tinkering by george totally disrupt the flow of the movies.  I got more and more angry as I watched the movies culminating in the celebration scene at the end of Jedi.  In my opinion the changes ruin the movies. Thats all that needs to be said.
B000066744|5.0|It was about 12:30a, the house was quiet and I was cruising channels for Indies. Like the sun rising this movie crept up and delighted me. It is a story I wish I had told...it was just waiting to be let loose. I watched it with slack jaw disbelief at it's originality, depth and beauty...neither of which overshadowed the pure brilliance of this story. It is like a ghostly visitation..buy it, watch it late, with a favorite beverage, alone first, as you will want to remain speechless...1900 will come to visit everafter, he will remain your closest secret friend...you'll never look at a luxury ship the same!
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist is a masterpiece!  As a representative of the horror genre, it surpasses Rosemary's Baby and Psycho.  I particularly enjoyed the BBC documentary on the making of the film, which is featured on this 25th anniversary edition.  In addition, director William Friedkin offers an impassioned commentary, revealing the vision and spirit of a true artist. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on \\"The Version You've Never Seen.\\"  Friedkin almost sleepwalks through his commentary on the more recent DVD.  Obviously, Friedkin does not like the updated version, and neither do I.  The extra scenes fail to add anything substantial, instead giving an authentic work of seventies art an unwelcome patina of present-day slickness. <br /> <br />
B00005JM0B|1.0|But not a surprising one. I knew this movie would suck the moment I heard that James Cameron wasn't going to direct it, and that Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong weren't in the cast. It's no longer an intelligent tale about love, time travel, and the evils of technology and progress. Now it's a series of car chases, shoot outs, and explosions. Albeit the first two films also had a great deal of that, but it was still intertwined with romance, and emotion. I.E. The love affair between Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner, Sarah Conner's love for her son and undying determination to survive, and of course John Conner's growing affection for the Terminator. But I'm afraid that is severely lacking in this installment. They took a moving, epic story and turned it into \\"The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\\"     I love Arnold, and I voted for him too, but I'm afraid it was painfully obvious to me that this film was nothing more than a giant \\"Arnold For Governor\\" ad. He wanted to make a big exit from the film industry and into politics. What better way to do that than in this 172 million dollar mess? I'm afraid he failed miserably, though. Instead, he just looked old and tired in this portrayal of a washed-up character.     Nick Stahl plays John Conner in this flick, and I've never even heard of the basterd. All I know is that he has no business playing the role that was written for Edward Furlong. He is supposed to come off as a man who has spent his entire life in hiding, and on the run from the authorities, but how could anyone possibly believe that when he doesn't even LOOK like John Conner would look as an adult.     Kristana Loken does alright as the T-X, but they didn't give her anything interesting to say in the entire movie. Robert Patrick kicked ass as the T-1000, because he was naturally menacing, and had a lot of simple, but very snappy one-liners such as \\"Hey, that's a nice bike.\\" It was cool because you knew what was going to happen. With Loken, the cleverest line you hear her say is \\"I like your car.\\" Wow, momma! I'm so excited I'm hyper-ventilating. Let's face it, though, she had a nice body, so I guess that was enough.    I can't think of anything to say about Claire Danes, because to tell you the truth I can't even remember that much about her character. That's how much of an impact she had on me. Pretty sad, huh?     Normally you can count on Arnold to save a movie with his witticisms, but they are virtually non-existent in this film, and even the ones he does have are just lame. I.E. \\"Talk to the hand.\\" The end is the worst part (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE). The T-X comes crashing through the military compound on a motorcycle, and the Terminator is standing right in front of it, and you think he's going to say something really cool, but instead he just shouts, \\"YOU ARE TERMINATED.\\" Ooh, wow! That's some original writing, right there. Oscar winning material, indeed! (END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER)    As for the one star, I give it to Earl Boen who briefly reprises his role as Dr. Peter Silberman from the first two films. This was the funniest part of the movie, and almost made the hole rotten tomato worth watching.     Yep, this flick was just a string of one massive let-down after another. If you are like me, and you are obsessed with the virtually spotless sentiment, originality, and intelligence of the first two films, I'd advise you to skip this one. It will just ruin the whole fantasy for you.
0688078958|1.0|\\"The Mother Tongue\\" is entertaining, but--like so many other books about language for the lay reader--it is filled with utter nonsense. For instance, Bill Bryson tells us that Japanese \\"hiragana\\" is a syllabic alphabet written above the main text as a guide on how to pronounce the \\"kanji\\" (Chinese characters) which form the main body of written Japanese. In fact, hiragana is used in conjunction with kanji, and its primary use is to to show conjugations of verbs and adjectives, as well as other aspects of Japanese grammar. The function which Bryson attributes to hiragana is, in fact, called \\"furigana\\" in Japanese. (In his \\"Acknoweledgments\\" page, the author thanks a certain \\"Doctor\\" from Osaka for his input regarding Japanese. This all leads me to wonder whether this pesonage may have been a doctor of podiatry, or perhaps a dentist!) One more example of the fiction in this book is Bryson's statement that \\"Pennsylvania Dutch is a kind of institutionalized broken English.\\" He then goes on to quote some amusing examples of this \\"broken English.\\" Whoever supplied Bryson with these tidbits about Pennsylvania Dutch must have been pulling his leg, as this language is actually a dialect of German--something that I already knew when I was in high school. I could go on, but I think my point is taken. Bryson's fabrications and/or mistakes about other languages undermines this reviewer's confidence that the author knows what he's talking about when he treats English itself.
B000002MJC|5.0|Gee!!! I don't understand why a lot of DM fans hate this album so much. It's so damn beautiful. But then again, I really think a lot of so called DM fans just like DM because it's cool to like a cult band.<br /><br />SOFAD is Depeche Mode's darkest album as every person here stated before me, but it's also so full of brilliant ideas, and I loved the fact that they went way far from their hi-tech pop sound in Violator, to the rockiest side.<br /><br />Depeche Mode's trademarks are all over this CD, the lyrics, the strange flow of notes, the best ballad from Martin Gore (One Caress, that orchestra rocks!!!), and other things, only this time they decided to sound heavier. Flood did an impressive job on pulling this out. \\"Rush\\" is an excellent example of how good synths and drums can mix and produce an amazing feeling of power.<br /><br />This CD is Depeche sounding the way they should've sound at that time.
B00000K0DT|4.0|THE USUAL SUSPECTS is an unusual, well-crafted, if ultimately mystifying movie.  Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar for his supporting role as the narrative force behind the drama.  A plot as thick as New England molasses unfolds in flashbacks and present day, and with Spacey telling the story, what's truth and what is fiction?  There are some interesting twists throughout the movie, and of course, the final one is a doozie, although if you watch the film closely, you can see it coming.<br /><br />Along with Spacey, director Bryan Singer gets good performances from Pete Postelthwaite as a conniving attorney; Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro as members of the gang; and a good performance from Gabriel Byrne, the supposed mastermind of the gang.<br /><br />The identity of Kayser Solce is key to the film, and it's revelation forms the big surprise at the end.<br /><br />Well done, but not the classic others feel.
B00005R8FI|5.0|I was there at Aragon Ballroom in 1969... mostly heads... this was radical stuff with no percussion.  A lot of us were sceptical.  John Mayall and company blew the audience away!!  We wouldn't let them get off that stage!!  Jon Mark was spectacular.  Johnny Almond was superlative and John Mayall's creation was mind-blowing.<br /><br />The Laws Must Change was a new message to people who were deeply into the world of psychedelic drugs.  Every song said something special to us in a way that we had never really heard before.  This is one of my top 10 albums of all time.  I often listen to it today.  It never wears on you.  If you haven't heard this music... get a copy.  It is KILLER MUSIC from the most creative years in the history of music.
B00009W0WM|5.0|These special releases of classic films are fantastic DVD editions.  It's so nice to see these films in all their retouched glory - no more struggling through the grainy VHS transfers, no more distorted sound, etc.  The Casablanca DVD does not disappoint.  In addition to its fine physical reproduction, it is certainly one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br />The story (for the few that don't know) - Ilsa and Rick are lovers in Paris at the time of the Nazi Occupation.  They make plans to flee to Morocco, but Ilsa stands Rick up and he has to leave without her.  A year or two later, she finally makes it to Casablanca with a man in tow - her husband Victor, who happens to be an anti-Nazi Czech leader.  This sets up intrigue between the French resistance trying to get Victor away from the Nazis, the Nazis who are trying to imprison him, and the black marketeers who buy and sell exit visas.  Throw in the Rick-Ilsa-Victor love triangle, corrupt Vichy officials, and a healthy dose of humour, and you have a movie that stands the test of time and is more enjoyable each successive viewing. <br /> <br />The performances, story, etc. are fantastic.  If the special effects are laughable (and they are!), you don't even notice because you're drawn in and engaged in the story.  The ending is a masterful series of twists, but it never cheats and once you've seen it, it is extremely satisfying but not predictable. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, younger viewers are bound to think that the entire film is cliched (as I did, the first time I saw it).  It has been so often imitated that it's unlikely you'll see this before some imitation.  This is especially true of the dialogue - young viewers may even laugh at the cliched lines, not knowing that it was in Casablanca that they all originated: \\"the usual suspects,\\" \\"of all the gin joints...,\\" \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,\\" etc.  Repeated viewings and the most rudimentary knowledge of cimematic history dispells this problem because the film is so much richer than just its most memorable quotes. <br /> <br />This DVD edition has some nifty extras - about 3 hours of Lauren Bacall's reminiscences on hubby Bogart, interviews with film historians, archival footage, etc.  The two commentaries are interesting - one by film historian Rudy Behlmer and the other by critic Roger Ebert.  Ebert's commentary is probably more interesting in that he offers a number of personal opinions (for example, he observes that Henried and Bergman have no chemistry between them, and speculates that Claude Rains's character is meant to be homosexual).  They even found some cut scenes to include.  It's good value for the price, even if you only watch the extras once.

B00003CXCT|1.0|It's a real shame that George Lucas doesn't care enough about his fans to at least offer a release of the un-modified originals.  Part of the fun of those movies was that they DIDN'T look perfect and that they DIDN'T have a CGI Jabba the Hutt.  I can't believe some of the things I've heard that Lucas changed in these movies.  I understand that George Lucas has the right to do what he wants to his films as they are his creation.  But I also have the right to make sure that he never sees another cent of my money as long as he's being so selfish.  Anyway...I heard that some REALLY BAD people *wink* somewhere on the evil Internet made DVD's out of recordings from the laserdisc releases of the films.  I also heard from a \\"friend\\" that the quality is actually pretty good.<br /><br />One other funny thing I'd like to point out is that a lot of people's favorite Star Wars film seems to be The Empire Strikes Back.  Go to [...] and check who directed it.  It wasn't George Lucas.
B00005JNEI|5.0|it's about time someone had guts enough to stand up to the Right Wing/Christian Fundametalist/Middle East Hypocricy. In addition to this try watching a new film called JESUS AND HER GOSPEL OF YES!  This film will be showing in NY on Nov 12th at the Village East Cinemas 181 2nd Avenue New York, NY 10003 (212) 529-6998.   Tickets can be purchased on the NY INdependant Film Festival website at    [...]  Simply click on schedule for Nov 12th and then the title.  What is JESUS AND HER GOSPEL OF YES?  It is a highly surreal but positive messaged film retelling the life of Jesus (played by Cheryl Townsend who co directed) as a woman and leader of the Gospel of Yes. Her nemesis and leader of NO is the transvestite Charlton Heston aka Moses.  This film won BEST Experimental Film with the festival.  The film stars three regional avant garde poets.  The afore mentioned Cheryl Townsend as Jesus.  Michael Basinski (Professor of Avant Literature at Buffalo University) as God.  John M Bennett (Professor of avant lit at Ohio State) as the devil.  It also stars Franciscan Monk; Fr. Justin Belitz as the Elder.  Mike Hovancsek, the composer of the film wrote an apt promotional text:    \\"Jesus and Her Gospel of Yes\\" is one of the best naked acid trip Jesus films that you will ever see!  Wow, you are going to love this film.  It is sort of like if you used the set from H. R. Puff-n-stuff to tell Bible stories!  No, it is like if you took the original cast from that Batman television show from the '60s and had them act out the life of Jesus with a cross-dresser and a couple of lesbian strippers!  No, it is like watching that Davey and Goliath claymation series after consuming enough acid to kill a herd of elephants!  There are layers and layers of odd images washing over people who are doing nonsensical things with cheesy props while orators shout poetry over each other and strange music fades in and out!  It is two hours of the most chaotic, screwed up stuff you have ever seen.  The film is so bizarre and funny the people who made it are either going to win a bunch of awards or get arrested (probably both)!!!\\".    Among the colorful characters in the film are:  the Anti-Christ (George Dubya Bush), the Beast (Jerry Falwell),  the Pharisees (the Promise Keepers), the Confederate Flagged Face Mormons, The not So virgin Mary, the teenaged heroin addict; Judas, Honey Nut Cherry Roll: The Queen Goddess, and many more.  Yes, the film dispenses with Pre-Conceived notions of Christ and looks at the MESSAGE of the Christ of the Four Gospels.  The film was written, Produced, and directed by Alfred Eaker and is a Pink and Blue Films, LLC Production.  And, we may be biased but we believe our film is much truer to the message of Christ. Much truer than a certian multi millionaire's recent film depicting Jesus getting whacked for two hours.    IF PASSION SHOCKED YOU AND FARENHEIT OUTRAGED YOU, YOU AIN'T SEEN NUTHIN' YET!  TAKE THE YES CHALLENGE. CAN YOU MAKE IT TO THE END?  (FAINTING PROHIBITED IN MOST THEATRES!).  An Alfred Eaker Motion Picture.

6305127689|5.0|Favorite 1980's Summer movie! For the time period, there were some great aerial shots and action sequences, and an excellent music soundtrack. Cocky Tom Cruise and sexy Val Kilmer are in direct competition at the Top Gun facility, Miramar, San Diego, California. This training is for the top 1% of all naval aviators, the best of the best, who happen to get the fine ladies, in a lot of trouble and protect the country all at the same time. Cool.  <br />The behind the scenes commentary by the cast on the NEW DVD is enlightening- a fan of the film will really enjoy it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|10 years ago when Green Day got big with Dookie, everyone said they were a one hit wonder... How wrong they were.  Each album is unique and has songs catchier than anything else out there today.   <br />    American Idiot is the next step in Green Day's evolution into the best rock outfit today.  THey have kept everyone guessing haven't fallen into the stagnation that many bands in all genres tend to stumble into.  <br /> <br />    After hearing the Album I felt inspired, and motivated. Thats funny considering how sad some of the themes are, but that's what great music will do. Green Day offer a breath of fresh air in a world more and more fed up with the status quo. <br />
B0001L3LUE|2.0|Mr. McNamara, inarguably the worst secratary of defense in the history of the US, demonstrates perfectly that learning is not equal to wisdom. <br /> <br />His many disasters, miscalculations and blunders helped make the Vietnam conflict into the mess that people & historians recollect today.
B0000CFW87|1.0|These types of recordings seem to be aimed at an audience I cannot relate to.   <br /> <br />Mr. Grobin has a pleasant enough voice - think an Anglo version of Andrea Bocelli - but I cannot get past the music itself.  <br /> <br />Frequently - and incorrectly - he's called an opera singer, but I think it fairly obvious, unless he's hiding something, this is not a voice made for opera.  A certain type of musical theatre, or perhaps ballads of another era - or from an era yet to be, would be more suitable for this singer.  As it is the material is overproduced, souped up to levels of near maudlin intimacy - but lacking anything \\"genuine\\" or real.   <br /> <br />Amazingly, people are flocking to this stuff and praising it to the heights ... I don't get it.  And don't want to.  It smells a little bit like Charlotte Church to me. <br /> <br />
B00006LI4S|5.0|It's such a delight and a pleasure to see an artist of such undoubtable talent put on a show of such quality. David Gilmour is without doubt one of Britain's top three guitarists and although this DVD doesn't showcase some of his most outrageous electric guitar solos his acoustic work is second to none and leaves you with admiration for this age-stricken legend. <br /> <br />Without doubt the 1994 P.U.L.S.E live version of Comfortably Numb will never be matched by anyone, including Gilmour himself but the version of this DVD brought a tear to my eye as Gilmour uncontrollably grins with delight as he rips into the last solo of the song. <br /> <br />Whatever your view is of Gilmour as a Floydian, put it all aside and salute this great guitar general!
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's here at last, the original Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. As you all know George Lucas originally insisted that these films wouldn't see the light of day on DVD until after Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. But he found time, and I am pleased to say that they look better than ever!  <br /> <br />   The picture and sound quality on each of the films is nothing short of breathtaking! They genuinely do look like new films. I think that Episode 4: A New Hope has still faired better, though. Like that bit when Vader force chokes that man on the Death Star. The loud humming in the background whilst he is doing it nearly broke my speakers, and it is quite scary. I think that's the sound of his dark power.   <br /> <br />   Obviously, as I'm sure everyone knows, these are not the original editions, but the special editions with a few more fixes. And what is my personal opinion on that? THANK YOU, GEORGE!  <br /> <br />   I think a lot of people seem to be forgetting that these are not OUR films, but that they are GEORGE LUCAS' films. Yes, even the two that he didn't direct. They belong to him. He's an artist, and he is welcome to keep on making more fixes until he is happy with how they look.  <br /> <br />   It makes me sick when I see people who state that they love the original versions, and then they give these DVD's one star ratings. Why, may I ask? They are still the same films that you grew up with, it's just that visually speaking they are now ten times better.  <br /> <br />   Okay, I'll level with you. I wasn't even born when any of the originals came out in the cinema. But when I fell in love with them, which was in the early 90's, it was with the original editions. So the special editions in 1997 were the first time that I ever saw them on the big screen. And I remember thinking to myself, \\"Wow, George hasn't only cleaned up the picture quality and the sound, but he's genuinely made them much better films, even though they were flawless to begin with.\\" <br /><br />   Oh, and just for the record, the change at the end of Episode 6: Return of the Jedi makes a whole lot of sense. You can really see what George is trying to say about the Anakin/Vader storyline. And also, this change fits in very nicely with the new Emperor dialog in Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back.  <br /> <br />   So all in all, these DVD's are great! I am so pleased that the HOLY TRILOGY is finally on DVD. In my opinion, these are the definitive versions of the original trilogy. At least for the moment, anyway. Does 2007 ring a bell with anyone? It's the thirtieth anniversary. That's all I'll say on that matter.  <br /> <br />Enjoy.      <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was a little dissapointed with \\"Shenanigans,\\" their last full length cd.  \\"American Idiot,\\" however, makes up for it entirely.  It sounds a little like \\"Waiting\\" mixed with \\"Nimrod.\\"  There is not one bad song on this albumn.  These CD also has the best lyrics by far out of all of their albumns. <br /> <br />American Idiot - 8.5/10...a little old already but still a great punk rock song. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia - 10/10...perfect example of the rock-opera deal going on with this CD...great song too. <br /> <br />Holiday - 10/10...Yet another great song, easily will be their next single. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 10/10...really slows things down, great song with awesome lyrics. <br /> <br />Are we the Waiting - 8/10...Can you say Queen??? <br /> <br />St. Jimmy - 9.5/10...easily the most punk song on this cd. <br /> <br />Give me Novacaine - 8/10...very good song, missing something i cant put a finger on though. <br /> <br />She's a Rebel - 10/10...a little poppy but still good GD, one of the faster songs on this Cd. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl - 7/10...not a big fan of the Egyptian drums and a very experimental song...but hey when your Green Day, you can do whatever you want! <br /> <br />Letterbomb - 9/10...another song with powerful lyrics. <br /> <br />Home Coming - 8.5/10..pretty good...doenst flow as well as Jesus of Suburbia does however. <br /> <br />Whatsername - 9/10...amazing song  this should have the same impact as Good Riddance did.  Good beat with possibly the saddest yet strongest lyrics on the CD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Since I bought this on the 21st i havent listened to another CD.  So go out and buy this CD as soon as you can.  and make sure to see them on tour this fall/winter!!!
B0000039QA|5.0|IGht Biggy is levels above any rapper there is or ever will be so any biggy cd gets 5 stars. I was just mad though, when listening to these songs, when Pdiddy comes out of no where and tries rapping but just ruins the song. Heres a little advice for you Diddy...do your producing thing, clothing thing watever, just don't rap its AWFUL.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Finally the \\"original\\" trilogy of Star Wars have been release on DVD. I have to say that I have waited a long time for this and unfortunately I also have to say that I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br />I realised that the versions released would be the Special Edition from -97 witch includes CGI scenery that already looks outdated by now. Unlike many of the classic effects... <br /> <br />But what bothers me most is that Lucas have messed about with the films even more and at such scenery's that it makes me very disappointed. For example: the classic moment from ROTJ were Luke takes of Dart Vader's helmet. I think everyone remembered how exiting it was to finally get so see how Dart Vader looked under the helmet. It was a classic moment that everyone remembers! <br /> <br />In the DVD-version Sebastian Shaw's head is replaced by Hayden Christensen's from Episode III. My first question is why this would be necessary? Didn't he think a younger audience would understand Return Of The Jedi after they have watched Episode III? If thats the case I have to say: Lucas, you underestimate the knowledge of you fans! As Sebastian Shaw has past away I also think it was a bit insensitive to replace him. There are also other scenes that have been changed more or less.  <br /> <br />The documentary is simply great and very interesting but if you looking for the movies I cant recommend this box. I'm happy I bought a deluxe set of the original widescreen VHS-movies back in -93. Not the same picture or audio quality, but they are the originals to me. <br /> <br />If it isn't broke, why fix it...
B0002JJBZE|2.0|i was excited to get my star trek original series season one . until i opened it and saw what a lousy and cheaply constructed collectors case. the dvds are stacked on top of each other in separate disc holders . which i almost broke one dvd trying to remove one from the holder which is  hard to remove . i expected at least separate casing for better storage of my dvds. like the honeymooners individual casing for each dvd disc which is perfect. hey mr case inventor next put the dvds in a paper bag .cause it's not much different from the crap star trek casing u came up with.  yours truly very dissapointed
B00006F7S4|5.0|I remember it like it was yesterday.  I Was beat down, torn apart, and alone after a 3 year relationship ended.  It was October of 2002.  It was an unusually cold October day in Southern California; as I was searching around the internet aimlessly, I came across an article by Beck.  He spoke of how this album came from heartbreak and everysong was written in a complete and utter painful state. <br /> <br />I knew it had to be mine. <br /> <br />From the very start of Golden Age, I got it.  I understood exactly what was going on in his head.  From that point on, it was almost as if Beck and I both got through those 3 weeks.  This album did not leave my side.  Everyday was like a rainy day.  I would wake up, put some coffee on, and put in this CD.  Everyday was rainy, cold and lonely.   <br /> <br />Then, one day, the sun rose.
B00004VVNB|5.0|If you've only ever seen Logan's Run on TV, you simply *have* to get the DVD!  After seeing it countless times on TV, I was amazed at what all had been edited out from the full movie.  It all fits now SO much better, the robot in the freezing chamber, and several other bits that I'll not give away.  :-)  Great older sci-fi classic to be sure! <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|With the rampant popularity of revitalized 80s rock, The Killers fit right in with the retro/pop commercial wave that has been spawning off bands like Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes, Hot Hot Heat, and The Von Bondies for years.<br /><br />Though they give off a distinctive British pop rock sound --it's a strong effort by this Las Vegas band who combines a steady dance beat, massive synthesizer action and enough decent guitar licks to make it an actually enjoyable album as opposed to amateur demos.<br /><br />The album kicks off in a good stetch with the radio-friendly \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" -- nothing too lyrically profound but enough to have you singing the words by the second or third listen.  The first single and fourth track--\\"Somebody Told Me\\" is a good representation of the album, very jumpy and repetitive. What's a pop record without repetition?<br /><br />It's really pick and choose after the first five tracks however--\\"Andy You're a Star\\" has awesome music but the lyrics leave you wondering what in the world you're singing and by the time \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" comes on, you really just can't take anymore of the same verse.  That said, \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and the album closer \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" wrap up what really isn't that bad of an album.<br /><br />I bought it on a whim and haven't been disappointed.  You'll replay this several hundred times and be able to say you knew them before they really exploded.  Hopefully, they're not a one-hit wonder.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Fantastic acting, scenery and props, this is just wonderful comedy. We watch it over and over. I've always loved the Wodehouse books, and this lives up to them magnificently, with some added songs from Bertie. Talent plus.<br /><br />The only drawback I can find is that the minor characters have different actors playing them from series to series. You just get used to one Aunt Dahlia or Madeline Bassett when another one with a different face and voice crops up next series. A shame, but it still doesn't spoil a 10 star series.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This version of the Star Wars Trilogy is simply the best these films have ever looked. The colors are brighter and the detail is sharper than any other version. Some fans my balk at the changes to the films, they are minor and are mostly to make all of the films fit together as a unified saga. <br /> <br />The bonus features on the fourth disc are also top notch. Empire of Dreams is a fascinating look at the making of this series and reveals stuff that even this hardcore fan has never, ever seen before. <br /> <br />If you are a Star Wars fan, then buying this set is a no brainer. If you simply love good films then you will want to have the authoritative collection of these films on DVD to admire for years to come.
068987474X|5.0|This book is simple, fun and a quick read,  (No dumb advice about using \\"I\\" instead of \\"You\\" sentences, no self-righteous quotes from guys about what turned them off in women, no playacting advised or required to trick a guy into loving you, etc.), but it might be the best, most refreshing relationship book ever written. <br />Basically, it says that if a guy seems reluctant to call, date, etc, or is married, is \\"afraid\\" to commit, makes you feel stupid or fat, it's not your fault!  There is nothing you have to change to \\"attract\\" him - it just means he's \\"not that into you,\\" not right for you, and you should stop wasting time trying to twist the relationship into working and move on to find someone who is right. <br />Simple advice, right?  But in the hodge podge of relationship advice and changing sex roles, common sense and self-respect have gotten lost, and this book brings it back. <br />Men are not frail, shy, helpless, confused creatures - if a man wants something, he'll go for it - and if he's not going for it, he doesn't want it. <br />Every lady in the dating world should read this - its a long-needed shot in the arm of a healthy dose of self-respect - the best medicine.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I can't believe he did it! He RUINED the original series! Hayden Christiensen's head on Sebastian Shaw's body? It was AWFUL! If the actor was still alive he should sue George Lucas. Naboo has now been added to the closing scenes of Jedi?! Perhaps Lucas would now like to \\"re-do\\" Breakfast at Tiffany's, but put Pacino's head on Peck's body? Save your money and buy a used and very old copy of the originals. Someday perhaps I will be able to buy the original films... unscarred.
B000063DIH|2.0|This IS Iron Maiden's second lowest point (with Bruce.) After feeling they had gotten too far away from what Iron Maiden really \\"was\\" after Seventh Son, they decided to go back to their roots and pump out a pure metal album. The result, No Prayer For The Dying. After that flat out disappointing album, Iron Maiden comes out with Fear of the Dark. Unlike NPFtD this album DOES have some stand out tracks. But, is it good? Not good at all...in the world of Iron Maiden anyway. For many other bands, this would be considered quite ok.     While Fear of the Dark has it's extremely low points, it also holds some very GOOD songs, and probably one of the most familiar to Maiden fans.    Fear of the Dark has three very good songs on it in my oppinion. The rest sink into mederocity or even, dare I say it, badness. What is it that this album is missing? In my oppinion it is all too much the same, and it lacks that emotionalism you get from any album before No Prayer For The Dying.    My personal favorites are:    Wasting Love: A lot of reviewers have given this song some bad reviews, but I think it is quite a good song. Quite soft and emotional, but since when is that a bad thing? I find Bruce's voice in this one simply AMAZING.    Judas Be My Guide: In my oppinion the second best song on the album. This sounds like something you would get from Iron Maiden's first album, Iron Maiden and Killers. It's short, it's hard, and it has a VERY catchy chorus.    Fear of the Dark: Wow...Iron Maiden's last GREAT song with Bruce(before Brave New World.) By FAR the best song on the album. But even on this album the song lacks that emotional feel. Bruce's voice seems so totally subdued and unmotivated. While this song is good on the album, it is much better on Rock in Rio. Iron Maiden regained that emotional feel and Bruce's voice literally soars.    To wrap it up...a disappointment. A step up from No Prayer For The Dying, but not too much. The band doesn't seem to \\"feel\\" the music like they did on their earlier albums. If they were to redo this album now (with their current line-up) this album would probably still only be given a 3 star review by me. The extra star because right now the music Iron Maiden is putting out is very good. They seem to have gotten that \\"feel\\" for the music back, especially vocally. Bruce Dickinson is like a fine wine...getting better with age =).
B00003CXCT|1.0|is george completely oblivious to the irony of how he has virtually become darth vader?  luke in A New Hope is obviously an extention of george at that time in history, young, fighing the \\"empire\\" of the movie industy, needing to prove himself.  but now, with all of this completely unnecessary tinkering , he is betraying his old self, the self that did the best he could at the time with the limitations that were on him, and is instilling this \\"more machine than man\\" mentallity that has taken him over.  he is completely blind and ignorant of the fun and innocence of his beautiful creations, all he can see are the \\"flaws\\" and is obsessed with digitally tinkering with them.  and the changes look bad and out of place.  they lack the warmth or, y'know i'm not even sure what it's lacking i just know that it is.  it doesn't fit.  it seems forced.  awkward.  a distraction to lovers of the movie for no real reason.  whatever intangibles the first movies had, whatever it was about them that unconciously spoke to us in such numbers, is obviously absent in the new george lucas.  he can't even relate to that stuff anymore.  his new movies are cold and lifeless and wooden.  more exercises in digital technology than storytelling.  and for that mentallity to bleed into the original PERFECT movies, is, um, ironic to say the least.  kinda fascinating actually.
B0000931QA|5.0|...but not the easiest to get into. This was my first introduction to Queensryche, and to say the least I was disappointed...at first. I thought the other reviewers had gone mad comparing this band to Pink Floyd meet Iron Maiden (both bands I love). Around the third time I listened to the album, I started to like it more and more, I just couldn't get enough of it.I prolly listened to it everyday for about a week. I heard new things every listen. Now today, this album is DEFINANTLY in my top 10 list, probably my top 5.    I don't think you can really judge this album track by track, as they all flow seemlessly from one to another. It is like one BIG song divided into a lot of smaller ones. But I will do it anyway, the best songs on this album, in my oppinion, are:     \\"The Mission\\" - Stunning, starts off so super slow and super emotional. It builds up until bursting into a very heavy, song. The chorus is so SUPER addicting as well, and sounds like it could have come straight from a James Bond like movie. Probably my favorite on the album.    \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" - The longest track on this album clocking in at 10:39. This song is an emotional rollercoaster, with the soft and heavy moments alternating throughout the song. Other things this song has are, a female singer the voice of \\"Mary\\" and the use of a choir. The way the two charactors go at it is simply amazing.    \\"My Empty Room\\" The presence of Pink Floyd is written all over this song. Only being a minute and thirty-two seconds long you may wonder how can it possibly be too great? But the emotional-ness of this song is at it's PEAK. It literally sends chills down my back just listening to it.    The vocals do take a bit of getting use to, especially if you start with this album, which I don't reccomend you do. At first I thought this guy couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, but I think now he has a voice that rivals that of some of the best metal singers out there. I have always been a fan of CRYSTAL clear lyrics,and this album has some pretty hard to understand moments in it. Heck, some parts I still couldn't understand if I hadn't read the lyrics. But those moments are always the most emotional, the most tramatic, the most thrilling part of the album.    As you can tell by most other albums this is a concept album. The story goes into such GREAT depth and leaves you wanting more all the time, unfortunantly even after the cd is over. You think \\"Well, what happens next?\\" I guess we will know soon, as Queensryche is going to release a new album entitled Operation: Mindcrime 2. To say the least, I'm certainly not expecting much(aka another Operation: Mindcrime), after the not-so-good albums Tribe, and Q2K, but I will of course give it a chance.    Ok, so I said this album probably wasn't the best one to start out with and you are probably thinking \\"Well what is then?\\" In my oppinion the easiest album to get into is Empire. While parts of it get a little \\"wild\\" most of it is extremly good. Or, if you are more familiar with the metal bands of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and company, I would reccomend you start with their first album, Queensryche, or The Warning, the influence is QUITE obvious on those two. Starting with Mindcrime could possibly ruin the rest of Queensryche's albums for you, but it didn't for me.    To rap things up, this is THE landmark album of Queensryche, and one of the best prog-metal albums ever made. This is a MUST-HAVE for any prog-metal/metal fan out there. And, if at first you aren't impressed, listen AGAIN. Don't be like some people who only listen to an album once and make an inital judement of it. I hope this review helped you :).
B000002GB9|4.0|In 1977 Styx released what I would consider to be their finest album,The Grand Illusion. While I don't consider Styx one of the greatest bands of all time or anything,Styx was and still is a good band.The Grand Illusion is the album to back that up.The first half of the album is almost flawless,with such songs as The Grand Illusion,Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man),and Come Sail Away,all appearing on the first half of the album.Three big hits out of the 4 songs one that half,that's quit an accomplishment esspecially if you compare it to most albums released today.Side two contains Miss America,and Castle Walls as highlights,and while some of the songs sound dated by today's standards,remember The Grand Illusion came out in 1977.When compared to other albums of its time period,The Grand Illusion isn't really strange, and hasn't dated any worse.For the time it came out having three hit singles on the radio or charts was a big deal,it was the 80's before it was common for groups to have 4 or 5 top 40 singles from one album.Any The Grand Illusion is Styx at their best,the Grand Illusion remains a rock and roll classic.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I sense a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of fans cried out in agony at once as Lucas once again mutilated their favorite stories... <br />Have you seen the new DVD release of Star Wars yet? This one's a real travesty, folks. First off, it is NOT the \\"Classic\\" Star Wars Trilogy as it has been advertised, but it is the Special Edition in disguise, with all its painfully obvious added scenes, glaring oversights, blatent special effects showmanship over actual quality, and just plain poor blending. As if this weren't bad enough, Lucas has seen fit to further adulterate the work by fiddling some more! I've only taken a cursory glance so far, but Ian McDiarmid has been added in place of the hologram of the Emperor's head in Empire (but the credits still bill Clive Revill as the voice of the Emperor), and at the end of Jedi, Luke peers into the forest as three figures appear... first Ben, then Yoda, and finally- Hayden Christensen?!?!? AAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!! Oh, and as the final sequence shows worlds across the galaxy, Naboo has been added into the shot. Could the DVD release have been more of a commercial for Episode III? And that scene with Han and Greedo- He's fiddled with it again! And it's still not believable!! What Lucas seems to have failed to learn is that at some point, you have to walk away from a project because the more you try and add to it, the worse it gets! Maybe the Big Guy has finally realized that he has lost whatever writing/directing talent he had and needs something else to sell his next over-decorated, under-acted big screen disaster! Or, maybe he figured if he went back and made the first ones worse, the new ones would look better! Whatever, the motivation, we can be sure of one thing- George Lucas has completed is journey to the Dark Side... <br />The only reason at all for ranking this trilogy with 2 stars instead of none is for the sake of the original, plus the bonus disk is the only part of the set worth keeping. While it has some interesting behind the scenes featurettes and documentaries, I was getting angrier and angrier every time Lucas came into shot. That's when I knew it was a waste of my money and time.  <br />Save your money for the \\"Purist\\" edition of Star Wars. I have no doubt Lucas will, at some time, release it to make himself another boatload of money that should have, in fact, been spent only ONCE!!!
B00006690G|2.0|Eminem can be quite funny, and that's the only reason to listen to him. I don't really care about rap all that much; it never made much sense to me and I'm not sure it is even music to begin with. Perhaps I'm being ignorant, but the hip-hop stars of today sure don't give me any reason to believe otherwise. <br />  But coming back to this Eminem guy. He's worth a listen or two ,mainly because of his tounge-in-cheek humor and ability to rhyme, but he can be bone-jarringly annoying after the first twenty minutes or so. For starters, he's got this really whiny voice, and the only reason he's being allowed to use that voice is because he's a white rapper. He could never ever become a conventional singer, not unless he enrolled in voice-improvement classes for two years.  <br />  I don't use the phrase \\"bone jarringly\\" unless I think it is really appropriate, and in Eminem's case I believe it is. His voice affects me, if I listen to him long enough, the same way <br />metal does when its rubbed against metal. You know, that painful, schreeching sound that so gets on your nerves. That is exactly what a prolonged listening of any of Eminem's CDs sounds like, and by prolonged I mean anything more than fifteen minutes. <br />  So what is it about this guy, why is he so famous? I don't know. I wish I did though. Don't we all? Here's a guy who went from washing dishes to superstardom, although he still fantasises about screwing Britney. The only thing I can think of is,....man this guy got so lucky.
B000002MG1|3.0|I became enraptured with R.E.M. back when Chronic Town came out, and absolutely loved everything they put out. Each offering upped their status, and they not only expanded and evolved, but eventually became superstars through perserverance and the release of \\"Out of Time\\". \\"Automatic\\" was the follow-up to their multiplatinum breakthrough, and it stands out mostly as, first, being a safer, weaker version of the previous album - mostly rehashes of older ideas and mundane ballads like \\"Everybody Hurts\\", and, secondly, for being their first-ever release with nothing really at stake. The songs here sound pedestrian for the first time in REM's stellar career (maybe the public read that as \\"accessable\\"), and I personally much prefer \\"Monster\\" to this, REM's most boring release to date.
0767020308|3.0|The Gwyneth Paltrow version is defintely better -- hands down!!   <br /> <br />There were several aspects of this film that I disliked, but Mark Strong's portrayal of Mr. Knightley was the most devastating blow.  He always seemed angry and out of temper.  Jeremy Northam was the perfect Knightley.  He is handsome, witty, and gentlemanly, and I guess I can never watch another version without thinking of him as the ideal fit. <br /> <br />The movie is also very choppy.  The pace moved too rapidly. <br /> <br />Overall, I don't regret purchasing the movie, but it definitely won't usurp my Gwyneth Paltrow version.
B000002MU3|5.0|As I've written before, \\"Automatic For The People\\" was REM's safest and most boring album. Thank God for \\"Monster\\", which winningly brought back the unpredictable, exciting REM that had captured our hearts and imaginations since \\"Chronic Town\\".
0780622650|4.0|I saw this on cable and it was far better than I expected. the casting is very good and it's a lot of fun. I loved the show as a kid and enjoyed the movie now at 4O.
B00006JKON|5.0|Hurrah! At last, the family of songs known as \\"War Child\\" are finally united on this CD. To call this a reissue is a misnomer. This is the album first intended by the band, but could never be released because of \\"the restrictions of vinyl.\\" The first copy I bought of the original (vinyl) I got in a Becker's (convenience store) in Toronto for $3.99! I wore out the grooves on my green Chrysalis-labelled Tull classic.<br />If you like Tull at its most progressive and yet tightest performance level, this album delivers. Now, with the reunited songs and orchestral pieces put back together with the original album, War Child not only feels more complete, but more \\"realized.\\"<br />I read the one negative review here and can only say, there's a reason that the negative review is a minority regarding this album. I am not a \\"Tull-can-do-no-wrong\\" reviewer. For example, War Child shines as a strong effort and a polished piece of production compared to the dismal \\"Too Old to Rock'n'Roll\\". Lesser accolades can be given to \\"Stormwatch\\" for its lack of human warmth.<br />But with its humourous lyrics, its rich orchestrations and licks, \\"War Child\\" can cut the chill on any wintry night.<br />Special kudos should be given to Ian Anderson for his efforts in releasing this series of CD's for re-examination and re-interpretation by thinking fans. Ian's liner notes are revelatory and welcome.<br />Once again, chaps...For Queen and country: Hurrah!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|OK, people are angry about 'double-dipping' the 'milked' DVD market. There's nothing worse than if you buy a DVD, all of a sudden: WHAM! A better one comes along. I usually either just get the 1st 'edition' or if I know that there's gonna be a mega-set (Lord of the Rings, Kill Bill) I'll wait it out. There, that's my rant. Anyway, on to this. first of all, let me say that the only DVDs here that are already out is the Matrix Revisited and the Animatrix. Everything else is brand new. the films themselves haven't changed, just better transfers, etc. What you get in here is 10 DVDs that take you pretty much to the bottom of the rabbit hole. Bottom line: if you don't have these movies, or you do have them but want \\"THE ONE\\" and only set, go for this. It's a pretty good price considering what you get.
B0000931QA|5.0|yes sir this is a pivital album in the progressive scene queensryche is one of the best out there this albu is one that when i got it i listened to it over and over until i got it my favorite song is the needle lies this albu kicks if you are getting into the ryche get it and play it loud
B00005JNEI|5.0|IM BUYING IT!!! <br /> <br />The truth is finally out.... <br /> <br />
B000063DHK|5.0|i was given this album with the advice that any metal fan should own this album and i agree this album wa recorded on the powerslave tour and has all the calssics for the self titled killers number of the beast piece of mind and powerslave this is two discs of skull crushing metal so pick it up you wont be dissappointed
055357342X|2.0|I started out this series because I heard so much about it. That was it, I knew nothing of George R. R. Martin's writing style, and had never even read a single thing by him.<br /><br />Now I wish I had done my homework. I only read Fantasy, as pure as I can get it. Does any of this series hold a candle to any form of Fantasy that I enjoy? NO. No way, notta, nope, never.<br /><br />For me to list the con's of this I must be vague, on the slim chance you actually read the book. Here they are:<br /><br />*On the technical aspect, each chapter is a new person, usually only about 15 to 25 pages long, a small glimpse into their world in a very formulaic way. There are more chapters about the bad guys than the good, and even the ones who take up entire novels eventually meet the axe one way or another. If you like wasting uncountable hours reading from multiple people's points of view, trying to keep the hundreds of names clear in every chapter as well as heraldry and history, please, plunge right in.<br /><br />*If you enjoy reading about animals in a mans world, don't read this book. All animals exist in this world for food, or as a penalty. This includes the Direwolves.<br /><br />*Don't get attached to any of the good guys, even the ones you dearly love meet the axe, as well as the ones you merely like.<br /><br />*Bite your tongue over the excessive amount of incest, as well as rape (no, the rape does not occur in an incestual way, all those involved in incest are happy with the arrangement) and you may well have no tongue left at all.<br /><br />*No true heroics, all good deeds are punished by betrayal and then ignored. Those who do seemingly heroic deeds do it for coin, or the love of slaughter.<br /><br />*Nearly all of the females in the book are empty headed women who desperately try to wield power, and of course, succumb to the power of men, and ultimately fail. Bringing the truth that all women are weak, and unfit for any type of action that does not include bedding.<br /><br />*Don't fill your head with \\"what if's,\\" because it won't work out, ever, for the better.<br /><br />*And, oh yes, count yourself lucky if you payed less than $8. dollars for a book, didn't spend uncountable hours praying that the next chapter might bring better fortune for poor lost children, and didn't feel the absolute need to come on here and write a scathing review.<br /><br />All in all, please, please, do not buy or read this book, or any of the others in this series. It starts out nice, I 'll grant you that, but it turns mean and nasty before long. Books like this put the tarnish on true Fantasy novels, is there anything sadder than a Fantasy novel that revels in abuse and cruelty with no heroes to lighten the day and give hope???
B000002JKA|5.0|to anyone who is thinking about getting this album get it its a little heavy for dt but i have all their albus and tis is definatley one of my faves along with metroplis 2 and six degress and images and words this one has some of teh best songs 6 00 voices and so many other greats tunes get it and play it loud
0671027573|5.0|I loved this book! The verbal sparring between the characters had me laughing out loud. And, the sex scenes weren't too shabby either. :)~  <br /> <br />The only thing I was disappointed about was that I knew who the murderer was even before they murdered anyone. This might not be the case with everyone but I just figured it was too obvious not to be the killer and I was right. Of course, I didn't know all the twists and turns that would take place but...  <br /> <br />I also thought the descriptions of the murder scenes were a little too graphic for this genre. I understand the necessity of making the reader understand how evil this person is but did the author really have to go into that much detail? It was kind of sickening because it was so descriptive that I got a mental image in my head that I couldn't shake. I suggest skimming the paragraphs where they describe the crime scene if you have a hard time with brutal violence against women. <br /> <br />The verbal interaction between the characters and the story line were excellent besides the above two things. The verbal interaction and the hot, but not vulgar, sex scenes (even the kissing was making me sigh...) were the reason I gave this book 5 stars. I loved the characters, too. They reminded me a lot of my friends and family. :) <br /> <br />I hope you get a chance to read this and enjoy it as much as I did!
B000002WCJ|5.0|this album is some of the best metal i have ever heard if you like it feast youll love this album fave songs eagle fly free dr stein and keep of the seven keys could have been a lil faster but it is still a great song  defininately buy thins one and play it loud
B00003CXCT|2.0|George Lucas screws up, again.  But it's not all bad. <br /> <br />I don't remember the original trilogy being so full of color.  In that respect, the DVD's look a lot better, but George's decisions to add and alter are disappointing. <br />It's as if nobody working for him or with him will dare question his decisions.   <br /> <br />ESB was my favorite of the original three.  The DVD version has only a few improvements, and quite a few bad decisions.  I can understand the desire to re-shoot the Emperor/Vader exchange, but why re-write the dialogue?  George thought it would be a good idea to have Jango Fett's voice for Boba Fett (being clones and all), but he didn't think to ask James Earl Jones to do the voice-over for the 3 seconds of footage added to the Special Edition as Vader leaves Bespin.  If James was asking for too much $$$, George could have omitted the stand-in Vader dialogue in that scene, altogether. <br /> <br />Putting Hayden's Anakin likeness at the end of ROTJ was a great idea, but how about making him look a little older, and a little more like the guy that \\"looked on Luke with his own eyes?\\"  While we're at it, why not edit out Alec Guiness, and put in Ewen's Obi Wan likeness?  Didn't anyone at Skywalker Ranch have the intestinal fortitude to say, \\"George, I think that scene is great as it is\\" and \\"we don't need to add another song to Jabba's Palace scene.\\"  Morons. <br /> <br />For the new fans of the story, they're going to be cheated.  George has proven he's a lousy director and doesn't know when to leave well-enough alone.  It's a shame that with such a monumental release, he didn't include the original, not-so-special editions.  They were truly classics. <br /> <br />Revenge of the Sith as directed by George Lucas?  I wonder if it'll be any better than the last two. <br /> <br />If George wants to fix all the \\"loose ends\\" in his movies, he should have started with \\"Howard the Duck\\" and \\"Willow.\\" <br /> <br />The \\"final\\" product on these DVD's are a classic example of abject stupidity.  The flow is disrupted, your intelligence is insulted, and the uniqueness is gone. <br />I bought them for my kids, hoping for the best.  I guess I'll look for the true originals on DVD on ebay.
B00007KWHP|5.0|this is some of the finest of the yes albums and in  seeing the recently in concert they still have it this album is a classic and everyone who istens to music should own it one of my favorite parts of yes is you can put the albu on and just let it play without haveing to skip around so definatly get this i had it on tape and the tape doesnt play any more so get it and play it
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I will not compare this to Gone with the wind, as that would be unfair. I think the story was predictable in places, but some of the supporting cast was superb. Nicole Kidman did a good job, and Jude Law LOOKED GREAT!  :) <br /> <br />Anyway, the movie was entertaining and I enjoyed it. The movie sountrack is really good. If you like bluegrass music, you should definitely purchase the soundtrack.
B000001ESF|5.0|if i was stranded on a desert island this is one of the albums i would want with me i have been listening to rush for a long time and i have this albu on tape and i dont even think it plays anymore this band has been around for 30 years and can still play the 2112 piece perfectly i strongly reccomend this one to any rock fan
B0002O7XVI|5.0|I think it is sweet that Polanski wanted to make this film for his late wife.  The film is dedicated to her and Tess was the book found next to Sharon's bed with a note inscribed by her stating \\"this would make a wonderful movie\\".  And it was.  Beautiful, powerful and a visual knockout.  And, if I recall correctly, it might have been a Best Picture nominee?
B000021XS0|5.0|i saw this album live before i baught it and it blew me away this album hits all levels metal and ballad if you are thinking about getting into dt buy this album it is a great starting point fir anyone and if you dont have this album get it
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day, the masters of punk, have perhaps made their masterpiece w/ American Idiot.  No, it isn't filled with just fast punk tunes like Dookie, Insomniac, or Nimrod, and it isn't the mid-tempo rock of Warning.  Instead, its a beautiful combination into a punk opera.  This CD should be appriciated by all.  I've heard comparissons between this album and some of the most famous concept albums of all time- The Beatles' Sergent Peppers, The Who's Pinball Wizard, and Pink Floyd's The Wall- and believe me, it deseves all the praise.  Now, the never satisfied so-called \\"hard core punk\\" community won't be satisfied by this CD for sure, as they're still waiting for something that'll never happen again- an album like Dookie or like Smash by the Offspring or 1 of the Propogahndi CDs.  Those people, however, don't understand want punk is.  They don't understand that even punk had to grow and change- bands can't write the sames songs over and over again.  Anyway, here's my song by song review of this great CD. <br /> <br />1)American Idiot- the long released 1st single; the most blunt of several political songs on the album; has that great old Dookie-like punk sound w/ beautiful bass work, but a little over played; 9/10 <br /> <br />2)Jesus Of Suburbia- one of the 2 nine minute opera songs on the CD; the transitions between the 5 parts of it are just done beautifully; part 1 (self titled) is a nice mid tempo guitar rock piece; then it had a nice bridge, right into a piano/guitar rock sound of part 2 (city of the damned) which sounds ben folds-like; there is a quick transition into part 3 (i don't care), which has a punkish sound; this leads into part 4 (dearly beloved), which has slower sounds and a dramatic tone of voice from billie- it's what you would define as \\"rock opera\\"; part 5 (tales from another broken home) is an emotional sounding rock song that starts off loud, then gets a lot softer; 10/10 <br /> <br />3)Holiday- this will hopefully be single off the album; greatmid tempo rock sound with good guitar sound and meaningful lyrics; my favorite song on the album; 10/10 <br /> <br />4)Boulevard Of Broken Dreams- song that will deffinatly be a single; has a depressing sound and lyrics that just give you the feel of exactly what billie is saying; 10/10 <br /> <br />5)Are We The Wating?- the intro has a pouding '80s-style drum beat; it then goes on to have an amplified arena rock sound; the lyrics aren't perfect, but get the point across; 8/10 <br /> <br />6)St. Jimmy- another song that'll probably be a single; back to the old 3 cord punk rock here!; a nice gruff tone to billie's voice on the chorus too; sounds similar to the type of punk sung by The Living End; 9/10 <br /> <br />7)Give Me Novacaine- starts out slow w/ dramatic vocals, and then the punkish bass comes in during the chorus; deffinatly a great rocking bridge; kind of ends w/ a '50s style beat; 10/10 <br /> <br />8)She's A Rebel- a classic 2 min punk song!; a great song to rock out to; the song that inspired the hand grenade-heart logo (And she's holding on my, Heart like a hand grenade), 9/10 <br /> <br />9)Extraordinary Girl- the only song on the CD that isn't that good; it kind of his a bad version of the Egyptian beat from The Offspring's Come Out And Play at the intro and bridge; however the great songwriting by Billie saves it somewhat; 7/10 <br /> <br />10)Letterbomb- the only thing bad about this song is the retarded intro which gives a bad image to a good song; deffinatly had a great, somewhat harder edged guitar beat especially in the intro and outro; all around a good song; 9/10 <br /> <br />11)Wake Me Up When September Ends- a song that is going to be a single that'll be gobbled up by radio stations; it's american idiot's version of the acoustic stuff from good riddance or macy's day parade; until some bass and loud drums come in midway through, the song consists of a guitar, keyboard, and a triangle; 8/10 <br /> <br />12)Homecoming- the other 9 min 5 part rock opera song on the album; part 1 (death of st. jimmy) starts off slow and twangy before growing louder; it's followed by an almost direct transition into part 2 (east 12th street)which is a mid tempo rock song with a lot of drum; there's then a dramatic slowdown to part 3 (nobody likes you) which is really dramatic and sounds very operetic; the drums then quickly come in, into part 4 (rock'n'roll girlfriend) which is sung by tre and has a sax and a george throrogood-like feel; part 5 (we're coming home again) then starts quickly; it has the feel of an old Queen song; 9/10 <br /> <br />13)Whatsername- it's a little out of place as a closer, but still a good song; it had the same kind of guitar beat as in Redundant on Nimrod; the song has a great bridge, with a fluxuating sound and loun bass; 9/10 <br /> <br />As you can see, this as an absolutly incredible CD, with a wide range of sound. There's something to keep every1 hooked!  So go out and buy American Idiot. It's worth your money to hear Billie Joe at this finest!
B000001DQI|5.0|For me, the music of Elton John borders on guilty pleasure. I've never thought of him as a truly great ARTIST, but he sure can create some great, memorable pop songs. He is a great musical entertainer if nothing else. He is also not afraid to work in different styles, and GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is perhaps the most concrete example of his penchant for experimentation, spanning 17 tracks and over 76 minutes of music that spans many different genres. There's hard rock (\\"Saturday night's alright for fighting\\"), R&B (\\"Bennie and the Jets\\"), sentimental ballads (\\"Candle in the wind\\"), a '50s-style dance throwback (\\"Your sister can't twist (but she can rock 'n roll)\\"), and even a faux-Jamaican dance number (\\"Jamaican Jerk-off\\")---John seems to have thrown everything into this album but the kitchen sink. I'm hardly complaining, though, as the results are thoroughly entertaining and often successful.    There are really too many highlights to recount in detail here, so I'll just mention a select few from the album. It opens with an ambitious eleven-minute cut, \\"Funeral for a friend (Love lies bleeding)\\", that begins with a tremendously imposing minor-key instrumental and then gives way to a subtly bitter song about a love affair that has ended badly. The hit singles---\\"Candle in the wind\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\", \\"Goodbye yellow brick road\\", and the rollicking \\"Saturday Night's alright for fighting\\"---are fun to listen to, but the rest surely does not lack fine music. \\"I've seen that movie too\\" is a personal favorite: a lyrically regretful (and perhaps slyly satirical) song about someone who seems to see love in terms of a romantic movie. \\"Sweet painted lady\\" and \\"The ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)\\" are also notable, as is the beautiful final song, \\"Harmony\\".     And that is just the tip of the iceberg of all the varied riches to be found on GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, an album that shows premier pop songwriter Elton John (along with his lyricist Bernie Taupin) at the topof his form. Even if you are not necessarily a big fan of his music, you will certainly not be bored with this album, so diverse are its songs, and so irresistible. It may not have an overall great deep meaning, but it is very entertaining to listen to. Recommended.
B00005JNEI|5.0|There are many memorable images in Farenheit 9/11, Bush reading \\"my pet goat\\" after the second plane hit, the wailing Iraqi mother who lost her family, Gore and Deniro partying after the Democrats short lived win - but the one that really sticks in my mind and manages to sums it all up succinctly is the elderly woman at the bingo hall who saw through the tainted slant of the media and the ever shifting reasons for invading Iraq and exclaims with toal contempt \\"we were duped\\"! Its an epiphany many of us are waking up to now, thanks to a fat white guy who currently happens to be more dispised by the religious right then Marylyn Manson or Anton Levay. <br /> <br />To hear it from the naysayers, Michael Moore stands in front of a camera for 2 hours launching vicious slander against righteous George. The truth of the matter is we almost never see Moore, Bush himself is the \\"star\\" of Fanrenheit 9/11 and whatever opinion the audience ends up drawing, it is based on Bush's own words and actions. The religious right has us so transfixed we find ourselves saying things like \\"even if the movie is only 90% true...\\" Well i went through the exhaustive reference material available on [...] and every assertion, every statement has been published somewhere before in the mainstream media based on traceable data. Unfortunately with just 5 guys controlling this information an article about the White house flying the Bin Laden family back to Saudi Arabia where 15 of the hijackers originated came from quickly dissapears from print and funnily enough is NOT the lead story on FOX news, I wonder why. <br /> <br />Moore plays his cards just right, I have watched this film with several groups of republican voters and fundamentalist Christians who would typically vote for George the anti-choice pro descrimination conservative. When Lila Liscombe reads the final letter from her son before he died serving in Iraq she breaks down in the point of his letter \\"Thank you for the Bible\\". It suddenly begins to dawn on these conservatives that Bush and his republican cohorts have behaved in a decidedly Un-Christian way in sending thousands of innocent men and women to unnecessary deaths, while Osama Bin Forgotton. I have watched every single Christian conservative melt like an ice cube thorugh this section of the film, indeed anyone without a heart of stone could not help but be touched by the Liscombe family. My female friends weep and the men sit in stunned silence \\"Im flaberghasted\\" is all one could manage at the conclusion. <br /> <br />This is as heavy handed as the film will get, the documentary itself is incredible not just from the content but in that we almost have a new doco genre here \\"tragi-comedy\\". What we witness in Farenheit 9/11 makes you angry enough to jump out of your seat and enrole to vote (even when you live on the other side of the world like me), it makes you want to weep at the injustice, all while you cannot help but laugh a hysterical laugh at the complete absurdity and stupidity we ourselves remain responsible for. I can not imagine a more important film being released this decade. <br /> <br />Ps If you think Michael is in it for the money he is losing millions in DVD sales to rush the release and attempt to have the film shown free on TV. He withdrew his nomination for best documentary Oscar on the chance a network will screen the film before the Election. I have a new American hero <br /> <br />
B0000524CY|5.0|For some reason every time I buy a copy of this movie for my DVD collection and bring it home strange things have happened and at first I thought it was coincidence but after going through four copies, and moving 3 times I've realized this movie comes with a price of peace. Although this film starts off like a drama, at one point it takes a drastic turn. It draws you into the life of this family and the story of this young  girl, who gets posessed by a demon who claims to be the devil himself. The great thing about the Exorcist is that it was made way before it's time....so it isn't taken very seriously as a horror film but think about it this movie lead the way for classics like Night of the Demons and many others. Indeed an innocent young girl posessed is a scary thought, but the make up used throughout each of Blair's transformations from cute girl to hideous demon were remarkably realistic, not to mention the voice(s) that came out of her. This is an absolute classic one to watch at least 3 times a year. I don't recommend it for children but hey I was like 10 years old when I saw it and it didn't bother me!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie.  The story-lines are fun and romantic and the characters are funny and poignant.  I especially love the character of Sam, the young boy in the film whose acting ability was astounding and his character was adorable and heartwarming.  This is a great rainy/snowy day movie to watch with your significant other (my husband won't admit that he liked the movie) or to watch with the girls.  It is a truly funny and romantic movie that left me with an all around good feeling.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like Joss Whedon's other projects, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Firefly relies on FANTASTIC characterization to make the show.  There are no cliches here.  No cardboard characters or boring dialog.  Joss Whedon is a genius when it comes to dialog and characterization, and Firefly is no exception.<br /><br />My only complaint about the show is that it was cancelled--quite undeservedly.<br /><br />And my only complaint about the DVD set is that in a couple of places the dialog doesn't match the characters' mouth movements when the sound track is off, but really, that's pretty minor.  I'm still giving it a solid 5 stars.
B000001ES4|5.0|Secret Garden's \\"Whitestones\\", is an amazing CD.  The talent of Rolf Lovland and Fionnula Sherry is unprecedented...their styles compliment each other perfectly.  \\"Whitestones\\" is a beautiful compilation of instrumentals, highlighting Rolf's songwriting and piano ability as well as Fionnula's amazing and haunting violin melodies. The songs on \\"Whitestones\\" are perfect to listen to after a long and stressful day, in the bath, and they are perfect to listen to while falling asleep as the songs are very ethereal and dreamlike. I have been listening to this disc for about six years and it is still in my main CD rotation, in fact I used the song \\"Hymn\\" at my wedding as I walked down the isle. This CD is a must to own for those who appreciate New Age and Celtic music.  Their other albums are also amazing, and I am proud to say that I own every one of their releases and I am looking forward to their next release which will be out soon!
B0002OERI0|2.0|Not a bad album unless you were expecting a punk band.  Lets hope that Mike Ness and the boys do better next week.
B00018D44U|4.0|This CD reminds me of sitting on the front porch of a home \\"down south\\", sipping ice cold lemonade and just \\"being home\\".  I love the music she wrote, and there is one song she sings by Tom Waits that really makes my heart ache down deep. <br /> <br />Highly recommend.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites - I keep it on repeat.  Peter's singing is so soothing and grows on you the more you listen.  His original songs are exquisite, especially Up On the Roof and I'd Rather Be With You.  His personality totally comes through.  His arrangement for You Don't Know Me is also incredible.  Basically, I love the whole thing...especially the sultry sax.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone and everyone whether or not they like jazz.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Just finished watching the new DVD of \\"Star Wars IV - A New Hope\\" using a DLP projector on a 7 foot screen with 6.1 Dolby Digital EX surround sound.  It is everything I had hoped it would be.  I was especially struck with the digitally remastered picture and sound.  The colors were saturated and with good contrast - much better than I remember the Special Edition theatrical version in 1997 on the films 20th anniversary. <br /> <br />The story is of course magical - still the best of all the Star Wars movies in my opinion.  This new DVD captures it all.  It is every bit as good as when it first came out in 1977.  Totally great! <br />
B00005JMEW|3.0|From Clarence Worley's first attempt to pick up a floozie in a cocktail bar for a tempting date of \\"THREE kung fu movies\\" (all starring Sonny Chiba) in \\"True Romance\\", it was obvious that the screenwriter -a then-unknown Quentin Tarantino- was a huge fan of Asian martial arts cinema.<br /><br />Eventually he turned up wearing a Chinese shirt in an introduction to the Miramax US re-release of the Hong Kong classic \\"Iron Monkey\\"...and we all knew it was just a matter of time before he made his own martial arts movie.<br /><br />Watching a \\"Hong Kong\\" action film made by an American is like listening to rap music performed by Europeans.  It can be technically proficient and even highly enjoyable, but at its core you recognize that there is something just fundamentally artificial and wrong with it...which is why this movie is so hit-and-miss.<br /><br />On the plus side, the action sequences are absolutely stunning; even the blood geyser FX during the swordfighting, classically over-the-top and more reminiscent of anime' than martial arts films, does not seem as absurd as it would in any other film.  The editing is as edgy as you would expect, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The action scenes are an adrenaline junky's dream, no argument there.  The film techniques from live action in living color to stark grainy black-&-white to animation are inspired and properly put Tarantino back in the \\"cool\\" zone of directors.<br /><br />But the story itself...revenge plot on steroids...just feels incredibly contrived.  The charm, if you can call it that, of Asian martial arts flicks is their hopelessly over-the-top nature.  Impossible acts laced with impossible dialogue exacerbated by eve more impossibly bad English dub tracks.  Add to the fact that Uma Thurmann, not the most gifted of actresses on her best day, makes an effort at overacting that would embarrass William Shatner and you start to get the impression that she is Mrs. Mia Wallace re-living her role as Raven McCoy (\\"the deadliest woman in the world with a knife\\") from her \\"Fox Force Five\\" pilot as recalled in \\"Pulp Fiction\\".<br /><br />Overall it's a good film, well-worth seeing...far better than I thought it was going to be (the Bruce Lee tracksuit from \\"Game Of Death\\" was really too much, though...pay all the tribute you want, Q, but even Bruce Lee's WORST effort is beyond the reach of mortals)...and the cliffhanger ending was completely satisfying and definitely an appetite enricher; the bases are loaded for a drive home of Sadaharu Oh proportions.role as Raven McCoy (\\"the deadliest woman in the world with a knife\\") from her \\"Fox Force Five\\" pilot as recalled in \\"Pulp Fiction\\". <br /> <br />Overall it's a good film, well-worth seeing...far better than I thought it was going to be (the Bruce Lee tracksuit from \\"Game Of Death\\" was really too much, though...pay all the tribute you want, Q, but even Bruce Lee's WORST effort is beyond the reach of mortals)...and the cliffhanger ending was completely satisfying and definitely an appetite enricher; the bases are loaded for a drive home of Sadaharu Oh proportions.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is it!  The greatest trilogy in movie history has finally made it to dvd.  Now, I was a little dissapointed that Lucas decided to release the Special Editions as opposed to the original versions but c'mon, stop your crying and take a look at these!<br /><br />First of all, the picture and sound is better than it's ever been before.  No longer is there a slight haze to the picture as everything looks clear and bright.  The sound has been touched up and Lucas even edited a few scenes to make them better soundwise.<br /><br />For example, there is the scene when Luke & Leia get seperated from Han & Chewie on the Death Star (In Episode 4: A New Hope)and are shooting it out with Stormtroopers across the broken bridge.  In the older versions of the film whenever Leia shot her blaster it sounded like she was firing a Magnum!  In this DVD version Lucas fixed that problem and now it sounds like she's firing a blaster just like everyone else.<br /><br />Also, the picture is so good now that I noticed something that Lucas didn't fix.  As Han & Luke are shooting at the TIE Fighters after they escape the Death Star in A New Hope, when you see the shots of the TIE Fighters flying by the Falcon you can see translucent \\"boxes\\" around the TIES!<br /><br />Besides the better picture and quality Lucas did go back and add some more scenes and also retouched many of the scenes that he added in the Special Edition movies.  Jabba looks awesome in the scene between him and Han in A New Hope.  He's about as life like as I have seen any CGI character and I am glad Lucas retouched that scene.  Also, the scene between Han and Greedo has been redone and while Greedo still does shoot first, it's almost at the exact same time as Han and is much better now.  Another scene that was touched up was Lukes fight with the Rancor in Return of the Jedi.  I HATED the Special Edition version of this because the new Rancor shots looks 2D and had just looked completely fake!  Lucas fixed this problem and not only do the Rancor shots show un in 3D but it the new shots also look really good.<br /><br />Throughout these films hardcore fans will notice a lot of new insert shots.  They are quick but make the movie fresh in a whole new way for all of us who have seen this film over and over again.<br /><br />There are also new scenes in this film that have a lot of people complaining.  My comment:  please shut up!  If you give these scenes a chance you will see that they work better!  For example when Vader talks to Emperor Palpatine over the holonet in The Empire Strikes Back they now have the actor who played him in Episodes I, II, III, and VI.  Not only does this add continuity to the films but it also has some new dialog between Vader and Palpatine that connects to the prequels and raises some interesting questions for episode III.<br /><br />The other scene that has people crying is the celebration scene at the end of Return of the Jedi.  We now see Hayden Christenson as Anakin's Ghost and a quick shot of Naboo celebrating.  I love this ending so much better now.  It makes a hell of a lot more sense to see the young Anakin in the Jedi Knight robe than the older one who cast down the Jedi Knight robe and was a Sith up intil the last 10 minutes of his life.  Also the young Anakin fades into this scene as if he's just arrived.  It makes the scene work and I like it a lot.<br /><br />Besides the films themselves there are a bunch of special features.  The commentary tracks are sure to keep you busy as well as the trailers (the trailers for these films are so bad that if those were the only things that I had as for what the films were about I would have never went to see them!  They're a lot of fun to watch), featurettes and the 2 1/2 hour documentary Empire of Dreams that covers a lot of ground on the Star Wars saga.<br /><br />Besides those things there is also a preview for the new video game Star Wars: Battlefront.  Also, if you have an X-Box you are in luck becauseif you put this disc in your X-Box you can play a playable demo of Battlefront!  Awesome!<br /><br />I like this set so much better than the Special Editions released in the 1990's.  Star Wars purists will probably hate this release.  If you hated the Special Editions though I still urge you to give this version of the films a chance.  I am a huge Star Wars fan as I have seen the orginials and the Special Editions as well as read many of the books about the extended Star Wars Universe.  I hope that you will give these films a chance.<br /><br />Also, there is a chance that Lucas will wise up and release the originals down the road.  In a recent interview fans asked some of the Star Wars staff if there is a possibility that there will be future releases of the Star Wars trilogy on DVD and they said almost certainly.  Star Wars purists will have to wait until then but to everyone else: Your Holy Grail has arrived!u are in luck because if you put this disc in your X-Box you can play a playable demo of Battlefront!

B00005NP04|5.0|If you can't regognize her name you will deffinatly recognize the songs she sings once you hear them. Almost all of them are quite famous. I don't really know what else to say about this fabulous cd. It has a rating of 5 stars out of over 100 reviews so it's gotta be good right? It is!! As far as her singing, it's not traditional country it's deffinatly more jumpy jazzy pop. Try it your guaranteed to like it!
B000002LJA|5.0|Without a doubt one of the most influencial musicians for the past 50 years as of this writing, Quincy Jones is one of the best musicians that on this planet and remains a great influence on music to this day.<br /><br /> His 1989 magnum opus entitled \\"Back on The Block\\" is unrivalled by almost everything else. The sheer number of singers and other stars who came aboard for this project is impressive! Starring a huge cast of old-time singers some of whom have sadly since passed away, rappers, and then yet-to-be pop stars this incredible masterpiece is without a doubt a contender for being one of the smartest, most creative, and energetic albums anyone has ever put out.  While I don't want to sound too biased with this review but \\"Back On The Block\\" is my favorite African-American music album of all time.  .<br /><br /> The party begins with a marvelous rap interlude entitled \\"Prologue (20's rap scene/ Quincy's Rap) which is a fun and energetic warm-up track featuring a wonderful rap dialogue that is really a lot of fun and highly joyous to listen. The title begins with a industrial metallic drum intro similar to that of the title track of Janet Jackson's dynamite \\"Rhythm Nation\\" and becomes a marvelous and energetic blend of rap, hip-hop with a New Jack Swing Spice. \\"I Don't Go For That\\" is similar to the previous and with a stadium-like New Jack Swing anthem with a fun Manhattan nighttime city feel. \\"I Don't Go For That\\" is a wonderful New Jack Swing classic with a highly danceable beat, wonderful melody.<br /><br /> \\"The Verb To Be\\" is a really humorous interlude with oddly amplified voice effects and really funny lines. The laughing voices merge into the track \\"We Be Doing' It\\". For all of the humor of \\"Verb\\" it perfect blends into the hip-hop rhythm and the song has a wonderful mix of R&B, blues, and dance all meshed together. If you're looking for great hip-hop music and for a testament for 1988-1991 being the Golden Era of this once-great genre, look no further. \\"The Place You Find Love\\" is one of my absolute favorite tracks on this album. It starts with a dramatic echoing Gospel voice and becomes a powerful Gospel anthem for the ages. The vocals by whoever is singing are absolutely incredible and do wonders for this track.<br /><br />  The next two-some track combo \\"Jazz Corner of the World\\" and \\"Birdland\\" to me are the apex of this album. \\"Jazz Corner\\" has a really perky Brazilian percussion and has a really cool hip rap verse. The groove of \\"Jazz Corner\\" perfectly merges into my absolute favorite song on this album \\"Birdland\\". This is without a doubt the best song Quincy has ever recorded and quite likely a candidate for the best cover-song I've ever listened to. With amazing bass lines and energetic trumpet horns similar from what one would hear from Phil Collins, the beat is just amazing and the song has a really awesome groove unrivalled by few other songs from 1989. \\"Septembro\\" is a sultry soulful instrumental jazz song with really unique chord shift and wonderful wordless vocals.<br /><br /> \\"One Man Woman\\" is a great and energetic dance song with a strong New Jack Swing style. \\"Tomorrow\\" is sheer and utter beauty featuring a barely teenaged then future-superstar Tevin Campbell singing on vocals and childrens choir. The song has a really positive, cheerful, and uplifting vibe to it.<br /><br /> The final track Secret Garden is one of the sexiest soul ballads of all time with a very Quiet Storm mood and featuring guest vocals from the late R&B crooner Barry White (I cried at the news of his passing) the create a beautiful nighttime closer to this illustrious masterpiece of an album.<br /><br /> This album is just about on the border of being utmost perfection. For all of the hard-work put into it's making this is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in popular, rock, hip-hop, and rap music history. As of writing this review, I am absolutely horrified to see the term \\"Out of Stock\\" actually on this product! For such a stunning achievement that took so much work and was such a huge hit, I for one cannot believe that Warner Brothers don't even carry this album in their catalog anymore! What a terrible disgrace to music history, by denying many fans one of the most positive, smartest, most well-crafted albums that has ever been released.<br /><br /> Wherever you go, I highly urge you to hunt for a copy of this album and buy it without hesitation. If not, then you have no idea of the party that you might find yourself missing out on. Quite simply there's no other album like this nor will there ever be.actually on this product!

0553296981|4.0|I just finished reading The Diary of Anne Frank and I read some of the reviews.  People make it sound like it was a book that she wrote about being in hiding and the war, it wasn't a book, it was her diary. Any diary that you read from a teenager isn't going to hold only information about what's going on in the world.  She did write about things that were going on, but not just outside, but inside the Annex, as well as inside of her.  What you are reading is what she really wrote, it has not been changed at all. I think it was a beautiful diary and very intelligently written.  I recommend it to anyone, even if your not interested in the Holocaust..
B0001CCXZW|5.0|It is refreshing to see this great show as it began.  I missed most of the 1st and 2nd seasons, and caught up with many on reruns and the remainder on this DVD set.  I absolutely love the show and where it has gone over the past 4 seasons.   <br /> <br />As for other reviewers who have a hard time dealing with Rory's \\"loss of innocence\\" as of late, HELLO, the character is a 19 year old college student when she loses her virginity.  That is old for today's standard, and the writers likely figured (and rightly so) that it would not be possible for her to remain a virgin forever.  And I also didn't see much \\"bed-hopping.\\"  One guy (while he is questionable b/c married) is hardly \\"hopping.\\"  Also, it is a common situation in real life and the writers want to portray situations that may happen in a life well lived.  Personally, I think they did it just to put a period at the end of the \\"Dean\\" issue.  What better way than to make him a philanderer?  And, seriously, \\"Murphy Brown\\" references are so ridiculous at this point in time that I hesitate to even type those two words in my review.  Not gonna go there... <br /> <br />This is a great television show, smart, funny, and superbly acted and written.  The characters, while extreme caricatures in a small town, show true human emotion that successfully draws fans of all ages to the show.  I just can't wait for the second season to be released!  The special features on the DVD set are better than I have seen on other sets, and the little booklet guide of each episode is very handy.  I would actually have liked to see some outtakes of scenes where the actors flub their lines, because you know it must happen from time to time with the rapid-fire delivery of those complex sentences!!   <br /> <br />To sum up, BUY IT!  You won't be disappointed!
B000002KAT|5.0|To be honest, I\\"ve never been more of a fan of Van Morrison than any other casual listener of the oldies station.  Then I heard the brilliant Sweet Thing at a bar, and was determined to find the album from whence it came.  I couldn't have been less disappointed in what I stumbled upon. <br /> <br />This album has a similar somber, jazzy appeal as Nico's amazing Chelsea Girl.  The difference is that where Nico was pretty much a contract player for a very well produced collection of songs, Astral Weeks is the highly personal work of a singular visionary.  The tracks here aren't really songs in the traditional sense, as much as they are movements of a big, gorgeous, drunken symphony. <br /> <br />Only Morrison was able to take classic American styles (Blues, Jazz, R & B) and make them as painfully Irish as he does here.  Although it's true that Van's upbringing predates the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the album seems so mournful of simpler times that it's hard not to feel a dark undercurrent somehow related to the violence that was erupting in Belfast in the 60's.  It's a kind of revolutionary passion that I wish existed in music today, but sort of died off in the 1980's. <br /> <br />Morrison reminds me of Maria Callas in the way that his voice defines the difference between prettiness and beauty.  He's a completely instinctual, animalistic singer, somtimes incoherent and ugly, but more expressive than almost any rock singer who ever lived.
B000066NW0|5.0|Losing Grip - not so keen on this song at first, but it really grows on you after a few listens. This is one of the more punk/rock songs, which isn't really my kinda style - 7/10 <br /> <br />Complicated - totally LOVE this. one of the best songs on the album. really catchy chorus and one of the more poppy songs - 8/10 <br /> <br />Sk8r Boi - this is quite a pop/punky kinda song. not one of her best songs but still good. has a ROCKIN chorus!!! 7/10 <br /> <br />I'm With You - first ballad on the album. one of my faves. chorus is really catchy and good to sing along too - 8/10 <br /> <br />Mobile - my least fave so far. it's quite repetitive and drags on and on like a Badly- Drawn Boy type song, but still quite catchy - 6/10 <br /> <br />Unwanted - this is a little like Losing Grip in that it is a big punky/rock kinda song. it is really angst-driven and turn it up loud if u really like rocking!!! - 6/10 <br /> <br />Tomorrow - one of the slower songs on the album, where Avril's voice really does shine. it's quite catchy and good to be played when you've had a really bad day - 7/10 <br /> <br />Anything But Ordinary - my fave song on the album. it goes along the lines of complicated, and is really catchy and good to sing along to. it's one of the more poppy tracks - 9/10 <br /> <br />Things I'll Never Say - my 2nd fave song. its got a big catchy chorus, and quite Alanis Morisette-style, you just can't stop singing along to it - 9/10 <br /> <br />My World - another really good song. quite catchy but not one of the stand-out tracks - 8/10 <br /> <br />Nobody's Fool - Oh my God, Avril tries rapping!!!! quite a decent song, but a little on the repetitive side - 7/10 <br /> <br />Too Much Too Ask - this is probably my least fave song. it's a bit on the dark/moody side, and doesn't really get going, although it's still quite catchy - 6/10 <br /> <br />Naked - good song to end the album on. It's quite catchy and the verses are really cool - 7/10 <br /> <br />Overall a Reallygood debut album from Avril. it's a mixture of pop and rock, but the majority is more poppy. don't buy it if you're looking for a more punk/rock album, cuz only about four of the songs can fit this description. COOOOOOOL!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Brilliant CD by a Brilliant artist. Song selection and arrangements are superb. I just love it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I really love this CD - but there are a few exceptions, but overall I thought it was great..  <br /> <br />Can't Hold Us Down - a perfect 5 star song, it's up beat and it has a really good message..  <br /> <br />Walk Away - It's Jazzy and long but it grew on me 4 stars  <br /> <br />Fighter - You all heard it, it's pretty good 4 stars  <br /> <br />Infatuation - It's a good song but its too long 4 stars  <br /> <br />Loving Me For Me - I don't really like it but the lyrics are really good 3 stars  <br /> <br />Impossible - It's pretty good 4 stars  <br /> <br />Underappreciated - I like it 4 and half stars  <br /> <br />Beautiful - Amazing song, amazing lyrics 5 stars  <br /> <br />Make Over - I like the song - I'd give it 4 and a half stars  <br /> <br />Cruz - Inspiring lyrics and a wounderful song 5 stars  <br /> <br />Soar - A great song with inspiring lyrics as well 5 stars  <br /> <br />Get Mine, Get Yours - I don't really like this song but i can tolerate it for a while 3 stars  <br /> <br />Dirrty - Everyone heard it - it's alright 4 stars  <br /> <br />The Voice Within - I like it 4 and a half stars  <br /> <br />I'm OK - I love this song - It tells us a lot about her past and the physical abuse she and her mother faced - it deserves more then 5 stars..  <br /> <br />Singing My Song - Not my favorite song 3 and a half stars <br /> <br />
B000002GB9|5.0|Styx is a tough band to review. Most of their stuff today is dismissed as cheese. I feel like I'm one of the few teenagers who listen to this stuff. Anyway, Styx took hard rock and put a creative spin on it in the 1970s, and this album is probably the pinnacle of their efforts (Crystal Ball, Pieces of Eight, and Paradise Theater are great too). Perhaps someday these guys will become more respected, especially since Rock and Roll has hit a huge slump in the last decade. <br />Anyway, here's what I think of the Album: <br /> <br />Grand Illusion: 10/10. The title track has a great marching rhythm, and a great message. Excellent. <br /> <br />Fooling Yourself: 7/10. In my opinion, the weakest track on the album. Some people love it, but I'm not too fond. It's unique though, which is the greatest thing about Styx. <br /> <br />Superstars: 9/10. The simplest Track on the album is still a great one. I love the guitar on this song. Got a nice melody. <br /> <br />Come Sail Away: 10/10. One of the greatest Styx songs ever. Got a nice Piano intro with some beautiful singing, and then it starts rocking with a great chorus.  <br /> <br />Miss America: 9/10. The hardest rocker on the album is great. It's a little bit overplayed on my part. Not Styx's best rocker, but a fine one. <br /> <br />Man In the Wilderness: 10/10. My favorite track on the album. This one is pretty overrated in my opinion, but I think it's great. Kind of darker, but it has a great melody and a totally sweet guitar solo. <br /> <br />Castle Walls: 10/10. Another favorite! This is a rather mysterious sounding track that sounds like Styx crossed with Pink Floyd. A great bassline and guitar solo. Highly underrated....check it out! <br /> <br />The Grand Finale: 9/10. The great thing about some styx albums is that they give you a nice finale at the end, which makes for great closure. This isn't anything too new or exciting, but its a good ending. <br /> <br />Overall, a classic album. Check it out if you enjoyhard rock with an artistic twist, but still feel like rocking out. Crank 'er up!!
0452282152|4.0|Vermeer's famous portrait of a girl with a pearl earring and her hair covered completely in fabric has always beguiled me.  The style of the painting, the expression, the clothes, the earring, the direct stare and longing in the mouth and eyes have always made me want to know more about the model.<br /><br />Ms. Chevalier's book dealt with those questions quite well, and took my understanding of the subject to new depths that I had not considered before.  If I had only gained that increased understanding of the painting, I would have found this to be a worthy book.<br /><br />The story is also filled with interesting details about the artistic methods of the time and preparation of materials.  That information was an unexpected bonus.<br /><br />Vermeer is known for having produced few works.  Ms. Chevalier has provided many intriguing ideas about why that might have been the case.<br /><br />On top of these artistic questions, Ms. Chevalier has written a lively story of a young woman whose family falls on hard times so that she has to take up work as a maid in Vermeer's household.  She finds herself at the bottom of the pecking order and is often treated unfairly.  Like Cinderella, her true qualities are eventually appreciated and she finds her Prince Charming.  The story also provides many helpful details about town life in Delft during the 1700s.<br /><br />The Cinderella story was a bit overdeveloped compared to the artistic aspects of the story.  Had the two aspects been in better balance I would have found this to be a five star book.<br /><br />If you normally enjoy historical romances, you will probably like this book better than I did.<br /><br />Keep smiling!

B00005JNEI|1.0|When your reviewer (Jeff Shannon) says that Moore armed himself with a platoon of reputable fact-checkers to produce this \\"provocative film\\", I wonder what your reviewer was smoking.  This is the worst attempt at a documentary that I have ever has the misfortune to view.  It makes \\"Rathergate\\" and the CBS use of \\"forged and falsified documents\\" on 60 Minutes II seem tame.  I would appreciate if your reviewer could name one of the reputable fact-checkers for the Amazon audience.  I do have to admit that Mr Moore is \\"rather\\" funny as the lead clown in his film.
B00005RIZP|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out years ago. I have never forgotten it. In fact, whenever I discuss horror films with horror film fans, I need only describe the plotline about \\"the guy in the attic movie with Olivia Hussey\\" - everyone knows exactly what film I am talking about. To a man or woman the response is the same - \\"it scared the hell out of me\\".      Its' hard to believe that Bob Clark made this film as well as the Porky's trilogy- but hey, comedy and horror both take talent.      Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth, Nightmare on Elmstreet,et al, all copy elements contained in this truly frightening film.      It takes place at a off-campus house over Christmas break. It involves a group of young college women who, unbeknownst to them, have a visitor. That's all I'll say. I've never forgotten this film.      Even after buying the DVD (and its' great with lots of extras), and having Bob Clark explain exactly how he made this film, it still scares me. Hardly any blood or gore -just incredibly imaginative, intense, film making. Just try watching it alone.      As the saying goes \\"you won't sleep through it\\", in fact you might have a hard time ever sleeping again, at least if you're sleeping in a house... with a large attic in it.      The surprise ending still works. Oh yeah, it still works- \\"Agnes, its' me,Billy\\"................................
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Marillion's newest release, Marbles, is something to savor. Two CD's with some of the most beautiful music you're bound to hear in your lifetime. Marillion plays with unprecedented intensity and power, and the songs on Marbles attest to that. They took their time making this record, over a year and a half, and it shows, not only in the playing, but in the songwriting as well. There's not a dog on this CD.<br /><br />Disc one starts out with INVISIBLE MAN. A dark, rather moody piece that sets the pace for Marbles, both live and in the studio. Fourteen minutes long, this song travels a dissonant path of excellence, showcasing the band's progressive skills, both musically and lyrically. Guitarist Steve Rothery shows just how cool it can be strumming an acoustic guitar for over ten minutes. Next up is the first of the MARBLES quartet. Not really a song as a whole, but moreso the first of four segments that makes up the song MARBLES, which is scattered across the two CD's in a conceptual fashion, despite the CD's non-conceptual arrangement. GENIE, a wonderfully melodic tune, is up next. Happy, bright, and cheerful, yet no less rocking. Think of MAP OF THE WORLD from Anoraknophobia, only much better. FANTASTIC PLACE is quiet, moody, and gorgeous. Steve Hogarth shows how one can build intensity as a song progresses from soothing ballad to intense rocker. Great song!  THE ONLY UNFORGIVIBLE THING is another moody mellowism that builds in intensity and showcases Steve Hogarth's trancing vocals. MARBLES TWO continues where MARBLES 1 left off, and then....drum roll please....the CD's most haunting track OCEAN CLOUD comes. This 18 minute opus sends the listener into near-nirvana. Amazingly beautiful.<br /><br />Disc two starts off with MARBLES 3, which, after two minutes, segues into the beatles-esque track THE DAMAGE. Next up is DON'T HURT YOURSELF, a happy acoustic guitar strumming melody reminiscent of 80 DAYS from the STRANGE ENGINE CD. The, the album's first single, YOU'RE GONE, sends the listener into a bit of a foot-tapping mode with its techno-like drum beat. This track is rather trancy in nature, and would undoubtedly show up well as a remix for dance clubs. DRILLING HOLES is another edgy rock tune like THE DAMAGE, and MARBLES 4 finishes up what the other 3 parts started. Then comes NEVERLAND, an amazing song that showcases the adept piano playing of Mark Kelly. There's a brilliant repetitive chorus that closes out the song like MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES did on Strange Engine.<br /><br />Marbles is an amazing CD, simply put. I highly recommend anyone getting this CD, regardless of the type of music you enjoy. It's THAT good. Buy it.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Oh my g*d, I just had the same experience!!! I totally did not want to see this movie but my girlfriend asked me to so we did. And I just loved it!!! We both do meditation and the reviews really do help with the understanding. <br /> <br />Terrific. See this movie now!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Like many others, I've been waiting a long time for the first Star Wars trilogy to come out on DVD. Also, like many others, I've been disappointed with director George Lucas' seemingly constant tweaking of the content of these classic films. When the trilogy was re-released in 1997, my friends and I went to see it for the experience of watching these iconic films in a theater again, not so much to see what new tricks Lucas came up with in his California lab.    So to hear he has made more changes to these movies does not impress me. Still, this is the Star Wars trilogy, the films I saw as a pre-teen that, it's not going too far to say, blew my mind and set a very high bar as far as what science-fiction in motion pictures could be. \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is the best of the three, maybe the best middle chapter in any film trilogy. While this project has always been intended as a money-making machine, you can really smell the commercialism encroaching in the third installment, \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" with its kid-friendly Ewoks. Still, these three movies are a monument to filmmaking, and it's nice to finally have them in DVD format.    In my opinion, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\" are terrible movies, especially compared to what went before. The seamless interaction between man, alien, and machine that made the first trilogy so magical is lost, and the actors just don't have the rapport that gave a dose of humanity to all the special effects the first time around. If I had Lucas' ear, \\"let someone else direct\\" would be my advice. Lucas seems determined to make sure everyone knows that he's captain of his ship, though, so I doubt the third movie will be any better. So, George, you created a masterpiece, finally made it available for sale on DVD, and I've bought it. I believe our business is concluded.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I read that in a review of American Idiot, and they were right.  This is the most important rock album of the year.  In a time where its impossible for anyone in the mainstream media to step out of the line, Green Day fires back with American Idiot, filled with the disillusion and anger, among other topics, that we all feel today.   <br /> <br />Here are the highlight songs of this great CD.  <br /> <br />American Idiot is the title track and first single, which takes a shot at Bush and his adminstration for their \\"war on terrorism\\".  At the same time it brings back the driving guitars and drums that made Dookie so popular.   <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia is another standout track, the five parts of this 9-minute epic truly flow together so well, you can barely tell its 5 songs in one.   <br /> <br />Holiday is an anthem for our time.  Green Day reaches its political height, calling out Bush as nothing but a \\"gasman\\".   <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams is an unbelievably great ballad about being lost and alone. <br /> <br />St Jimmy is another personal favorite of mine.  Fast, loud, recalling memories of songs like \\"Jaded\\" and \\"Playtpus\\" <br /> <br />Letterbomb is my third favorite track on this CD (Behind Jesus of Suburbia and Wake Me Up When September Ends).  A perfect punk song that simply asks \\"where have all the riots gone?\\".  Another memorable line that sums up our apathetic times \\"this city's burnin', its not my burden\\".   <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends is simply the best song on this CD and in the Top 5 for greatest Green Day songs of all time.  Billie Joe has never been more honest and vulnerable as he is in this song about his fathers death.  This is Green Day's zenith.   <br /> <br />Simply put, this album is a classic and any fan of rock in general should be picking up this CD.
B000002MP2|5.0|well well well <br />I must say we have a masterpiece on our hands... <br />yup this is definately one of the cds that defined 90s \\"Mdern Rock\\" and still continues to define to this day. <br />Yes thats right...this cd was released in 94 but still 10 years later...I STILL LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM! <br />This ranks along with CLASSICS like So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes from NOFX and Out Come The Wolves by RANCID, and The Blue Album by Weezer and finally NEVERMIND by Nirvana <br />This is GreenDays best cd...the only other cd that might even compare would be Insomniac <br />Like I said this is a true masterpiece for punk pop punk and rock alike... <br />
B000020617|5.0|This is Foo Fighters best album, even better than 'Colour & The Shape'. I was very suprised when I heard 'Learn to Fly' on The Nerve (rock radio station) since I didn't think anyone could mature so much in two years. Daves voice has not changed but some of his songwriting has, his lyrics became stronger/funnier than The C & the S and he has taken more pride in his work. He had now began to sound like Kurt Cobains 'In Utero' that he drummed for a half decade ago, now he approaches more of what his old bandmate was all about. I'm sure Kurt was proud when he watched Dave down on Earth with his good buddies John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix in Valhalla, maybe (The three were the greatest damn human beings that ever existed!). The other bandmates have also matured a bit too, lead guitarist Pat Smear had begun to make damn good riffs and solos (sometimes) in this godly album. The rythem isn't bad either, drumming and bass playing is top knotch here. Buy this you Foo Fighter/Nirvana freak!
B000003TAW|5.0|hmm....lets see....I got turned on to Weezer early 7th Grade...my buddy david had this cd he was listening to in class during \\"break time\\"....i could hear it through the headphones and it sounded pretty good...I didnt know the band untill I had asked him what he was listening to... <br /> <br />He said\\"its a kickbutt band called weezer...there from the 90s but still ROCK man! you want this? I have the original copy this is a burned copy...\\" <br /> <br />well I took that album...its one of the best decisions Ive ever made... <br /> <br />I am now in 10th Grade and have been listening to weezer for 3 years and I have this album green and maladroit and theyre DVD and intend to buy Album 5 whenever it comes out <br /> <br />this is a must have for any rock fan...though it is considered \\"emo\\" anyone can listen to this and enjoy it... <br /> <br />make a good decision copy it from a friend or better yet go buy it! <br /> <br />--your friend YESMan
0440237688|4.0|I highly encourage everyone to read the book The Giver. The setting for the story is in what would seem to me to be a cold, dark, colorless world, in which Jonas, a 12 year old boy, lives. As the book progresses, you learn to understand Jonas and that world in which he lives, and by the end, you totally root for him to accomplish what he sets out to do. I think that if you enjoy a good book, this one would be an excellent one to read!
B000002UAX|5.0|As a big fan of the fab four, obviously I love this album. I wouldn't put it up there in the Abbey Road area though. The largest range of songs on any Beatles album. Tons of classics, tons of little known treasures. I personally think they could have cut it down but there's too much incredible music on this album not to give it five stars.  <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|As a guitarist myself, I have over the past few years turned my attention away from bands like Green Day - merely because the music they play isnt \\"challenging\\" enough. I have been listening to The Pixies, Pearl Jam, Metallica (oldies, but goodies!). <br /> <br />From the age of 13 to 18, I was obsessed with Green Day - Ive seen them live 4 times now - and I must say that the majority of the bands old stuff sounds the same (I loved it anyway!).  <br /> <br />I bought this album a week ago - unsure what to expect. I have to say I am pleasantly suprised!  <br /> <br />Songs that stand out for me: <br />- American Idiot - Sounds a lot like the kind of music you would expect from the traditional Green Day (Dookie/Nimrod/Inseticide) <br />- Holiday - Great song. Well written, catchy. A proper \\"feel good\\" song. Billie Joe's vocals have DEFINATELY improved!!! <br />- Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Amazing. No other word could describe this song. Great lyrics, great music. It's as much of a shock as Good Riddance back in the days... <br />- Are we the waiting - How to describe this... Well, this one isnt really for me, but I'm sure Indie music fans would fall in love with it on first listen. <br />- St Jimmy - This sounds like CLASSIC Green Day! Almost feels like you're listening to Kerplunk mixed with 70's punk <br />- She's a rebel - Powerful and pumping - Lots of strange twists in this song. One of my favourite songs on the album - most old school Green Day fans will love this one ;-) <br /> <br />Overall, this album is well worth putting your hand in your pocket for! <br /> <br />The only reason I haven't rated this 5/5 is that it would take a masterpiece for me to give full marks :D <br />-
B000002KO3|4.0|Remain In Light is an album like no other. Most every song is one measure repeated over and over, at least for the non-vocals. The singing is as clever as can be. David Byrne's versatile and energetic voice is heard singing walls of melodies at some times. There's also Brian Eno and Nona Hendryx at the mic with him. I won't short change them. Especially not Eno. He did as much as a person not named David Byrne could do on a Talking Heads album.  <br /> The first three songs are pretty similar in the fact that they are very upbeat and difficult to understand lyrically, at least for me. The fourth track is the well-known \\"Once In a Lifetime.\\" This is a great song that has introduced many people to the Talking Heads via radio. It's slightly more structured than many of the other songs, having an obvious chorus and verses. Then comes the funky \\"Houses in Motion.\\" Nearly as good as \\"One in Lifetime\\" is this one.  <br /> The rest is quite a disappointment compared to the first five songs. \\"Seen and Not Seen\\" is sort of a a story or poem put to music. The lyrics are interesting but the song is not nearly as energetic and funky as the others. The pretentious \\"Listening Wind\\" follows. \\"Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill/Mojique thinks of days before Americans came.\\" Need I quote more? Maybe this wouldn't be as unappealing if you hadn't been put in a jubilant mood by the first few songs. The closer, \\"The Overload,\\" is a big depressing drone that seems to go one forever.  <br />  The last few songs leave you with a not so great lasting impression of an otherwise great album. I try to look past that and listen to \\"The Great Curve\\" again.  <br />  Though inconsistent, I still enjoy listening to Remain In Light. It just makes you want to tap a foot or thrust your head back and forth like David Byrne.
B000002JR8|5.0|If you want the very definition of heavy/thrash metal, look no further than FBD.  This album is a MASTERPIECE!  Most metal bands have always projected this image of pure, %100 testosterone, but their music fell somewhat short of the mark, NOT Pantera.  This album is like auditory adreneline, it's pure, it's vicious, it's brutal, it's beautiful.  Never before, and quite honestly, not since, FBD has the essence of metal been so clearly defined.  In my opinion, NO BAND has EVER done thrash metal better than PANTERA.  Not, Megadeth, not Metallica, not Slayer (I'll get killed for that one), not ANYBODY!
B0000AM6JI|5.0|Al Pacino is just too good in this movie as hood turned released jail ex criminal now trying to go straight Carlito Briginate.<br /><br />This film has a good plot and a lot of drama with decent action. While watching, you wonder what will happen next. Definitely one of the top five Pacino films I can see again and again.
B000002VCO|4.0|Though maybe not as good as \\"Tales, \\"Robot\\" or \\"Turn of A Friendly Card\\" this is, nevertheless a fine follow-up to \\"Eye In The Sky\\" and contains several gems, such as \\"Prime Time\\", \\"Don't Answer Me\\", the instrumental \\"Pipeline\\" and the title track. And, as usual, an excellent, crystal clear production.
B00006IUL7|5.0|This is definitely one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The story is basically a remake of a classic foreign film, where a detective is trying to solve a murder case in a small town that never gets dark. After having trouble sleeping for days, the detective soon finds himself caught in a world of confusion and lies. Al Pacino and Robin Williams deliver very captivating performances in this film, so it's no wonder why this film did so well. This film is probably one of the deepest films ever made going over powerful themes like lust or love, justice or injustice, truth or perception that are often questioned throughout the film. And it somehow works, to where the film manages to blur the perception of right or wrong to the point where the audience can't tell the difference. Overall, this is definitely another great film by two of Hollywood's finest actors.
B00028HBKM|1.0|What was Jesus' message?  To love and forgive, and generally treat people the way you'd like them to treat you.  What is this movie?  An exercise in tight-focus sado-masochism, the effect of which is to send people out of the theatre roused to a frenzy of grief and rage that they then direct -- where?  At anybody who's not a fanatical worshipper of the person they claim as their god.  The thing has no value as a story -- no dramatic tension (yup, they're just gonna him him again until he's dead), no nuance, no depth, no nothing -- except the crazed wallowing in physical suffering that has characterized more than one of this distinctly kinked movie-maker's previous screen outings.   <br /> This movie is a bloody mess in every sense of the word.  Seems to me that Jesus would be horrified and embarrassed by it.  This isn't what he came here to communicate, but rather a lot of hysterical kerfuffle spun by lots of other people, who were or weren't there (which doesn't seem to matter to devoted -- self-styled -- \\"Christian\\" fanatics, who'll believe anything that comes with the world \\"Bible\\" attached to it, no matter how nutty). What a betrayal -- not by intention but because Mel Gibson has fixed on the screen such a twisted, blinkered vision of Christianity.   <br /> Jesus wept, and he's weeping still -- about the latest in a long line of perversions of his message.
B0002IU988|5.0|I'm usually not big on reviews and never base a purchase on them myself. So, you can consider this more of an opinion than a review. I was really eager for this album to come out. I liked some of Creed's songs but never was much into Stapp's vocal style. And no, I don't think he ripped off Eddie Vedder...not sure who thought that one up because I never heard the connection. Same goes for Myles Kennedy. I don't hear Chris Cornell either. Maybe when he hits a certain note here and there but they are not very similar at all. If you want to compare him to someone, which I hate to do, he sounds closer to Ian Thornley of \\"Thornley\\" and the former Big Wreck. Of course anyone can sound like anyone if you look hard enough for similarities. On to the music....Yes, a few of the songs do sound like something Creed would do but what do you expect from 3 of the former members? That said, only certain parts of those songs have Creed similarities. The music is much more complex and the vocals IMO are head and shoulders above Creed. You can tell Mark Tremonti had a lot built up inside that he needed to get out as far as his playing goes. The solos aren't necessarily melodic...they are mostly done at a very frenzied pace, but it's better than none at all. I'd be willing to bet they will get better if they put out more albums in the future. My faves are \\"Down To My Last\\" \\"One Day Remains\\" \\"Open Your Eyes\\" \\"Metalingus\\" and \\"In Loving Memory\\" in that order. This one is definitely worth checking out and if their chemistry stays tight, I'll be looking forward to checking out even more from these guys in the future.

B0002OERI0|5.0|ok, so my husband and I left a prior review.  This is the edited verion:American Idiot is an amazing album - granted I live in NYC, but (grew up listening to Green Day and Pennywise in Hermosa, CA) all my musical life, and I have to say, they are phenomenal-one of the best albums ever!! If for no other reason than because not many albums are made that you can listen to EVERY song and never get tired of it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Regardless if you agree with the negative feeback in the reviews here on Amazon.com, you are short changing Britney.  I rather have disliked her previous albums because they sounded like \\"we wrote these pop songs for you, sing them and dance and be quiet.\\" So I don't know how anyone could say her new album is horrible, she co-wrote 7 songs and collaberated with several different artists including Moby, and the co writer of Kylie Mingoue's \\"Cant get you out of my head,\\" for her song \\"Toxic.\\" \\"Me Against the Music,\\" is not one of my favorite songs but has credibility because she worked with one of the most known female artists on the planet - Madonna, who has had over 10 number one hits.  This album shows Britney's growth, as a person and most of all musicly.  Her albums have gone from pop teenager to woman self expressing keyboard synths, all of her songs are unique and each has a theme and unique sound.  You could turn up this CD and dance to it, the beats are heavy and loud enough to hear out of your car with the windows rolled up.  I have not been a previous fan of britney, but this album shows some major growth and I don't normally like this kind of music, but music is about creativity and self expression - if you dont like it don't listen to it.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Very happy with the video quality and the sound is very good in Surround EX, though two things disappointed me: They didn't go with a DTS soundtrack and the packaging is just too commonplace for the long awaited release of Star Wars on DVD. This Star Wars boxed set uses the standard plain-old dvd cases. I would have liked to see packaging in a cardboard jacket as they did with the deluxe editions of Lord of the Rings, or The Godfather boxed set, or something even more special like the fold-out packaging of Band of Brothers encased in a tin container. Good news is that movies each fit on one disk, and the wait is over.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a Christian of any denomination. Nor have I ever felt the draw of any organized worship. That said, watching this film in some way managed to strike a chord within me which resonates even now.<br /><br />This is *not* easy viewing by any stretch of the imagination - the many reviews here should give you a clue of that. But what the film does - very successfully - is highlight the capacity of ordinary men to commit acts of almost pure evil when faced with the unknown. Claims of anti-Semitism against this film are - in my opinion - somewhat off the mark. Gibson places the blame for the torture, humiliation and execution of Jesus on the shoulders of all men. Jewish elders, Romans and Herod are all shown as lacking in courage and compassion.<br /><br />What Gibson has created is as stark and pure a story-telling of the Passion as we have seen in cinema. Watch.
B0000025DT|4.0|The Electric Light Orchestra continue to make world-class symphonic pop-rock with their 1976 release, \\"A New World Record.\\" Jeff Lynne & company deliver another great disc that's rich in melodies & musicianship, with excellent orchestral flourishes throughout. Several ELO classics come from this record, such as \\"Telephone Line,\\" \\"Rockaria,\\" \\"Livin' Thing,\\" and \\"Do Ya,\\" as well as the very inventive \\"Mission (A World Record),\\" and the beautiful album-closer, \\"Shangri-La.\\" ELO were totally at their creative peak during the mid-to-late 70's, and \\"A New World Record\\" is another fine standout for this classic rock group.
B000000W6R|4.0|Most bands with genuine rock creation going on end up with some B-sides, and the Smashing Pumpkins were no exception. While it has no internal cohesion, \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" is a solid album in its own right, with the mix of bombastic and balladic that the Pumpkins did so very, very well.<br /><br />With a few exceptions like Broken Social Scene, B-side albums usually have a few enchanting songs, surrounded by half-formed songs that might be good when they grow up. \\"Pisces Iscariot\\".... is not one such album. Virtually all of these songs are worthy of being A-sides.<br /><br />The Pumpkins were one of those rare bands that did both quiet and loud songs equally well. There are mellower, beautiful songs like \\"Soothe,\\" the beautiful cover of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Landslide,\\" or the rather wispy \\"Whir.\\" On the other hand, there is the rock side: frenetic \\"Frail and Bedazzled,\\" steady \\"Plume\\" and jagged \\"Pissant.\\" Then there's the center jewel of the album, the steadily built-up \\"Starla,\\" which starts soft and turns into pure sonic insanity.<br /><br />The instrumentation has a raw quality -- it doesn't sound unpolished, but it does have a lot of unbridled power and enthusiasm. Billy Corgan was in good form during each recorded track, including the one from his apartment, be it fuzz-rock, distorted jams or his acoustic guitar, with James Iha quietly and exceptionally backing him up. And as the finishing touch, there's outstanding drumming by Jimmy Chamberlin.<br /><br />Corgan's voice is a bit off in \\"Landslide,\\" but otherwise his high vocals fit in as well as always. James Iha also gets to shine in \\"Blew Away.\\" And the songwriting is a bit more simplistic (\\"You hear a lot of visions/you can't even stop/can't see what you're missing/spinning like a top\\") than the usual Corgan fare, but still quite pretty to listen to.<br /><br />\\"Pisces Iscariot\\" is a rare beast among B-side albums -- the B-side album that is better than many regular rock releases. And whether you're a Pumpkins fan or a newbie, it's a solid listen.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|The real horror in this movie is the fact that people watch it. I'm a zombie enthusiast, and I love the 1st and 3rd of the \\"Return\\" series, but MAN, this movie blows. They kill the zombies with electricity in perhaps the lamest zombie attack scene since \\"Oasis of the Dead.\\" That's not good. <br />Watch parts 1 and 3, but skip this one. You'll be doing yourelf a favor.
0671015206|2.0|Great.  These people have money, but what else?  Do you really want to sit around with a fat bank account while you live and work like a pauper?  Personally, I find these people to be hopelessly boring - constantly watching every damn penny and obsessed with their \\"net worth\\". <br /> <br />I'm a doctor, and I see people die all the time.  And they don't take anything with them except perhaps regrets for what was left undone.  No one has ever told me that they wished they had worked just a little more... <br /> <br />I'd rather use up my money and enjoy life rather than having the cold comfort of being a \\"millionaire\\".
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am not necessarily a democrat or a republican, thus a swing voter. This allows me to avoid party line bias. When voting for president, i generally vote on my gut instinct, for who i think will do the best job of running the country. Up until September, i was like most, not impressed by either Kerry or Bush, waiting for a chance to hear what they had to say and listen and read some media reports. I heard about the movie and had a difficult time getting it, as most did not carry it due to fear, which struck me as odd.  Finally I watched Farenheit 9/11 and was disgusted by the arrogance and lies of this administration.  Michael Moore presents facts that are undisputable and allow you the viewer to think hard.  Facts are from several different reputable sources that cannot all bend the truth. It is clear that Mr Moore has a grudge against President G.W. Bush, he shows that at the beginning, but in the movie he presents facts to support his views which make it difficult to say he is  bending the truth for his own reasons. After hearing the controversy surrounding Mr. Moore and the government and republican effort to silence him, I was glad to finally get to see this documentary that said what everyone else was afraid of saying in fear of the RNC wrath. This movie really changed my mind about President Bush and his administration. Facts presented here about the President Bush's administration, policies and practices were an eye opener.  A lot of stuff i did not know about. This is not the way that this our country aught to be run! As a Texan and former Bush supporter I believed that this movie was biased and a lie, but I was challenged to watch the facts presented in the movie then think about them. Let's just say bush doesnt get my vote anymore. The whole issue about the Bin Laden family being flown out of the country after 9/11 especially strikes me as odd.  The fact that they should have been detained for questioning cannot be argued. Bush family ties to rich oil Saudis and business with the Carlyle group which did business with the Bin Laden family!  Question the motives of the war in Iraq, knowing that most of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, none came from Iraq. In fact there are no known ties to Iraq or WMD's.  So why arent the Saudis being questioned??? After all, Bin Ladin is a Saudi himself. Why arent we attacking Saudi Arabia?? Why arent we concentrating our efforts in Afghanistan? that's where Bin Laden is! Why are the rich and administration favored companies fighting over the oil fields in iraq? I thought this war was about terrorism?  Why are the military (using our hard earned tax money) guarding the oil fields  more than anything else in Iraq(and dying in the process)? Is the death of all these military personnel (1000 and growing) worth it?  What if one of them was my kid, brother or cousin?  Is Iraq on its way to becoming another Vietnam like crisis? Is this about oil? If so who benefits, and are we likely to give up control of the region if Bush returns to office?  Will Iraq elections be fair (or will he be US controlled for oil purposes)? Are we suggesting that Iraqis and other countries take our place  and pay for a war we started? Will they willingly do that? are they less human? Were all the peaceful diplomatic efforts exhausted before the war started? Did Bush go against common sense? Is Bush's arrogance hurting our foreign trade relations and deficit?  Does he even care about the deficit? At least watch this film before you vote, and figure out why the RNC is trying so hard to silence Mr Moore. Think hard about the facts.  I dont think the American public is ignorant as this administration probably thinks, i think we are in the dark about the truth that is hidden from us.  If many knew the truth they would clearly change their minds too. No wonder the RNC is trying hard to silence Michael Moore.
B0002234LS|3.0|***WARNING. This review may be a spoiler to those who have not seen the move.***  I would have given it 4 stars (5 would have been too much considering the real slow build up) were not for the end.  I'm a big fan of horror, and I don't mind when the villain wins once in awhile, given that it's put together just right.  Somehow, though, the end seemed to fall apart.  Here's a few reasons: <br />1) The private detective Mort hired should have sensed something strange about Mort all along; maybe even by questioning his ex and her new lover (hmmm. . . that may have been a good start). <br />2) Although I thought Mort's ex's new lover was a bit of a creep, by the end of the movie I understood why.  He knew Mort was crazy.  So why let her go see Mort by herself?  Furthermore, if he felt something bad was going to happen (which is why he ended up following her there) why not bring a gun or call the police or something? <br />3) Didn't it seem odd that when the wife finally went into Mort's cabin and it was in ruins with the name Shooter scratched all over the place that she chose to go upstairs instead of getting help? <br />4) And that sheriff; obviously he sensed something wrong about Mort, and possibly linked it to the two missing guys.  So why didn't he force Mort to ask questions or at least follow him back to the cabin and keep an eye on him? <br />
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The W brothers had a massive cult hit with the original Matrix.  They had a great idea carried off well.  They were stylish and hip and even managed to make Keanu Reeves seem like a real actor.  And then they signed a deal for the sequels. <br /> <br />Watching this movie, you'll realize exactly what happened.  They took all of their advance money and bought big houses and partied for months until the night before the script was due.  Then they panicked and threw together a story that had enough elements of the first movie to call it \\"The Matrix\\".  They made it and we bought it and now we're wishing they'd stopped after the first one.  I call this George Lucas syndrome.
B00005JKGO|5.0|And I am not dissapointed. Fellini captures the excitement of Rome so well. It is also a very interesting look at relationships that corresponds to the director's own personal experiences (read his book 'I Fellini').<br /><br />I found this to be a lot more entertaining than 8 1/2 despite the length - and it also looks very good on dvd - even though it isn't criterion. I would highly reccomend this two disc set.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore is the type of man who has his fair share of detractors as well as supporters, but don't let that deter you from watching this movie. <br />    The film begins with footage of jubilant Democrats celebrating what they believe to be the victory of Al Gore as the new President of the United States of America, but alas, that happiness is short-lived with the startling news that, in fact, GEORGE W BUSH IS THE NEW PRESIDENT! <br />    How did this debacle happen? How could a spoilt, over grown child like George W Bush possibly succeed the intelligent and sophisticated President Clinton as President of the most powerful nation in the world? Simple, get your brother and some of your Daddy's friends help you cheat on the vote recount in the state of Florida, where your brother happens to be the governor, and convince Dad's friends in the Supreme Court to rule in your favour in spite of glaring oversights, and blatant evidence of voter tampering. <br />    Cut straight to the blackest day in the history of the 21st century, and we see footage showing that on the day the Twin Towers were destroyed, George was visiting a primary school to read with the kids (assuming the man had the intelligence to read as well as the kids!). And while the nation was in a state of sheer naked panic, George just sits there in the classroom and barely blinks an eye. <br />    The second half of the film then concentrates on the Iraqi battleground, and the very human cost of war. The most poignant moment of the film is Lila Lipscombe reading the last letter her son wrote her from the Iraqi field before he was killed in action. He tells her that he and the other troops don't know why they are there, they don't want to be there, they all just want to come home to their families. <br />    But perhaps the most galling aspect of this film, second to the gruesome images from Iraq, are the existence of a business relationship between the Bush and Bin Laden families. The implication being that this war on Iraq was instigated in order for Bush and co. to make millions (billions?!), but all at the expense of 3000 innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001. <br />    Many detractors have gone for the juggular, and accused Moore of fabricating many facts, some going as far as accusing Moore of telling outrageous lies. But prior to seeing this film I read several books regarding this subject, one of them was 'September 11' by Noam Chomsky, 'Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq' by Christopher Scheer, Robert Scheer and Lakshmi Chaudry just to name a few. These books had already exposed Bush for the sycophantic bully that he is. <br />    And yes, I for one hope that he falls flat on his arse by losing the next election. <br />    For anyone out there who was skeptical about the connection between Al_queda and Saddam, or if you wondered how did it go that Osama Bin Laden was deemed responsible for September 11, and yet somehow, Bush suddenly declared war on Iraq WATCH THIS MOVIE. <br />    Just a point of interest, the Bush administration claimed there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and the Al-Queda group based on the fact that Mohamed Atta (one of the leading hijackers) was in Prague the same time an Iraqi official was visiting the city of Prague. There were several claims that they held a meeting, but oddly enough, the 'sources' which claimed that they spoke at length were untraceable to all. And there has never been any evidence that the two men ever met, only that they were in the same city at the same time. <br />    So, like I said, watch this movie yourself, and decide whether or not the real axis of evil (Bush, Blair and Howard) deserve to win their respective elections or not. <br />    Another four years? More like another 6 weeks for Bush.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is certainly one of Maiden's best.DRIVING MUSIC,GREAT VOCALS.To the reviewer asking why Cross Eyed Mary wasn't included.It's because that is a Jethro Tull song from one of Tull's most famous albums,Aqualung.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I went to the Best Buy here  in  NYC to buy Clerks, Uncensored (the animated ones) and saw all the \\"loyal followers\\" (aka LEMMINGS) of Lord Almighty George Lucas waiting on a long line to buy their DVD box set of Star Wars and I wanted to burst out in hysterical, maniacal laughter. As you can probably tell , I already did MY research and found out that the original movies were not going to be released but the 1997 \\"special editions\\", with their awful CGI effects as well as a few new ones. You all know what I mean by now. And I swore that I was not going to fall into that trap and spend 42.99 for the  altered versions and would rather go to my storage space and dig up my laserdiscs of them instead and watch the ORIGINAL films. But since they stopped making laserdiscs back in 1997 and it was no way as popular as DVD, most of you don't know that laserdisc had a much better picture than VHS and had analog video and digital sound. <br />So if all you loyal , faithful fans of the original films want to see the ORIGINAL films, instead of these bastardized versions, just go on ebay and get a used (or I've even seen New) laserdisc player and all 3 films on laserdisc, so you can watch them over and over again. <br />The originals with a much better picture than VHS, iI said! <br />It will cost you more than 42.99 or whatever you paid for the DVDs with their alterations, but will be worth it. <br />
B0000VAFO0|3.0|OK, this movie didn't win any Oscar awards, which really suprised me until I remembered that Oscars are given to movies that (1) I dislike and (2) have some sort of \\"artistic\\" message.  Well, Underworld failed on both counts.  Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief to an almost unreasonable level (if the vampires are so powerful, how come the werewolves beat them like a rented mule in every fight?) and put up with some really poorly acted scenes (ie: every one that has a confrontation between Beckinsdale and the #2 vampire chick), but in the end, it's a fun movie to watch.  Don't worry if you don't love it, because you'll forget about it totally within half an hour. <br /> <br />Unless you're in love with K.B., don't buy this.  Just go rent it the next time you've got 2 hours to kill.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Ive known LoG for a few years now;  heard Burn the Priest on MP3.com (RIP may I add) and was immiadiately impressed.  wasnt the greatest metal ive ever heard, but it was good enough for me to do some research on them, as they seemed to have dropped off the planet.  Thats when i discovered they had changed their name to Lamb of God and had released \\"New American Gospel\\", one of the best metal albums of all time.  most metal fans at least acknoweledge the fact that all faces of metal are changing.  no one can deny that Burn the Priest/LoG are on the forefront. they, along with Shadows Fall, Blood Has Been Shed, and more recently Killswitch Engage (now with BHBS' Howard Jones on vocals) are changing extreme metal as we know it.  all aforementioned bands have OUTSTANDING vocalists, as mentioned in other reviews, easily on par with Slayer's Tom Araya and Pantera's Phil Anselmo in their own rights. <br /> <br />bottom line: LoG is amongst the new metal bands, the bands that are changing metal as we know it, and the bands that will be here for a long, long time.  if their current popularity is any indication, the bands we're hearing now will be mimiced for years to come (those ignorant to screaming, heavy, screatching metal will say they mimic each other, which couldnt be further from the truth), and you know what they say: If you're gonna copy someone, make sure to copy someone who knows what they're doing.
068987474X|5.0|This book has transformed my relationship outlook.  Very charming, heartfelt, and a quick, funny read.  Coming off a tortuous series of break ups, I went a little self-help, relationship book-crazy trying to figure out why I couldn't seem to make it work with anyone.  I cannot believe how simple it is -- they just weren't that into me!  Eureka!  Nothing to figure out, no one to blame, no self-esteem issues, no crappy \\"rules\\" to follow or games to play.  He's just not that into you, and you deserve better!  This is truly the best relationship book out there, ladies.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album is fantastic. Easily the best release of 2004, and in the top 5 of this century. It took a few listens for me to fully appreciate but great albums often do. You'll be hooked from the first listen and it just gets better from there.  <br /> <br />I've been listened to this album for atleast three days in a row now and it's offically....awesome.  <br /> <br />BUY IT! NOW! <br /> <br />...also I ordered it direct from Merge Record's website and they sent a free poster and sticker. Very cool.
0805076476|5.0|By now the plot to Chuck Palahniuk's novel Fight Club is well-know; unfortunately, it's also still widely misunderstood. All those reviewers who saw a celebration of violence and nihilism completely missed the point: this is a work of satire. <br />Palahniuk criticises (quite successfully, I thought) consumer and self-improvement culture, as well as the state and capitalism. However, the real target becomes the social movement itself, and the way in which such a movement can degenerate into facism. Fight Club begins as a movement to extoll the individual, but ends up destroying him in the name of the &quot;greater good&quot; (in this way, Palahniuk also takes a stab at Communism). Men who are first taught that they alone have the power to control history, are later forced to alter their physical appearace and mindlessly chant slogans such as, &quot;you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake&quot;, and &quot;I am the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world&quot;.<br />Palahniuk shows us how a young man, first disillusioned with his job and his possessions, soon loses focus and ends up being angry at everything: society, history, God Himself. The book's characterizations are accurate: history is always most profoundly altered by angry young men. <br />The book is written in tense first-person narrative, with Palahniuk firing off page after page of potent and memorable prose. It's unfortunate that most people, acting on their biases and the word of others, will never get to appreciate it.
B000062Y98|5.0|Blind Guardian's 7th studio album, A Night At The Opera (2002) is their best since Nightfall In Middle Earth (not to mention their only one since then.) Even so, this is tied with Avantasia's Metal Opera Pt. 2 for best album of 2002. Everything about it is good. Perhaps the best part of this album, aside from the songwriting, which has never failed for these guys, is the experimentation. They still stay true to their trademark sound while also throwing in a bit of Queen and some classical music elements. This is probably the most original and fresh power metal album you'll find today, and every song (except Mies Del Dolor, a boring and unnecessary bonus track) is perfect.<br /><br />And now, of course, for the three highlights of the album: Track 2, \\"Battlefield,\\" features one of the quietest intros by the band, yet may be the heaviest BG song ever! Track 5, \\"The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight,\\" is a perfectly done ballad, and goes out with a bang. And actual closer \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" may be the GREATEST BLIND GUARDIAN SONG EVER!!!!!! Not only is the song a towering 14 minutes, 5 seconds, but it features one of the best intros, a little bit of all the principle elements of this album, and even a little bit of Celtic folk music thrown in to one segment of the song. Overall, the only track I don't care for is the bonus track, \\"Mies Del Dolor,\\" I never bother with bonus tracks anyways, most of the time. Anyways, if you like Blind Guardian, check out other power metal bands, such as Iced Earth, Demons & Wizards (a project from Hansi and Schaffer), Helloween, Edguy, Stratovarius, Nightwish, current Therion, Timo Kotipelto, and the Avantasia project.<br /><br />\\"We alone are fighting for metal that is TRUE, we own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you.\\"-Manowar
0425188809|5.0|Dean Koontz has written some excellent books and this is one of them. The suspense is tightly woven throughout this story. The two dogs - like yin and yang, darkness and light, good and evil - were both created for a purpose. One for superior intelligence and the other to kill. This is not a new plot, the handling of this plot is new. <br />  <br />Though you realize The \\"Outsider\\" is evil, a more appropriate name could not be found for this being, there is something else about it that you will come to discover. There is a scene that is heart rendering. Though the \\"Outsider\\" wants to kill the good dog, Einstein, at every opportunity, when it was in the laboratory site with Einstein, it sits with Einstein to watch Disney movies. The author handles this so well, that you feel sorrow for the \\"Outsider\\". You might want to shoot it, but you would likely shed some tears that you had to do so. It is what it is, not because it wanted to be, but because it was made to be by man. So a dichotomy exists - the desire to kill, then sitting quietly to watch Disney movies with its foe. Then too, it hates Einstein because it saw that Einstein was everything it could not be - Einstein was well loved for his beauty, for his gentle behavior. This spawned a deep jealousy that drove the \\"Outsider\\" to want to kill Einstein. The \\"Outsider\\" hated its own image, it was too gruesome to itself. So it acted its role well, the role of a super killer, yet it wanted the characteristics that made Einstein. There is pathos in this story by Koontz, one I cannot forget.  <br /> <br />The tense atmosphere is maintained throughout the story. You feel it, know the \\"Outsider\\" is coming. The \\"Outsider\\" stalks Einstein, it uses its powers, enhanced by man to make it a super efficient killing machine. Look! There in the darkness. Can you see it, can you see its glowing eyes? It is ready to pounce with all its super strength. A horrendous killer, yet you also remember it was made that way, created for that very purpose. You do not hate it, you hate its purpose. Here is the power of Koontz' story. <br /> <br />I ask myself how would I handle this type of story. I could never approach Koontz, he does it so well. He somehow captures two emotions for one being - hatred and sorrow. Then he blends these into a powerful story line you will not forget. I recommend this book to anyone who talks to me seriously about literature.  <br /> <br />In my rating system of 0 to E (lowest is zero, or not worth reading to E (excellent)), I gave this book an E. I do not do this for very many books, a atory has to capture my interest, maintain it, it must make me see or feel something I cannot forget, and then if I know I will remember that something, I give the book or short story my highest rating, E. Watchers is such a book, it is such a story. I highly recommend it. You will not forget this story.
1400049628|5.0|This is a witty, well-written book that appeals to people like myself who grew up fascinated with the classic zombie movies by Romero and Fulchi. As crazy as it sounds, I have played out many of the scenarios from this book in my mind, and it is written with a serious enough tone that it could almost be mistaken for reality. Although this is classified as a comedy, most of the humor is derived from inside jokes such as indirect references to classic zombie movies and little-known zombie facts. I loved the appendix which detailed the zombie incidents throughout history, and would love to see some kind of a followup book from Max Brooks on the same subject.
B000069CWE|5.0|A great cd, that is worth at least a listen to.  I was shocked after first listening to this.  In a way it's similiar to Hybrid Theory, but the tracks have been redone to produce some excellent music and vocals.  This album has a more influencial hip hop feel to it, but still maintains a rock background on some tracks.  After hearing Meteora, their album sounds much like Hybrid Theory, in that they didn't take their music more creatively bound, like they did with this cd.  I like all three, but maintain my stance that this one is overall their best.  I feel their music would be more successfully taken in the direction they went with this cd, then they had taken with Meteora.  Only because the type of production and effort put into this one was very creative, and had much more end potential.  In any case, with a mix of a few slow tracks, and remixed tracks from Hybrid Theory that will blow your mind, is totally worth every penney.  The cd is never boring, and you'll want to listen to every one of the 20 tracks listed on the album, enjoy!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love Star Wars (original movies)... I can't imagine why on Earth JAR JAR BINKS exclamation of \\"WESA FREE\\" is added to the end of Return of the Jedi.  I guess I am one of the few who are disillusioned with the Star Wars franchise... oh well...
B00008BXJJ|5.0|this double live album is just awsome i love it i listen to it everyday. ac/dc is the greatest rock band of all time. they have been through some ruff times in the past. but alltogether theyve pull'd through and made every effort to make music for us fans and release great albums. everyone of these songs just rock and they sound great for a live album. not alot of live albums i'd give 5 stars but this one i do. so for those about to rock to ac/dc i salute you.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just can't believe how Green Day keeps churning out great songs w/ the same three freakin' chords.  I've been a fan since Dookie and am simply amazed at how GD have grown up along with me.  This album grows on me more and more with each listen, and I can't stop listening.  I figure at this rate I'll propose to the CD by October.
B00005NEUF|5.0|Three cords and a whole lot of attitude!  That's rock and roll!  Forget what the critics may say and ignore any bad reviews you may read on this web site, The Strokes understand rock and roll.  Don't try to explain it, don't try to justify it, just turn up the volume and enjoy it.  'New York City Cops', 'The Modern Age', 'Last Nite', etc it doesn't get any better than this.  Perfect!
0393317552|4.0|This book shows how biogeography and environmental factors affect the development of human societies, not differences in intelligence and certainly not the intrinsic qualities of peoples of different skin colours and races. I was a reluctant reader of this book initially, thanks to the thickness of the book and the seemingly distant fields of knowledge touched on, such as, epidemiology and archeology. However, I was proven wrong. <br /> <br />The writer employs lucid writing to explain how archaelogical evidence actually point to the fact that all of us originate from the African continent. After our ancestors migrated to various parts of the globe, their destinies were affected by geographical factors, which in turn affected their abilities to form organized government, manufacture sophisticated weapons, procure food and develop writing. Interspersed with diagrams, tables, maps and picture of aborigines, the book convincingly demolishes the grounds for racist theories by relying heavily on scientific evidence.  <br /> <br />The book is simple enough for readers with no background information at all to understand it, yet comprehensive enough in its coverage to satisfy the needs of more seasoned readers. Do not let the thickness of the book set you back, for the knowledge gained from reading it will prove worthwhile.  <br /> <br />p/s: it's short of being awarded five stars because it can get quite repetitive at times.
B00008WT5M|5.0|this is the best album to me that ac/dc did in the 1990's there were other good ones the few they made then. just as now. my thoughts of this album are for sure 5 stars plus and then some. everysong on this album razor's edge, is awsome they just rock from start to finish. this is how i rank them thunder struck' fire your guns'are you ready' razors edge' got you by the balls' if you dare'money talks' rock your heart out' mistress for christmas' shot of love' goodbye and badluck' lets makeit'but no matter how you would list them they are still all great songs. and they rock.

B000286S8S|2.0|Sammy as a single artist is crap.  Apart from DLR performing with some of the best guitarists in the world like me, I must admit he IS Van Halen!  Sammy Hagar is boring.  His voice is boring, his lyrics are boring and non inventive, how many time does he have to sing 'stormy weather' for f***s sake?  The music changed into poppy dull crap when Roth left because we had to tune up one step  We shouldn't of taken on a singer who's career was just about past it's sell by date.  Dave Lee Roth should be put back in this band as soon as possible, I'm gonna talk to Alex about it.  Only nerds can be into Hagar.  Hagar should retire, something that he should of done 20 years ago.  Yer, lets get ROTH Back!!!
B00028HBKM|1.0|I rented this movie undeterred by the negative reviews regarding too much violence that I had heard from friends. After all, I thought depictions of graphic violence would help illustrate how horrible the crucifixion was. Unfortunately graphic violence alone isn't enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.  <br /> <br />The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is. For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary. All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot. In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me. I couldn't help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood (based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged) and the beatings he took about the head, that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain. The few, brief scenes which didn't involve Jesus' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion. These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with, and the dull, monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life. The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly. How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.  <br /> <br />A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth. The only objection I have heard about Jesus of Nazareth is that Jesus is played by a non-Jew with blue eyes. If you can't get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise, charismatic, and loving entity Jesus was. Brilliant performances combined with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack make the crucifixion scenes in Jesus of Nazareth carry far more emotion impact than the passion of the Christ did.
B000002KCC|5.0|This record is obviously a fantastic achievement, and I'm sure other reviewers have pointed out just how good it is. However, I don't really see it as the 'so raw it's unlistenable' record it's made out to be (and neither is the equally great, but short 'Time Fades Away') Sure, Neil's singing is a bit pained at times (rarely do you hear a singer who seems to mean what he's singing as much as you believe Neil, here) Some tracks are like 3am versions of what you wight find on Harvest (Borrowed Tune), and others are just good times Crazy Horse rockers, like Come on Baby... (I'm sure Neil found the time very painful, though!) Whilst a weary, drunken resigned feeling lurks over the album, this is hardly like listening to Joy Division. Alberquerque is just beautiful, and I'm sure fans of Neil's softer albums will find much to like here. Likewise, there are plenty of tracks that will appeal to 'hardcore' Neil Young fans.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I encourage people to listen to the entire cd at first in one sitting.  There are two nine minute tracks that have amazing style changes throughout them.  There are slower songs, faster songs, everything to make for a good listen.  If you've liked any Green Day album from 1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours to Warning, you'll certainly love this one.  A matured sound, and a wonderful album.  Good work boys!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day first exploded into the mainstream scene with 1994's \\"Dookie\\" which was an amazing display of 3-chord punk paired perfectly with angsty lyrics. 2004's \\"American Idiot\\" is no \\"Dookie\\", but it comes pretty close. A departure from their usual sound, Green Day's American Idiot is a \\"rock opera\\" that presents its listeners with a storyline complete with a complex, confused character. This character has different sides to him, namely: Jesus of Suburbia - the introverted, \\"follow the rules\\" kid who is confused by the messages in society and St. Jimmy - the apathetic, f*** you, punk kid who is tired of not finding anything that he can relate to or that makes his life worth living.  <br />Reminiscent of their pop/punk sound are songs like the first single and the cd's title track, \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"St. Jimmy.\\" Tracks such as \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" (a personal favorite) and \\"Wake Me up when September Ends\\" exhibit an emotionally heavier side to the album, especially with `September' paying homage to Billie Joe's father who passed away when he was ten years old. A unique component to the album is the sub-songs. Within \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are smaller songs that are denoted by roman numerals and distinct titles. These songs are important to the evolution of the central character. Billie Joe Armstrong is an incredible lyricist who delivers depth, informed social/political commentary, and heartfelt words to infectious melodies. \\"American Idiot\\" is an album that can be listened to straight through, which in this period of disposable popular music, is a great feat. Even if I was not a dedicated Green Day fan, I could tell this is one of the most significant albums to come along in awhile. <br />
B0000VCZK2|4.0|The packaging on this DVD set is not perfect, but the abundance of \\"Extras\\" is astounding.  The interviews and documentaries where incredible, taking their time, and being a very thorough dissection of the events and decisions leading up to the ultimate theatrical releases of each of the movies.  I found the making of Alien and Alien 3 the most interesting of the documentaries.   <br /> <br />Of course, I have a bias towards liking the documentary for Alien because it is by far my favorite of the four movies, but Alien 3's was equally interesting because it showed the corporate decisions that hindered the ability for David Fincher, in my opinion one of the great cinematic directors today, from making a movie that could captivate its audience.  True, Alien 3 didn't live up to it's genre expectations-true, it wasn't scary, but it was a visual treat and the mood and desolate atmosphere invoked by the movie is notable.  I think in time, people will come to regard it as an sci-fi art film-certainly not the best Alien film if you're a sci-fi or horror buff, but in my opinion shouldn't be written off as an awful film (and I'm very picky). <br /> <br />The special editions of each of the movies where better than the theatrical releases, except Alien Resurrection which was more interesting than wholly necessary. Although Alien's theatrical release wasn't as good as the special edition, I prefer it because I like the long meandering shots that Ridley had of the ships (notably missing in the SE version) as it adds a emptiness to the feel of the ship-space is supposed to be cold and quiet. <br /> <br />This is my judgement of the four movies (special editions): <br /> <br />1) Alien - Perfect and brilliant.  The new shots of the Alien are great if suttle. <br />2) Aliens - One of the best action movies ever. The additional scenes interrupt the tension a little and make the movie really long, but still very much enjoyable. <br />3) Alien 3 - Gothic and somewhat depressing, but is interesting despite not being truly frightening-it's hard to care for murderers and rapists being picked off by a dog-like alien.  Fincher scenes Fincher was forced to take out really helped the movie a great deal.  The SE version is better than the Theatrical Release. <br />4) Alien 4 - Designed for Teenagers.  This feels the most like a Holliwood movie with one liners that the first Alien movie would dare use-almost a parady of itself.  It makes a good summer flick, but not exactly repeatable, and definitely pales in comparison to the first and second, and even the third. <br /> <br />The Worst parts of all 4 movies put together would still be like Citizen Cane compared the abortion of a movie, Paul Anderson put out this summer \\"Alien Vs. Predator\\"
B000002A3T|4.0|Any group with a catalog that includes albums such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" along with their numerous other releases will forever have to live up to that reputation.  In the hands of other groups \\"The Division Bell\\" would be considered a high-water mark in their repertoire; in the hands of Pink Floyd this is just another competent, beautiful album.<br /><br />The album opens with the instrumental \\"Cluster One,\\" featuring the sounds of Mother Earth herself.  The music is quiet, thoughtful, an introspective introduction that provides a flavor of things to come, and perhaps reminds you that this CD is a Pink Floyd CD; you can expect art, a touch of this, a touch of that, and it will be tinged with progressive elements.<br /><br />The stronger elements of \\"What Do You Want from Me\\" contrast nicely with the opening piece.  The song has elements that date back to \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  While the work breaks little new ground for Floyd, it is the reliability and quality of the music and lyrics that make it so addictive.  This music is the same while being different.  Those contrasting guitar chords are so Floyd.  \\"Poles Apart\\" follows in a similar vein.  However, the power of the lyrics of \\"Poles Apart\\" pulls you into the imagery painted by the combination of the music and lyrics.  Once again the keyboards reminded me of \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"Marooned,\\" is okay.  This instrumental track may fit with the theme of the introduction, but is otherwise uninspired.  The instrumental is pleasant and mellow, an accompaniment to floating clouds and mellow water surrounded by whispering spring trees; music to get dreamy by.<br /><br />I have allowed myself to be influenced by another reviewer who stated that David Gilmour took the opportunity to get a few digs at Roger Waters in this CD.  At first I heard the lyrics of \\"A Great Day for Freedom\\" as relating to the breaking down of barriers between East and West at the end of the cold war.  Multiple listening now convinces me that the song has more to do with the departure of Roger Waters than anything else.  The music is mellow and good, but to use the lyrics as may have been done distracts from my enjoyment of a musically good song.<br /><br />While the music of \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\" starts with a jazz flavor, or may even remind a listener of Vangelis' \\"Blade Runner\\" music, the lyrics are surreal and hint at paranoia and being left out.  Richard Wright's music retains only a hint of Pink Floyd's usual musical style and while the change in flavor may provide some needed variation, the variation is also noticeable to a focused listener.  This track is one of my less favorite on this CD.<br /><br />I like the music and the lyrics of \\"Take It Back.\\"  There is a strong pop beat to this song, but it is so listenable and the lyrics are complex so that it is an enjoyable song.  My only objection is the pop-like repetitive lyric at the end of the song.  The harmony is well done, but the repetition is annoying.<br /><br />The lyrics of \\"Coming Back to Life\\" are evocative.  The song is a lament, and a seeking, and a journey, and a vision, an ending and a new beginning.  It is amazing that David Gilmour managed to squeeze so much into the sparse lyrics of this song.  While this song retains some of the pop flavor of \\"Take It Back,\\" the lyrics will challenge an analytical listener and turns what could have been a mundane song into a good listen.<br /><br />\\"Keep Talking\\" uses a bit of a gimmick with the synthesized voice of physicist, cosmologist and author Stephen Hawking used at several places in the song.  I like this song with its Pink Floyd style.  However, I keep thinking that this song sounds similar in places to another song I heard on an early Pink Floyd album; I am just unable to pinpoint the song.  Perhaps the style is so strongly similar to early Pink Floyd that I keep thinking this is a song from \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"<br /><br />The song \\"Lost for Words\\" is a song of frustration.  How can you help overcome the differences between you and those who may be your enemies?  This song really has no answer to the question, but how many songs of any genre use the words \\"doldrums\\" and \\"cauldron,\\" particularly in the same song?  For a while the vocals have a bit of a Bob Dylan feel to them, particularly in the opening stanza.  Later we hear the sound of a boxing match in the bridge leading into a stronger, more Floyd style vocal.  This song also contains a four-letter word that I am unable to recall having seen in a Pink Floyd song.  I was a bit surprised by the inclusion, though it fits well with the theme.<br /><br />The last track, \\"High Hopes,\\" is my favorite on this CD.  It is progressive and strong and a wonderful way to finish off a CD.  My opinion of this CD was strongly flavored by this last track that contains so many musical elements.  The song in introduced with bells and a haunting piano.  The initial vocals are dark and plaintive.  The lyrics are full of unrealized futures and lost pasts, a feeling that we are coming to the end.  The tolling of bells and the heavy bass are sad and nostalgic, and while it would be easy to accept the end as depressing, it is the well-executed artistry of this song that makes me happy rather than the sadness of the song.  I hope for a return of Floyd.<br /><br />This solid CD is a worthy addition to Pink Floyd's catalog.  We can only hope that there might yet be something released in the future from this ground-breaking and influential group.ng from \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" <br /> <br />The song \\"Lost for Words\\" is a song of frustration.

B0002OERI0|3.0|Green Day's Masterpiece?!?! I sure as hell hope not. This may sound cheesy, but I hadn't known s**t about GD until an episode of \\"O'grady\\" showcased their radio-hit \\"waiting\\". In love with the 15 second clip i had just heard, I rushed out the next day to buy International Superhits. I couldn't believe how long I'd passed up on such a great band. Every song was catchy, with just the right ammount of variation to set it apart from other pop-punk acts. After weeks of listening to ISH, I couldn't wait for AI to come out. I had heard the single (title track) and not been too impressed, but i figured maybe the rest of the album would be better. Well, lets just say it was and it wasn't...Tracks 2 and 12 were WAY TOO LONG, track 8 (my favorite) was too short and the rest just kinda sounded generic (with 4 ,5 and 7 being mild exceptions). The idea behind the rock opera theme is genius, i won't take that away, but I found out its just not for me. That being said, I'd still recommend this album to any pop-punk fan with an open mind...

B00000373U|5.0|As we're bearing down on the relase date for \\"From a basement on the Hill,\\" I thought it might be time to put in my say concerning this, my favorite album from everyone's favorite Fool on the Hill...<br /><br />Subtle chord changes, the occasional drums and backing instruments. If you prefer, as I do, stripped down Elliott (the KRS albums) to full on Beatles-orchestration-bandleader Elliott (the Dreamworks) then this is your album. It holds together more cohesively than his previous, self-titled release.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I think Elliott never put out a perfect release. But his flaws are perfect in their way... Kinda like his buterfly wings voice, so apparently frail on the surface: haunting and fluttering- always on the verge of sounding like he was about to slip off-key... but he never did...<br /><br />Truth be told- There's a couple of songs on this that I can't stand, skip 'em every time. But the ones that I love (Between the Bars, Alameda, Speed trials, Angeles, Pictures of me, 2:45, The morning after, and especially No Name #6) are all among not only my hands-down Elliott picks but are also some of my most favorite songs, period. 'Between the Bars' alone would be worth this, easily one of the most achingly soulful, sad, sad songs ever to take shape in the human soul.<br /><br />This stands firmly poised on the precipice, intimating the tempestuous break from KRS and the switch to Dreamworks, right around all that Good Will Hunting madness... The answers may not be forthcoming on the why and how of Mr. Smith's demise. resign yourself to it. We can only guess at the inner workings of this guy- peering in through the windows he's left us. This is my favorite room, looking in.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|This is a wonderful final release from Joe and his pesky meskies. I, like most people who love the Clash and rock'n'roll, were very upset and hurt when Joe Strummer died. When I found out that this record had been released, I raced out and bought it. And, I must say, this is probably the best Mescaleros album. \\"Coma Girl\\" just blows me away, \\"Gets Down Moses\\" has one of the best raggae beats Joe's ever done, and his cover of Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\" is amazing, and the rest of the album shines as well. Go out and buy this album, and listen to the swansong of a Rock N' Roll legend!!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This movie is first off, one of the best vampire movies I have watched recently. This is leaving out the point which the plot is about vampires hunting down the remainder of the Lycans(werewolves). Kate Beckinsale is an absolutly amazing actress. This was the first movie which I have seen that she was in. Her part in this movie is as a Death Dealer is an extremely serious role. I do not believe she smiles even once. That takes a great skill. Back to the movie. It is about a vampire who falls in love with a human. This human, Michael, is bitten by a werewolf and begins to see flashbacks of memories of the strongest Lycan. This werewolf's name was Lucian. As Selene(Kate Beckinsale) tries to help Michael....Just buy the movie already. No dissappointment guaranteed.(For a good laugh, look at Lucian's face when Michael has his flashback at the Lycan's dwelling!)
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm not really a big fan of the term \\"special edition\\". It's usually a quick cash-grab to get people to buy the DVD/see the movie in theatres only to be cheapened. Before 1997, Fox released the THX enhanced versions of the trilogy. This was literally the last time you'd see the trilogy in its original form.  Couple years later, the special editions came out. George Lucas has been saying all the time that the films he made near 30 years ago were not his \\"vision\\" so he made some changes: some good, some bad but I didn't complain because I had the original THX ones and the special ones. Then the DVD set is released...and it's only the special editions? WTF? <br /> <br />The films are timeless. The first film has a bit of a slow first half to me, the second is definately the best and the third is uneven but still good. Some of the changes are for the better though. That pink looking fudge under the landspeeder is gone, no more transparent snowspeeder and the Sarlacc pit actually has a monster rather than some hole with couple tentacles and spikes. The lightsabers have been refined a bit(although some of the colors change like when Luke practices on the ship it's green, yet later when he has the helmet on it's white?) and the Death Star explosions have a cool looking ring. As for the bad? Oh boy. <br /> <br />Greedo still shoots first but it's not as jerky but still LOOKS odd. Jabba in the hanger is still in there but I think he made a better impact in film 3. They changed Boba Fett's voice and it sucks. And of course Hayden Christensen(Anakin in new films) replaces Sebastian Shaw as the ghost at the end of Jedi. <br /> <br />For people who grew up with the 70-80's versions, these changes seem very out of place. In the end, they are his movies, his stories and he can do whatever the hell he wants. But sadly, the reason why he's a big name in the first place is not his improved films but the originals and thinks that's what we want. The Lion King dvd has the OPTION to watch either the special edition(it's only just a crappy song) or the original theatrical version...couldn't Lucasfilm have done that? I keep getting the feeling that the only reason he's doing this is to make it connect with the new trilogy and he otherwise probably wouldn't have bothered changing unless he didn't make the trilogy. <br /> <br />As for the extras? VERY nice. First up is the big documentary(I'm talking over 2 hours) on the entire making of the Star Wars films. Very good, although you might've seen it recently on tv. Then there's the characters and a feature on the lightsabers. There's also your typical butt-kissing feature where well-known directors praise the film. The transfers of the films are excellent as they progress better and better with each new film and the sound is great. <br /> <br />It's hard reviewing this. On one hand, you have 3 classic films that are nose deep in pop culture yet at the same time it doesn't feel like my Star Wars. But if you want these films on dvd then you'll have to settle with these which isn't a bad thing mind you.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Finally on DVD.  I'm thrilled, which is more than I can say for some of the other customers reviewing this grand series on this site.  For all you hard-hearts out there, listen to yourselves:  you are complaining about the Star Wars trilogy being released on DVD, with beautiful color, and ample bonus features.  On DVD.  Think about it.<br />And speaking of which, I'm not sure why the customer who rants about Star Wars being a LOTR rip-off is so angry.  Certainly there are similarities like say the \\"good vesus evil\\" theme.  But to say that George Lucas is a thief?  Ouch.  This is a space western, pure and simple.  If anything is a rip-off of LOTR, it's Harry Potter, despite it being enjoyable in it's own right.  Come on, the gigantic spider?  Professor Dumbledore?  Dobby the house elf? <br />However original a person's idea for a story is, there is ALWAYS going to be something that influenced it.  Something it resembles.  And speaking of LOTR, let's look at the rise and fall of the Third Reich shall we.  Don't even get me started on the Hitler/Sauron comparisons.  It's sheer genius, really.<br />Let's enjoy our time.  Star Wars, Empire and Jedi.  On DVD at last. . .
B0000075ZB|5.0|I wish this album was still in print in America. However,there are used copies for sale where compact discs are sold. They could also be found in thrift stores. This 1982 album is another incredible production by The Bee Gees. The title track,a Bee Gees composition,is the biggest hit from this album. It would be covered by the Bee Gees themselves in 2001 for THEIR GREATEST HITS-THE RECORD. Another hit from this album,this one minor,is TAKE THE SHORT WAY HOME. OUR DAY WILL COME is a non-Bee Gees cover,written and first recorded in the sixties. The Boneroo Horns are heard on several tracks. The brass ensemble began working with the Bee Gees in 1976. The title track also appeared on the various artists album SOUL OF THE BEE GEES,and on Warwick's later compilations. Also what's out of print in America is Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album,another Bee Gees production following this one. Barbra Streisand's 1980 album,GUILTY,another Bee Gees production is still in print. Obviously,that album's sales record is still very good after its being on the American market for 24 years.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Nelly just as much as the next guy, but the entire pimped-out hustla, gangsta/wanksta club anthem rap has been entirely over done. The entire rap genre seemed to be destined to being nothing more than 50 Cent, that is until Kanye dropped this album. The production values are amazing, every track could easily become a single. From \\"We Don't Care\\" to \\"Last Call,\\" Kanye takes his listeners on an awfully personal tour through his mind and soul. The only complant I might have is that there were a few too many skits. But other than that, it is a flawless album. Without a doubt, \\"College Dropout\\" is the finest freshman album ever, any genre or artist. With Jay-Z's retirement now offical, Kanye has stepped up to the plate and made it so the ROC will be a force in music for many more years. I can't wait for his second album.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I don't know about anyone else, but this series of films, for me defines my childhood.  EVERY recess during school was filled with recreations of the Star Wars stories by my friends and I.  We PLAYED with the action figures until their joints were so loose they could be used for puppets.  We READ everything we could get our hands on.  We dressed up for Halloween and went trick-or-treating as 4 little Princess Leia's.  How is it possible that these movies finally being released on DVD can be disappointing?  They captured my imagination and my attention as a child.  And now, as an adult, I have the thrill of sharing that magical experience with my own children.  On DVD.  Let the 400th viewing begin!
B00028HBKM|1.0|The first third of this movie is wonderful. The direction is nice, the visual and special effects are artful and the acting is adequate. However, as soon as the movie begins to show the lashing of Jesus, it dwindles into an overblown sado-masochist fantasy. I know the bible and the time period well, and there is absolutely zero reason to believe that this is a realistic depiction of how the christ was tortured, Yes, he was tortured, but The Passion shows Jesus enduring treatment that would have killed any living creature within the first ten minutes. You could see Jesus's ribs, for God's sake! <br /> <br />During and after the flogging, the worst that can happen does. I began counting the lashes, but lost count after 80-something, which is more than double what the Bible states Jesus was given. PLus, every time the man falls while carrying his cross, the cross falls on his back or he falls onto a sharp rock-any living creature would have long been dead, but Gibson carried it out for shock value. What could have been dramatic effect if used sparingly became an orgiastic festival of gore and violence. <br /> <br />In the hands of an unbiased director, this would have been one of the best films I've seen in years, but Gibson let his own passion blind him. I could practically hear Mel offscreen yelling, \\"Yes! More blood! More! MORE!!!\\" <br /> <br />Still, those who want to believe this is \\"realistic\\" will do so regardless of reality. My suggestion would be to watch the first 45 minutes or so, then stop when the flogging begins.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Great PPV.  Probably the most anticipated PPV in history.  Unfortunately, it was hyped up so much, the expectations were huge. It was disappointing, just because of the hype, but still an amazing event.  The DVD is actually a 2 disk set. <br /> <br />Watch the intro at the beginning.  All WWE PPV's intros are good, but Wrestlemania has the best one. <br /> <br />1. Big Show vs. John Cena (U.S. Title) <br />Good way to start off the show.  Cena really got the crowd going.  Decent match between these two.  (7.5/10) <br /> <br />2. Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs. Dudley Boys vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrioson Cade vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles/Fatal Fourway) <br />It is the better of the two tag title matches, but it is not that good.  It could have been, but it was a little too short.  Half of these guys are now on Smackdown.  It was nice of Vince to try to fit everyone into the show.  (7/10) <br /> <br />3. Chris Jericho vs. Christian <br />These two built up a great fued.  Great match.  Second best of the night.  There are some pretty sick spots in the match.  Jericho puts the \\"Walls of Jericho\\" on Christian and eventually keeps the hold all the way out onto the arena floor.  Trish Stratus makes an appearance.  Shocking ending.  (9/10) <br /> <br />4. Evolution vs. Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Handicap Match) <br />This match was put together to get The Rock and Flair into a match at this event.  Otherwise, it would have been Foley/Orton.  Good match.  The Rock and Flair put on great performances.  Surprising ending.  It comes out of nowhere.  (7.5/10) <br /> <br />5. Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie (Evening Gown Match) <br />Very disappointing.  I thought there would be a lot more to this match.  (4/10) <br /> <br />6. Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Title) <br />Participants included Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero, Ultimo Ultimo Dragon, Jamie Noble, Billy Kidman, Shannon Moore, Nunzio, Funaki, Akio, & Tajiri.  There are a lot of sick spots in this match, especially the Shooting Star Press by Billy Kidman off the middle of the top rope to the arena floor.  Unfortunatley, it is a short match and the wrestlers are not in the ring that long.  (8.5/10) <br /> <br />7. Goldberg vs. Lesnar (Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee) <br />This match was so hyped up and ended up being awful.  It was Lesnar and Goldber's last match in the WWE and one of Austin's last appearance.  The crowd made the match by ripping on Lesnar calling him a \\"sellout\\" for leaving for the NFL.  Horrible match.  (3/10) <br /> <br />8. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Basham Brothers vs. APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Title/Fatal Fourway) <br />Not a very good match. Just an attempt to get all these guys on the show.  (6/10) <br /> <br />9. Victoria vs. Molly Holly (Women's Title/If Molly Loses, She Has To Shave Her Head) <br />Not the best match, but good ending.  I don't want to tell you what happens.  (3/10) <br /> <br />10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Title) <br />I thought this match was going to be one of the best in a while.  It was a little disappointing, but it was only that reason because Angle was hurt and he never revealed it until after the show.  It was still a good match.  The crowd was really into it.  The end is terrible.  (9/10) <br /> <br />11. Kane vs. Undertaker <br />This match marked the return of the Undertaker as the Deadman.  Nobodby really cared about the match, they just wanted to see Taker.  Amazing entrance.  It is one of the most surreal moments you will ever see.  The crowd goes crazy.  Not the best match, but it is worth it for the entrance.  (6/10) <br /> <br />12. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat) <br />Great match.  Best match of the year so far.  They say it may be the best main event in WWE history.  Fantastic, fast paced match with a lot of emotions.  Great spots with HBK doing a Moonsault off the top turnbuckle to the arena floor.  Anothersick spot with the double suplex on Benoit through the announce table.  Amazing ending, with a lot of near falls and high emotions.  Great energy in the match.  (9.5/10) <br /> <br />As I said, this is a 3 disk set.  Some of the best extras is the special hosted by Flair which featured highlights of the top ten matches in 'Mania history as voted by the wrestlers.  Definately watch the movie of Wrestlemania 19, especially the Angle/Lesnar segment and The Rock/Austin segment.  They are both very, very emotional, especially Austin/The Rock segment. <br /> <br />Definatley buy this DVD, it is worth it for the extras alone.  <br /> <br />Overall Rating:  9/10
B00003CXCT|3.0|Overall the movies are great, the remastered versions are visually spectacular.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers here I did see the orginals in the theaters and I for one miss them.<br /><br />The added scenes and music I find distracting, they are easy to spot, I believe that one that has not seen the orginals could spot the changes, to me thats not good. Lucas it seems has tried to make parts of the movies more child friendly, example the music in Return of the Jedi and the addition of background singers with a comic flare.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to trade this set in for a set of the orginals, they are the true classics.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I bought this CD because I wanted to see what it would sound like. Well, this is different, but it still seems like she is recording the music that other people want her to. It does not sound like \\"Britney's music\\", but \\"Jive Records\\" music. I think if they threw Britney in the studio and let her do whatever she wanted, it would be a lot better than \\"Me Against The Music\\" and 8 other songs on this CD. When I first heard \\"Toxic\\", I did not like it, but it is the best song on the CD and one of the best pop songs of the year. I think Britney should reevaulate her career and then try recording a good album.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|I am not a hardcore fan of ZZ Top, but there are more than a few songs that made this a must buy purchase for me. Although I was familiar with and like some their early hits like \\"La Grange,\\" \\"Tush,\\" and \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" it was not until buying their multimillion selling \\"Eliminator\\" in 1993 that I started to get into them. I know that some longtime fans disliked it when ZZ Top glossed up their sound with synthesizers, but to me that's exactly when they found their niche. Although I'll get shot by some for writing this, when I am in the mood for something more traditionally bluesy, my first instinct is to go to Stevie Ray Vaughn and not early ZZ Top. They followed \\"Eliminator\\" in 1985 with the release of the equally addictive \\"Afterburner,\\" which includes the massive hit \\"Roughboy,\\" which may not be the greatest ZZ Top song in the mind of purists, but I could listen to it forever. The same goes for \\"Stages,\\" \\"Pearl Necklace,\\" \\"Sleeping Bag,' just to name a few.<br /><br />This 2 Disc compilation is sequenced chronologically and breaks down the group's hits into their pre-synth and post-synth periods and it seems to hit all the right notes. Some have correctly mentioned that the last 3 selections on Disc 2 are absolutely unnecessary (these include a second version of \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" (Live), and remixed/dance versions \\"Legs\\" and \\"Velcro Fly,\\" which are already in the collection in their much better original versions) and that by not having them, it could have left room for other songs that may be missing.<br /><br />If you only like the pre or post synth ZZ Top, you may find yourself disappointed by this selection, but in all fairness it represents their very best and both periods produced worthwhile material. I wound up making a 1 Disc personal version that took what I thought was the very best for me and I am loving it. Almost of the hits are here and if that is what you are looking for, you could do a lot worse. Also, this collection has good inserts that give new fans and may remind some older fans of how these guys got to where they are. I do wish that they would have gotten into some of the behind the song stuff, but it's not a must for any collection. I give this collection a solid 4 stars for its thoroughness, great remastering, and just because I finally have some of my favorites in one place. The 1 point penalty is for the shoddy 3 song choices on Disc 2, but I can live with it now that I have made my own version as I never want to hear these remixes again.at give new fans and may remind some older fans of how these guys got to where they are.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|This CD is very good. When her debut CD \\"Songs In A Minor\\" was released in 2001, there were only 5 songs on that CD that stood out to me. With \\"Diary Of Alicia Keys\\", I like almost every song. Sometimes, it seems her vocals are a little weak, but the music is good. Stand out tracks: <br />If I Ain't Got You <br />Karma <br />Dragon Days <br />Diary <br />You Don't Know My Name (sick of this song now after they played it every 5 minutes) <br />My Boo (soon to be on the special edition album) is not that great of a song. Usher and Alicia are just trying to make money off of each other, and that is a smart business move.
0393035158|5.0|I was struck today by a classic case of cognitive (and temporal) dissonance the author would surely appreciate: The barbarity of beheadings posted by the barbarians themselves on the Internet.    Sam Harris, in his book The End of Faith, speaks of how we almost have a time portal to the Dark Ages in this kind of barbarism in the modern day. Sam is, if nothing else, an iconoclast who left political correctness far behind, with no apologies. He is also a lucid and fearless thinker. I'm sure, given the sacred cows he slays in this book, that reviews run the gamut from effusive praise to bitter invective. Exactly what one might expect.    I found the book to be almost two books intermingled. On the one hand he analyzes and mercilessly exposes organized religion and its manifold effects on our society, particularly in regard to our politics. The chapters and chapter sections dealing with these issues stand on their own as models of frankness and insight. Other sections of the book get much more esoteric, exploring the nature of belief, consciousness, and brain/soul concepts. Some will find the revelation at the end of the book that the author is (or has been) a practitioner of meditation modeled on what sounds like Zen or the like to be a convenient excuse to dismiss earlier material which may have made them decidedly uncomfortable. He does, after all, rake religious moderates somewhat mercilessly over the coals.    I suppose I may have found this book more perspicacious than many other readers might because I not only deeply investigated Christianity subsequent to my Catholic upbringing, but also read extensively on mysticism (including Christian mysticism) and Buddhism. And like Sam, I also practiced Zen meditation for a considerable length of time. One thing he fails to mention in arguing that this is not a religion per se but simply a technique is that Zen monks have been giving lessons in meditation for many years now to Christian monastic communities, ever since Thomas Merton broke the ice and revealed the value of such techniques to would-be mystics of all stripes. While admitting that many of the world's Buddhists are no more mystics than your run-of-the-mill Christian, he correctly points out that the readily accessible portions of Buddhism which focus on meditation are in a completely different category than the organized religions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism (and Hinduism, which he mentions more or less in passing).    There is a great critique of the War on Drugs about halfway through the book, which one hopes will be reprinted for a much wider audience. He makes the point that our nation's collection of victimless crimes are, in fact, political manifestations of the urge to stamp out sin, despite the fact that many of them cannot by any sane person be construed to contribute to the detriment of society. And by those which our society accepts and condones we uncharacteristically admit his thesis, slapping what are commonly called \\"sin taxes\\" on them (cigarettes, alcohol, etc.)    Harris takes moralists to task with well-deserved condemnation of the self-righteous notion that ethical behavior can spring only from religious fervor. Indeed, he has two chapters on the history of Islam and Christianity which clearly show that unbelievable amounts of wildly unethical behavior have sprung from just such fervor, and continue to do so today. His urgent contention is that religious extremism is incredibly dangerous in the world of modern weaponry, and that the very concept of irrational faith must be replaced by rationalism if we are to survive as a species.    The touchy-feely notion that religion should be off limits to pointed criticism, and that all religions are, at their core, inspirational and tolerant, is brought crashing to the ground by Harris' sublime reasoning and mountains of evidence. I kept wanting to underline passages to share with friends and family, such as when he's discussing the idea of beliefs basedon nothing more solid than other people's beliefs, with no concrete evidence whatsoever. He points out that if such beliefs were held by a small number of people they would certainly be considered delusional, but since they are held by millions they're instead respected as sacred. \\"There is sanity in numbers,\\" he writes.    Indeed, it's been a pet peeve of mine for ages that people justify unfounded belief based on nothing but the number of other deluded souls who believe the same thing they do. Is it not glaringly obvious that such appeals to a belief's validity based on the number of believers can be used by a vast body of other believers who believe something at odds with that? \\"Our situation is this: most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility.\\" Tell it like it is, Sam.    One cannot, alas, come away from this book with an optimistic glow. Hopefully the reader will be bold enough to confront his or her own beliefs in the light of reason, and admit of irrational belief and behavior in their own past and/or present. There is certainly ample material here to promote self-examination. The very idea that billions of people will question their faith to this point, however, is beyond the realm of possibility. Sam Harris is dropping a much-needed pebble of reason into the pool of irrational certitude, and one can only hope that the ripples might be noticed and propagated by countless others.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce's solo debut 'Dangerously In Love' is great R&B album with something for everyone. She starts the album off with \\"Crazy In Love\\" with boyfriend Jay Z which was a summer anthem on radio, then she goes into her other hit singles \\"Baby Boy\\" with Sean Paul and \\"Naughty Girl\\". I like when Beyonce slows it down and just uses the music. \\"Me,Myself,& I\\" is a catchy song that a lot of people can relate to. \\"Signs\\" with Missy Elliot tells about astrology signs. Interesting song (b/c produced by Missy). \\"Hip Hop Star\\" is a funky, ROCK STAR type song with Big Boi (Outkast) and Sleepy Brown. On so many songs, Sleepy Brown is unneeded (listen to this song), but Big Boi adds some fire to the song. Overall, this is great CD to add to your collection.
B000002UA5|3.0|The studio part is halfassed drivel that only King Crimson at their absolute worst (\\"Thrakattak\\", the worst parts of \\"Lizard\\" and \\"Islands\\") can exceed in terms of pretentious, stupid, ass-holy and pretty amusical pompousness. Waters' long, soft, hypnotic folkish number, \\"Grantchester Meadows\\", is beautiful, but it's the only thing on the second disc that doesn't make me want to get a splitting headache. The first disc - the live half - is amazing, though. David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Rick Wright, and Nick Mason were unbelievable live, clearly (although Mason still needed to work some things out - his drumming on \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is really amateurish). Wright plays trancelike, completely psychedelic, Eastern-influenced organ solos, while Gilmour makes avant-garde noises and Waters hacks away at his heavy bass. Fun, fun stuff! All four live numbers here completely blow away their studio counterparts. \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\" is brilliant in its' mathematical buildup towards a perfect slasher-movie climax and then going back to its' eerie beginnings. Very bizarre, but rewarding modal/free improvisations within a rock context by psychedelic punks who shied this line of incompetent on their instruments! Yes! Well, ok, Gilmour was very good at his instrument, but Wright seems to have difficulty holding down chords (even though he sounds great), and no one ever accused Waters of being the world's best bassist (although he's much better than many say he is). Overall, very, very cool to smoke out to - except the studio wankery would sound just as terrible high. God, the studio half is retch-worthy, but the live half kicks ass!
B0001AP12G|4.0|After hearing to \\"Through The Wire\\", I had to go pick up the CD. Unlike P.Diddy, Kanye uses samples well. \\"All Falls Down\\", \\"Through The Wire\\", & \\"Spaceship\\", \\"Slow Jamz\\"-just to name a few. He took Lauryn Hill's acoustic song and turned it into a great hit \\"All Falls Down\\". \\"Jesus Walks\\" is one of the best songs on the CD-because he came out with a secular song about Jesus and it was a hit on radio-not gospel radio, but secular stations. He had people chanting \\"Jesus walks\\" and that in itself is powerful.I like how his music is so real and socially aware. It is also an entertaining CD- \\"New Workout Plan\\" is a funny song that really doesn't fit this album.  Overall, a good debut.
0062502182|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Written in a poetic way, it is a beautiful tale of a boy who has some doubts about following his dream. The world he lives in is a combination of realistic and mystic. I agree there are some vagueness and oversimplifying, but in my opinion that's what makes the book a good fantasy story.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is her best (thus far). Christina threw away all the \\"pop tart\\", \\"pop princess\\" persona and made great music. <br />\\"Fighter\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Walk Away\\" (BEST SONG on CD), \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\" are my favorites. She has great vocal skills and uses them on this album. It was released in October 2002, but I can still put it in the CD player and listen.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a videophile first and a Star Wars fanatic second. I have a high-end home theater (CRT Front projector with 120\\" screen) which is themed after Star Wars. <br /> <br />For many years I have been suffering with the Special Edition Laserdisc versions of these movies. The quality of the Laserdiscs is hard to take when projected on a 10 foot screen. Well, my kids and I fired up the new Star Wars ANH DVD last night and it was SPECTACULAR! Oh my god what a difference in picture quality! It made watching the movie enjoyable again (and I've seen it probably 50 times). The audio appears to be very similar to the S.E. Laserdisc version. That is, lots of boom added. <br /> <br />The ONLY thing that distracted me in the movie was where Princess Leia's dialogue was dubbed. I never noticed this in the LD version, but it was quite apparent in several scenes on the DVD. For example, when the bad dudes are about to blow up Leia's home planet, you can hear where they dubbed in some chick with an English accent! Besides the accent, you can clearly hear a change in background noise before and at the end of the dub (almost a \\"click\\"), and the tone of her voice is different (more treble I think). I never noticed this on the LD, so after the movie I checked the LD version. Guess what? The English accent is there too, but I never noticed it because the other audio clues are not present. I noticed this dub in at least one other scene on the DVD. <br /> <br />So what's up with dubbing Leia with someone with an English accent? How stupid is that? If there was an audio problem, why didn't they just get Carrie Fisher to dub it herself (or at least someone that sounded like her)??? George? Are you listening? I gotta know! Maybe it's in the bonus material. <br /> <br />Oh, and Lucas' digital \\"enhancements\\" don't bother me a bit. So, nyaaaaa! <br /> <br />Anyone want to buy a Laserdisc box set? Cheap?
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 911 is Michael Moore's contribution to the 2004 Presidential Campaign. Hoping to help other loyal, concerned Americans bring the Bush Administration to a hardly untimely end on January 20, 2005, Moore documents the perfidious nature of the crooks and warmongers who have misgoverned us since the Supreme Court stabbed us in the back after the 2000 Election.<br /><br />The movie begins with the last, triumphant days of the Al Gore Campaign as it swept toward victory in November of 2000.  Moore then documents the shenanigans and insider dealings which produced the Florida fiasco and installed Bush and Company in the White House.  Moore does an especially brilliant job of documenting the sleazy tactics and underhandedness of W and his milieu, which includes some of the smarmiest people in the Middle East and Europe.<br /><br />Next, Moore shows us W. on September 11, 2001, sitting with a glazed look on his face as his world began to crumble.  Moore demonstrates that far from being the courageous, calm leader Republican propagandists portray, W. in the days and weeks after September 11 was more of a pawn than a king.<br /><br />The most powerful parts of Fahrenheit 911 deal with the tragic war in Iraq in all its bloody details, details that the US media has never had the stomach to show us but which are essential to our understanding of exactly what our government is committing in our names. Moore also shows us exactly which Americans are doing the fighting and dying:  not the privileged sorts who run the government, but the poorest and saddest among us.<br /><br />Fahrenheit 911 is a muckraker's delight.  It claws away our illusions and demonstrates that the Emperor has no clothes and that our \\"gods\\" have feet of clay.
B00003CXCT|5.0|i don't care about the changes, it's the same story, same movie and the same characters, the bonus material dvd worths the money only by itself, don't hesitate and buy it, what would you buy instead of star wars anyway?
B00005JLWN|5.0|Don't misunderstand me, I thought that Martrix part 1 was a good movie, but Equilibrium has a better story. The story was  interesting and some parts were very heart moving.     Equilibrium has a unique action style which uses very fast hand movements. Contrary to Matrix 1 which uses slow motion bullet time speed.    I also recommend another movie named The Returner. Which has a different style, but is good for sci-fi action fans.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne is back with her sophmore album titled as \\"Under My Skin\\". This strays away from her first debuted album \\"Let Go\\" from a poppish teeny rock girl to a young woman dealing with love,heartache and truth. From commercial songs as \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"My Happy Ending\\", she overturns her poppish-punk  side to more heartfelt realistic rock sounds to \\"Forgotten\\", \\"Fall To Pieces\\", and so many others. I can listen to this whole album without really skipping any tracks.  Either way it is worth the buy.
B00005Q45W|1.0|I bought this album when it was first released, tried to listen to it once, groaned in disbelief and went back to the old stuff. I gave it a second spin today and still couldn't last out to the end. Compared with the earlier albums that could be beautiful, haunting, exciting, humerous and subversive, all at the same time, this one is just dreary to the power of ten, little more than a spoken-word recording of some new poems to a dreadful muzak background. I would have liked to listen to the poetry, as other reviewers have clearly managed to, but the whole thing just sounded so awful. How can a man who gave us Leaving Green Sleeves, Chelsea Hotel, Sisters of Mercy, Marianne and so many other wonderful - and wonderful-sounding - songs put his name to this dross?
B00000IQC8|5.0|Really, I usally can't put myself through a black and white movie.<br /><br />One day my friend comes over with this movie, says it's funny but it's in black and white.  I didn't think this movie would be all that good, but since I love, crude and sexual humor alot, this movie was just my ticket for comedy.<br /><br />This was a independent low-budget film with a lot of petential inside it.  Joke after joke in this movie, I found myself laughing over and over again.<br /><br />And it has a feel to it, as if, this could accually happen to a couple of people running a couple of convineonce stores.<br /><br />It does a superb, hilarious job of how a lot of bad things can happen to someone who isn't suppose to be at work that day(Donte), and a man who is just a let's everything loose at the costomers that come in his, or his friends Donte's store(Randal).<br /><br />People who are easily offended by, crude, sexual, and explict humor, will definitly not want to check this out, but for those who love that kinda stuff(like me)  Have gotta get this or already own this.<br /><br />peace
B0001UL7RY|2.0|One, I could already tell by the cover and the title that I wasn't gonna like it, that it was not living up to Let Go.  Let Go is a brilliant album that has helped me get through my pre-teen years. <br /> <br />Under My Skin is less substantial, it has catchy hooks covered with fake lyrics posing as deep messages.  The first two tracks are pretty bland and formulated.  The only songs I like on this album are He Wasn't and How Does it Feel.  He wasn't is an '80's like song with clever lyrics written just by Avril, I think.  This is waht she has the potential of doing.  HDIF is about feeling lonely and analyzing the souls around her; it's very good, it's a little sparse though. <br /> <br />UMS proves that Avril has more potential for better albums once she gets past her teen pop stage.  She still has to figure out who she is, though she hasn't explored her self-discovery at all on this album.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Roland Emmerich has done it again.  He's found another way of destroying major cities on the big screen.  This time around, it isn't a giant lizard or aliens, though.  This time, it's Big Momma Nature.  I caught this one in the cinema, and I'm sure that it has a better payoff there than on the TV.  It's still worth a look though.<br /><br />The premise of the story is a little wild, but all in all this is just another disaster flick.  There's no moral to this story(unless you're a tree-hugger who took this film to be a warning on mankind's affect on the environment).  Nope, nothing here but lots of things freezing up, Americans crossing over into Mexico, twisters in La-La land, and a really quick trip from Philly to NYC.  But everything looks pretty cool while all of this is happening.<br /><br />The film, if taken as nothing more than a reason to show off some neat special effects, is pretty good.  It does drag along somewhat, but let's face it, freezing things isn't as cool as watching them blow up.  The tornado scenes were some of the best bits of this flick, though they make a rather quick exit.  I also enjoyed the scenes involving the wolfpack(though they looked pretty fake).  The acting is standard and there's nothing really \\"great\\" about this picture.  But, as stated before, this flick is all about spectacle and light on story.  Nothing wrong with that, right?<br /><br />On the other hand, if you do consider this an environmental warning, WAKE UP!  This is nothing more than popcorn fun, and it suffices.<br /><br />There are better end o' the world movies out there, but this one won't let you down.  It's okay, but you might want to rent it on DVD before you lay down hard cash for it.
0061020680|5.0|Mort is an awkward young man who bungles everything he attempts. When his father decides to send him off to be an apprentice, he gets only one offer - from the Grim Reaper himself. It seems like a good job to Mort: free room and board and a secure position in a business that will never run out of clientele. He doesn't even need to die to take the job. Soon Mort is doing some of the reaping himself and he even seems to be gaining maturity, self-confidence, and the ability to walk through walls. He falls in love. But can he manage to help Death harvest souls without making a complete mess of things?<br /><br />This is the fourth in the wildly funny and inventive Discworld series and the first in the Death story line. Although Death made an appearance in the first three books, this time we are provided with a much closer look at Death's domain through details on his daily routine, his likes and dislikes, his household, and his horse. We meet his daughter and his faithful servant. There are hilarious scenes where Death tries out a few mortal pleasures to learn what they are all about. Only Pratchett could depict Death fly-fishing, getting drunk, or participating in a line dance. Above all else, we find out that Death's not such a bad fellow when we get to know him.<br /><br />Pratchett continues to flesh out the geography, culture, and magic of Discworld. He addresses the self-healing nature of history and the relationship between fate and death. He presents a coronation, a bevy of bumbling wizards, a deadly beverage called scumble, a library of self-writing books of life, and a dangerous section of Ankh-Morpork known as the Shades. There is also a generous helping of wit, puns, and wicked satire. This is a great read!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with Beveridge.  This book is imminently readable, engaging, and thought-provoking.  Beyond that, it is a writers' book.  Shriver uses the epistolary form to advantage great enough to challenge Lee Smith's accomplishment in FAIR AND TENDER LADIES.  Don't pass this one up.  It's a good read.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Come on George, what's your problem? <br /> <br />You can try like crazy to make it appear that you envisioned the entire series of star wars when you made the first movie, but clearly you DID NOT. So instead you make liars of all but Darth Vader in the movie, which is ironic. I was shocked back when I saw you had changed the title of Star Wars to Episode IV a new hope... and realized that you would be spinning up numerous movies predicated upon greed, both at the box-office and in merchandise. <br /> <br />I love the way the new set LOOKS seamless with the new movies... but then again, I DON'T REALLY CARE MUCH FOR THE NEW MOVIES. Why not? Because rather than inventing something new, you try to build upon the old. But then, in the final analysis, all you can do is go back and revise the originals. Trying to make a story consistent which is not. Little subtleties like Obi Wan lying to Luke about his father. Clearly that was the real story - but you realized that it made for a far less exciting Empire Strike's Back, so you have Darth tell him that he's his father, and set about creating this sequence of changes. <br /> <br />I am surprised you couldn't spend all this energy on creating a separate and exciting adventure, that has nothing to do with the old characters... what a colossal waste! <br /> <br />Even with all your revisionism you can see that the stories still don't line up, the inconsistencies are too great - and the final tragedy is that of having the Queen of Nabu, or Nabu itself, never go back and purchase Annikan's mother's freedom. Like she, or the Jedi counsel, or Amadhala, would not of just went and bought her. But then, there wouldn't have been a movie right? You had to struggle to concoct a reason for Darth Vader's story, and try to pack the theatres for another three movies. <br /> <br />I wish the original movie, in it's unaltered form, could just be released. But, then, it is too revealing not of the special effects of Hollywood, and their stateat the time, but rather it is too revealing of George Lucas' greed in revising the story. <br /> <br />Too bad, and what a waste of money.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|ok, to the other reviewer... that is truly pathetic. how can u review an album u've only listend to the first minute of a few songs? (btw, its dookie, not nookie) the album needs to be listened to as a WHOLE from beginning to end. the music varies, and in fact shows the deversity of the band. yet, all of the songs flow together, and despite having deviations from their original guitar, bass and drum sets, the style is still Green Day. if u like rock music, u owe this album a listen. everything is here from 'classic punk; to 50's, 60's rock; to the lone singer with the piano'. the lyrics show depth, more than u'll get from anything else right now, the &quot;punk&quot; that ppl claim they play... yes, good charlotte, simple plan etc. the symbolism shows everything from the government, religion, anarchy, and the medias influence on ppl and its effects. this is real punk, the music that stands up for something different than conformity which is offered everywhere and force fed to people by the media. &quot;don't knock it till u try THIS&quot;
B00003CXCT|4.0|Picasso once said that no great work of art is ever truly finished.  I guess there's something to that, but there comes a time when the digitally improved \\"Star Wars\\" begins to look like the cinematic equivalent of Michael Jackson -- Lucas nips and tucks and tones and straightens and bleaches and generally fiddles with the face of his movies until finally he's saying, \\"There's nothing wrong with gray skin. In fact, it's always been gray.\\"  <br /> <br />I personally think consumers should send a message to Lucas and NOT buy this box until he agrees to issue the original versions but given that this box is currently the #1 seller on this site, that's obviously not gonna happen (until, of course, he sells enough and rolls out an old school box set for completists -- though that might be me being too cynical). <br /> <br />Anyway, I rented the box just to check out the changes and, yes, it's just as messed with as I feared.  After this travesty and \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones,\\" I thought my faith in the series had completely died.   <br /> <br />But then I watched \\"Empire of Dreams,\\" the special doc on the making of the series.  And I kind of got my faith back a little.  Yes, i still think Lucas has lost his mind, but \\"Empire of Dreams\\" is fascinating, a inpsiring work about filmmaking, special effects, creativity and the way a vision can change between the treatment and the images' arrival on celluloid.  It explains a lot about why Lucas became what he's become, but most importantly it harkens back to what I loved about the original trilogy.  It talks to every important person that can be interviewed and even though you may not think you can stomach 2.5 hours about the fading, distorted movies, I think anybody who loves film will find something amazing in it.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Just purchased this cd today.  Bought the original when it first came out.  Hopefully all Cat fans will be repurchasing his albums after what our government has done to him.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor! (2 guitarists, 2 bassists, 2 drummers, a cellist, a violinist, and no singer), may very well be the most powerful band on the planet, creating music of oppressive beauty with echoing guitars, beautiful and moving strings, and using samples of emotional dialogue.    They have instantly become one of my all time favorite groups, over all electronic or rock.  Their songs usually last a minimum of 20 minutes that build up to the most glorious listening experience my mind and body can experience, giving goose bumps during every listen.  Their music has touched me in a way no other music ever will.    \\"Add the Ennio Morricone sense of desolation, Mogwai's disgust with the world, piles and piles of intense sadness, and you have the nine-headed monster that Radiohead wishes they could be.\\"    If you are ever hesitant with what life is about or whether you want to heal your sorrows, or if you are just up for an incredible and enjoyable listening experience, put them on and you will see why they are the best.
1401301010|5.0|SCAR TISSUE's ebullient succotash of AK's mad, harrowing life kinda reminds me of Johnny Cash as a fireside yarn spinner.  The storytelling inspires me to seek the lightning bolt, perfect words -- vs. lightning bugs, as Samuel Clemens used to bethink.  Anthony Kiedis loves the language, obviously, and I've succumb to appreciating the dictionary a little more (halcyon imagery like his lyrics make for absolute adroit reading) due to this book.  I even love the font on the spine's backstrip.
B00005JMUA|5.0|In a telling moment of \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" Bill's brother, Budd, played in a wonderful understated performance by Michael Madsen, is listening to a recounting of events we saw in Volume 1 - specifically when Uma Thuman's Bride single-handedly destroy Lucy Liu's O-Ren Shii and her bodyguard platoon, the \\"Crazy 88\\".<br /><br />Budd asks \\"You're telling me she cut through eighty-eight bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?\\"<br /><br />Brother Bill replies \\"Nah, there weren't really eighty-eight of them. They just called themselves \\"The Crazy 88.\\"<br /><br />Budd asks \\"How come?\\"<br /><br />Bill answers \\"I don't know. I guess they thought it sounded cool.\\"<br /><br />There is a LOT in Quentin Tarantino movies that happens because it looks or sounds cool.  I'm reminded in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" of the dialogue-less scene in the Pawn shop where Bruce Willis is upstairs selecting a weapon to use on the psychotic murdering rapists downstairs.  He considers a few lethal clubs and even a chain-saw before settling on the Samurai sword and in the audience I was thinking \\"YEAH! Get the samurai sword! That'll get 'em!\\" Plus - it's cool.<br /><br />There is a scene where one of the characters sicks a deadly Black Mamba on another character, then whips out a notebook with pages of hand-written notes about how god-awful deadly the Black Mamba is. The character sits down, flips open the notebook, and delivers an almost pharmacologic description of the lethal venom, along with \\"'In the bush,' the saying goes, 'a lion can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and the black mamba can kill you. However, only with the mamba is death certain.' Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.'\\" Pretty cool, huh?\\"<br /><br />Tarantino's movies are cool, and the characters in them know it. The smallest touches are added, sometimes for no apparent reason other than to add a \\"cool\\" factor.  All of the members of Bill's Assassination team are called the \\"Deadly Viper Assassination Squad\\" and they all have \\"Snake\\" Code-names.  Why?  'Cuz it's cool, of course.<br /><br />In the beginning, at the wedding rehearsal of the bride, we get to see Samuel Jackson portraying the piano player for the wedding, and is there anyone cooler than Mr. Jackson in the movies?  He asserts his coolness by telling how he sat in with practically every R&B group that came through his little town over 2 decades.<br /><br />The Bride is standing at the alter of her wedding rehearsal when she hears a flute playing a familiar refrain.  She follows the notes outside where she finds her old boss and lover, Bill, playing the familiar notes on his old flute.  Bill is played by David Carradine, and if movies gave out \\"comeback of the year\\" awards like sports does, Mr. Carradine would have earned it in this role, courtesy of Mr. Tarantino.  For extra \\"coolness\\", the flute that Bill is playing for the Bride is the same one that Carradine played back 30 years ago in his iconic role as Caine in the wildly popular tv series \\"Kung Fu\\".<br /><br />The \\"Wedding Chapel Massacre\\" that we're told about in a roundabout way in Volume 1 is set up perfectly in Volume 2, then executed with a single swooping crane shot that backs from the wedding party at the altar, all the way back through the church, down the steps, straight back through the gravel parking lot where the other members of the Assassination Squad are approaching with cool strides and lethal weapons.  The crane swoops the camera up overhead and we see the flashes in the church and hear the shots and screams - and we KNOW what is happening in there without being shown in gory detail.  I can think of no single camera shot as virtuoso since Orson Welles' virtuoso opening to \\"Touch of Evil\\".<br /><br />I haven't told you ANYTHING about the plot, but if you watched Volume 1 you KNOW where the plot is going.  There's a surprise or two, but there's delight in every scene.  I've read Roger Ebert say that movies aren't as important in \\"what they're about\\" as in \\"how they're about it\\".<br /><br />Kill Bill is about Kung-Fu movies and westerns, and the way it's about it is..... cool.bout it\\".   <br /> <br />Kill Bill is about Kung-Fu movies and westerns, and the way it's about it is..... cool. <br />
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I stayed away from the theaters when this movie was playing, suspicious that it was just another over-hyped Disney-like film. I rue that decision now, for I missed the chance to share it firsthand with dozens of undoubtedly delighted families. As the critics have duly noted, this movie is already a classic in every sense of the word. Far better than \\"Charlotte's Web\\" and indeed all the other \\"animal\\" films, it has inaugurated a cinematic genre. Neither the brooding parody of Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" nor the frivolous antics of Looney Tunes, \\"Babe\\" has shown that it is possible to entertain with animals while making one think about the unavoidable lessons of life. This movie succeeds on so many levels, as its many Oscar nominations indicated, that one has to believe that creative genius was behind it. The screenplay is accessible to children yet retains moments of adult wit reminiscent of \\"Peanuts.\\" This careful use of language to convey simple truths may explain some of the film's broad appeal. But its heart-warming, life-affirming message, delivered as it is by the most unassuming of characters--a pig--explains the rest. If you've been hesitant like me to even watch, much less buy this film, do yourself a favor and rush out to rent it. (Indeed it has almost made me into a vegetarian, but that's another story). Then the film itself will convince you to add it to your home video library. You and your family will treasure it for years to come.
B0002OERI0|5.0|How good is this album? The short answer is: it's Green Day's masterpiece. It is better than Dookie and it raises the bar for the entire pop-punk genre. I can put it better than that: it sounds a lot like a swift kick to Good Charlotte's (or any other wish-they-were-Green-Day band's) throat. I'm not going to go into a rant about Good Charlotte sucking, but suffice to say, American Idiot is a hundred times better than any album these whinny teenage-angst bands will ever be able to create. <br /> <br />It isn't the new standard as far as concept albums go. That honor is still broken between The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper and David Bowie's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust. But that doesn't mean it's a bad opera, either. It's the best in the past 15 or 20 years (maybe even further than that) and coming from a band that no real critics ever assumed were much more than the break out artists of one summer in the early 90's, that's saying something. <br /> <br />Whatever glimmer of depth and artistic talent Green Day exhibited with \\"Good Riddance\\" they have only confirmed and broadened with American Idiot. I love early Green Day, don't get me wrong, but when I heard Good Riddance, I almost cried. They were one of my favorite bands, but I never imagined they were capable of such a beautiful ballad. I made a choice after I heard that never to doubt them again, and I'm glad that I did. <br /> <br />Standout songs include the title track, \\"The Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" \\"Wake me up when September ends,\\" and the 9-minute epic \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\" But-and this is important-not one song is bad. <br /> <br />The only negative feeling I have about this concept album is that it has an aura of finale. Like either Green Day won't try another one like this again, or they won't make another album, period. I'd lean toward the first, but even that upsets me. Now that I know they're capable of such brilliant work, I don't know if I could go back to the two minute fight songs of eld. <br /> <br />Make another concept Album, Green Day, please God, make another concept album.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have just finished watching the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it totally blew me away!!  I have been a fan since the first movie came out when I was 7.  This set is very fan friendly (like the DVDs for Episodes I and II). All three movies are remastered and is probably the best picture quality I have ever seen!!!! And the sound is unbelievable!!!!  These are the special edition versions of the films, and each film has been \\"tweeked\\", including the re-doing of Jabba in the first movie, Ian McDiarmond as the Emperor in the second, and Hayden Christensen as Anakin at the end of the third. I feel the small changes were to liven up the experience and to connect the movies with the prequals. <br /> <br />The bonus materials on the fourth disc are totally awesome! The 2 and a half hour documentary \\"Building An Empire\\" is the most informative doc I have ever seen. It also includes trailers, game previews, featurettes, and a photo gallery of all three films. There is also a hidden Easter Egg of a blooper reel. (to access, press 1138 on the gallery/game page). It also contains a sneek preview of Episode III. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great DVD set and it gets me more excited to see \\"Revenge Of The Sith\\"!!!  Highly Recomended!! <br /> <br />MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!!!
B00004WLXZ|3.0|Directed by Leni Riefenstahl, this is a cinematic document of the 1934 rally at Nuremburg. Everyone who reviews the film says that, all politics aside, the artistry is breathtaking. And I agree: if you buy one piece of Nazi propaganda in your lifetime, you should definitely make it Triumph. But if you can, watch it on a double bill with Schindler's List or The Pianist so you know you're getting both sides of the story.  <br /> <br />Though this is obviously very old footage, the DVD transfer of both the audio and visuals is astonishing in its clarity. In fact, it was so vivid, when the pizza man knocked on my door during the opening credits, I nearly hid in the basement.  <br /> <br />Again, there's no denying the technical brilliance of this film, but a movie designed to promote the Hitler agenda will never get the gold star of excellence from me.  <br /> <br />Happy viewing!
B000268QB2|4.0|I don't buy everything that hits the tops of the charts.  About 99.95% of everything that gets air time is completely ignored by me, but Keane did something that no  other group has managed to do since the introduction of a-ha, 20 years ago:  the music made me stop dead in my tracks to listen. <br /> <br />The music is simple, but catchy enough to make you do that silly head bobbing thing.  Vocally...well, he's no Freddie Mercury, and no Morten Harket, but Tom Chaplin has something that sets his vocals apart from many others...perhaps we could call it... good range and emotion.   <br /> <br />Like another reviewer, I'm of the older generation that grew up listening to singers who HAD to have a VOICE (no overdubbing to cover the mistakes, you know?)  And while I still listen to 'rock/pop' music, I try to ignore the 'expert opinions' of \\"critics\\" about anything, simply because I like to make up my own mind about things.   <br /> <br />Comparing Keane to the Beatles, Radiohead, Coldplay (and now, even a-ha) makes no sense to me.  They aren't the Beatles, Radiohead, or Coldplay....you get the picture.  They are Keane. They have the sound they want to have, and for the first time in a long time, I have heard music that doesn't make me cringe and wouldn't embarrass me to have my mother listen to.   <br /> <br /> Basically, one should just give them a fair listen with an open mind.  No comaparisons and no big expectations.  Who knows, you might actually like it.
B0000062S0|1.0|Our perceptions of music are so different and so subjective, that my review will probably mean very little to you, and yet, I am so disappointed with this release that I just can't seem to keep quiet.<br /><br />This album is completely devoid of the chemistry, energy and power that made Led Zeppelin one of the greatest bands of all time.  Every track on this album is singularly boring and uninspired. Plant's voice shows the ravages of age and time, and Page's guitar playing is a mere shadow of what it used to be.<br /><br />I love Led Zeppelin and I like a great deal of Plant's solo work.  I can even listen to Page playing with Coverdale or the Firm.  But I cannot tolerate this.  Listening to this album makes me feel old and tired.
B00018TI5E|5.0|It is a shame John Frusciante's name is tainted with the Red Hot Chili Pepper name that overshadows his solo career. Perhaps that is why he named this album \\"Shadows Collide with People\\". A fine appreciation of music and an ear tuned to hear musical genius when it is in front of them while this album is playing makes it a great inspiration to fellow musicians. Play it, enjoy it and forget the fact he is the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist. You won't find much of them here even though I am a fan of theirs since '87.
B00003CXCT|5.0|First let me start by saying that it is of course everyones right to the freedom of their opinion and the ability to post it here. But the other freedom here and the one that is most important in this issue is ARTISTIC FREEDOM!!! Mr. Lucas is the one who has dedicated his life to his imaginative film career NOT YOU!!! He has every right to do with his films as he chooses. The man is a perfectionist and a genius. He has always said that the technology in the era these films were produced 1975-1982 was inadequate for his vision. So he changed and or added things, so it was more what he wanted it to look like. The tie-in changes from the first trilogy to the second trilogy are there to give a better transition from the first three to the last three. Also lets not forget all of the technical achievements Mr. Lucas has given the film industry. A NEW HOPE is probably the most influential technological film of the 20th century. It could also be argued that it has one of the greatest character driven Good vs. Evil stories ever created. The theme is centuries old, yet I know of few others that pull off this conflict so well. So show these films and Mr. Lucas some respect. If you don't like the new changed films don't watch them and enjoy your old copies of the films on Laserdisc or VHS. I have the originals on VHS also, fun for nostalgia.  So Purists be damned, if you don't get it then, \\"I got a bad feeling about this\\"...
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually brings the audience a bright glance of what most people on earth strive to encounter and/or attain, love. Love is a word with many different meanings in regards to the relationship between people, but it is uniformly positive to how people interact to one another. Love in this film is most often meant as how the Merriam-Webster dictionary would put it: \\"1 a (1) : a strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests b : an assurance of love.\\"<br /><br />The film displays several characters that are linked to one another in some way and how these people find a love connection with each other. The story emphasizes that time and place are irrelevant and that no one is above love as the story depicts the British prime minister (Hugh Grant) falling in love with one of his maids. The story also shows the first love as a young teen falls in love with the school's popular girl, and how love sometimes can be painful when it is not returned.<br /><br />Richard Curtis who also directed films such as Bridget Jones Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral has previously displayed his skill in making romantic comedies. Love Actually continues to presents Curtis's skill to make light hearted, yet meaningful films where love is the essence. In addition, it is a film that will cheer up the audience while viewing it as it offers much humor, entertainment, noble notions, and much else to ponder. In essence Love Actually offers what it teaches, love, which provides an excellent cinematic experience.
B00005JNEI|4.0|i have cracked the history books studying Postwar foreign policy and it is clear that we are heading back down the road to \\"mutually assured destruction\\" if we dont change direction as a collective of civilisations. <br /> <br />moore's depiction of bush is very accurate -- as a crusader hellbent on his wars cos they serve his personal profit margins nicely. no idealism there, just meism.  <br /> <br />all you need to do is read the news for what kim jong from north korea is singing these days. if the world goes down that path, a path that bush is laying out for us, then we're all doomed.  <br /> <br />readers/viewers are advised to take a look into rumsfeld's corporate relationship with now recalcitrant nations selling them WMD materials in the immediate few years before he joined the Bush Administration? yeah, he's really interested in freedom for all and the safety of americans at home and abroad. wake up yankee pawns. <br /> <br />we need ten more movies like this. bravo moore!
B000268QB2|5.0|Ok, so I am a huge fan of bands like Queen, Coldplay, Travis, etc. Maybe this is why I like Keane so much, but then again I don't think so. I bought this CD on a recommendation by a friend and wasn't impressed initially. About a month later I find myself listening to it daily without skipping a single track. This is a terrific CD of great pop songs. Highlights for me are Somewhere Only We Know, Everbody's Changing, Your Eyes Open, and Bedshaped. If you like Keane I would definitely recommend picking up Invisible Band by Travis, Rush of Blood to the Head by Coldplay, and Want One by Rufus Wainwright.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is by far one of the best tool cds yet. it is pure lyrical genius. maynards haunting voice traps me in a spell when i listen to it. there isnt a song on the cd that i dont like. the music of this generation sucks but tool gives me a glimmer of hope that good, REAL, quality music still exists
B000024QML|5.0|Very is the album that for me really represents why Pet Shop Boys are probably one of the most underrated pop groups in musical history. Combining highly intelligent and sophisticated lyrics with very poppy, \\"synthy\\" dance music, PSB reached their creative peak with this album. An interesting follow up to their extraordinary album Behavior which proceeded it. What a shame that PSB are only known for their 80's hit West End Girls in the US.
0553579908|5.0|Carrying through on the fantastic promise in Book 1, the second book in the Song of Fire and Ice trilogy begins to accelerate the story. The Starks and Lannisters have divided the country with their war, and that doesn't even include various other lords who are staking their claims to glory. The political intrigue and fierce conflict of just this one plot would be sufficient to hold my interests (especially with George R.R. Martin's superb writing) but there will be twists and turns aplenty in this series. The heir of the deposed King prepares her return to the mainland, and the (...)son of the Starks faces an enemy up North that could crush all the warring kingdoms.    Every character is somebody you can care about or dislike, and George R. R. Martin perfectly presents the brutal reality of the time, with some important characters dying/being crippled/etc.    This series is a tour de force, and I can only await eagerly for it's next installment.
B00003CXCT|5.0|1300+ reviews tell it all. Not since the release of The Beatles \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" CD have I seen such anguish, mixed emotion and gnashing of teeth over a re-released product..and mostly from those who've yet to see them!! <br />What is the problem? This isn't a life or death situation..they're only movies..as many others have stated. I have my copy already..they sound & look magnificent. The changes make sense when tied into the overall scope of the whole Star Wars Saga. So it's young Anakin at the end overlaid, so what if Greedo shot first..who really gives a rats!! It doesn't change the overall feel or flow of the movies themselves. Besides they WERE George Lucas' brainchild after all..he can pretty much do what he wishes with them!! I can see the sense in those changes too given the release of Episodes I & II and the impending release of Episode III next year. The conspiracy theorists are out in force again but they're kidding themselves if they think these movies are \\"ruined forever\\". Sheesh!! <br />With hindsight, there is some \\"hokeyness\\" present in some parts of IV & VI..things like the cutesy Ewoks and certain scenes in the Episode IV (the hug-fest in the garbage compactor, the 'Droids getting \\"emotional\\"). That hokeyness is also present in Episode I (the Jar Jar Binks scenes, the \\"kiddie\\" scenes) & II (the Anakin-Padme romance) but at least it's consistent.  However that's part of the overall charm of the movies. Initially based on the structure of 1930's-50's action movie serials like Flash Gordon, we have the young initially-naive hero (Luke), the feisty heroine (Leia), the swashbuckling rascal (Han Solo) & loyal offsider (Chewbacca), cute funny characters (the Droids) and the wizard-like ex-warrior(Obi-wan) not to mention the supreme Villian (Darth Vader). Supported along the way with a host of other wierd and wonderful supporting characaters, these 3 movies are just pure, sheer escapism and lots of fun. I was 20 when I first saw \\"Star wars\\" on the bigscreen..the opening shots of the Imperial Star Cruiser filling the huge screen left a huge impression on me and my poor neck (I was watching it four rows from the front!!)  The films set a huge standard in science fiction film making that has just gone ahead in leaps and bounds since.  <br />Overall I'm glad it's on DVD finally..I can now preserve my 1997 Remastered VHS versions. This is a DVD set to enjoy. Forget the changes in the film..you'll barely notice them...just sit back, forget the rest of the world for about 6-7 hours and enjoy them..and don't forget torank up that amazing 5.1 sound!! <br /> <br />
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever had the good luck to read.  My introduction to The Giver was in sixth grade and I am still enjoying it six years later.  Lois Lowry writes in a way that, no matter how many times you read the story, each time you get something else out of it.  She presents a strange and almost utopian land that is on one level a deeply enriching story about a boy growing up, and on another level profound with a deep philosophical slant.  What is more important, an ordered controlled life free from pain and sadness, or a world with joy and happiness but also pain?  Is erasing our differences with political correctness a good thing?  Can there ever be a perfect society?  The book does not give any answers, but like any good philosophical text, it points the way.
B00000I8BX|2.0|Now this is a very biased review here (it's really just a review for one song).  I'm not into this kind of metal whatsoever, love classic 80's metal (Iron Maiden, etc.) or classic industrial (Ministry, etc.).  I think Fear Factory is quite a boring modern metal act.  This is standard nu-ish junk metal, but this one song, Resurrection, stands out as an emotional musical masterpiece.  I don't know how these guys managed to throw this amazing song into such a mediocre pile, but I recommend anyone to listen to that one song, if it means you have to buy this album or just download the song.  Two stars, just for Resurrection.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|we viewed this last night after several recommendations and reviews. The visuals and technique are great, as is the acting, but the story and expostion just don't work for us.  We were clueless as to what was going on for the first hour, then began to understand what was the theme in the 2nd hr.  BTW, our DVD had very significant sound problems for about half the movie.  The music was extremely loud, but the spoken parts were almost not understandable until you raised th evolume only to be blasted by the music.  This cleared up in the 2nd half by itself.
B000002LQR|4.0|By far not the best RHCP's release but its in any respect a strong release in its own right. There are some new songs as well mixed into the CD old ones. 17 tracks that provide a blend for the listener that traverses between hip-hop and disco type beats.<br /><br />All in all my favourites in this CD release were the tracks of; Breaking the Girl, Suck My Kiss, Under the Bridge and They're Red Hot.
006016848X|5.0|Cracking good read. Not sure, however, that Gray fully realises that love is simply a neurological by-product of the biological imperative of reproduction. Love between sexual partners is in fact (almost) impossible - we conjure the illusion of love when we project narcissistic self-love onto an other and hold them up as a mirror for our vanity. The maintenance of 'love' however is necessarily fragile and depends upon its possible cessation by the other - the other has to be a worthy mirror, otherwise they cannot reflect our vanity. It is within the parameters of this battleground that the human sexual relationship is enacted. <br /> <br />Furthermore, there is not a fine line between love and hate; they are merely different manifestations of self-love that have been affected by the objectified other. 'Love' is self-love propagated by the other; 'hate' is self-love subverted by the other. In the latter case, self-hatred is prevented as it is transferred onto the other thus preserving self-love. If the other managed to alter our self-love they would be free of the viscosity of our objectifying gaze and would have, in turn, moulded us into an objectified en-soi. Perhaps!
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Julia Roberts's command of the screen is so effortless, it's easy for moviegoers to take her for granted--but we shouldn't. Mona Lisa Smile--about a noncomformist teacher at a private school who encourages students to pursue their individuality--is pretty much an all-girls version of Dead Poets Society that mixes '50s fashions with '70s feminist thought. However, its lack of ambition doesn't diminish the talent that's gone into it: The writing and directing are well-honed and skillful; the actors--a talent-studded cast featuring Marcia Gay Harden, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Juliet Stevenson--are uniformly excellent. But without question, Mona Lisa Smile rides on Roberts's shoulders and she carries it with ease. She's possibly the only contemporary actor who simply owns a movie the way Bette Davis, Jean Arthur, or Claudette Colbert once did, radiating a engaging mix of intelligence, drive, and emotional warmth that cannot be matched.
B0000000LI|2.0|I caught his live TV show on PBS while channel-surfing and being live, the music seemed pretty good. However, after I bought the CD and played it, the music was pretty tepid without the flashing lighting, huge orchestra and singers. Watching Yawn-ee's music is better than listening to it, except we have to keep being treated to close-ups of Yawn-ee having the Big O over his own music. Puh-leeeze! It ain't that great. <br /> <br />It's kind of like John Tesh music (if you want to call it that), a chord played over and over and over, only very LOUD so that you'll think you're listening to real music. I watched the audience and more than Yawn-ee would like to admit, most sat cross-armed and sullen when others applauded as if they'd been dragged to the concert against their wills. <br /> <br />Custs #2 Keys to Imagination & #8 Nostalgia are almost identical, that same chord over and over that apparently sticks in Yawn-ee's brain and he can't dynamite it out. #6 One Man's Dream was actually the best piece he's written. It sounded like actual music, not well orchestrated noise. The other pieces just went on and on and you find yourself not listening to them. He's coming to Reno in November, near where I live. I won't walk across the street to see him. <br /> <br />Yawn-ee is very rich. Apparently you can fool some of the people all of the time.
B000000OU4|2.0|This is the worst Methney album I have heard to date. Although it has some great guitar playing in parts most of the CD is totally ruined by monotonous hip-hop beats which,in my opinion, have no place in jazz. Where's the freedom and improvization which jazz is known for? In fact, I'm not even convinced the drummer was playing at all. For most of the set it sounds as if the drummer switched on the drum machine and went out for a smoke. There are a lot of good Methney albums out there, but this is not one of them. Save you money.
B000089CJI|3.0|When I first heard the song Such Great Heights I thought it was the best electropop song I've heard in the past ten years. I checked out Give Up in the hopes of hearing more great stuff. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is a nice song but the lyrics are pretty lame. But it gets worse.... much worse. Sleeping In is just silly and not a very interesting song at all. Nothing Better is just awful with lyrics that are so bad they make you cringe.The rest of the songs have some interesting electronic stylings but they are just are too weak to sustain the entire package.It really makes me appreciate the efforts of the bands from the 80's that did this much better. With the work of those bands available to modern musicians you'd think people attempting to make music of that style would have an advantage in creating something equal to or better than. Such Great Heights initially reminded me of the band New Musik. If you like light electropop you may want to check out the album Sanctuary... if you can find it.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I have read all of the Harry Potter books (5 so far) and of them all, book 3, The Prisoner of Azkaban, was by far my favorite.  So I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  The first two movies were very good, but I couldn't wait to see some of the things from this book.  Unfortunately, the director/script writer decided to leave some of the best things out (like Professor Snape being enchanted and floating out of the Shrieking Shack, the friendship between Crookshanks and Sirius as a dog making you wonder who Crookshanks really is, the explanation of how the three friends (Pettigrew, Sirius and Harry's dad) became animals to keep Lupin company when he was a werewolf, the explanation of Harry's patronus being a stag and its significance).  They put in some things that I thought made the movie less factual (like having Lupin as a werewolf attack Sirius when he was a dog, when the whole reason Sirius had learned to become a dog was to keep Lupin company when he was a werewolf), and focused too much on action and not nearly enough on the characters and their relationships.  J.K. Rowling is a brilliant author who develops characters so well that you feel that they're your friends.  This movie was flat and one-dimensional and a HUGE disappointment.   <br /> <br />That being said, the scenes where Harry flew on Buckbeak over the countryside, his talks with Professor Lupin, the Patronus, and the Dementors were well done.  However, even there, this movie was different -- it looked as if the Dementors were trying to give Harry the \\"kiss\\" constantly -- in the book, they simply made you miserable, and didn't suck out your life unless you had a death sentence.  This will make things in later books (when a Dementor DOES try to give Harry the kiss and everyone is appalled) much less understandable. <br /> <br />I just don't understand why, when there was such an incredibly excellent plot to work from, they felt it was necessary to leave out so many wonderful pieces.  And even if they do a great job on the next two books, I will forever be disappointed that they ruined my favorite one.   <br /> <br />To whoever made these decisions -- STOP MAKING IT ABOUT ACTION!!!  Follow the plot!  Focus on the characters and their relationships with each other.  We have plenty of action films --what makes the Harry Potter series so exceptional is the development of the characters.  The readers of these books are bright -- we don't need simplistic script writing -- it's boring and seriously underestimates what we are looking for. <br /> <br />Linda (to view some of my paintings, go to my website at [...])
B00023B1A8|5.0|I own quite a number of DVD concerts and this one has to be one of the top 10.    Recently I purchased \\" Daylight Again\\" and was somewhat disappointed ,but this one more than adds what the other concert lacked.    Crosby is totally awesome. He literally beams with enthusiasm during this entire concert.   They all do, but David stole the show this time.  Little did he realize he'd be undergoing a liver transplant 4 years later.  Even though the concert is named \\" Acoustic\\" it's not totally that, Stills is quite electric throughout the concert.  At times he's almost overwhelming on certain songs in my opinion.   Their voices are powerful in this show.  They started out a little flat on the first song, Deja Vu and I thought Ut Oh. Oh NO !, but then it changed and wow they got it together and sounded so good I got down right sappy. ( don't tell anyone about this please ) LOL... The sound of the DVD quality is just great.  It sounded as good on my computer DVD player in stereo as it did on my Sony Trinitron with Dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. It's truely awesome.  You won't be disappointed in this concert DVD , so take my word for it and add it to your collection.   It will make you smile time and time again.

B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard \\"American Idiot\\" about a month and a half ago, I immediately thought that the new Green Day CD that I had read about in magazines (calling it a \\"rock opera\\") would be a return to classic Green Day, like the single. Needless to say, being a huge Green Day fan for a decade now, I rushed right out to the store on Wednesday after school and got my copy. <br /> <br />Here's the thing: it's not quite what I would call \\"classic Green Day\\", but it is definitely Green Day. It's got the great familiar Green Day sound. Songs like \\"American Idiot\\" (which I think everybody's heard by now) and \\"St. Jimmy\\" are very much classic GD, but on this album, the boys also experiment with some different sounds. And it makes for the best album of 2004 thus far. (Definitely a good thing, as 2004 has been quite a dismal year for music so far.) <br /> <br />How so, you might ask? How do they incorporate new sounds into the new album? Well, here's a good example: rock operas! Yes, the tracks \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are 9+ minute medleys of five different songs each! Okay, they're not the first to do it, but they do it great here, and the songs flow into each other very well. Also, they do some great ballads (which I'll get into later) that would make Bon Jovi blush. <br /> <br />Other songs worth noting: \\"Holiday\\", which is easily my favorite on the album. It's got a great hook (GD can write a hook that'll stick in your head for days), it's extremely catchy, and the line \\"This is the dawning of the rest of our lives.../On Holidayyyyyyy...!\\" sounds almost apocolyptic, very nice. Also, \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is a great ballad, as are \\"Give Me Novocaine\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\". And of course, \\"St. Jimmy\\" is a great punk rocker that sounds like it could easily have come from a Nimrod session. Pretty much all of the songs on here are at least good, and worth checking out. <br /> <br />So anyway, if you're a Green Day fan, and you don't have this...why are you sitting at your PC looking at reviews for it? Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot, to get feedback for the album. Well, here it is: it's great, and it will be in my CD player (and head) for a loooong time. RECOMMENDED!!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|\\"Citizen Kane\\" has always been enigmatic to me.  There is no denying that when this film was released in 1941 it was light-years ahead of other films in regard to technique, story-telling, and enough cannot be said about the superlative cinematography by Gregg Toland.  The screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz is superb.  The ensemble acting by the Mercury Theatre troupe is outstanding. Orson Welles had to have the most chutzpah in the world to make a veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst, one of the most powerful men in the world at this time.  But is this (bold letters for effect)THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL-TIME?  In all likelihood, yes.  That said, I would not rank it as one of my favorite films but one I deeply admire.  With apologies to Roger Ebert, this film can probably be best viewed in a film course where it can be analyzed and dissected.  It may just be me, but I hold \\"The Godfather\\" in higher esteem, a film that is both art and entertains.  A film by Orson Welles that I enjoy more is \\"A Touch of Evil\\" because it has higher entertainment value(and atmosphere to die for).  Another recommendation for Welles fans is \\"The Third Man\\", a film that Welles appears in but did not direct but it sure feels like he did.
B000286S8S|4.0|Well, well, well - very deep subject, as is the VAN HALEN saga. LISTEN...let's be HONEST...the three new songs are \\"not up to Van Halen Standard\\" and obviously were last minute thrown together attempts to cheer on a returning and triumphant, yet humble, SAMMY HAGAR. Sammy has had great moments with the band, and even greater as a solo artist in his own right - I have alotta respect for him, and like him alot. DAVID LEE ROTH will eternally be celebrated as \\"the voice of Van Halen\\", regardless of his exile to Rock obscurity, never to be forgotten, as his recordings with Van Halen have become this band's CLASSIC TRADEMARK SOUND. DAVID LEE ROTH's immense and diverse talent was equal to the sum of this band's remaining parts as a whole. HAGAR's \\"live\\" versions of ROTH's Van Halen classics are tasteless - it's just as silly as Lindsey & Stevie singing Christine McVie's FLEETWOOD MAC classics \\"live\\" on their concert tour since McVie exited that band. Still, Hagar, Buckingham & Nicks have every right to interpret their respective bands' back catalogue, however insipid and uninspired they may come across in the process. The VAN HALEN brothers exibit a desire to forget the past - so much as to not include a single picture of DAVID LEE ROTH anywhere on this new compilation - and limit mention of their former lead singer's name in the liner notes. How ungracious, indifferent, ungrateful and hypocritical[This CD's liner notes ask \\"What happened?\\"]...let's not forget how you all got where you are today, and you're still making $$$ off DAVID, and because of his presence in your recording history. Van Halen should move forward, forget the past, and stop living $$$ off their pre-1986 glory days. SAMMY HAGAR will always have his successfull solo career(and much more)to fall back on. What the hell...great music here!
B00003CXCT|1.0|When I heard that George Lucas had finally decided to release the classic starwars trilogy on DVD, I thought it would be just that.  The unfooled around with Classics from the seventies and eighties.  Boy were we all lied to.<br /><br />Not only is this the updated versions that were released in the late ninties, which contained too much in the way of computer animation that it lost the heart and soul that lucas breathed into them those many years ago, but he has gone and ruined them further.  Simple things, I know, like the changing of Boba Fetts voice, or the computer generating of the Sail Barge, but it was enough to make me want to destroy George.<br /><br />My advice would be to find the origional trilogy on VHS.  If you are able to find it,  let me know where.
B000005C1B|5.0|This concert by Roy Orbison was recorded in September of 1987.  The core musicians here were in Elvis Presley's band in the 1970s, interestingly.  They are supplemented by several well known performers who were admirers of Roy.  But guys like Bruce Springsteen don't try to steal the spotlight from Roy.  They just let Roy do what he does best, which is sing with that amazing voice of his.  Roy does sound a bit older than he did back in his heyday, but he can still hit those high notes.  Roy and friends run through most of his classic hits, plus a new song written by Elvis Costello, \\"The Comedians\\", which later was included on his [[ASIN:B000VO8O8K last album]].  It's truly a wonderful concert, and I would recommend it to any fan of Roy.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Ok, avril fans, lets just get one thing straight.  AVRIL'S MUSIC IS POP, NOT ROCK!!!  Obviously y'all have never heard real rock music.  I don't see how you could say it's rock????  REAL rock music has LOUD guitars, bass and drums.  Where as Avril's music has been polished over way too much creating a crappy pop-rock sound. <br />I'm not hating on you for liking her.  You can listen to Avril, but don't go around saying she's a rocker. <br />Just face it, this girl will NEVER ROCK!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Farenheit 911 is not only the Cannes festival \\"Palme d'Or\\" awarded movie , it's  also probably one of the most important documentary ever done: in those u.s elections days , it is not only the destiny of the United states who are at stake, but also - because United States is the most powerful country in the world - the destiny of the whole planet. What Farenheit 911 shows wonderfully is how dangerous it can be for the whole world, beginning by the U.S.A to have in command people who have probably understood everything about business and power, but absolutely NOTHING about what LIFE really is. If you prefer the truth to the lies, then you will love Farenheit 911 which is not only done with humor and the famous Michael Moore provocation spirit, but also with emotion and compassion .  It's not only a movie about Bush and his band of mad men, but also about the founding principles of America, being destroyed under our own eyes. An absolute \\"must-see-movie\\" for every one who want to save the future of America, and the world.

B0002234LS|4.0|\\"Secret Window\\" is better than the trailer you saw on TV indicates.  Don't want to give away too much of the plot, but there are some surprises in this movie that actually keep you on the edge of your seat, should have been R instead of PG-13.  Johnny Depp's performance is much like \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", a reasonably intelligent individual with a little neuroticism mixed in.  John Turturro, outstanding as usual, this guy deserves more leading roles, he rates an Oscar on his shelf someday.  Perfect example of a Rental movie, you enjoy it, but don't want to keep it.  Give it a look, Recommended.
0689835604|5.0|My daughter just recently got excited about someone reading to her before bedtime/naptime.  I picked up this book and read it to her and now she's hooked.  I am asked to read it to her prior to any time that she has to sleep.  She loves her \\"baby story\\" and takes great pride in pulling the flaps.  We have read it every night/day for 3 weeks now and she pulls the flaps and we haven't had any issue with them coming off.   <br />My daughter is 2 and has a speech delay and I find her trying to say words from the book, recognizing letters and getting excited about reading.  I don't know how much more you can ask from a book like this!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Many people are \\"horrofied\\" by the film's violence. Contrary to other films the violence was based on fact and had it's purpose. It's sad that today's world is full of cynicism and hate. I think this is one of the main reasons many people don't understand Christ's sacrifice and His love for us all. As a result the \\"bashers\\" hate the film. <br /> <br />As we drift away from love, less we comprehend God's ways. Let us at least try it for once. . .  <br /> <br />As for the movie, I loved it. It has made a big impact my life and strengthened my faith. I recommend this movie to everyone who is serious on their search for God. This movie along with good Spiritual Direction can bring many spiritual fruits. <br /> <br />The only thing that dissapointed me was the lack of \\"extras\\" on the DVD. That's the reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. A making of documentary, deleted scenes, movie inspiration sources along with other interesting features could've been added. Let's hope a Special Edition gets released.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I've read reviews calling Moore a \\"Trator\\"  (?), insinuating that all who buy this movie are supporting \\"Fidel Castro\\" (Dictator of Cuba), \\"Tehran\\" (Capital of Iran), \\"Hamas\\" (Palestinian terrorist organization) and \\"Saddam\\" (who is in jail).  Too funny.  I saw it in the theater and didn't think I needed to see it again but all these lunatic fringe, right wing illiterates campaigning so vehemently against it have caused me to re-evaluate my position.  I'll go out and buy a copy now and watch it one more time...  Anything that pisses off so many right wing fundies deserves a second look. <br /> <br />Happy hunting.
B00003CXCT|3.0|First off, I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, so the 3 star rating is not for the films themselves, although there are parts of them that might get fewer than 5 stars, but not many. I'm not going to comment much on the films themselves because what else is there to say? They are awesome! My 3 star rating is actually for the overall package of the DVD set. The video & sound quality are excellent, so no problems there. However, I give it 3 stars because there is so much here that is lacking. There is so much more that could have been added, but for some strange reasons, wasn't. First, why is there only 1 bonus disc between three films when the DVDs of Episodes I & II got TWO DISCS each? This makes no sense. There have been so many specials about Star Wars over the years (like that infamous Holiday Special, which, no matter how corny it was, would still be cool to see on DVD) that surely, more features could have been added. Second, where are all the deleted scenes that have become legendary for many Star Wars fans? The early scenes with Biggs & Lukes other friends, the snowtroopers running into a bunch of wampas and the sandstorm scene in Jedi. Most DVDs have deleted scenes nowadays, so why not Star Wars? And finally, I know these are George Lucas' films, but knowing how fanatical & devoted the fans are, why couldn't we have gotten one disc with bonus material, one disc for the special editions and one (or possibly a double-sided disc) with the original versions, so that fans, new & old, can see how the films were \\"way back when\\". I mean, I know he felt changes were necessary, and I agree, they are kind of cool, BUT, when I first saw Star Wars at the age of ten, I don't remember no one complaining, do you? Sure, you might be able to buy the original versions on video through ebay or something, but videotape doesn't last forever. And the quality is usually crap. It's too bad Lucas only seemed to pay attention to what HE wanted and not what the fans wanted, but I guess you can't have everything. Still, these great films are finally on DVD, though somewhat altered, and with a few features missing, so I shouldn't complain too much, but it just bugs me that they overlooked so much. So, even though I seem to love to complain, I still bought 'em and liked 'em.
B00004YRQA|5.0|For me, the easy portability of memory cards outweighs the fact that you need to buy one.  Sharing saves has been part of my game-group culture, right back as far as when games were saved on audio cassette - and memory cards are certainly an improvement over a pocketful of disks or tapes.  Personally, I'd miss it if it suddenly vanished.      Admittedly, the PS2 should come with SOME kind of card as standard, even if only 1 megabyte - after all, pretty much all the PS2's games require one to get the best out of them.  But I'd not choose to have an internal save system instead.  And Sony's card is, at least, a quality item - it's well enough made that I've never known one to fail, and the 8mb capacity has proven to be enough that none of my friends to date has ever needed to purchase a second one.    As a one-off purchase,(...)- yes, it's necessary (which may be frustrating to those who never went through the hassle of having to buy boxes of blank disks and use up one per saved game).  But it's also very well made indeed, and - as even the lower scoring reviewers have said - you won't find a better memory card for the PS2.

0887307280|5.0|This book is more about changing your way of thinking rather than telling you how to do something. However, by doing that (and providing a few hows along the way), it has the potential of saving you a LOT of money! <br />After reading the book I talked to an entrepreneur who had started his small business 13 years ago and made it grow to a over a million a year in sales company. He told me episodes of his venture that were clearly spelled out in this book as red flags. I'm sure that had he read the book he wouldn't have learned the hard way! When I mentioned this the E-Myth book, his answer was: \\"I didn't read the book, I learned it\\". Which is true... only he did it the hard way!
B00005LC6U|5.0|this is the one that started it all! ! a must for the true dracula fan!  the black and white film only enhances the true fear and terror the director and actors were trying to achieve. nothing beats the classics! !
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God is the future of American metal and \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" proves it. This album tops their other releases: the riffs are brutal, the vocals are intense, and the drumming is the best its been on any Lamb of God release. This band one day will be the new Megadeth or the new Slayer. If I can see one down fall, its the vocals. They are very death metal-ish, and that may hurt the bands success. But for a metalhead, they fit the music well. Bless the metal gods for this release.
B000002G8H|5.0|SLOWHAND is a great Eric Clapton solo album. Except for the overplayed \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", everything here is great. If you get this one, 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD, ERIC CLAPTON, LAYLA, JUST ONE NIGHT, DISRAELI GEARS, WHEELS OF FIRE, THE VERY BEST OF CREAM, BLIND FAITH, LAYLA & OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS, MONEY AND CIGARETTES, BEHIND THE SUN, JOURNEYMAN, and John Mayall's \\"Beano\\" album, you'll have a wonderful Eric Clapton library.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|As a die hard Green Day fan since I first heard Dookie and one who has bought every other album they have released, I feel that I must comment on this one.  Plain and simple, this is the best album they have ever released.  I have listened to every song at least 4 times.  It has depth and meaning like none of their other albums.  This, in the 3 days that I've had it, become my favorite CD ever, and it's going to take something damn impressive to dethrone it.  The social commentary is wonderful, and I'm saying this as a republican.  It's more commentary on society than on the administration.  This is a musical epic that will be talked about and possibly taught years from now.
B000002G89|5.0|461 OCEAN BOULEVARD is one of Eric Clapton's best CDs ever; with the exception of the overplayed \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\", everything here is great, with the best songs being \\"Motherless Children\\" and \\"Mainline Florida.\\" If you get this one along with SLOWHAND, JUST ONE NIGHT, DISRAELI GEARS, WHEELS OF FIRE, THE VERY BEST OF CREAM, BLIND FAITH, LAYLA & OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS, MONEY AND CIGARETTES, BEHIND THE SUN, JOURNEYMAN, ERIC CLAPTON, and John Mayall's \\"Beano\\" album, you'll have the ultimate Clapton library.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums I've ever bought. This isn't for the stuck up college crowd, it's not for the stuffy critics, this is for people that want to ROCK!!!!!! <br />If you want to pick up something heavy, look no further. The title track alone is worth the price of the disc! <br />Andrew W.K. RULES!
B000002G8L|5.0|Eric Clapton delivered his best live album with JUST ONE NIGHT. Most of the songs, both originals and covers, are top-notch, and the playing is hot and highly electric. If you get this album, along with 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD, SLOWHAND, ERIC CLAPTON, LAYLA, THE VERY BEST OF CREAM, BLIND FAITH, and the \\"Beano\\" album, you'll have a wonderful Eric Clapton library.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|London Calling is the greatest rock and roll album ever, bar none.  The Clash hit their stride with this record, incorporating their myriad influences into something far greater than the sum of the parts.  This was the high point of their career.<br /><br />As for the Vanilla Tapes: they are a fascinating document of a great band ( might they have truly been the only band that mattered?) pulling together their influences to forge something new.  Despite what another reviewer wrote, these tracks have never been bootlegged, so we are all hearing them for the first time.<br /><br />The booklet is great.  It is not slapped together but provides interesting historical documents, such as the Armigideon Times, along with new essays setting forth the background, recording  and impact of the album.<br /><br />The DVD could have used fresh interviews with Mick, Paul and Topper, but even lacking those, it is still interesting and the studio footage is great. I always thought the stories about Guy Stevens' nuttiness in the studio was hyperbole, but if anything, he was crazier than the stories made him out to be.<br /><br />This is a great re-release of the greatest album ever.  Buy it without fear.
B000002P5W|5.0|With AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE, Jimi Hendrix made dramatic strides forward from an already incredible debut album. Songs like \\"Little Wing\\" and \\"Castles Made Of Sand\\" show a newfound sensitivity, and such rockers as \\"If 6 Were 9\\" are just as hot as anything from the debut. You must own this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Looking through the forty (of 1120!) previous reviews, I see only one four star and one single star rating (the latter being notably inaccurate), the rest giving five stars.  There's no need to explain more.  This is what entertainment television should be.
B00006D295|5.0|... how this movie has never once stopped showing in theaters ever since it's opening night in 1975.  And that's going on 40 YEARS now.  It's been translated into many languages.  Several thousands(if not millions)of people dress up and go to this movie at midnight.  It's amazing.  And, even though it was made in the 70's, it still holds up. <br /> <br />Tim Curry is wonderful as Frank.  Susan Sarandon as Janet, Barry Bostwick as Brad, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Meatloaf, and Peter Hinwood as Riff-Raff, Magenta, Columbia, Eddie, and Rocky are all amazing. <br /> <br />The songs are really good and The TIme Warp is fun to dance. <br /> <br />This movie isn't for everyone.  For those of you who hate it or don't care for it or who've never heard of it, just give it one chance.  If not for seeing Tim wearing fishnets, then for the songs.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have listened to Green Day since I was 9 years old when I saw the 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours CD on the shelf at a music store.  I have been in love with them ever since.  Now, When I first heard just snipets of American Idiot on the internet I was a bit dissapointed.  Well, Now that I have the CD and have listened to it in its entirety many times over, it is one of my favorites.  Yes, it is VERY different from the Green Day norm, but thats what makes it so great.  They can do their classic punk vibe and then turn around and create this CD and it still be amazing.  I am having a hard time choosing which song is my favorite on the CD, it's THAT good.    Here's my personal run down of the album:    1. American Idiot : 9/10 some old style Green Day to open up the album.  A little political, but still a good tune that most can relate to.  2. Jesus of Suburbia : 10/10 the story weaved within this song is just beautiful.  Great transitions and gorgeous vocals from Billie Joe  3. Holiday : 8.5/10 Has a nice beat and makes you wanna sing along to it  4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams : 10/10 Absolutely LOVE the lyrics in this song.  Billie Joe's voice is at its best in this song.    5. Are We The Waiting : 9.5/10 just a beautiful song all together  6. St. Jimmy : 8/10 Classic fast and furious Green day.   7. Give Me Novacaine : 9/10 Starts out slow, and then the Chorus hits you.  Has lyrics that hit me right in the chest.  8. She's A Rebel : 10/10 Reminds me of Green Day's Kerplunk days.  Has a tendancy to get stuck in yer head if you arent careful  9. Extraordinary Girl : 8/10 starts out different from anything I have ever heard from GD.  Not one of the best on the CD  10. Letterbomb :  8.5/10 Somemore classic Green Day.  This one sounds kinda like it should have been on Insomniac instead  11. Wake Me Up When September Ends : 9/10 slow but very good.  Who said punkers cant have great ballads?  12. Homecoming : 10/10 another great multi-part song.  It amazes me how well they pull off all the transitions.  Just great  13. Whatsername : 10/10 Absolutely awesome.  another slower song, but this song is the one i think most can relate to.  Beautiful and a great way to end a beautiful album    Needless to say, this CD is one to buy and listen to over and over.  Don't go into it expecting old school Green Day, or you WILL be very dissappointed at first.
0716703440|2.0|Resorting to the metaphor of \\"bongs of a bell\\" to describe differential forms and \\"machines\\" to introduce the notion of tensors is a little insulting to capable undergraduate physics students.  This is one of the most overhyped and overrated textbooks I've ever used. <br /> <br />Physics and math students: Brush up on your vector calculus and classical mechanics and start with Shutz's \\"A First Course in General Relativity\\".  If you've had some general relativity already, head for Wald's \\"General Relativity\\".
0380789035|5.0|I have to thank Neil Gaiman for writing this book, because not only did I enjoy it, it made me think while I was reading it.<br /><br />As is common in his books, there's a society just underneath ours that we are unaware of.  In this case, it is the mythic entities of many cultures all imported to America by those who believed in them.  Gods, faeries, leprechauns, djinn, and demons all inhabit America, living off scraps of faith and scams against regular people.  Couple that with more modern Gods, such as Almighty Dollar, Media, Internet, and the rest as those who are currently believed in.  There are also folk heroes and discarded modern Gods such as Johnny Appleseed and The Iron Horse.<br /><br />This isn't evident at first, though.  The main character, Shadow, believes at first that he is working for a crooked eccentric.  It is only through experience that he realizes he's in this \\"underground\\" culture and that his employer is a God, and is introducing him to other Gods.<br /><br />There are several excellent plot twists near the end that I won't give away, but they prevent the book from being predictable.  As I too often see how a story will turn out by one third of the way through, this was a particular delight.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I just want to say that this movie is very informative, opening your eyes to what you have never seen before.  Forget about any negative comments you've heard about the producer, and just watch this movie with an open mind.  At the end of the movie, you can choose to disregard the possible biased comments made by michael, doesn't matter.... there are certain facts, relationships, etc that will put your brain to work like you never thought a movie can before.  At the end, you might ask \\"What if ... then...\\" \\"What's going on here...??\\"  Question after question.<br /><br />I think every american resident should watch this movie.  This is by no means comparable to Bible, but it is an eye opener, very informative documentary.  Borrow it, buy it, rent it...whatever you do, you gotta watch it.  You have nothing to lose, and you may even learn something new if you pay attention.<br /><br />Praying for a more peaceful tomorrow!
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I would love to finally own this concert and too bad Led Zeppelin pulled out.  I hope this time McCartney's mike will be on - remember when he did \\"Let It be\\"?  Perhaps today's technology could correct this.
6301969294|5.0|This is one of those timeless stories that I believe will get more and more relevant as time goes on (especially when we have President's like Bush in the White House.)  But I digress...Great filmmaking and acting by a stellar cast that includes Gary Cooper as Howard Rourke and Patricial Neal as Dominic Francon.  Having been a HUGE fan of the novel I was completely taken in by the film.  Ayn Rand wrote the script and it is one of her best (she also wrote the original screenplay for one of my favorite films of all time \\"Love Letters\\" starring Joseph Cotten and Jennifer Jones.)  Beautiful, striking cinematography and a note perfect score by the legendary Max Steiner make this a must see in my book.
B000002GGU|4.0|I darn near shredded my tender vocal cords trying to sound like the protagonist of \\"Summer of '69.\\" That was the epic summer of '85. Nineteen years later, I'm still happy when this song comes on the radio. Of course I get a lump in my throat over that final \\"and now the times are changin'/look at everything that's come and gone\\" stanza...this coming of age masterpiece is made all the better by the fact that Bryan Adams still had his baby teeth in 1969, putting \\"Summer\\" smack in the middle of the nowhere rock geography shared by Journey's \\"south Detroit\\" and Kim Wylde's \\"east California.\\"<br /><br />At this point, the tracks are imprinted on my DNA. \\"Heaven\\" is an evergreen, \\"One Night Love Affair\\" is a tasty opener, \\"Run To You\\" is a dark ode to having a l'il teen something something on the side. Yep, Reckless is prime sanitized Telecaster flannel rock. I love every song on this record. And anyone who loves Reckless as much as I do tends to keep it to herself. But you're gonna buy this CD, even though you already have it on vinyl and cassette, so you're equally busted.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool are a band that has a very unique sound, extremely unique. <br />Not only is it unique, its interesting, the musicianship is flawless and very detailed. <br /> <br />The good thing about Tools music is that it opens up your eyes for what music can be. Tools songs are'nt just usual songs. They take detours in sound, build ups and stop start thrashes of guitars. <br /> <br />While the actual songs on this record are all good, it is quite annoying to have a record like this with so many interludes of noises and static etc. <br /> <br />Surely interludes of interesting instrumentals or electronic sounds that keep your ears open would have made this record alot better than it is. <br />In other words - \\"It should be about the music!!!\\" <br /> <br />But the standout tracks make up for it. <br /> <br />Tool is'nt Metal. <br />I'd like to call it physcodallic experimental thrash/hard rock if I may. <br /> <br />This is some of the most interesting music you will hear. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|First, to the reviewer below me....if you think \\"Star Wars\\" is a war-promoting film, than you better get your senses straight. \\"Star Wars\\" was not meant to depict war as realistically as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" did. It's a pure fantasy-driven film, nothing more. Plus, with scenes like Luke nearly dying in the Hoth battlefield, I don't think it portrays war in a bright picture either. <br /> <br />As for the DVDs: well, what's already been said here that isn't true? Lucas just had to tamper with the original trilogy so that he could tie in the elements from the vastly inferior prequels (um, shouldn't he have done the reverse when he was making the prequels?!). No matter what anyone says, these changes ARE distracting and take away from the story.  <br /> <br />I'm very disapointed with the Amazon reviewer (and to anyone who defends the dvd set)who said the changes were \\"minor\\" and for fans of the originals to just get over it. What frightens me most about the release is how Lucas is so adament in burying the original films from existance. This is more than just debating on whether Greedo shot first; this is Lucas rewriting history, butchering the content either to fulfill an ego or profit. Erasing Sebastian Shaw's image at the end of ROtJ with Hayden Christenson is akin to the way Russian communists erased political enemies from photographs: \\"Oh him? He never existed.\\"  <br /> <br />I agree with everyone else that Lucas can do what he wants with the original trilogy, as long as consumers can have access to the original films just as they were. Frustratingly, Lucas won't even give us that option. Thumbs down on this release.     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|2.0|I think its about time \\"Green Day\\" got back to where they belong. <br /> <br />Dookie and Insomniac their first records (forget the other two before that) were proper rock/punk guitar albums, with grungy riffs (particularly Insomniac) - revoluntionary albums. <br /> <br />Then along came Nimrod, good album something different, but Green Day did'nt carry on making the catchy hard rocking cool riffed music they were good at, they made \\"WARNING\\" a piece of commercial crap as it turned out, and heres more of it. <br /> <br />AMERICAN IDIOT sounds way to manufactured compared with Insomniac or Dookie. <br /> <br />Get back to making the music that you made you who you were, and who you should be. <br /> <br />AMERICAN IDIOT is lacking the punch that their other albums have. (Dookie and Insomniac)and won't stand the test of time. <br /> <br />Let hope for better things next time.
B0000214F0|2.0|I saw the first run of this strange film back in 1980 I think...and my date and I both thought it was a hot film...except for the gory parts that weren't as interesting as some of the sex scenes.  But a few years ago I bought the DVD and watched in amazement at how badly this film comes off today.  Its as if its an \\"R\\" movie trying to be an \\"X\\" movie.  Nothing shocking in the sex department...and hey...what else matters in this type of film?  We are not \\"freaky\\" if we just want to watch Star Wars or something....the film was produced by the man who owns Penthouse Magazine...and he was a freak...back in the day...but time has made this film look cheap and less than interesting now...Capt. Freaky says \\"save your money on this one\\"!
B00005JN7O|4.0|One thing's for sure: director Kerry Conran truly loves film.  An avowed \\"Star Wars\\" fan who threw in a fun allusion to George Lucas's first film \\"THX-1138\\" (look out for a strategically positioned room number), it's clear he also adores Golden Age Hollywood, the art deco movement and World War II era pop culture. This is his love letter. <br /> <br />The film is set in 1939 - no wonder, as it's the year usually described as \\"Hollywood's best year ever\\". One of the brightest winks to the audience is a building that looks exactly like the sphere and cone design of the 1939 World's Fair, aka \\"The World of Tomorrow\\". But visual and thematic references to Golden Age films are abundant: \\"Metropolis,\\" \\"Things to Come,\\" \\"Lost Horizon,\\" \\"King Kong,\\" \\"Gunga Din,\\" \\"The Island of Doctor Moreau,\\" \\"Only Angels Have Wings,\\" \\"Why We Fight\\". It also has a slightly corny, slightly tongue in cheek take on 1930s serial pictures like \\"Buck Rogers,\\" which also inspired \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones.\\" (Intrepid girl reporter Paltrow wears almost exactly the same clothing and hairstyle as Allison Doody in \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\".) <br /> <br />More traditional, classic science fiction seems to have been an influence too, namely \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" and \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\". Theater marquees in this futuristic New York show \\"Kings Row\\" (a soapy film in which a young Ronald Reagan showed dramatic promise) and \\"Wuthering Heights\\", the 1939 classic that launched Laurence Olivier into movie stardom. <br /> <br />The beautiful images are softened into a 1940s sepia tone, and if you're any kind of retro fan, you'll love just looking at this movie, filled with special effects (the list of FX houses that worked on the picture goes on and on during the credits, even featuring the house \\"Pixel Liberation Front\\").   <br /> <br />This is a fun popcorn movie, groundbreaking in its use of FX, but falling short of truly spectacular. The script shows some wit, and almost manages tosound the same screwball romance notes seen in classics like \\"His Girl Friday\\" and \\"Bringing Up Baby\\". The four leads - Law, Paltrow, Ribisi and Jolie - have some of the best acting chops in their generation, and Olivier is the one actor in a million who resonates as brightly in death as he did in life. And the story postulates an intriguing alternate history in which neither the Reichstag or the Hindenburg burn down, World War I starts and finishes even earlier, and where Germany and Russia are about to be invited into a League of Nations-like utopia. Not to mention that women command vessels and squadrons in the Royal British Navy.  <br /> <br />But when it comes to story, script, and acting, it's not that the film fails or is even mediocre - the acting is solid, and the script is a cut above the usual action/adventure fare. Still, the special effects and images simply overshadow everything else.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you love space opera adventure or watching grainy, B&W classic films, you should enjoy this.  <br />
0812550706|1.0|It was a grind. One game after another. I kept thinking that anytime something new would happen. You can't save a boring book with 2 chapters. This is not a great SF; in fact, it is a very low end one. Additionally, good SF must be believeable; this was not.
B000084T18|5.0|I don't get it why some people rated this album 1 star. This is such a good album. The beats for this album are great. G-UNIT.
B000089CJI|5.0|As a fan of John Mayer, Jack Johnson, and other guitar focused songwriters, no one could have predicted that i would love this album. The songwriting is amazing on \\"Give Up\\" and I immediately have tried to find out as much as humanly possible on teh Postal Service. FOr at least 3 reasons you should buy this album! <br />1)NOthing better-this song is perhaps the most 80s newwave throwback i have ever heard, but it does it in a way that is unabashed and not cheesy! it treats the genre with respect not nostalgia which I think is awesome. It made me, the listener respect it more. <br />2) Brand New C0lony- for these pantydroppin lyrics alone: \\"I'll be your platform shoes, undo what heredity did to you, so you dont have to strain to look into my eyes. I'll be your overcoat buttoned up to the throat with the collar up so you wont catch cold. I wanna take you far, from the cynics in the town...and kiss you on the mouth....\\" <br />3)THis place is a prison- this song is darker but not so dark that it is intangible. with lyrics like \\"Its not a party if it happens every night\\" makes it relatable to everyone.  <br />I also love the song order- the album starts out with the light and poppy songs and ends with a darker song and then an awesome instrumental (which i am usually not a fan of) <br /> <br />thanks for changing my opinion of this genre!!!!!
B00000JJSK|4.0|This CD is killer - why is it out of print!!!.  A departure from Kyuss for sure, less of the muddy sound (which was sweet) and more straight ahead rock.  Garcia's vocals are so strong and emotive.  I wouldn't say they carry the album because the musicianship is so dialed in.  But his vocals and lyrics always seem to make everything gel.  Well crafted songs, no filler. <br /> <br />I got this baby on Ebay for $28 because it was out of print and I'm glad I did.  Pick it up if you can find one. <br /> <br />Viva la Stoner Rock!!
B00005JMX6|1.0|Answer: Wasted two hours off my life by watching this horrendous movie.  Do you remember \\"Risky Business\\"? You know, that movie where Tom Cruise was an uptight high school student who wanted to go to some Ivy League school who learns to say, well, \\"f**k it\\", by falling in love with a hooker with a heart of gold(are there any other kinds, really?) and defeating her pimp? Remember? Well, this movie ai'nt no \\"Risky Business\\".  Here, Emile Hirsch, from the decent \\"Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys\\", plays an uptight high school student who dreams dreams of going to Georgetown who has to learn to say, well, uhm, \\"f**k it\\" when he falls in love with a porn star with a heart of gold(are there any other kinds really?) and has to defeat her producer(Timothy Olymphant).  Oh, and do you remember when Tom Cruise had to come up with a lot of money before his parents came home so he decided to hold a party full of prostitutes? Well, in this movie, get this, Emile Hirsch has to come up with a lot of money by the end of a weekend by... well, I won't ruin the lovely surprise for you.  \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is a rip-off of \\"Risky Business\\". We get that. And that's all right, as long as you put an origanel spin on it, right? Well, not here.  The director and screenwriters have a clear contempt for humanity. The film is so poorly written, executed, and for the most part, acting that I found myself counting the numerous continuity errors that pop up.  The movie is poorly lit and shot, with a cheap look that a Lifetime movie surpasses. Choppy editing and cheap looking slow motion don't help, neither does the fact that none of the scenes flow into one another, which makes you think your watching a bunch of sub-par \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skits.  And I could forgive this, almost, if I a)understood the actions of the actors or b)really cared, but the script never cares about stuff like realistic charactors or devolpment. Ha! thats for good movies!!! We are meant to believe that the Tom Cruise, ohcrap, Emile Hirsch, charactor is willing to get beaten up, face down the probability of a prison sentance(though this plot devolpment is false) and do all other sorts of stupid things for a girl he, nor we, get to know. The title charctor, played by Elisha Cuthbert who has confused acting with pouting and trying to look pretty, is never a real charactor, merely a part of the lead charactors imagination.  Oh, I forgot the two buddy charactors, a quiet, nebish guy who has to learn to like himself(oh, how nice a message) and an irriating, grating pervert who likes to watch porn with his friends and says some of the most horrendous lines in movie history that I actually crunged at the presumption. And I've seen \\"Clerks\\" a thousand times.  I am an objective watcher, so I weill give props to Timothy Olymphant, who despite a crappy, sleazy charactor, gives a relativly good performance, although he is playing the same role he played in the much better \\"Go\\" from a few years back.  \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is sleazy, dirty, dumb, mean, unfunny and unrealistic. It would've been the worst movie of the year if it weren't for that damn M.Night Shyamalan and his \\"Village\\" debacle.  Don't even watch this sucker if it comes on T.V.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Oh wow. This movie is awesome. I could write for weeks and not make you think this movie is as good as it really is. Everything is depicted so well. I remember seeing it in the theaters and the only thing you can hear after the movie ends is the occasional person crying. It is amazing. It really really shows what Christ went through. Makes you realize the scourging wasn't just a couple of hits with a club. He had so little skin left on him by the end it was awful! And the real shocker is that they didn't show all the wounds either...not by a long shot. Like I already mentioned though I could write a 40 page interpretive essay on it and it wouldn't be good enough. So the best thing for you to do is just watch it yourself!
B0002858YS|5.0|This album blew me away. Of course, I bought the CD because I loved the song \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" but surprisingly, I don't play that song as much as I play the other songs on the album. Brandon Flowers has an incredible voice and the CD as a whole rocks. There isn't one bad track on it! Some people have criticized Brandon Flowers for not writing lyrics that are poetic enough, which, the lyrics to \\"Somebody Told Me\\" don't show his amazing writing ability. But the other songs' lyrics are amazing. (ie. \\"I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere, then watched her disappear into the midnight show.\\" -'Midnight Show'to give an example.)To make a long review short, BUY THIS ALBUM. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have seen many of the widescreen star wars on episode IV have an error in the dvd player on scene 26.  But the same disc might play fine in another DVD player.  About 1 in 6 sold have come back with people having errors playing the disc.  In seen 27 of episode IV the video and audio is choppy in 3 areas.
B00006CXSS|1.0|If you ejoyed classical American propaganda (like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\") , you won't be dissapoited with this trash. To me this is bad comedy with same ridicolous scenes. For example I watched an episode about german siege of Bastogne. And what did I saw !?! At the end of the episode American just casualy running through while Germans doing nothing to stop him. No Mr. Tom Hanks and your merry men, I wasn't convinced that such actions chrushed Third Reich.
B00005221L|3.0|Needless to say I am disappointed with this DVD. As much as I love the movie, I cannot say the same for the DVD. I own both the original DVD released a few years ago and the recent Collector's Edition. The original DVD lacked in the special features department, except for the theatrical trailer and the transer used for the DVD suffered from its share of grain and print damage. The Collector's Edition, while it had a separate disc just for the special features, it appears to have the same transfer from the original Predator DVD. The Collector's Edition suffers from print damage and grain. You'd think that by releasing this Collector's Edition that Fox would have taken the time to attempt to clean up the film, but they didn't. I guess they can justify having the fans double-dip for another DVD of Predator with the inclusion of a separate DVD of special features. But, to tell you the truth, if you already own the previous DVD of Predator and you're not into the whole special features thing, then save your money and don't purchase this Collector's Edition. However, if you don't already own Predator and/or you're a hardcore-fan salivating over the special features bonus DVD and you don't care about a below-average film transfer, then by all means purchase this DVD.
B0001V6ZJ8|1.0|The film deserves 5 stars but the DVD only gets 1.  Why:  no letterbox format.  After waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on DVD, why would they give us full screen / pan & scan?  Yes, the quality and color are great but oh, what we're missing on the sidelines.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I went to see this movie on opening weekend, at a tiny four screen theatre that runs mainly independent films. When we arrived in the early afternoon, people were crammed into the entrance and flooding out to the street. There were all types of people, young liberals, old liberals , conservatives of all ages and professions, some holding pro- Bush signs, many expressing the opposite opinion. We were told the shows were sold out untill that night, despite the movie playing on two of the four screens. As we were waiting to buy our tickets for the 8:30 showing, one of the theatres let out. Some people looked outraged, but not at michael moore. They were amazed that so much had been kept from them. Even today, months after F9/11 has exposed some of the glaring omissions the media made in covering Iraq, There are many things in this movie that are found nowhere else, that no company has the nerve to show, because this footage starkly contraficts the rosy picture the Bush administration has tried to paint for us. Moore shows viewers things that we have not seen, guides us through a twisted path of information, but lets us draw our own conclusions about Bush and his administration. Everyone should see this movie. If you are a democrat, you will love it. If you are a republican or independent, and open-minded enough to consider another person's point ov view, you will be deeply moved, and you just may find that you can no longer support George W. Bush. This movie may very well tip the balance in this election. Bravo Michael Moore! You have made history.
B00005JMYI|1.0|Personally, I choose the latter of the two.  This movie was uninspired, the writing was terrible:  it was a waste of my money.  This movie had, dare I say \\"bright spots,\\" but these times came few and very, VERY far between.  The only reason I sat through this entire movie was because it was part of a double feature paired with \\"Envy\\" (which was actually worse than \\"Anchorman.\\") <br /> <br />I am a big Will Ferrel fan, but he was terrible in this movie.  Ron Burgandy is too much like some of his other characters.  For being the featured actor in this movie, they didn't showcase his talent what-so-ever.  Christina Applegate, not right for this part.  Paul Rudd, whom I usually like, was also bad, athough I think I blame it more on the writing.  I do have to give some props to Steve Carrell who was the funniest, if not the only funny character in this movie. <br /> <br />\\"Anchorman\\" definitely did NOT live up to the hype.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The only advice I can give you before you buy is:  if you don't believe me, go and rent this movie so you can see it for the steaming pile it really is.  If this movie, along with \\"Envy,\\" \\"One True Thing,\\" and \\"Jason X\\" disappeared forever, I would be a happy camper.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|The CD is very nice. But the person who mixed the tracks put Sarah in the background. I felt as though her voice was coming around and over the background scores (which were beautiful, by the way). I bought the CD for her vocals and am disappointed that she's not the prominent sound on the disk.
B00004ZD69|3.0|I would've given it a 3.5 if that were possible ..however, I think the first disk is melodically weak. It drones on that for what seems like forever, but it's not a hypnotic drone it's just a \\"when-the-hell-is-the-next-note-coming?\\" drone. Furthermore, the \\"Arco mini-market\\" sample is distracting. It's like \\"wait.. what did she say?\\" It takes away from the music.  <br /> <br />I really like GSYBE but most of their albums are crammed with polical wash. Thankfully, \\"Lift..\\" isn't. The speaches can be nauseating. It's not that I'm so patroitic, it's just that I hate political art. I like art to be more personable. Which is why I'm ok with the \\"penetrate the corridor of God\\" speech on \\"Lift..\\"  <br /> <br />That's why I didn't give it a \\"5\\". All that aside, the second disk is amazing. The orchestration is incredible. Sonically, this record is amazing. Also, it's great how the band transitions into different \\"movements.\\" If you're into atmostpheric/ambient music you should buy this record. It's worth it for the second disk alone.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot... This cd is absolutely awesome... from their great, slow and catchy \\"Wake me up when september ends, to their very punky \\"She's a rebel, This Cd is easily the greatest of the year... <br /> <br />1. American Idiot 18/20- a typical Greenday song that you will hear on the radio quite a lot... great song <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia 20/20- Great, awesome, and extremely suprising Greenday song... well, 5 songs... but the songs fit just perfectly, one of my favs. <br /> <br />3. Holiday 18/20- this is a great song, awesome lyrics. <br /> <br />4. Blvd of broken dreams 19/20- this song has been stuck in my head since i got this album... i like this song alot... also has some very nice lyrics... greatly sung by Billie Joe  <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting- 17/20 Nice song... a chant song really... quite catchy <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy- 19/20 Nice,Fast Greenday. An Awesome song <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine- 16/20 an ok song... unneccesarily slow <br /> <br />8. She's a rebel 19/20- great, punk, greenday song <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl 17/20- strange beggining, catchy chorus... ok song  <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb 20/20- this song is awesome!!! Just a great song. <br /> <br />11. Homecoming 20/20- the other 9-minuter on the cd... i like it slightly less than Jesus of suburbia... but awesome enough to get a 20 <br /> <br />12.Whatsername 19/20-  an awesome way to end the Cd... a little too slow...
B000000H66|5.0|I like this Death album alot because of the heaviness and technicality. Chuck Schuldiner was not only a wonderful musician, but he was a creative lyricist as well. His poetic, thought provoking lyrics make pansies like Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, and Limp Bizkit look like the jokers that they are today. As for the guitarwork, Chuck's lead guitarwork on this album is just as great as ever, I mean the solos are just jaw dropping. Drummer Gene Hoglan just destroys, his snare blasts and lightning fast double bass will have you headbanging after having a sip of a YJ Stinger energy drink. Symbolic, 1,000 Eyes, Zero Tolerance, Empty Words are my favorite songs here.<br /><br />Death rules, R.I.P Chuck, you were a great guy!
B0002OERI0|4.0|When i heard their first single American idiot, i though it was gonna be just as poppy as all the rest of their cd's.  Then i bought it and there is more slow stuff on it.  But thats ok cus there is still alot of fast punk songs like they always have.  One bad thing is that it souds soo produced.  The vocals souns almost fake because you can tell they used all kinds of things to change the sound.  But when u listen make sure the first time you dont skip any tracks cus some are about ten minutes long with 4 actual songs on one track.  Most of them dont get to the good part until aobut 3 minutes into it.  The best songs are American Idiot, Holiday, St Jimmy, homecoming, and Shes a Rebel. <br />If you like old green day.... you might not like this at first listen but believe me IT WILL GROW ON YOU.  If you like green day buy this.
B0002DB52M|1.0|I give the director credit for trying something new. On the other hand, he could not have told the absurd story in a realistic setting. Without the artificiality of the non sets, no one would believe or accept what he had to say. The casting and acting were quite good, however. I am tempted to give the movie another star for that reason but I am too repulsed by the bleak vision of humanity presented here. The moral of the story can only be that if given power over another person, anyone will ferociously use and abuse that person. In this crowd, even the upright philosopher of the group was easily corrupted, while the Kidman character, who was portrayed as a kind of saint full of forgiveness, joined them in their depravity when she got the power. Sorry, this terrible tale has no relationship to the world I live in. I do wish critics would stop automatically anointing all stories of human degradation as art. After watching this one, I felt like I needed a long shower.
B00005A1VH|4.0|Gary Cooper stars as Alvin York, a young man living in backwoods Tennessee at the outbreak of WWI.  York is a tough, heavy drinking man until he has a religious experience.  He turns his life around and is working to better his farm and win the love of a local woman.  When he's drafted for WWI, he claims exemption as a conscientious objectioner.  He struggles with the dilemma of whether to honor his religion or his country.<br /><br />\\"Sergeant York\\" is based on the real-life story of a WWI hero - Alvin York, who reportedly refused to let his story be told for decades.  Finally, he relented with the condition that Gary Cooper play him.  Even though Cooper was arguably at least a decade too old for the role, he manages to pull it off through his very likeable portrayal.  In fact, he won the first of his two Oscars for the role, winning again for \\"High Noon\\" in 1952.  Walter Brennan gives one of his finest performances as the caring country pastor, earning his fourth Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the process.<br /><br />The movie was nominated for Best Picture (losing to the even more sentimental \\"How Green Was My Valley\\") and Best Original Screenplay.  The script is quite good, and makes York's many epiphanies and re-considerations believable, which is quite a task.  Howard Hawkes's admirable directing also earned an Oscar nomination.  He's best known for madcap comedies (Bringing Up Baby, Ball of Fire) and more trenchant dramas (The Big Sleep, Red River); \\"Sergeant York\\" is a surprisingly tame movie for him.<br /><br />The film is perhaps a little too docile - filled with very gentle somewhat corny humor, prime Americana, and affirmation of the Protestant work ethic. Perhaps as a result, it's rather dated when compared to many other classics from the era - it feels more like a Capra film.  Overall, Sergeant York is a solid movie, likely to appeal most to fans of films that are very sentimental.  I wish that it had a bit more bite.r />
B000069HK2|5.0|the used is an amazing band . i must of listened to there cd a million times . i saw them live at the warp tour 2003 and i fell in love ! usually i hear some bands cd's and there good and then you hear them live and your like wow they suck but the used is a different story there just great live ! some of there songs really helped me out a lot . and i love the screaming that burt(lead singer)always incorporates in the songs it just makes it that much better !! the used is my favorite punk rock band cause they write there own songs and there not about being famous they just want people to hear good music . all and all i think they are one excellent band and i recommend there cd to anyone who likes good rock music !! i love them and you will to !
B000059H99|5.0|Sometimes the simple ideas, when well done, accomplish as much or more that the elaborate plots, settings, and special effects of major epics.  The concept of \\"Rocky\\" was certainly a simple idea; a club fighter going nowhere gets the chance of a lifetime and makes the most of it.  The idea behind the plot is believable and the characters are fairly believable as well.  Sylvester Stallone does a credible job as the unknown boxer.  He is a likeable guy who doesn't take anything too seriously.  Even as a \\"muscle\\" for the mob, he tries to reason with his \\"clients\\" rather than do the work he was hired to do.  He has a thing for the sister of his friend and his style of romancing just adds to his audience appeal.  His eventual opponent in the ring, Apollo Creed, is an obvious satire on Muhammed Ali.  His flair vs. Rocky's \\"ah shucks\\" style also adds to the audience appeal.  Things meander until the fight draws near and Rocky starts to get a better focus on his training.  His workouts and the accompanying music help to get the audience stirred up for the main event.   <br /> <br />The fight is an interesting event.  Most boxing fans would regonize that the fight would have been \\"called\\" long before the final round.  We are not made aware, until later Rocky movies, that fighters can actually die in the ring.  However, we know that we are in a modern day fairy tale so why let such minor points distract us.  However, the beatings that each fighter administers on the other may have succeeded too well on the screen.  The excess just got worse in later Rocky films.  The ending of the fight helped, I think, to add to the power of the movie by keeping us focussed on the improbable rather than the impossible.  The music, the calls for Adrian, the rare humility from the champ all create a goose bump of an ending. <br /> <br />Rocky is a great film that I have seen many times simply because I always toss away the remote when I come across it on TV.  It stirs something good and positive in all of us.  Everyone of us wants to think we'll rise up to the occassion if lady luck finds us while we're just killing time.  Usually, when an actor creates a starring vehicle for himself, the result usually is disappointing.  Stallone can be proud of what he put together in \\"Rocky\\"  The disappointment and over-promotion comes from not stopping with just one Rocky.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Wow. This is the first reaction after watching these films. Not only is the audio excellent, but the clarity and resolution are truly spectacular. And, what is the best is the fact that none of the films lose their artistic quality that made the originals so popular. Now all we need are the Original Versions and I will not make anymore complaints. However, these are not the original versions, but Lucas' tinkered with versions. Again, Greedo shoots first. Yes, Hayden Christensen replaces Sebastian Shaw as Anakin's ghost. But, with some luck and some time, these deviations will be forgotten. Right now, I am only concerned with the pure joy that these TWO classics, (Sorry, Jedi) are finally on DVD. As for the extras, I can make the assessment that Lucas is omitting some things, but these will do for now.
B0000524CY|5.0|THE STORY OF THE EXORCIST 1973 RELEASE IS A TRUE SHOCKER.

B000002UVX|5.0|Although I truly do love the Experience, after I listened to this album, I decided that compared to these guys, they suck. Jimi is really on top form here, taking more time to build up intensity on his solos instead of knocking you out within the first two seconds. I am certainly not criticizing his playing, who can do that? What I am saying is what results is a more listenable performance, with his change in emotions evident. Drummer Buddy Miles is a very nice compliment to Jimi's style of playing, better I think than even Mitch Mitchell was from the Experience. And Billy Cox brings Jimi and Buddy together seamlessly. When Jimi cuts out for a solo--almost constantly--you don't feel as though there's a chunk missing from the rhythym section like you did with the Experience. Noel Redding wasn't a bassist, he was a converted guitarist, which explains alot.  <br /> <br />The Album itself--and I capitalize \\"Album\\" because it is worthy of being capitalized--is nothing short of brilliant, tied for first best live album with \\"The Allman Brothers Live at Fillmore East.\\" Every track is magnificent, especially \\"Machine Gun,\\" and \\"We Gotta Live Together.\\" I do kind of wish that they had all been Hendrix originals, instead of Buddy Miles chipping in with a couple of his own, though they really aren't bad at all. Quite good, actually. Jimi should have sang them all, though. My favorite part on the record is on \\"Machine Gun,\\" when Jimi starts making the bomb sound effects with his guitar. You just can't resist showing off, can you Jimi?
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore isn't a god or anything more than a fine filmmaker but I praise him for speaking out in such uncertain times.  Usually his films are about him parading around getting people in uncomfortable situations but in FAHRENHEIT he smartly lets the footage do the talking.  If anyone makes a fool of BUSH and his policies it's Bush.  Michael Moore is just presenting the obvious truths about our misguided leader.  Anyone who bashes the film is just in denial.  A very powerful film!

0765301598|3.0|This (hopefully) last \\"Legend\\" tale was the worst.  Like other reviewers, I devoured the original series and even liked the three \\"family\\" series.  But something changed in the \\"Legends\\" Series - the story not only got off track but introduced elements that were disconcerting in the least.   <br /> <br />Where to start? The sadism was so bad that when Erasmus or one of the Titans drew near to a human I skipped ahead, unable to stand any more elevated rationalizations from these monsters. Besides, we are never told why they act as they do - what drove them to this madness? Speaking of madness, the cult of Serena was one of the wackiest ever.  The idea of unarmed mobs taking over a governnment was absurd. <br /> <br />Then we had those interminable battle scenes that were the epitomy of dullness. The conversations among the robots were  ridiculous, more like something on Mystery Science Theater. There were too many characters and the hero (Vor Atriedes)remained distant, never acquiring a personality.  Also the characters made decisions totally \\"out of character\\" again and again. The writing style (three pages/chapter) is annoying, making it seem like a series of vignettes instead of a seamless tale.  <br /> <br />On the plus side, we learn the origins of the Spacing Guild  (Norma, my favorite character, appeared briefly). The origins of the Bene Geserit - more an accident than a purposeful event - was a good saga. We learn why the Harkonnens are hated, the Atriedes admired and the Corrinos in command. I hope the authors move on to other things...drop the robots, the battles and get on with the mythology. <br />
0440180295|5.0|There was a moment of sublime significance where it all came together for me in Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\"  It is near the beginning of thr novel.  Vonnegut has just finished describing a massacre that had happened in the war.  Just at the moment he describes how eerily quiet everything is, a bird interrupts the silence and says \\"Poo-dee-tweet.\\"  You might ask yourself, \\"how in the world could that be significant?\\"  After you have finished reading the novel it will make complete sense.      \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is also told from a significant point of view.  What view that is you will have to discover on your own.  The book starts and ends with Kurt Vonnegut telling us how exactly he is going to tell us this story, and in conclusion, a brief explanation of why.  Everything in between follows Billy, Vonnegut's main character, and \\"alter ego\\" in a way. Billy's life supposedly has many parallels with Vonnegut's.  The heart of the story is Billy's surreal journey through World War II.  More specifically, his experience concerning the Dresden bombings that occurred near the end of the war.  The book shifts in and out of different time periods, and rolls along in a non-orthodox fashion.  There really is no clear cut beginning or ending.  The style in which \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" was written makes perfect sense though.  It is just difficult to explain everything without giving away the secrets and symbolism that readers should be privileged to enjoy on their own.  I know the description of the plot I gave was fuzzy, but there really is no normal, flowing plot.  It is all over the map.  That is precisely how it should be, if you realize what Vonnegut is trying to tell us.    \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is written with extremely dark humor and a very sarcastic overtone.  The book does not want you to take it seriously, which is, in fact, a direct parallel on the pain that Vonnegut feels when writing it.  You can see behind all the lines that this is a very hard task forVonnegut to complete.  He does not want to fully realize the pain war caused him, so he makes a joke about it.  He treats everything lightly and sarcastically because that is the only way he can make his mind cope with the tragedy it had on his life.  After \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" was written, Vonnegut thought it was a failure.  Vonnegut thinking it was a failure only adds to its greatness.  In reality, it is war that is the failure, so any book about it would be one that Vonnegut could not view as a success.  \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is remarkable in the sense that it gives us a non-sentimental, in your face view of war.  It can be funny and sad all in one moment.  It paints of beautiful picture of how absurd war really is, and underneath it all, the damage it does to those involved.    Grade: A
B00005JM0B|3.0|With the loss of James Cameron as director, the core of the Terminator storyline seems to have disappeared. At least in the second movie the line \\"no fate but what you make\\" became a major theme... apparently John Connors character was just messing with his young self giving him false hope, because the war still happened. While a great summer flick, and definitly a Terminator movie (lots of people get Terminated) I feel that the franchise has gone the way of the Star Wars and the Matrix, and lost that sense of itself that was so appealing.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've purchased in ages.  Rice writes songs that are simple, convincing, addictive, memorable.  A gem from beginning to end.
0767840135|1.0|After seeing Mystere, Vareka and Dralion I was truly dissapointed in the performance of Quidam.   <br />Artistically the music, the theme was dark and gloomy and it lacked tremendously the pizzazz of the other shows. <br /> <br />The performance were nothing spectacular and I was little baffled from the wonderful reviews it received from the others. <br /> I am not saying this was the worst show I have ever seen but compared to the others it truly was a disappointment.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend to check the other three before you venture into Quidam. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|I've noticed that many reviewers are complaining because there are no extras on this DVD.  So what!?!  The point of this movie isn't what Mel Gibson or any of the actors think.  The point is what's happening on the screen.  If you don't get that, you don't get the message.  Why cloud the true message with a bunch of talking heads who are only going to say what's been said in countless magazine/newspaper interviews?  This is a powerful movie that needs no explanation.  It captures a part of Jesus' life that has been overly sanitized.  We (Christians) know that Jesus died for us, but how many of us have actually considered \\"how\\" he died for us?  Watching this movie should make a lot of people sit up and take notice.  It's not an easy movie to watch, but once again, that's the point.  You're supposed to feel uncomfortable.  You're supposed to be horrified by the brutality and callousness of what happened to the Son of God.  Mel Gibson did a magnificent job of capturing the last hours of Jesus' life.  He didn't sugarcoat anything; he didn't downplay any of the \\"ugly\\" aspects.  I respect him and this movie for that.  This is definitely a movie that stays with you after you watch it.  Hopefully, if you watched it in the right frame of mind, the true message should stay with you for the rest of your life.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a series of six interlocked tales - encompassing a wide array of eras, locales, and genres -in which the protagonist in each story is impacted in some significant manner by the tale told in the preceding section (or the following section, as the book's tales wind out in reverse order in the second half).     So...the stories we tell, and the sense we make of things, have meaning.  I'm not sure if Mitchell intended this a straightforward(ish) reincarnation tale, or if the larger theme has something to do with the idea that the stories we tell survive us, perhaps at least partially define what it means to be human, or enable us to retain some vestige of humanity in the face of forces (imperialism, slavery, corportization, or just our own worst impulses) designed to strip that away.  The centerpiece of the book does take place in a future world in which civilization has been literally reduced to the ability to remember, and relay that rememberance forward in a sort of verbal folklore.    This is a good, moving, well-written, and entertaining book.  One's patience for it is probably dependent on one's degree of exposure to genre fiction - I think someone approaching this from the perspective of classic \\"literary fiction\\" might find it off-putting - part of the fun here is the manner in which Mitchell plays with the tropes and cliche of various genres (sci-fi, hardboiled crime fiction, belles lettres, etc) across the six tales.   That said, there's lots of \\"high literary\\" enjoyment to be had here - the writing is stellar, and there's lots of good thematic linkage (boats, bridges, musical themes, etc.) that add quite a bit of depth.      I would also like to dispel the notion that this is a \\"difficult\\" book in the style of David Foster Wallace, Thomas Pynchon, etc.  It is just extraordinarily fun to read. The novel's overarching themes are challenging and profound, but it is also a page-turner of the highest order, and in that sense a real celebration of the various genres it exploits and parodies.  Highly recommended.
0767802470|2.0|They got what they deserved, remember the Germans were fighting so they could kill all the Jews and take over the world, why would we want them to live?  WE DONT.  Maybe if i was German or they movie was about Americans i could realte, but im sorry they deserved worse then what they got.  Its too long, it doesnt have enough action, no drama, the score is bad, the acting is boderline soap opera, and the dialogue is perverted.  U571 is better but not much, if your looking for a better Wolfgang film check out Troy (a great great great film) its a million times better, if you want a better war movie check out Saving Private Ryan of course, its the best war movie ever made.  4 out of a 10 for this.
0393035158|4.0|Harris is to be commended for convincingly adding his voice to the growing realization that established religions are not only obsolescent but can be extremely dangerous in today's world. He not only castigates extremists but moderates who tolerate the beliefs that motivate extremists. He gives voice to the exasperation some folks harbor toward religion and perhaps provides the catharsis necessary to just get over it and move on.<br /><br />  After all, Judaism, Christianity and Islam were established when most folks thought the world was flat and was controlled by the gods. Back then they didn't have the knowledge of our world that science has gained for us in just the past few centuries. Given what they knew then, those religions may have been an improvement over what came before (altho' politics played a role in the establishment of all three). But that was then and this is now, so let's move on.<br /><br />  Move on to what? Perhaps folks are not moving because they don't know what to move toward. That's what I propose in my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\" While acknowledging the negatives in religion, I try to take a positive approach in order to examine why and how theism originated, and discover what it is in human nature that enables theism to still persist in spite of its obvious obsolescence.
B00012FXAE|4.0|The first half of this film is like the first one. It's very slow and focuses more on scaring us rather than thrilling us. But then the second part kicks in, and the action never lets up.  <br /> <br />This film does that rare little thing that not many sequels can do: it surpasses the original. Everything about the film is better. The effects, the action and of course, the Aliens. They are more convincing this time around, due to a great blend of animatronics and puppetering, and as a result we are allowed to see more of them.  <br /> <br />Also, this film introduces us to the Alien Queen. She is one nasty mother ******. Also, I think that she was actually designed by the director of the film, James Cameron, as well as many other things. So this is HIS film, in every sense of the word.    <br /> <br />The acting is great, but the film can slow down at times, which does hamper your viewing pleasure. The additional seventeen minutes are good, though. I thought that they made the film better.  <br />
B00005U122|5.0|I gotta start by saying that I am a DVD collector. I own over 100 music DVDs ranging from Supertramp, Fleetwood Mac, Depech Mode, Sade, Pink Floyd (of course) to America, U2, Dylan, Springsteen and you name the rest.  <br /> <br />In the flesh does by FAR outperform all of them in terms of sound, arrangement, production, performance, and above all music. Roger Waters is just amazing. The guitar is out of this world. The background vocals are mesmerizing, and the instrumental arrangement is absolutely awesome.  <br /> <br />Just a glance at the crowd and you will feel the passion, excitement, and pure cheer in their moods. I envy every single one of them for attending the concert. <br /> <br />A Pink Folyd fan or not, this musical tour-de-force is undescribale. You gotta see and feel it. I am still in search for another DVD out there that can outdo In the Flesh. If you know of one, please share it with me.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, I am not biased since I used to lean much more toward Gilmore than Waters, but this performance proved me wrong. It will prove many other Gilmore fans wrong as well.  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd is not dead by any means, it just switched name to Roger Waters.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Bowling for Columbine was a better documentary than F911, however F911 is a far more powerful motion picture with much wider reaching implications. Forget the slapstick humor, South Park'ish cartoon interludes or much of Moore, because here Mike just lets the neo-conservatives, right wing media, senators and the odd President of the United States of America make fun of themselves without them even having to try that hard. However the moment that a dead Iraqi baby is held up to the screen is the moment that you realize that Moore is no longer concerned with giving us that many giggles and also that this documentary is going to cause significant problems for Bush's reelection campaign.<br /><br />We are hit with a barrage of appalling film reels, excluded by the mainstream US news, that impressed the judges at Cannes, because 99% of F911 is all about what you WHERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. F911 will give you a news update of 4 years from 2001 to 2004 that has been missing from your lives, simply because the material is considered anti-American or unpatriotic to show on national television (but Iraqis have seen plenty of it on their own!)... and ALL of it packs a whopping punch to boot.<br /><br />It is clear from watching the first few minutes of F911 that Mike has one goal in mind - to identify Bush as a problem that needs to be gotten rid off, so Moore devotes massive screen time over to his favorite Texas tongue twister and lets him get rid of himself by simply playing back for us some things that this guy has been jabbering on about over the years.......... BRING IT ON! Those where the 3 words that sent the Iraqi people ape, burning convoys, hanging US civilian bodies from bridges, kidnapping journalists and decapitating foreign workers on video camera. If it is not clear that Bush is an incredibly very stupid leader then WHO OR WHAT IS?<br /><br />After a smashing opening sequence where Bush's cabinet are all seen putting on makeup before they go on camera - showing us that these people are JUST ACTORS!, we learn that Bush had businesses funded by the Bin Ladens and was very intimate with the Saudi Royals. In fact the name he himself blacked out from his army records was none other than his business partner who made the Saudi/Bin Laden deals for him! It is blatantly obvious that a rich Saudi oil businessman is really not interested in financing a small time US oil player, but is interested in the President's son. What Moore points out is that there can be no doubt that this partnership has turned into a very bitter rivalry... with the REST OF MANKIND STUCK INBETWEEN AND GETTING THE FULL BRUNT OF WHAT IS THEIR FINANICAL/BUSINESS PROBLEM! In fact Moore even shows us how the Bush family continued their relationship with the terrorists AFTER 911!<br /><br />F911 is not a conspiracy theory. It is not about how much Bush knew about 911 or even if he was responsible for it. It is not about possible CIA operations to crash planes around America, nor are any conspiracies even touched on. In fact Moore just paints the President as a man who just likes to party with the rich, doing what the rich want him to do, helping them to get richer. On 911 his priority was with his rich friends. He allowed members of the rich Bin Laden family to leave America, because the rich Saudi ambassador asked him. As Moore so aptly points out... would Clinton have let the parents and friends of Timothy McVeigh take a flight out of the country, all together, without at least getting them on the record?<br /><br />The actual events of 911 are treated with dignity by Moore. Instead of replaying everything we have seen a hundred times before, Moore just lets the screen go black and plays us a sound recording from within the Trade Centre at the time of the attack... a deeply unsettling experience. Then we are quickly thrown into Iraq, bypassing Afghanistan as nothing more than an excuse to build another oil pipeline, and we are after Saddam while OBL remains at large. We then get to see troops on the ground playing heavy metal music on their headsets while machine gunning everything in sight, bagging Iraqis over their heads, raiding their homes looking for dissidents and generally showing people what it is like back home!... and we get plenty of that when Mike starts his rant about The Patriot Act.<br /><br />The real cream of F911 however is how the army recruits young marines, by showing up at malls in disadvantaged areas, and with a laser like ability, home in on a poor kid and manage to convince the teen to join up. It is frightening how pro these hunters are (one hunter even hints to an underage teen that he LOOKS much older!). Mike then sets out to Capital Hill to see if he can recruit a Senator's son or daughter for the marines... and obviously fails because no one with any sense would send their kids to that war... but Mike introduces us to a family that does think it makes sense, only when their son is KIA, it all changes very quickly. Near the White House the mother meets an old lady advertising the horrors of war, only to be confronted by protesters who say she is a fake. The confrontation lasts a few seconds with the mother of the marine who was KIA, but the denial on the part of the pro-war protester to acknowledge the mother's dead son at first, and then trying to justify it, shows how terribly ill some people really are.<br /><br />F911 is so full of information it can not be reviewed in 1000 words, however it is safe to say that this is the most important documentary ever made about 911 and the US government.ins at large.

B00009V7T2|5.0|On first listen of De-loused I didn't quite know what to think. It sounded like the voice of ATDI (At the Drive-In) but the music had definately changed. And for the better. Still I listened to it solid for about a month. No joke. And I saw them live. That solidified the deal. If you get the chance, even as an opener as I saw them...See The Mars Volta! <br /> <br />I later found out among what I thought was scrambled, fragmented lyrics a deep and interesting story of Julio Vengas or \\"Cerpin Taxt\\", an artist and friend of the band. Apparently Julio was shooting rat poison and went into a coma. He ended up surviving the coma only to commit suicide. It's a sad and beautifully told story from the eyes of possibly the most interesting of lyricist. I highly recommend TMV for anyone who is willing to take a journey through a violent, charismatic and eye popping world. You won't be disappointed at all. <br /> <br />Recommended tracks: son et lumiere w/ ineritatic esp, roulette dares (the haunt of), and take the veil cerpin taxt. and if you have the time. which you should make it if you don't cicatriz esp!
0800177177|5.0|This is what Dracula should have been all along! Ok, I wish Dracula and Mina would have gotten together at the end, but I guess they kinda did... Winona Ryder was perfect for the part of Mina. Gary Oldman was the best Dracula so far. I guess if I have any complaints about this movie it would have to be Keanu Reeves, it's not just his performance but, he's the wrong guy for the part, not convincing at all. The emotion evoked from this movie was incredible. You really want Dracula and Mina to \\"live happily ever after\\". This is without a doubt the most romantic \\"horror\\" movie of all time.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Yeah, the camera work might have ruined the experience, but it was so much better than the first one! The acting was so much better (especially by Julia Stiles). She had a much more bigger role as Nikki in this movie. Great twist with having Brian Cox as the bad guy in this movie.  <br /> <br />This movie beats out some spy movies (especially James Bond). Lets get Bond to fight against Bourne. Lets see who will win. (most likely bourne). Both The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy are incredible movies and kicks James Bond in the ass. Incredible! Love IT!!!!!!
B0002IU988|5.0|A friend told me about these guys so i went out and got the cd. I listened to the first couple songs and didnt pick it up again for a while. I lost one of my best friends a couple weeks ago in a car accident and at his funeral they played \\"In loving memory of\\". At the time i didnt know it was alter bridge until the next day i happened to pop the cd in the truck and listen to it on the way to school, it come to that song and i recognized it right away. Tears ran down my face and that song will be one i wont soon forget. The whole album is amazing, go out and buy it, you wont regret it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Partisan Republican's say this movie is full of lies. They are lying. That's all they do. They are great at it! I just wish the Democrats would fight fire with fire. <br />This is an important movie. Anything that gets one person to change their vote from the current fascist dictator-type Bush administration is a great thing for the USA.
0440217563|4.0|Yes, Claire left Jamie for 20 years, with good reason!  She left because he bid it, she thought him dead and raised her daughter well, as he wished.  She also risked everything to be back with him again, once she knew he did not die in battle.  Not an easy choice.  She came back to a world she hardly knew, tolerated endless trials (most modern women would not) and a little betrayal, to be with the man she loved more than life.  This book takes off where Dragonfly left off perfectly and leads us on to the next chapter of Claire and Jamie's lives.  As in Outlander and again in Dragonfly, life in that time is not easy or sweet, but the good can be found and savored, as our characters did, dispite insurmountable obstacles.  This is not a series of books to be undertaken lightly, which is the meat of the whole endeavor, but the end result is just as it should be.  Keep the faith!  I will not spoil the outcome with detail, but encourage all readers to stick with it!  There is love!  And it is worth the journey!
B00003CXCT|5.0|FIVE Rocket stars!  Are you kidding, the image quality is far more impressive than the VHS version (SE).  I like how the menus are so interactive and intuitive.  There's just so much bonus features you'll be having fun sifting through all that footage.  I don't know how George does it but he really puts the Star into Star Wars! <br />Oh and if you watch it again you'll notice many details and scenes you totally missed!  Own it today, don't delay!
B0002KVULG|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dracula movies and i've seen all the classics from Bela lugosi to Christopher Lee. <br />Frank Langella plays Dracula as a suave and sexy monster who can really sweep a girl off of her feet not just with his powers but with his charisma alone. <br />Kate Nelligan is one of the sexiest Lucy's i've ever watched and i would'nt mind taking a bite out of her myself. <br />Sir Laurence Olivier delivers a great performance as Dr. Van Helsing presenting the DR. as a truly fearless vampire killer and the  confrontations between him and Dracula are pretty intense. <br />Everybody is truly into their characters and the special effects which were pretty innovative for 1979 just enhance the visual pleasure. <br />This is one top notch vampire flick showing us a more sexy and debonair Dracula who can also rip your head off at the drop of a hat. <br />Go ahead and take a bite!
B00030590I|1.0|yea it might have been beautiful but it sucked. why the hell did they say quinten tarantino in the preview he did not have any thing to do with it. I whent to go see it becaues I say quintens name but god that was a mistake. it had to much drama it was realy unrelistic and stupid it had sub titels and is all ways a turn off for me.
B00004TDTO|5.0|With close to five hundred other reviews, there's not too much than can be added to the legendary Spielberg thriller.  The film is just as intense as it was close to three decades ago.  Robert Shaw's performance still ranks as one of the most Oscar-worthy ones on film.  John Williams' score is no less terrifying after all these years.<br /><br />The bonus feature of viewing the early television work of director Spielberg is fascinating, especially when one recalls the shows, as I do, that he had a hand in shaping (\\"Night Gallery\\" and \\"Columbo,\\" for example).<br /><br />Forget \\"Finding Nemo\\".  \\"Jaws\\" is the original FISH-IN-THE-WATER story.
B000006NX5|5.0|This is most probably the best album ever recorded by Barry White. I can not find the right words to describe properly the greatness of the \\"Maestro\\" Barry White's talent to produce and record the music this album contains. Mr. White allow you to enjoy his music with out vocal ingredients in order you can truly appreciate his genius. I just got this CD recently but I was looking for it for many years. I even got the LP with the same title and presentation 5 years ago at Sou Paulo Brasil during a quick trip to that country. This CD has the exact same music than the original LP released back in the 70's. Now finally it is here for everyone to enjoy it. If you like soul music and Barry White this is truly an esencial CD for you.
B0002Y69NQ|5.0|The main purpose of this review is to ask everyone reading this a question, but first I must say that THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY THE COOLEST DVD BOXED SET CREATED SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME... <br /> <br />Anyways, the question: <br />I need to know if the limited edition includes the boxed package with the matrix code running down it like the standard edition does. I only want the limited edition for the 80-page book, but I will get the standard edition if the limited does not have the box (I think we can all agree that the plastic case shown in photos for the limited edition looks pretty cheap). ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THIS (FOR SURE, NOT JUST A GUESS), PLEASE WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW HERE TO TELL ME. <br /> <br />Thanx...
B000002NHN|5.0|I had recently re-purchased a copy of this CD. I original had it on casette until my little sister had ruined it. I am so glad that I rediscovered this CD again. It's so haunting. It takes you back to a different place and time. I love that Loreena uses poetry for lyrics and that there are instruments that you normally don't hear. This is one very, very, gorgeous CD.
B0000A12BL|5.0|The extended version of The Package lasts about a minute and a half longer than the album version. Maynard sings, \\"take what's mine\\" a few more times along with some other lyrics. This version of the song ends with an extended fade-out that sounds like the intro to the song.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|I admit, I miss Savage Garden. They were the only pop band that I could admit to liking without feeling like I was buying into mass-produced, commercial music. I loved that they were so heartfelt and passionate about their music, for being pop musicians, they had a lot to say and I loved that. I also loved that they incorporated an 80's New Wave Sound. It was so lush. <br /> <br />As far as this album goes. It's just as good as the first one. I felt that they hit a height with this album. The lyrics were complex and the emotion just seeps from Darren Hayes' soft voice. Some songs were incredibly fun to listen to or even dance to, such as \\"Chained to You\\" or \\"The Animal Song.\\" Where \\"Two Beds and a Coffee Machine\\" was more introspective. But \\"Hold Me\\" and some of the more softer tracks were a little lackluster. The best song though from the album is \\"Gunning Down Romance.\\" It's actually the first song that Savage Garden did to me, that did not have a complete upside. <br /> <br />But, overall, great album.
6305609705|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (1979) endures as a surreal, mesmerizing journey through the chaos of the Vietnam War. The passion and gamble of Coppola's masterpiece is a rarity in today's cinema. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" remains a textbook example of accomplished filmmaking with its innovative use of stereophonic sound, location cinematography and stream-of-consciousness narrative. Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper deliver classic portrayals, while Marlon Brando's iconic presence evokes the tortured madness of Col. Kurtz. Coppola's \\"unfinished\\" ending has been the subject of much debate, yet the final images remain haunting.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Years ago, Arista & Mobile Fidelity released Al Stewart's \\"Year Of The Cat\\" on CD & I purchased the MF version. Over the years I've played the two hits from this album (\\"On The Border\\" & the title track) but due to what I was doing at the time, the other tracks were passed over in favor of playing another CD or to do something else. When I learned that Rhino was releasing \\"Year Of The Cat\\" (with a sonic upgrade!), My interest in this album peaked once again so I purchased it while visiting New Jersey. One night I decided to play it as I went off to sleep. I couldn't get to sleep that night until I heard this masterpiece four times! This CD is loaded with artistic wit & creativity & I am shocked that I managed to go all this time without listening to these treasures. Rhino did a beautiful job remastering this album too. I have never heard such detail in this album as I did with this Rhino CD. When I play this CD now, I have to play the entire CD. The only way I can play the two individual tracks is if I happen to be playing a \\"Various Artists\\" CD or listening to the radio. If anyone I know tells me they have any of the original \\"Year Of The Cat\\" CD's, I will strongly insist that they upgrade to the Rhino version. Thanks to this CD (& Rhino), I am going back through all of my CD's to revisit them one track at a time. My only hope is that if I discover another overlooked treasure like this one, I hope Rhino is involved with the latest issue. \\"Year Of The Cat\\" is a stunning album! The Rhino CD sounds spectacular! I highly recommend this CD!---William F. Greco
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion Of The Christ, nothing prepared me for what I was about to see. Whether one is a believer in Jesus Christ as the worlds Saviour or not, one can only hope the person who was prepared to suffer as Christ clearly did, physically horrific but even more emotionally, for he knew exactly what was he had come for and what is earthly rewards were going to be, then for all of our sakes, let it not be in vain. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Christ's last 12 hours is pictured with love and cruelty in both extremes. This is a film that is thought provoking in the way all the characters played compelling roles none more so than Christ, Mary his Mother, Mary Magdalene and Pilate. Just to end, If you do not believe in Christ as the Saviour, do bidding to his words
0393316041|5.0|I have read the Czech translation of Feynman's book 3 times, and the original 3 times as well. It was always a very entertaining experience, and the book was among the things that influenced me a lot. <br /> <br />Richard Feynman has been one of the greatest and most original and unusual physicists of the 20th century. At the same moment, he was an ordinary, curious, emotional, straightforward man whose thinking was deeply rooted in common sense. <br /> <br />However, this book is primarily a great portion of fun. Feynman's stories involving locks in Los Alamos, doctors who considered him insane, girls in the pub, paintings with naked women, physics, rabis, magicians, maps of a cat, and other things are simply irresistable. <br /> <br />There may be other physicists whose life is (or was) equally entertaining and interesting as Feynman's life. But this book will make you sure that Feynman deserves your time.
B0002IU988|5.0|songs 2,3,6,7,8 & 10 are running through my head all day long. <br />\\"Shed my Skin\\" give me goose bumps. \\"down to my last\\" will be thier real hit when it gets air time on the radio...\\"broken Wings\\" is so freakin' catchy. The bridge in \\"in loving memory\\" is powerful. \\"One Day remains\\" awesome. <br />buy this CD and listen to it several times.. give it a chance you won't regret it. <br /> <br />Beach.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Watching these DVDs on my plasma, I was disappointed to find the kind of compression artifacts you see in some older cheaply made DVDs. Also, the print seems to be on the dark side (no pun intended) and the shadows fall very flat and opaque. I have a nagging suspicion that Lucas did this on purpose so he can release a \\"newly remastered\\" version of higher quality later on. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I'm happy with the set. The movies are still great, even if a few of the new additional edits are gratuitous.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  It's so serious, but cynical and funny at the same time.  There are things that one could miss if you're not paying attention.  Features Peter Sellers in three different roles, and if it weren't for an injury, he would have played a fourth role.  This movie came in 3rd on the AFI Top 100 Comedies of All Time.   <br /> <br />There is a cheaper version of this movie available as a Special Edition, and according to the Sony Pictures website, all the special features are the same.  The big difference, however, is the soundtrack.  This 2 disc special edition bolsters a huge Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS soundtrack, the \\"standard\\" special edition is only one disc and is presented in mono.  This movie deserves a 5.1 treatment, so if it comes down to special features, go with this 40th Anniversary special edition.   <br /> <br />This is a fine addition to any DVD collection, and a must have for Kubrick fans.  One can't help but notice the cynicism used here that would become key in his later films such as Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut.  This movie is one wild ride, and in the final words of Slim Pickens' over the top Major Kong, \\"Yahoo!!\\"
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album will hopefully usher in a new era of intelligent, musically complex punk music. Definitely a new evolution.  I wish bands like Blink 182, Sum 41, Yellowcard, Bad Religion, Offspring, MXPX, etc could find their own inner \\"American Idiot\\". <br /> <br />This album proves that Green Day *is* the best punk band of the last fifteen years.
0064409422|5.0|I loved this book because it had a lot of action it it. It's about how Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter find a wardrobe in a house they're staying in. Lucy is the first one who finds it and she finds out from a faun called Mr. Tumnus that she is in Narnia. Then Edmund finds it and makes friends with the White Witch. But she is a bad person...Oops. I'm telling you too much. You better read the book to find out more! Zippy
B000063DFN|4.0|I grew up listening to Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Judas Priest, straying away from Iron Maiden, especially after hearing \\"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter,\\" because it was such an annoying song in my opinion that my friend played over and over when we hung out.  However, years later, a friend of mine let me borrow a \\"Best of the Beast\\" telling me to keep an open mind. <br /> <br />I did just that and I liked what I heard, especially the song Aces High and Bruce Dickenson's natural voice.  (I still think that Rob Halford is a better singer than Dickenson, but both have their weaknesses).  His recommendation was Powerslave, so I followed what he said, amazed that such a great song was the intro to this album.  Aces High is a truly amazing song, however, it gets especially repetitive.  Actually to tell you the truth, I enjoyed this album for about a week before dismissing Iron Maiden once again from the bands I listened to.  I tried to like the album at the time, but with the limited number of songs and limited number of emotions, I just couldnt stand it. <br /> <br />Now however, after I bought Number of the Beast, Killers, Brave New World, and Fear of the Dark, I really enjoyed what I heard, and I especially liked Fear of the Dark and Number.  So I decided to relisten to Powerslave and see what I could get out of it. <br /> <br />Aces High was just as good as the first time, but after listening to it over and over again, I still stand that it is a very repetitive song, though one of my favorite Maiden songs, it should be done in moderation. <br /> <br />Two Minutes to Midnight was a song that I could never fully interpret, both lyrically and musically.  I would listen to the song and just get completely lost, not knowing where a time change would occur or when the solo took place.  I hear that this song was played on the radio many times, but I just cant understand that because I the song just loses my attention.  I think Fear of the Dark is a better song thanthis, but I know many people disagree. <br /> <br />I am a sucker for instrumentals, and Big Orra caught my ears as I heard it.  The melody sounds extremely 80s.  The other Maiden Instrumentals that i have heard are Transylvania (on their self title) and Genghis Khan (on Killers).  I would have to say this matches Transylvania in greatness, but each of these instrumentals are great in their own respect. <br /> <br />Flash of the Blade, Duellists, and Back in the Village all make up a mediocre part of the album, in my opinion.  When I heard Flash of the Blade for the first time, I thought to myself that maybe Ozzy was writing some songs for maiden!  That intro sounds like something ozzy would do.  The guitars harmonizing is pretty good, but the guitars also harmonize just as good in Duellists.  When I first heard \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" i thought, \\"Duellists!!\\"  Seems like Maiden reused a lot of things, starting from Number of the Beast to Powerslave, especially when the end of Where Eagles Dare is the same as the beginning of Invaders.  However, speaking of Duellists, the solo is very good.  The song builds up. <br /> <br />Back in the Village never really caught me, but I decided to listen closely when my buddy was telling me how terrible it is.  Its not as terrible as some people say, but I will say that the lyrics are a bit strange, and why does the harmonizing sound similar to Duellists and Flash of the Blade? <br /> <br />Then the title track plays.  I would have to say, aside from the opening track, this song is a high point in the album.  the chorus, \\"Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave,\\" was something i found myself singing after i dismissed maiden as a band I would listen to.  The bass in the middle is excellent, along with a solo, but the instrumental part in the middle is so complex that you wouldnt really notice a solo unless you were 100% focused on what you are listening to. <br /> <br />Finally, we arrive to Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  I was surprisedat how many people actually know about this song.  Some of my friends that only listen to rap and hip hop know about Rime, and that just blew my mind.  I would have to say that the lyrics of this song is just pure genuis because Harris is able to tell the story of the poem and have it rhyme and have it written in proper rhythm, because when Dickenson is singing this song, he isnt off beat, or trying to squeeze in large amounts of words in a short amount of time, like in Duellists.  Those who say that there is no boring part in this song, I think are wrong.  The bass part starting at 5:05 is a very boring part if you ask me and it lasts about for about 2 and a half minutes.  Its basically 2 chords repeated, but I suppose that Harris wanted to express something musically, so he had to add in a part like that.  starting at 7:34 however, it picks up and at 9:10, you have an emotional and skillful solo that lasts almost a minute, then you have a harmonizing part, that is different from Flash of the Blade, Duellists and Back in the Village.  The song ends the same way that it started, with the same riff and singing rhythm. <br /> <br />I am not sure how much I would recommend this album to a new Maiden listener.  I would have to say Fear of the Dark seriously caught me and Number of the Beast rekindled my interest in Maiden.  I recommend Number of the Beast for the first time Maiden listener, then maybe you will appreciate Powerslave more than I have.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|Every once in awhile a movie soundtrack is composed or compiled that is so fantastic that it not only adds an entire new dimension of appreciation to the movie, but stands on its own as a magnificent recording.<br /><br />Well, it worked with \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but it doesn't quite reach that level for \\"Kill Bill Vol. I\\".<br /><br />There are definite highlights...\\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" could very well be the best Ennio Morricone theme that Morricone never wrote, and \\"The Flower Of Carnage\\" preceding it is just amazing.  I have to admit that I bought the CD for Tomoyasu Hotei's drop-dead cool \\"Battle Without Honor Or Humanity\\", perhaps the ultimate \\"walking-in-slow-motion-while-dressed-in-black-and-wearing-sunglasses\\" theme song of all time.<br /><br />But Nancy Sinatra's \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\", while completely appropriate and totally something you'd expect Tarantino to find a place for, just doesn't start the CD off on as high a note as you'd like when remembering the movie; \\"Miserlou\\" it ain't.  And Charlie Feathers' poor man's Elvis knock-off, while a decent enough nugget lovingly plucked from obscurity, doesn't seem in-place with the movie at all.  \\"Twisted Nerve\\" is just plain annoying, and The RZA's \\"Ode to Oren...\\" is just tedious.  Oren's \\"Queen of the Crime Council\\" soundbite from the movie is among its most memorable lines, and that probably tells you all you need to know about this \\"slash first, talk later\\" martial arts tribute film.<br /><br />Worst for me on this CD is the Santa Esmerelda (who?) remake of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\".  It's a good enough song, sure...and there aren't many who love flamenco guitar as much as I do...but drawing this tune out for over 10 minutes is an exercise in monotonous self-indulgence.  Considering that Hotei's \\"Battle...\\" is infinitely better and less than two-and-a-half minutes long, it only irritates me further.<br /><br />The rest of it is not memorable enough to leave an impression without seeing the movie again (which I've been meaning to do for some time now), but if you like at least two of the songs from the movie you'll probably find it worth your while to buy this soundtrack.  Be forewarned, though...as it is an \\"enhanced\\" CD you will find it nearly impossible to play the audio tracks on a PC (which I do to pass time while at work).  All the same, there is good music on this disc that can't be found anywhere else; for that reason alone I bought it.do for some time now), but if you like at least two of the songs from the movie you'll probably find it worth your while to buy this soundtrack.

B000065V41|5.0|Who knew that Micheal Caine would take this job so seriously. I am a Muppet fan. I grew up watching Sesame Street, the Muppet Show, watching the films. When Jim Henson died it was like a part of my childhood died with him. But when his son Brian took up the mantle and made \\"A Muppet Christmas Carol\\" I believe he made his father proud. Then, as I said, there is an amazing performance that Micheal Caine should honestly be proud of. Whenever I read the Dickens classic I envision Caine's portrayal of Scrooge. Definitely a warm Christmas classic.
0156027321|4.0|LIFE OF PI is a much talked about (i.e. hyped) book about a boy who is lost at sea with a Bengal Tiger.  The blurbs on the book jacket are all over the board- \\"A story that will make you believe in God\\" and \\"Think an adult Calvin and Hobbs\\" etc.  Ignore the rehtoric and praise and what you have her is a really good adventure story with a lot of heart. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA without as much depth or significance.  Sure, the begining is a bit tedious (though not unreadable as some reviewers here have stated) and the overall religious aspect feels a bit underdeveloped by the end...LIFE OF PI is still worthy of your time.  The ending is excellent and leaves you wanting more.  And at the end of the day, isn't that what makes a book good?  Ignore the hype, read the book.
B00005JKTF|3.0|Having loved \\"Shining Through\\" for half my life, I am enamored with romance tales set in the frantic times of war. Charlotte Gray had so much potential, it's a great-looking and atomospheric film with well-shot scenery and transporting period pieces, but it's allowed to wither away under lethargic pacing and a painfully diffuse screenplay.<br /><br />Blanchett pitches in a disarming performance as Charlotte. For a spy she sure cries a lot but does well to get herself out of a pinch. When the hero of the film, played quite handsomely by Billy Crudup, tucks away two Jewish boys at a crumbling shed (ice-cold cliche alert) she becomes the unofficial nanny. In short, she gets to enjoy 1940s women empowerment while also being fussily maternal, bringing a warm human dimension to wartime spy games.<br /><br />Problem is, we stumble from antic to dull antic without much focus and even our wondrous heroine can't help feeling equally confused, summing it all up perfectly with \\"I don't know what I'm doing here anymore\\".<br /><br />I still give it three stars for dabbling in rewarding themes, such as questioning the meaning of bravery or acknowledging how war's extremes can be transforming, but the campy dialogue doesn't help much. All too often the film's Wise Ideas sound like they came straight from chinese fortune cookies, like \\"War makes fools of us all. The rest it kills\\". Um, ok.<br /><br />Sad waste of some great talent and a stirring score by none other than John Barry.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm just a spectator at this point.  You know, the movies are fine, both trilogies.  I like them, I enjoy watching them, and anytime someone can acknowledge whenever I make a Lando reference, it makes my day. <br /> <br />However, the golden age of Star Wars fandom must have been somewhere between '92-and '94.  Far from the tired debates of whether Lucas was or wasn't justified in making his special editions, or whether or not the prequels are good, the early 90's were an intrepid time for SW fans.  It had been a roughly a decade since the last film, and the SW fan club was a fledging group.  Merchandising was next non-existent.  Hanging on to fandom was something you did because you were true to it. <br /> <br />Nowadays, the fan-culture is over-blown.  Lucas, whom I do not think is driven by greed, has said that licensing funds his projects so that he can avoid studio producers, and thus retain control over his projects.  However, this abundance of licensing is where Star Wars fandom rears its ugly head.  If nothing is more \\"imperial\\" than millions of people spending excess money on products made for the members of the world community whom consume an excuse of natural resources, not to mention that these products are sold by the world's largest retailers, than I don't know what could make us more \\"imperial\\". <br /> <br />Ever wonder what teenagers in Asia do?  Check out your collection of items from the last few years.  I remember a newscast that compared images of people rushing to hoard episode 1 toys, while on the same day, people in Kosovo rushed UN workers distributing food.  Sick. <br /> <br />After episode III, I urge you to give it up.  Find something else more constructive.  Make choices and sacrifices in a way that Princess Leia, Han Solo, or Luke Skywalker might do.  Thats the spirit of Star Wars, thats what I feel Lucas is trying to get you to do.  If you still crave entertainment, why not investigate Lucas' other films and examine the themes he uses,or why not check out the films that influenced him.  It's been a fun ride.
B000286S8S|2.0|A. Never mix NEW songs with classics. No matter the temptation to lasso a few bucks, in the end the listener will only be TOO conscious of how subpar the new songs are. I call it Karma.    B. Sammy is just so much better without Van Halen and they are so much better with David it's almost painful now to watch an event such as this. But like any good freeway pile up you look through the cracks of your hands just to see if a body is hanging out of the side of one of the cars.    C. Fans already have all these songs.    D. Fans do not want these new songs. Have you heard Marching to Mars or 10/13? It buries this nonsense!!    E. The pacing and spacing of the songs is of course ridiculous.    F. How the 'F' did this get made in this fashion?    G. Gee, the package looks nice.    I gave it 2 stars because like any bum sitting in front of a grocery store I cannot resist the urge to throw two bits in so at least they can grab a bite to eat and maybe just maybe, sober up for once in their lives.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I like this album alot. My mom bought it for me when i was like 12, I didnt like it then but a few years ago I listened to it and was overwhelmed with how great this album really is.  Alot of people rag on it because people compare it to pink floyd.  Im not going to compare it but it is a great album.  If you dont like it then you dont have to ramble on about how bad it is, people just get tired of that.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Fans of Star Wars have been waiting a long time for this. All I have to say is that it's about time. <br /> <br />The quality of the dvds are good and the bonus material is pretty interesting. It moves through each of the movies and shows aspects of pre- and post-production. Plus, you get to see the training of the actors for the lightsaber match we've all been waiting for! This is a \\"must have\\" for Star Wars fans.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Despite being only 15 and being exposed to Green Day when i first heard Minority (off Warning) from a friend of mine, they have grown to be one of my favourite bands. I know own all records from 1039 to the amazing American Idiot. <br /> <br />This record is what i believe to be the highlight of Green Day's career so far. To be able to put out a record this good after 94's smash Dookie, you obviously have to be a good band. Having waited forever for this cd, i got it on the 21st when it came out.  <br /> <br />1. American Idiot - Although sounding like a combination of Brain Stew, Hitchin' A Ride, etc., its classic Green Day and thats all we need. Just a little overplayed on the radio 9/10 <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - First of the 2 nine minute songs, this is amazing. The song flows so well, each part is good, i dont know what else to say. Its hard to imagine GREEN DAY did this. 10/10 <br />3. Holiday - This is another great song, one of the most political on the album (other than possibly the title track), its a catchy song and one of my favourites of the album 10/10 <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - This may be one of my all time favourite Green Day songs. Great power ballad, amazing lyrics, in my mind this would be their biggest single off the album 15/10 <br />5. Are We The Waiting - a chant along song, and as some other reviewers mentioned, sounds like a Queen song. 10/10 <br />6. St. Jimmy - Most punk song off American Idiot, typical Green Day 10/10 <br />7. Give Me Novacaine - Good song, not much to say 10/10 <br />8. She's A Rebel - Reminiscent of Kerplunk days, as one other reviewer noted. Another one of my favourites 10/10 <br />9. Extraordinary Girl - Probably my least liked song in the beginning, but as the song progresses and i hear it more, i like it alot 10/10 <br />10. Letterbomb - This is (surprise) another good song. Catchy, just like all Green Day 10/10 <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends - This album's Good Riddance or Macy's Day Parade,this is both a better song than Good Riddance and sadder than Macy's Day Parade, combined to make an amazing song 10/10 <br />12. Homecoming - The second 9 minute song, includes my favourite part The Death of St. Jimmy, and a funny bit by Tre Cool titled Rock and Roll Girlfriend. 10/10 <br />13. Whatsername - Softer song, a great way to end the album in my opinion. 10/10 <br /> <br />All in all, this is one album you cannot pass up. Get it now.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Its hard to say that one king crimson album is better than another, well hard for me anyway. many seem to love some albums, hate others...i cant understand this.  at face value almost every album sounds completely different but they just about all have the same wonderful components of forward moving, power, disciplined skill, and freedom within ultimate structure...or is it structure losely built around ultimate freedom?  in any case this album is certainly one of the best collections of music i have ever heard.  level five is amazing, the whole thing is amazing.  the power to believe segments are particularly wonderful.  i thought that the construcktion of light was one of crimsons best releases, although i seem to be alone in that, but this one is like a  beefed up, higher production version.  i feel that the music is similar but more intense and even more forward reaching, and somewhat more well produced.  but ultimately closely related to that prior release.  i recomend everything crimson has released for various reasons, but of course, some are better than others, and if i have to choose what i feel is best, the power to believe is it.  also the version of larks tongues in aspic part four on the ep happy with what you have to be happy with is really something, sounding a little better than the construcktion version (although i do miss belews coda)his guitar melodies pretty much make up for it.  fripp and company have once more outdone themselves, it feels like this is where its been going for a long time, i wonder where it will go next... =) <br />enjoy fans of heavy, enjoy fans of beautiful, its all here
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best Green Day cd ever. All the tracks rock. They are all top-notch, their best complete album yet. I had very high expectations buying this album. They were fulfilled and more. Go out and buy this album you wont be sorry if you do.
B000005S31|5.0|this is one of his best albums hands down. it's up there with transformer and new york and the bells. 'kicks' is awesome, then there's the laid back dylanesque groove of 'nobody's business'. any self respecting lr fan should own this.<br /><br />;
B00005JLWN|4.0|Star Wars is a (very creative) rip-off of Frank Herbert's DUNE. That is the greatest SciFi, and Greatest movie of all time, and its a Rip-off. Equilibrium is just as good of a ripoff, albeit there are a few plot holes. But considering the miniscule budget, it should be compared to Pitch Black, not The Matrix. (Pitch Black also had a micro budget, and no lead actor, and thats on of the best SciFi movies ever made).    If you want a synopis of the movie, just read different reviews, i don't want to have to write one, but on the the pros:  Pros:  The Gun Kata is martial arts based on mathematics, kung fu, and Guns. Whats not to like?!?  Christian Bale provides some great emotions and great stoic moments. Good actor, sounds exactly like Keanu.  The Kid. Damn, hes scary.   This movie is just striaght up bad ass, no one can deny it.    the bad:  When Preston stops his 'dose', he is so obviously feeling that its obsurd that no one can tell. I thought that was weak  The Equilibrium establishment wasn't expanded on, and i never figured out what it was for. This is probably due to Budget and Time constrictions, so its all good      The last 40 minutes were kind of rushed, but the last fights were awesome. When the black guy steps up with the sword, you are expecting a long intense fight. You will be surprised, and just may laugh out loud.   The last pistol fight was cool, and REALLY FAST      good movie, some plot holes, some rushing, but watch it anyway
B00005JN7O|5.0|My wife and I totally agree with Roger Ebert's review of this movie. It is fun, imaginative and creative. It has a nostalgic quality to it for those who grew up after WW II and who dwelled on the \\"possibilities\\" of the \\"'World of Tomorrow'\\" whether we garnered them from books, television or even the radio.  <br /> <br />We were impressed with the acting of the major performers: Jude Law: Sky Captain, Gwyneth Paltrow: Polly Perkins, Angelina Jolie: Franky and Giovanni Ribisi: Dex Dearborn. The plot is the classic struggle between good and evil. The above are \\"good guys\\"; the bad are the mainfestations of as well as the \\"evil\\" Dr. Totenkopf. <br /> <br />The cinematography really used special effects to give some of  the screen sequences a \\"comic book\\"-like appearance as well as a long-ago-and-far-away motif. <br /> <br />The imaginative props which appear throughout the entire film fit the plot appropriately. <br /> <br />My wife and I would recommend it to anyone who has a vivid imagination and enjoys such creative \\"story telling\\" as this film enbodies.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I'm so glad this movie is now being released in a two disc format. As an early release to DVD I have always felt the extras that accompany the single disc version don't do the movie any justice. <br />Shawshank is truely one of the greats of all time. While some maybe happy to sit back and ridicule it, I feel that they have clearly missed the point. It's no Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer and for that we can be most thankful. <br />It's a movie of true substance that requires an open mind to really appreciate it. <br />The worst thing to ever happen to this movie is that was released in 1994, the same year as Forest Gump. <br />While Gump is a good movie, basically it just a lot of historical events gradually being connected together with Gump as the link. <br />When I left the theatre after seeing Shawshank fo the first time, the one feeling I remember having far more than most was that \\"someone had just told me a really great story\\". <br />I now understand that Darabont being writer and director was also the brains behind the opera scene. A touch of brilliance. <br />I applaud Darabont for keeping the movie at 142mins. It is a great story and Darabont is a great storyteller. <br />I hope the extras live up to my expectations. <br />I HOPE.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is by far Nirvanas most artistic, creative and definately musically talented album that they have ever made. Nevermind was great, but some songs were too poppy and were too repetative sometimes and it was VERY overrated. This album is true grunge, its dark, depressing and above all relentless! The screaming of Kurt Cobains vocals combined with his great riffs with Dave Grohls pounding drums and Krists thick basslines makes this album one of the greatest that I've ever heard. Songs like 'Heart-shaped Box' and 'Milk It' show just how much of pitch he can make, from near-silent verses to eardrum pounding choruses you can hear his vocalistic talent. Some songs like 'Rape Me' and 'Very Ape' are very short, but they dont end without us seeing how talented Kurt is, I think Kurt was high when he wrote 'Very Ape' but it still sounds awesome. Every song on this album is worth at least 8/10 and, oh yeah I forgot about the last one. The last one is 'All Apologies', this song approaches more of a John Lennon feel to it with \\"All in all is all we all are\\" at the end and with a soft verse and a semi-heavy chorus. John Lennon must have been very jealous yet proud when he heard that. Overall this should get 1 million stars, its a near perfect album and the flaws are almost unnoticeable.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Greenday were the origional American Idiots, but my god how they've changed! i absolutely loved the older music of Dookie etc etc, but i have to admit i havnt got all their albums and im not a mad fan, but i do like them and i thought i'd get the new album because i knew i'd like it, expecting it to be like greenday of old... <br />im looking at this album as a stand alone piece of music and it it absolutely fantastic, forget its by greenday and it stands alone as one of the best CD's i've ever heard, and that includes a lot of 'big' names! now consider this CD is by greenday who gave us albums like Dookie and the depth, talent, beauty and lyrics are amazing. i bought the CD yesterday and listened to it while in the rush hour, (ie in the car) all the way through. This album shouldnt be compared to the likes of Dookie, because the music has inveitably changed over 10 years, but in my opinion this album is amazing as a stand alone piece of music and it also stands up very well to older greenday stuff.i was reading all these reveiws before i heard the album and i was pretty skeptical that this album could be so good, but it really is! If you dont like greenday of old you will like this, and i hope all you die hard fans like it too because its an excellent achievement.  <br />This album is fantastic, go and get it :o) hope the reveiw helps!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is without a doubt one of the best of the year...if not that, one of the best ever. Kanye West is an amazing producer, but this was known before his solo album ( IZZO, Jay-Z...Stand Up, Ludacris...Bonnie and Clyde, Jay-z...Get By, Talib Kweli...Encore, Jay-Z...The Truth, Beanie Seigel etc etc. )so its no surprise that his beats are amazing on this album. But contrary to what people say, he does have the gift of unique rhymes. He manages to pull words together that people would never have thought of, and chooses subjects that are generally overlooked (education,work..) This album is worth a check even if you dont like hip hop. Just try it you wont be dissapointed.
B00005JN7O|4.0|I'll admit, my expectations were low. I had seen the previews and kept thinking, \\"Why does it look all blurry?\\" Jude Law and Gwyneth Patlrow convinced me to go. I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it. The completely original characters, that slightly blurry way it was filmed that reminds me of old photographs from the 40s of my grandparents, the costumes, the story, it's all unbelievable! And I mean that in a good way! <br /> <br />The movie is about Joe Sullivan (Law) aka Sky Captain and the perky Polly Perkins (Paltrow). Scientists have been disappearing, and Polly is a reporter trying to figure it all out. One day, giant flying robots (it sounds hokey, but just go with it!) land in the city, stealing from power plants to get \\"supplies.\\" Sky Captain is recruited to find out why and who is behind the operation and Polly, his ex-girlfriend, demands clearance because she knows some things about the mystery that he doesn't know. So the movie goes on, in this totally amazing world with characters you are going to love. <br /> <br />There's lots to love about this movie. The cool story, the cool effects, Jude Law... okay, Gwyneth too! They make an awesome pairing (yet again--- they were in The Talented Mr. Ripley together) and their snippy banter is wonderful. I was laughing out loud during some moments that I despertely want to give away right now so you can have a laugh-- but I'm going to keep them to myself and hopefully you'll jet to the theater to check this one out. Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie also make appearances, Jolie's name even appears with Paltrow and Law's names before the title in the credits, but it's Ribisi's name that should've been there. He's fantastic, I can't wait to see more of him in Flight of the Phoenix out this November. <br /> <br />Think it looks stupid? Hokey? Seen it before? Guess again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
B00006690G|1.0|In less than 3 short years the world had gone from the complex and poetic mind of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG to the corny and simple Eminem. The good news is that he will be long forgotten in five short years or when a musical revolution occurs where an awesome hard rock band kicks gay new rap off the charts. I hate rap these days and Eminems a huge reason why. I mean whatever happened to poets like the guys in Run DMC, Public Enemy (kinda), Tupac, Biggie and LL Cool J?.. Well LL's still around. People say he's a revolution in rap, I dont disagree but is it a revolution for the better? Most certainly not! Because of him we've got countless no-talent rappers like 50 cent, Fat Joe and especially Sarai (thank God she's long forgotten). Eminems just a greedy producer who just wants to expand his audience no matter what, remember in the past music was all about doing what you liked to do, not doing whatever it takes to broaden your fan base? I guess bands/rappers just dont care about their music as much as their money. About this album, its about as much of an accident as Eminem himself, why couldn't his mother kill him when she had the chance? I'm sorry but he's to blame for a lot of crap thats been happening in the music industry. There are no good songs here and he just had to use Aerosmiths 'Dream On' to hit it bigger than he was, looks like Steve Tyler and Joe Perry also care more about money than music as well. I hope Eminem burns in hell and gets ripped to pieces by Satans hellhounds while feeling extreme and abnormal pain. Done.
B00003CXCT|4.0|The trilogy was perfect untill Mr. Lucas decided to add some CGI Crap to it, but that's not all what realy got to me was the ending of (Reurn Of The Jedi) when aniken, Obi-Wan and Yoda appear as ghostly figure. how come the young Anikon appears with the Old Obi-Wan??????. <br /> <br />That's all for now
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I hate how half of the bad reviewers out here haven't even heard her new album and are just judging a book by its cover. I admit I have been britney fan since baby one more time, and that may leave me a bit biased, but this album is her best. The catchy pop songs and funky tracks really get to you. I also don't understand why a lot of people don't like Early Mornin'.. its surprisingly catchy and fun. Although my favorite songs are toxic, shadow, the showdown and early mornin, all the songs are great and it is truly an album worth spending money on.
0688163173|5.0|\\"Shutter Island\\" is the latest reminder that Dennis Lehane is today's best writer of crime fiction.  Like the dark and brooding \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Shutter Island\\" is a departure from the successful formula of Lehane's gritty Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro mysteries. The time is 1954, the setting, Shutter Island, a bleak and desolate place not far from Boston, home of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  Those familiar with Lehane's writings will find the somber palette of words familiar, but the period, theme, characters, and plot move in a foreign but ambitious direction.  It is the story of Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule, U.S. Marshals on an assignment to Ashecliffe to investigate the baffling escape from a locked room of inmate Rachel Solano.  The hospital is rumored to have conducted illegal brain surgery on the patients, adding another layer of intrigue to an already spooky setting, a cross between noir crime fiction and gothic horror.  As the mysterious Solano's ghastly past unwinds, the mystery deepens as clues and rationale cease to reach conventional conclusions.  Surprising, even for the talented Lehane, is the Hitchcockian command of surprise and plot twists he executes with a deft ease, slamming the reader with the same impact of the hurricane that rocks the island in one of the novels many vivid scenes.  \\"Shutter Island\\" is a novel that will shock and physically stagger, a true classic of modern fiction that once read will not be forgotten, and must not be missed.
B000002HMH|4.0|Well it could be both. If you compare this to the Black Album or Master of Puppets or just any early Metallica album then this is definately worse. But if you compare it to other bands at the time then this would most certainly be better. After Nirvana seemingly ended the grunge era with Cobains suicide bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit and Blink 182 hit the mainstream. I've always hated Limp Bizkit, they are a disgrace to rock, rap and music overall. Korn was okay, but they were nowhere near as good as Nirvana or Soundgarden and Blink 182 was the first of many poseurs that are here today. <br />   This album was something different, something totlly creative, soft yet still Metallica and great alltogether. This album will never measure up to earlier Metallica masterpieces like 'The Black Album', 'Ride the Lightning' or especially 'Master of Puppets' but it still had many poetic and creative songs on it. 'King Nothing' is my personal favorite and although James' vocals may not be as screaming or powerful as in the eighties or early ninties he makes up for it in his softer voice, its loud but it still has some artstic movement in it. This is Metallicas 'White Album' and although not as good as the gods of pop rock/classic rock (Beattles) it still was very artistic. The songs are good, nothing like the early stuff but still well worth your money.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've seen this particular adaptation at least five times, and I still haven't had enough. Yes, the writers, producers, cast and crew did an outstanding job, blah, blah, blah, but it's Collin Firth's performance as the proud and sexy Mr. Darcy that keeps my girlfriends and me coming back for a yearly encore. The man was made for this role--he oozes that smoldering masculinity, pure chivalrous romance that just doesn't exist any more. It's not in what he says, it's in what he doesn't say. All this and not even a kiss until the last scene! Now that's powerful...
B000003TAR|1.0|In Utero is total bullsh*t masquerading as something intelligent and creative. With a mixture of embarrassingly pretentious lyrics, and horrendously bad playing, anyone with some amount of reasoning will be able see that this isn't the masterpiece the reading material in your local grocery store magazine rack says it is. The online rhyming dictionary can make better plays on words than Cobain does. But then again, nobody slurs their words together with that heroin-induced drawl better than \\"Kurdt\\" does.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I never had the chance to see the original trilogy in the theaters (because I was born about 11 years later)but I do have a copy on VHS. I did see the Special Editions and I did like them; I didn't know what all the fuss was about. Now that the dvd's are out I really enjoy them but there are some more changes for better or for worse. Jabba in ANH has recieved an upgrade, the lightsabers match the colours of those in the preqels, the Emperor in ESB has been switch to the actor who plays him in all the other Star wars, and Hayden Christiansen? is added to the ghost scene in ROTJ. The change I truly hated (and the one that kept this review from a 5 star) is that Boba Fett's voice is now done by the guy who Jango Fett and it sounds out of place and terrible. Besides that little mis-step this DVD is great
B000002JS8|5.0|This is unfortunately the last Bon Scott album, dont get me wrong I loved Brian Johnson and I thought he was the next best thing but Bon Scotts words reached me and he's one of the reasons why I'm a rock fan. The song 'Highway to Hell' perfectly describes the band after this album. This was their best, then after the massive sell-out yet awesome 'Back in Black' the downfall began: 'For those about to rock' was their second and last good eighties album then after the terrible 'Who Made Who?' we wouldn't see a good AC\DC album until 'Razors Edge', then the ninties downfall would begin and after 'Ballbreaker' I had had it. During the Bon Scott era however all their albums rocked my ass, 'High Voltage' and 'If You Want Blood' are among my favorite seventies albums.  <br />  Okay back to this album. Bon Scott has truly done it again here, him and Angus Young are the perfect duo when comes to leading the band. The rhythem is awesome as well with Malcolm Young on guitar, Cliff Williams on bass and Phil Rudd on drums and they all build the perfect foundation for each song. This is an essential hard rock album for, well... hard rock. Buy this masterpiece as well as 'Back in Black', 'High Voltage', 'For those about to Rock (We Salute You)' and 'If you want Blood (You got it)'.
B0002IU988|4.0|Most of you probably know that Alter Bridge consists of 3 of the former Creed members.  This is true.  But what else is true is that Alter Bridge is about 500 times better than creed.  The new vocalist (Myles Kennedy) is right up there with the greats, and Mark Trementi (lead guitar) is amazing.  He is one of the most underated guitarists of all time and deserves to finally be recognized.  Alter Bridge is also about 500 times harder than their days as creed.  There certainly are still the occasional slow ballads, but most of the songs are in your face metal with great guitar riffs.  This album is great, and I recomend it for all rock fans.
1591840562|5.0|Guy Kawasaki's The Art of the Start is a must-read for anyone who is working in a start-up or thinking of starting a business of any kind.  I have just finished it after having just finished my business plan.  Now I have to go back and re-write  the plan based on Guy's advice.  Guy's book is filled with \\"sounds easy; really hard to do well\\" kinds of things:  write an executive summary in four pages; put your pitch into 10 powerpont slides.  The charts on pitching are worth the price of the book. The book is a masterpiece of information architecture with mini-chapters on topics like the art of speaking (also worth the price of the book).  Each chapter ends with a FAQ (Frequently Avoided Questions).  This book is full of real wit and wisdom.
B0000636UN|2.0|I'm giving Sheryl's last studioalbum a spin at the moment and to be hounest, I still don't like it. Her last studio album, The Globe Sessions, was a really deep and personal album full with introspective songs. It's also one of my favourite albums in my collection and her best so far. C'mon, C'mon is an album full of catchy pop-rock songs, but it feels so forced, the writing, her singing, everything. I think that she's a little bit lazy here and there. The songwriting and some lyrics are really trite and corny. There are also a lot of guest musicians that overpower her own input. The last couple of songs are pretty decent and the collaboration with EmmyLou Harris, Weather Channel, is one of the most beautiful songs she has ever written and the strings give the song a beautiful atmosphere. Why the European bonustrack Missing isn't included on the American release is a riddle, it's one of her better songs. I give this album 2 stars because she can do so MUCH better. This is not a good introduction to Sheryl Crow because she has so much more to offer then this for her standards rather shallow album.<br /><br />1.Steve Mcqueen 3/5<br />2.Soak Up The Sun 2/5<br />3.You're An Original 2/5<br />4.Safe And Sound 3/5<br />5.C'Mon C'Mon 2/5<br />6.It's So Easy 2/5<br />7.Over You 2/5<br />8.Lucky Kid 2/5<br />9.Diamond Road 2/5<br />10.It's Only Love 2/5<br />11.Abilene 3/5<br />12.Hole In My Pocket 3/5<br />13.Weather Channel 5/5<br />14.Missing (Euro.Bonustrack) 4/5
B000066NW0|1.0|...and delivered the final blow that would just destroy the music industry! I think this is one of the most useless albums that has ever hit stores, its the reason why other talentless poseurs like G@y Charlotte and S*!*ty Plan got signed for Gods sake! Anyone who thought of signing a poseur to make money had something wrong with them and that idea has plagued the music industry ever since. Every song on this hunk of crap is utterly useless, uninspired/uninspiring and horrendous. With the state that music is in right now (with rap being the current choice of our generation) I am ashamed of my kind, their the reason why parents hate us! Remember when music was all about the music and you had to have TALENT to get signed? I know it wasn't my time but I'm sure that it was much better than today, all anyone wants today is the money...like Avril here. I hate her, even if she wasn't the worst thing that happened to music (Limp Bizkit and\or Eminem anyone?) she still made it sink to rock bottom. I hope something happens very, very soon. <br />PS: Just one thing...DONT BUY THIS S*!T!!!!!!!
B00005JN2X|4.0|I saw Collateral in the theater with one of my friends the other night and it's great. People who say this movie is terrible are probably just mad that Tom Cruise is playing the bad guy. Basically, Cruise's character, Vincent, initially appears to be a regular guy who grabs a ride in a cab driven by mild-mannered Max (Jamie Foxx). At one point, Vincent bribes Max to be his normal driver for all of his appointments (with a large sum of money, I might add), and Max reluctantly accepts. After the first destination, however, Max realizes that these appointments are really shooting targets for Vincent, who turns out to be a hit man.<br /><br />I think the acting in this movie was good for all the actors involved. But I also think people calling Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max Oscar-worthy are getting a little ahead of themselves. He DID do a good job, but I don't know about an Oscar nod. Also, I couldn't give this movie five stars because it seems like it ended in the wrong place. It should've had one more scene, because I can think of at least two loose ends that were left untied (I can't tell you what those are because they're spoilers of sorts). If I piqued your curiosity, well then, go to the theater and check this movie out.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert<br /><br />P.S. Did anyone else notice that this movie had no opening credits?
B0002OERI0|4.0|This CD blew me away. It's incredible. Good Charlotte is looking worse and worse with this CD out. The best songs(in my opinion) are American Idiot, Whatsername, and Wake Me Up When September Ends. Another good song is Are We The Waiting.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|Tired plots, over-acting, and a story arc that never got off the ground consigned this western to the TV graveyard in record time. <br /> <br />I watched the first two heavy-handed episodes and I was not impressed. The story-lines were predictable--if not recycled. The action was sparse. The characters were trying so hard to be mysterious that they were uninteresting. What did impress me was how slow paced this show was. It was boring. Very little happened and when something did, it was not pulled off in an exciting way. <br /> <br />This show wasn't canceled out-of-hand. It was canceled because it couldn't generate interest. <br /> <br />I did like the cast though, and the production values, so I'm giving it two stars.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin, they are the greatest band of all time, greater than Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, the Who and even Black Sabbath. This is their follow up to their breakthrough self-titled album. Every song in this album is great, its the third best Zeppelin album after Physical Graffiti and Led Zeppelin IV. Why bother reviewing the songs? Every single one scores at least an eight\ten and Jimmy Page shows just how creative he can be with the guitar. Robert Plants vocals have improved as well, they were always great but in this album he shows his range in vocals. John Paul Jones shows his fans that he deserves great recognition from the basslines that he makes and John Bonham has a sledgehammer for a foot, he's the best at kick drumming! Every hard rock fan should have this in their collection, it is a masterpiece.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Back in 1983, when Michael Jackson was more known for his music and career, as opposed to his strange persona, plastic surgeries (and now his controversial nature), he ventured out from his Jackson 5 roots and put out what would become the best-selling album, not only of the 80's, but of all time.<br /><br />Regardless of what kind of music you're into, almost anyone could probably find something they liked here.<br /><br />1. Wanna Be Startin' Something -- The opener was a small hit that got unfortunately overshadowed. A cross between his old-style soul/R&B and a contemporary 80's dance sound.<br /><br />2. Baby Be Mine -- The only of two non-hits to be featured, but it's no less good. In fact, its medium tempo, semi love song-lyrics and backing saxophone make it sound a bit like the hit \\"Rock With You\\" off his previous album.<br /><br />3. The Girl is Mine -- This is the first of the slower-paced pop songs, which even features backup vocals by my favorite former Beatle, Paul McCartney (who had MJ provide vocals for his own hit, \\"Say Say Say\\" around the same time). I also gotta love the small spoken word argument between the two near the end.<br /><br />4. The title track will probably be remembered for years to come. The horror-themed 14-minute short movie MTV video, featuring the living dead and other Halloween-esque themes was unlike anything before it. The song is a funk/pop number about the dead rising from their graves, appropriately enough also featuring a spoken word section by horror legend Vincent Price.<br /><br />5. Beat It -- This is another new sound Jacko explores here. With its quick tempo, rock-influenced happy pop sound, lyrics about street gangs resolving conflict peacefully (with the 'West Side Story' video to match), you've got another winner. Of course, we can't forget the Eddie Van Halen guitar solo - which even got this song some rock radio airplay.<br /><br />6. Billie Jean -- The next classic everyone over the age of 5 has probably heard. Aside from being the third landmark song in a row (this one blowing up on MTV, becoming the first smash hit by a black artist) it's just fun, uptempo soul-pop/rock.<br /><br />7. Human Nature -- This was, amazingly, only a very minor hit, but it's tied with \\"Beat It\\" for my favorite song. A half ballad, half uptempo pop tune - also with a slight love song sound - that's just about impossible to not get stuck in your head.<br /><br />8. P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) -- Another minor hit to emerge which goes back a bit to his R&B roots. It's an uptempo dance stomper reminiscent of something Earth, Wind & Fire might've done.<br /><br />9. The Lady in My Life -- The other of the two non-hits is a very slow and soft in comparison. It's the only full ballad here, a love song akin to something you might hear in a Disney movie.<br /><br />NOTE: I can't comment on the bonus tracks, since I only have the original issue.one blowing up on MTV, becoming the first smash hit by a black artist) it's just fun, uptempo soul-pop/rock.    7.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden's 13th studio album, Dance Of Death (2003), may feature pretty lame cover art, but the 11 songs of pure metal more than make up for the little blunder. This album is among the best albums of 2003, almost as good as Children Of Bodom's Hate Crew Deathroll and Dimmu Borgir's Death Cult Armageddon. Overall, Maiden fans won't be disappointed. If you're expecting that 2003 is the year that Maiden will suffer the downfall that Metallica did that year, think again. This album is classic Maiden of massive proportions, the riffs are fresh though, and it isn't even close to Number Of The Beast, but it still rocks.<br /><br />And now, the three highlights of the album. Opener \\"Wildest Dreams\\" is a fast, extra heavy Maiden tune with one of my personal favorite solos they've done. Track 2, \\"Rainmaker,\\" has one of my favorite intro riffs ever, plus a great harmony solo midway through the song. And the title track is another Maiden epic, ever since Bruce joined, no Maiden album was ever complete without an epic. TRUE metal soldiers, unite!<br /><br />\\"Heavy metal is the law that keeps us all united free, A law that shatters Earth and Hell! Heavy Metal can't be beaten by any dynasty, we're all wizards fighting with our spell!\\"-Helloween
B000089RV6|5.0|Bon Scott's death may have permantly affected the band but they kept going on anyway. With new singer Brian Johnson who sounds a lot like Bon Scott the band made their comeback album that is regarded as one of the best AC/DC albums of all time. This album has some truely remarkable songs starting off with there opener Hells Bells. My personal favorite on this cd is You Shook Me All Night Long. This album is so great you really wonder how they pulled it off without there fantastic singer behind them. The band paid there homage to the fallen singer in the song Have a Drink on Me. This album never gets old and it's a must have for lovers of rock music.
B00005J79J|4.0|Sarah Brightman crossed over from showtunes to ethereal pop over the years, changing her image with nearly every album. From the velvety grandeur of \\"Eden\\" to the sparkling \\"La Luna\\" to the surreal \\"Fly.\\" Several of the best songs from the 1990-2000 period are included here, and except for a few omissions, it's a top-rate collection of singles.<br /><br />It kicks off with two songs from her early pop period, the epic \\"Question of Honour\\" and organ-dominated \\"Heaven is Here.\\" There's also a cover of the Bee Gees' \\"First of May.\\" Then she dips into the melancholy \\"Who Wants to Live Forever,\\" the rich \\"Tu Quiere Volver,\\" the rich \\"Just Show Me How to Love You\\" and the pretty duet with Andrea Bocelli, \\"Time to Say Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />Then it's time for a look at Brightman's more recent creations. These songs tend to be more textured and symphonic, and less spacey. There's the hymnlike, vaguely sexy \\"Eden,\\" ethereal \\"Nella Fantasia,\\" the soaringly earthy \\"Deliver Me,\\"  and the aching \\"Only an Ocean Away.\\" Taking on a more ethereal sound is the soft \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" and richly psychedelic \\"Whiter Shade of Pale,\\" followed by live versions of of \\"Captain Nemo\\" and \\"Mer.\\" It wraps up on a sweet note with the silky, murmuring \\"The Last Words You Said.\\"<br /><br />Brightman has a good enough track record -- and a long enough career -- that it's hard not to wish for a two-disc set of her best songs from that era. With this release, Brightman has a chance to smooth over some of her odder past songs (like that Tom Jones duet) and focus just on the best she did in every album during that ten-year period. Some of her songs seem to have gotten lost in the shuffle. For example, where is the beautiful \\"Desert Rose\\"?<br /><br />However, the musical arrangements are impeccable -- there's some electronica, orchestral pieces, and \\"Tu Quiere Volver\\" is lorded over by an acoustic guitar. Brightman also gets to show the full range of her vocals -- she sings sweetly or richly, and launches into operatic solos in songs like \\"Question of Honour.\\"<br /><br />And unlike a lot of \\"best of\\" albums, this is also a good place for newbies to start checking out Brightman's work. Die-hard Brightman fans will have everything but the live tracks, yet this is still a good collection.chly, and launches into operatic solos in songs like \\"Question of Honour.\\"  <br />  <br />And unlike a lot of \\"best of\\" albums, this is also a good place for newbies to start checking out Brightman's work.

B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a film that many Protestants have come to question. They doubt the Veil of Veronica, even though it's been displayed. They doubt the Stations of the Cross, but not the Church fathers? And so on. <br /> <br />But I found the DVD disappointing. It was reasonably accurate, except at points (say in the interaction between Jesus and His mother). It was low budget made epic by the incredible cinematography and even a score that grows on you. <br /> <br />But it's only the movie. That's it. There are no special features. There is no director's commentary - that EVERYONE was looking forward to. There's nothing. Gibson didn't spend any time at all with the DVD. It would have taken two hours of his time. I can play the much lesser film, Contact, and get three commentaries. And so for many modern films, good or middling.  <br /> <br />So I certainly won't say - boo, hiss. I just wanted to say that I had looked forward to something that simply wasn't included on the DVD.
B00005JMJG|5.0|As Maxim said, \\"This is a mind fnck of a movie.\\" Which that it is, but a glorious mind fnck at that. Of course we all know the premise of the movie, but when you just look at that you can't completely see how funny this movie really is.<br /><br />At the same time that Joel is having his memory of Clementine erased we see the ones who are erasing his memory it starts out with Patrick (Frodo) and the one who is actually running the equipment played by Mark Ruffalo. At this point we find out that Patrick is dating Clementine and using pieces of Joel's past to win her over.<br /><br />Soon after Kirsten Dunst's character comes over where the erasing Joel's memory, Patrick has to leave to comfort Clementine and so Mark and Kirsten are having a party. All the while Joel lies in the bed, Mark and Kirsten are dancing on it in their underwear, smoking weed next to him, and drinking in the area. (This part makes me never want to go through surgery.)<br /><br />Joel eventually decides to start hiding his memory of Clementine elsewhere in his mind in order to remember her, but Mark picks up on it even in his screwed up state, and calls his boss to come over and help. He gets there and their able to fix things and he takes over the operation and Mark goes outside to get air as Kirsten stays in and flirts with their boss.<br /><br />I'm not going to give anymore away, because this part adds a little twist to the movie that I didn't expect. With both plots going this becomes an interesting movie, unlike anything I'm sure you've ever seen before. At the least rent this when it comes out on Tues., but I think everyone should just buy it. And tune in to the next Oscars to see Jim Carrey finally get his due!
B000001FRY|5.0|Great debut albums come in all flavors, but all have one thing in common: the presentation of a fully realized sound and attitude which somehow honor \\"the tradition\\" while adding something genuinely new to it. U2's first disc, BOY, fulfills those requirements beautifully, offering a first taste of the band which is still recognizable nearly a quarter of a century (and many changes in sound and concept) later, but remaining very much a unique entry in its catalogue.<br /><br />Everything on BOY is big - the drums, the bass, the heavily echoed guitars and of course Bono's vocals. The band wasn't terribly sophisticated at this point, perhaps, but by relying on its strengths (which were considerable, even this early on) U2 managed to give post-punk a genuine identity and so elevate it from the morass of one-hit wonders who made the early '80s such a forgettable era in pop music for the most part. Much of the credit for this must go to Steve Lillywhite, whose inspired production gives the whole affair a ten-feet-tall-and-a-mile-wide ambience well suited to the anthemic nature of the material (and the band).<br /><br />From the opening jangle of \\"I Will Follow,\\" U2 makes its case in plain and powerful rock music, without a derivative note to be found. While fleeting moments of influence can be detected - a Pink Floydy touch here, a Bowiesque phrase there - BOY is a surprisingly innovative work, all the more so when one considers that the band members ranged in age from 18 to 20 while they were recording it. The anthems come hot and heavy throughout - \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"The Electric Co.\\" may be the best known, but \\"A Day Without Me\\" and \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" are equally huge, while the demimonde musing of \\"An Cat Dubh\\" show the first signs of U2's dark side and \\"Out of Control\\" takes the whole thing to an energetic apex even the other cuts can't quite match. Much has been made of U2's lack of chops in its early years, but that's hardly an issue on BOY: Adam Clayton's bass lines are tight and swinging; Larry Mullen's drums are relentless as a herd of bison; Bono's voice is already a masterful instrument in its own right, and the Edge remakes the role of the guitar through various effects in the first of a long line of efforts which would establish him as the premier axeman of the past twenty-five years - not because of his \\"chops,\\" but because of his imagination.<br /><br />In short, BOY is as essential as any work from this amazing and long-lived band.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|Okay, for those of you who can't watch a black and white movie you need to be banned from ever seeing another movie again in your entire stinking lives. I can't believe that anyone would judge this movie based on that considering what it took Kevin Smith to make this film.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm here to talk to film Auteurs anyway. If you want to know how to make your own film, on your own budget and make it big in Hollywood, this is the film for you. This film was made on a budget that included nothing more than maxed out credit cards and a sold comic book collection. And while you can tell that it was a cheap film, it's not the camera work that makes you enthralled with this movie, it's the dialogue which is fresh and whitty.<br /><br />And in this anniversary edition you'll find it all, even a documentary about the film making of Clerks that cost more than the movie itself!!! On the DVD ROM they've got the 168 page original screenplay for the film. So I say anyone who is either an aspiring filmmaker, or a Kevin Smith fan should own this film which will show you how it all got started.

B000286S8S|5.0|Here it is. We have some new Van Halen. Let's face it -- anybody who's buying this for the three new songs probably already has every one of the hits on this set. The old songs are remastered, and they sound okay. However, there's some clipping on some songs, which is annoying. This set is pretty heavily hard limited, so audiophiles shouldn't expect it to sound amazing. Still, it IS a hard rock/heavy metal collection, so a little bit of compression or hard limiting isn't too bad. It makes things sound \\"heavy,\\" and Van Halen is a band that should always sound heavy... and loud. <br /> <br />The songs are good. Mixing them up is obviously an attempt to make the band's body of work seem like a whole, rather than \\"Dave's era\\" and \\"Sammy's era.\\" Leaving out Gary Cherone is perhaps understandable from a marketing perspective, but from a personal perspective, Edward Van Halen shouldn't have left out his \\"musical soulmate.\\" Gary's era should have been represented with \\"Without You\\" and \\"Fire In The Hole.\\" But, hey, what can we do? <br /> <br />All the hits are here. There are album tracks that any diehard fan would want here, like \\"Summer Nights,\\" \\"Mean Street,\\" \\"I'm The One,\\" \\"Ice Cream Man,\\" \\"Little Guitars,\\" \\"Somebody Get Me A Doctor,\\" etc., but diehards already have those songs. For the casual fan, this includes the commerically successful Van Halen tracks, but they're not really the band's \\"best.\\" Stuff like \\"Dancing In The Street\\" and \\"Feels So Good\\" aren't really good examples of typical Van Halen. Still, they were bigger hits than \\"Somebody Get Me A Doctor\\" and \\"Little Guitars,\\" so they have a right to be on this set.  <br /> <br />There's a lot missing, but for what it is -- a collection of Van Halen's greatest hits -- it does its job pretty well. <br /> <br />The new songs.... <br /> <br />Well, they're pretty good. For me, \\"It's About Time\\" and \\"Learning To See\\" are the best. \\"Up For Breakfast\\" is a song you really have to be in the mood for, as the lyrics are alittle silly... but not really in a cool way. If you're in the mood it's good, but sometimes I just don't want to hear it. When I first heard \\"It's About Time\\" I thought the Van Halen legacy was about to be destroyed by EVH. I thought he'd gone Nu-Metal. I remarked to friends, \\"Van Halen is dead\\" and \\"What is THIS?!\\" as I listened to it. Later on, though, I grew to really dig the song. The intro is a little different, but the song grows on you. I even learned the song on guitar. If you go into things with an open mind, these songs are good. But, hey, I also like Van Halen 3... <br /> <br />If you're a casual fan, this is a good set. However, if you feel a little let down, don't give up. Get \\"Van Halen,\\" \\"Van Halen II,\\" \\"Fair Warning,\\" \\"1984,\\" and maybe \\"5150\\" (if you dig Sammy's stuff). If you dig what you hear on this set, buy all of the albums. There are a lot of album track gems, especially on the David Lee Roth-era albums. But this set has the hits. <br /> <br />The live Sammy tracks are pretty pointless. We already have the original, classic studio versions. Why would we want live versions from \\"Right Here, Right Now\\"? At least give us NEW live versions, guys! They could have replaced those cuts with \\"Humans Being,\\" one of the 1996 David Lee Roth tracks, and an album track or two. But, hey, what's here is good. <br /> <br />I gave this album 5 stars because it's a good introduction to the music of Van Halen. I got introduced by buying each album myself, but for casual fans this will do. I really give it 4.5 stars, but I thought I'd round it up to 5 here. What can I say? I'm a big Van Halen fan and I'd rather give this 5 stars than 4. If you're a casual fan, buy it for the classics. If you're a diehard, buy it for the new songs. Either way you can't lose. <br /> <br />(By the way, the embossed digipack is pretty cool... although a better booklet and liner notes would have been good.)
B0000AQVCL|3.0|The influences on this CD are obvious--and they are good influences to have for a CD.  The songs are, especially the single.  But there is a tendency for the songs to turn right nstead of left, usually around chorus time.  Most of the lyrics are not especially inspired.  Buy it, but don't expect it to be a staple.

Although written in the same vein as \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", and written from the viewpoint of a 15 year old emotionally challenged lad, it was droll, to say the least.  Originally purchased for my daughter, I have since decided that it is better for a charity to make 50 cents from.

B0000AC8N4|5.0|Of all the albums Dexter did after the bebop era, this does the best job of giving the listener that same feeling that people got from listening to him back in the '40s.  I'd say that this is primarily due to his choice of personnel on this particular date in Paris, which inlcudes the amazing Bud Powell on piano, an amazing French bassist named Pierre Michelot, and the one of the greatest jazz drummers from the bebop era, Kenny Clarke.  The choice of tunes for this album also has to do with maintaining that feeling, since two of the tunes were Charlie Parker staples (\\"Scrapple from the Apple\\" and \\"A Night in Tunisia\\"), one was one of THE tunes to know in the '40s (\\"Broadway\\"),and two lovely ballads that were covered a lot during that time (\\"Willow Weep for Me\\", which has a very laid-back feeling to it that is the most unique Dexter ballad performance I've ever heard, and his lovely interpretation of \\"Stairway to the Stars\\", which has a very similar feeling to his ballad performances on \\"Go!\\").  Added to this superb album are two bonus tracks (Gershwin's classic, \\"Our Love is Here to Stay\\", and a wonderful trio reading of \\"Like Someone in Love\\", which shows off Powell's skills greatly.)  Overall, if you are a fan of Charlie Parker, old Dexter from the '40's, or just a plain out jazz fan, \\"Our Man in Paris\\" is for you.

B00000IL29|5.0|I don't think I could name a more perfect album than this one, if I tried!  That's just how amazing Herbie Hancock's best-known acoustic work is, especially due to the amazing personnel of Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, the terribly underrated George Coleman on tenor sax, and the magnificent rythymn team of Ron Carter and Tony Williams, who, along with Herbie, make up the impeccable rhytymn section of Miles's second great quintet. The underwater/out to sea theme of the album is kept throughout, which I'd say is mainly due to Tony Williams's awesome wash and ebb effect he gets through his cymbals for the duration of the album.  Of all the tunes, I can't pick a favorite, since it is all five of these amazing Hancock compositions that make this album spectacular.  I think that this cd shows both Hubbard and Hancock at the top of their game, and that's saying a lot since I own a lot of magnificent gems that feature these two giants.  This is definitely one of the most essential jazz albums ever, so if you don't already own this, do yourself a favor and order it right now!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Finally received album through the mail and I never thought it would be this good. With the four year break they came up with very good songs. A great rock/punk album that I have been waiting for and so far I love 11 of the tracks (Yes i like to skim them right through and choose, lol). I was a bit suprised how long the track was especially (about ten minutes of \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\". I can see how they are \\"SOMEWHAT\\" compared to the sounds of Clash, but this isn't there album and there works....this is Green Day who affirmatively like to call themselves \\"American Idiot\\"...we can use that term more loosely for President Bush.
068987474X|5.0|This book really isn't just for women, and it really isn't just about relationships.  True, it focuses on empowering women to say \\"Hey, I'm worth more than this and I'm not going to settle\\" which is a wonderful thing to realize, but it really goes beyond relationships.  We are conditioned to work hard (and, as an unfortunate side effect, suffer) for everything in life - jobs, material possessions, etc - and when love or money or other things we want don't come to us, it's easier emotionally to justify and/or make excuses as to why we're not getting what we feel we deserve when we want it.  Whether it's the attention of a man (or woman) or a promotion at work, the power of this book is that it tells you in no uncertain terms that YOU are the only one who will suffer if you continue to cling to something that wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />The authors have really stumbled on to something good here - what I took away from this book and will continue to remember is that life is too short to pine for things that aren't meant to happen.  Who knows how many great things pass us by because we're too busy worrying about getting something or someone that just wasn't meant to be.  Read it and weep, if you must, but then also be glad that - if you apply what you've learned and make it your mantra - it's the last time you will cry over a love or aspiration unrealized.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|First off im glad i watched this film. The whole concept of time travel and the chaos theory interest me, possibly because of their surreality and their unpredicatbiliy. It was therefore nota difficult buy among the action films and rom-coms. <br /> <br />       Its important to note that this film has disturbing moments. Not just cringeworthy but genuinally disturbing. This is a credit to the directors but at the same time its definitly a film that should be kept away from young or timid children/people. <br /> <br />        Ashton Kutcher played his part well. Unlike other reviewers i dont deem him to be any more than an adequate actor but the most important thing was to convey guilt and sadness at how his actions affected others, which he carried off very well. <br /> <br />        Also it was important that the effects that his changes made were linked to the changes themselves. I thought this was also done quite well. It didnt get overly surreal. <br /> <br />        In all honesty the concept of the film was possibly better than the film itself. Not to say this was throwaway trash like so many other films. After i saw this film for the first time i started thinking, how will my actions affect others?  <br /> <br />        Critisism for this film is unfounded as not only is it a good concept but most of the missing links formed by the blackouts are mended in the end. This is when you get to appreciate how good a film this is. Definitly a stop start emotional experience with an underriding meesage. Worth repeat viewing.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Typically, I'm not one to listen to indie music, but this album excels so greatly that one can't help but be awed. Not only does the band write moving, profound lyrics, but they also play with a skillfully emotional drive. For once, the hype is justified. Anyone who listens to good music at all needs to buy this cd immediately.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am so glad I bought this CD. I've always liked Green Day's singles before, but I've never actually owned one of their albums before. I read that this one had a lot of hype behind it, and it's all true, people!! I wasn't expecting a concept album! Absolute masterpiece! I can listen to every song on this CD, even the 2 \\"megatracks\\" without skipping to something else. I don't have a particular favorite. Do yourself a favor and give yourself the opportunity to experience Green Day, in a way you never have before.
B000000OSG|4.0|Use Your Illusion II is the better album of the two Illusion cd'a by Guns N' Roses. This album has a better tone and feel to it then part I. Slash guitar work is amazing here as it is always. Axl's lyrics are some of the best of his carear, I take that back this album proves what a genius the man is these are his best lyrics ever! Izzy, Dave, and Duff keep rythm perfect as we all know Guns N' Roses had one of the most powerful rythem sections of all time.<br /><br />The album opens up with on of GN'R's best songs, 'Civil War' this has great acoustic and electric arrangements. Axl wrote amazingly powerful lyrics for this anti-war epic. Slash's guitar solos are great. 'Yesterdays' was a slight hit off the album. It has great bluesy guitar and the lyrics are great. It talks about living for the future and not the past but always keeping those memories in the back of your mind. Not to mention 'Yesterdays' has one of Axl's best vocal performances. Next you go right into Guns N' Roses cover of Bob Dylans 'Knocking On Heavens Door' which is a great song by Mr. Dylan butput in the hands of GNR this song gets turned into one of the greatest cover songs of all time. Slash's guitar melodies are beautiful and fit perfectly., his solo is powerful and Axl's arrangements and use of a church choir are amazing. I get chills every time I hear GNR's version of this song. 'Get N' The Ring' is great but should have just been put on GNR live. It is a big F.U. to all the media and critics that tore Guns N' Roses down all the time. Great song but it doesnt belong on this album. 'Breakdown' is one of my favorite songs on the album. It has a cool banjo intro by slash then its into straight up bluesy rock and roll. One of the better songs on the album. 'Pretty Tied Up' is a hard rocker with a killer chorus. Slash's solo isnt half bad either. Now on to 'Estranged' which is the best song Guns N' Roses ever recorded! Its tied for Slash's best guitar song along With November Rain off of Use Your Illusion I. The arangement of 'Estranged' is the best I have ever heard in a rock and roll song, this is easily one of the top five songs I have ever heard. Its got amazingly powerful lyrics. Slash's guitar melodies are the best he ever made and the slolos he plays at the end of the songs are two of his best. I would have paid the full price for this song alone! The arrangement on this song is why I said Axl was a genius. 'You Could Be Mine' is the hardest rocking song on the album. It was a realy big hit for Guns N' Roses. I think it might have been an even bigger hit then 'Civil War.' The chorus in this song is whickedly cool. 'Don't Cry' with alt. lyrics is not bad but is nowhere as good as the original on Use Your Illusion I. Its not bad but the album could have done with out.<br /><br />There are five more songs on the album of those '14 Years' 'Shotgun Blues' and 'Locamotive' are decent songs but nothing to special. 'So Fine' isnt a good song its just filler really. But the last track on the album 'My World' is Axl making stupid lyrics and mixing them with a beat box and its like rap-metal. It sounds like a really, really bad Ice T. impersonation. Other then those two songs this is a really amazing album that no hard rock fan should be without. Once you buy this album listen to 'Estranged' loud and over and over again!r Illusion I.

B00005JGAB|5.0|Who could hate the Ramones? You could laugh at them, sure (which I do a lot) and love them all at the same time (which I do) but you could never hate them (well, you could hate Johnny, apparently - not meaning to speak ill of the recently dead, but that's what it sounds like) when they played. I think this is one of the greatest pop albums ever made. Yes, Pop. This is not really that punk, at least compared to the beautifully nihilistic music that came after. This was always more of a laugh, and even a well-meaning laugh in some places (although \\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow The World\\" is pretty eerie). Well, what can we say about this album? No one ever sounded like this in 1976. It's incredible. The bonus tracks also kick tons of ass (who knew \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" could sound even sweeter?). The Ramones are fantastic. As anyone with a brain will tell you. Trying to describe the songs would be an exercise in monotony, but particular favorites are \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" (duh), \\"Beat On The Brat\\" (duh), \\"Judy Is A Punk\\" (duh), \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" (duh), \\"Chain Saw\\" (possibly my favorite for no reason at all), \\"Loudmouth\\", and oh hell, everything's great. I can't say anything bad about this album...it's short, too short, but that's all, really. I love it without reservation. Praise Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy.
0618526412|5.0|I can totally understand now why this is an 'Oprah Pick'. It is a magnificent piece of work, masterfully written (though it was originally published in the '40's). I applaud this pick as a hard to put down wonderfully written book.<BR>It is a wonderful memoir and very memorable in the prolific pages. I rank it up there with \\"He Never Called Again\\",\\"A Child Called It\\" for it's integrity to the story. I highly recommend this book.<BR>Thank you Oprah!!
B000003RCY|5.0|a very good debut album !!!! this was the last rammstein album i purchased, but it was one of the better albums ive heard in a long time. heirate mich has a good guitar solo (watch the performance on lchtspielhaus if you own it, its excellent !!!) and seemann is my altime favourite song on this album.
B000022TSY|5.0|I was utterly surprised by this film. I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our now-infamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly, this did occur, but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying, \\"Guns don`t kill people, people kill people\\", well after watching this film, it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change, yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites, androids, and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world, yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine, we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a free-spirited, mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now, we are more concerned about money and the family-plan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake, eat, and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time ... why? It is called \\"bills\\" and \\"responsibilities\\". These are the choices that we chose to make, and for anyone to say that they cannot do it, I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything, it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be, and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see ...<br /><br />Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film, I felt that Hopper (who also directed) knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.<br /><br />Nicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much, was the product of a wealthy upbringing, but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed (in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him), never left the state line, and never lived life. He constantly used the expression, \\"I have always wanted to ...\\". How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a co-worker? If you always wanted to do it, why haven't you? So, here we have Hanson, dreaming a dream but never following through, who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites, but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking (driving most of the time) representations of the word \\"freedom\\". It is tragic what happens to Harmon, because he (unfortunately) experienced the negative side of freedom ... hatred and fear of the unknown.<br /><br />There was one scene that just jumped out at me. It occurs in the diner before the incident later that night where our travelers experience hatred in the country they admire so much. They go from peace and love to fear and hate. Itis as if they witnessed night and day. It was frightening to hear the words coming from people in that restaurant. It was not only scary to wonder what was going to happen to our narrators, but mainly that people were speaking that way to fellow citizens. I know that it still occurs today, and it is surprising to me. We bomb a country because they do not follow the same principles that we do, but we need to start asking ourselves this question ... do we need another United States?<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****te.

B0000057C5|5.0|this album wasnt my first rammstein album, but i had heard about the song du hast. (much thanks to those writing reviews who are correcting peoples translations) first, the english versin of the sone is NOT A TRANSLATION OF GERMAN TO ENGLISH. it is the english VERSION. i peronally think that there are much better songs than du hast, but the video is in fact very good. i like tier, klavier, and kuss mich the best. the cover of the depeche mode song stripped is also nice, but its not avalable on some c.d.s, sadly.
0784011680|3.0|Directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, director of Gandhi, this is the story of Sir Charles Chaplin. The comic genius who showed the world what comedy was and introduced American society into the film era. This film, simply put, was amazing. I was hesitant at first to see how well Robert Downy, Jr would do as one of the most influential men in movie history...and he was on target. He showed the brilliance of Chaplin, and also showed a bit of his dark side. The side that not many knew about...his underage womanizing, his constant pursuit of perfection over anything else in the world, and also as the humanitarian.<br /><br />Chaplin did more for film then any other actor during his time, and it showed. Although my biggest gripe about this film would be the director, the actors themselves took me away from my seat an into the life of Charlie Chaplin. This film stared Dan Ankroyd, Anthony Hopkins, Moria Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Marisa Tomei, James Woods, Diane Lane, Nancy Travis, Kevin Kline, and even a favorite of mine...Milla Jovovich.  The all star cast pushed this movie to excellence.  This film could have been one of the best autobiographical pieces ever made, had it not been for the director.  Now, don't get me wrong...he does good work...just this one was not his \\"cup of tea\\".  I went into this film expecting a darker ending...a darker story...and a darker character.  We all knew how funny he was, but how dark was his humor...when I went back and looked at some of his old silent films (before the \\"talkies\\") I was amazed by how many of them portray his life...the darker aspects of his life.  There are many scenes about his mother and how she was put into an asylum by Chaplin himself.  Hopkins makes the comment, \\"Your grandmother was certified insane, and your mother was certified insane...where did you get your humor?\\" That line made me think...I would have liked to see the trauma that was impacted him as a child.<br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks (played wonderfully by Kevin Kline) said to him, \\"You know you look like him, Hitler...with the mustache. I think he stole your bit.\\" and Chaplin just smiles....was there something there that we didn't know about...was Chaplin a communist although his brother was a Jew.  These were confusing, and the director did not cover these grounds.<br /><br />Downey in several of the scenes tells Hopkins (the book reviewer) that he doesn't want to talk about it...and they don't .... I wanted them to go deeper into his psyche and see where all of it came from.  Most of these points were just passing glance...which irritated me. Watch the ending, the director tries to wrap up Chaplin's life at the Academy Awards, and that was when it hit me about how much darker I wanted this to be...I don't know, I guess I am the generation of JFK and Nixon or Oliver Stone at his best...but I needed darker.<br /><br />I know it was there.....I just know it!!!!<br /><br />Grade:  *** out of *****rfully by Kevin Kline) said to him, \\"You know you look like him, Hitler...with the mustache.

B00003CXCT|4.0|First off, this is the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set, so it's still worth the price just to have a clean set of these movies.  And I'm not going to harp on the scene changes because I liked them and thought they added nicely to the movie.  What kept this from becoming an \\"Epic\\" release for me was the music audio problems on \\"A New Hope\\" for the final scene.  The John Williams theme that so clearly defined this final battle originally is barely present and detracts from the dramatic effect of the ending.  Before now, the music heightened the tone and helped put us on the edge of the seat....but not now.  It's dull and inaudible. <br />One other note.  I also read the channels of music audio came out wrong/reversed. <br />Just for those glitches, I dropped a star. <br />This will work until he releases another updated set in a few years....but that's all.  Consider waiting for a sale unless you can't wait. <br />
0767802470|5.0|If I had the time to take this movie door-to-door and sit down with everyone in America to watch this film, I would.  Everyone needs to realize that I have a fascination with submarine films.  I loved The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide.  Both of them rank as my top action films. I  don't know why I love this genre so much. I think it has to do somewhat with my passion for sci-fi.  The ocean is almost like fighting in another world.  So many times we have seen wars play out on land, and while there is only so much you can show with a land fight, the war field on the open sea allows for so much more creativity.<br /><br />Director Wolfgang Peterson gives us some great characters. While not much dialogue happens in this film, you can see everyone's expressions on their faces, and those expressions tell better stories than words.  You can see their fear, their excitement, their sadness, and their power by just the way that Peterson directs them. With his direction, I felt that I was on this U-Boat with the crew. Peterson perfectly portrays a feeling of crampness and claustrophobia wrapped together as one.  I think that during one of the bombing scenes I broke a sweat because of what was happening on screen.<br /><br />Finally, I am also a fan of films that tell a different angle on the story. So many years I have watched war movie after war movie that show the victorious American's beating the classic \\"evil-doers\\".  Now don't get me wrong, these are fun sometimes, but I love to see a different angle.  In history class we didn't learn about the casualties of the Germans in WWII.  We learn about them as a statistic, and never put these heroes on a human level.  This film humanizes the German's conditions during the war. The Germans are human being also, who fought for their country just as valiantly as our soldiers did during WWII.  They had families, they had pasts, they had homes that they left to become a part of history.  To fight for your beliefs.  That is what America teaches us, fight for what we believe in....doesn't it?<br /><br />I could talk about this for hours, but instead I am going to sit back, relax, and tell you how wonderful Das Boot was to watch.  I have not been this entertained for a long time. Bravo to everyone involved in this film. I think it IS the best war film ever released (that I have seen). I want everyone to get out of their seats this weekend and go rent this movie. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Grade:  ***** out of *****is what America teaches us, fight for what we believe in....doesn't it?   <br /> <br />I could talk about this for hours, but instead I am going to sit back, relax, and tell you how wonderful Das Boot was to watch.

0767853636|5.0|i remember seeing this film in the theatre when i was about 12 or 13. i feel in love with it!!!  i see the other reviews that this version does not compare to the disney version, and more so on the play version.  might i remind you that Annie was a comic strip, long before it was even though of as a play or even a movie. so i dont think that it is fair to compair this movie to the play or even to the disney version.  i feel that it is simply a different version that hollywood put together.  at that time when annie came out, musicals were fading fast!! the last big musical that was a box office smash before annie, was grease. but even though musicals were on the way to becomming \\"extinct\\". it was not really until evita that they started to be \\"revived\\". look at moulon rouge and chicago. the latter won a best picture oscar award among others. i feel that this movie fif a real good job on tellng the story of how annie meet daddy warbucks in a two hour or so movie. i feel they could have found a better girl to play annie, but we can't win them all. all and all she did the best that she could knowing that this is the first movie that she made. i bought this dvd movie a few months ago, and i dont think it sound really well on a good surround sound.  I have done some research in recent monts to find that the new version will be cheese and scan. That is a major turn off when I am buying my DVDs. I will stick to this version, for it is, if not already out of print. Dont get this movie,  this movie it very wide.
1559409002|5.0|The sound was horrible in this film. The acting seemed like it was done by high school students. The score was unneeded. The direction was horrible. Nothing was explained.<br /><br />I loved this film.<br /><br />I know, many of you are probably wondering why I loved a film that denounces everything I feel is needed in a film, but for some odd reason in this film it worked. This was a very scary movie. Not the kind of scary that you need blood or violence to make you jump, but the kind that the violins seemed to shrill your way to behind a pillow. I was really impressed that this film was released in 1962.  I would put money down that if this film were to be released today it would do really well.<br /><br />As I watched this film, I made the comment that this could very well have been a Mystery Science Theater 3000 film.  There were certain elements to it that I could see Joel or the bots just making fun of.  So, in that sense, I am glad that I didn't see the film with those guys commenting through it, I may not have enjoyed it as much.  This was a film full of symbolism, of imagination, and of surprises.  I loved the way that Mary went from real life to when people couldn't hear or see her.  It showed that something supernatural was at work instead of just some crazy guy following her around. The carnival was spooky.  This is one of those films that you would put on at Halloween with a great bottle of wine and your best girl by your side.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I enjoyed how this film came to it's conclusion.  As the visions of the phantom man became greater and greater, it was obvious that the cops were getting closer and closer to finding the car.  I also enjoyed the fact that the \\"undead\\" of the film all came out of water to be reborn.  It was great foreshadowing to what would happen to Mary.<br /><br />The director took many risks with the symbolism that he used, and it worked better than some films with today's CGI abilities.  You could tell as you watched this film that imagination was flowing with the writer of this film.

B0001YRVN4|3.0|I won't lie, the video quality is great, the audio quality is great. But I'm extremely dissapointed in this dvd release. It /is not/ the original three Star Wars films. It is the 1997 special edition 20th anniversary re-release of the films with added scenes, more special affects and tweaked scenes. I'm just letting everyone who is interested in purchasing this know. I bought it without knowing this and am thouroughly dissapointed with the release. I'll probably end up watching the films on vhs now, but I don't know yet.

Showdown: I love the music in this song, but the lyrics are pretty dumb. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Breathe on me: my fav. song on the CD!, I love this song, the beat rocks, Britney should do more songs like this. 10/10 <br /> <br />5.

Outrageous: 2 words, (Very repetitive!) but still pretty good with a dance/RnB sound to it. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. Touch of my hand: this one is cool but i doubt it will ever be a single with the message of it, very cool music though. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. The hook up: the middle of the song when she sings faster sounds awesome, i like this one too. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. Shadow: i really like this one, a very nice ballad with nice lyrics, my 2nd fav. on the CD. 10/10 <br /> <br />11.

B000089HCR|5.0|When KISS and ALICE COOPER came out with a shocking show, sticky tunes, easy listening songs; too many bands tried to copy the same line.  Just a few ones evolve into something good (WASP, MOTLEY CRUE, TWISTED SISTER and maybe another one that I don't remember right now).<br /><br />Well, WASP at first sight, when they came out (1983) seemed like a tight band, just as Van Halen, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Etc. The members seemed to have a good time but in a few months the one that standed out and stayed in the band was Blackie Lawless.  And they seemed tight because they sounded great together. Maybe they weren't as big as some other bands did in the 80's but with this CD they printed a mark on those days.<br /><br />WASP had a bad attitude with melodic songs, they sound hard and fast but very melodic.  Blackie has a voice that only his image could fit, deep and very high range.  This album almost did it as a classic, maybe if they had stayed together more time they would have been bigger.<br /><br />The uptempo part of the CD is \\"I wanna be somebody\\", \\"L.O.V.E. Machine\\", \\"School daze\\", \\"On your knees\\", \\"The torture never stops\\", we have a very slow (at least for them) and very nice song \\"Sleeping (In the fire), and not as fast but very dark and crushing are \\"B.A.D.\\", \\"Tha flame\\", \\"Hellion\\", \\"Tormentor\\".  The music on this CD is very diverse and enjoyable.<br /><br />On this new edition they included the first EP that they released and it was called ANIMAL (F*!\\" like a beast).  For my taste, they spread the songs cleverly. First they put \\"Animal\\" and at the end they include \\"Show no mercy\\" and \\"Paint it Black\\".  This EP was very hard to find in those days (well, at least here in Mexico).<br /><br />\\"Animal\\" is almost as good as any song on the original release, very fast and raw. \\"Show no mercy\\" pretty much the same and \\"Paint it black\\" is a cover from the Stones and all I can say is that WASP should stick to their music. The cover is bad and frankly I don't like it.<br /><br />On this edition they included a lot of band information. They printed the original pictures that came on the album but the quality is quite bad because the photos are very grainy and it looks like a copy of a copy.<br /><br />Is this one recommended? Yes, of course it is.<br /><br />Highlights: I wanna be somebody, Sleeping (in the fire)<br />Lowlights: Paint it blackf band information.

B00003CXCT|4.0|George Lucas wields his artist's rights like a light saber. All three films are given digital nips and tucks affecting visuals, audio and storyline. For purists demanding release of the original theatrical version, there's plenty of provocation. Let the fan boys debate: The rest of us will celebrate the return of Luke Skywalker and pals in intriguing reference-quality discs that eclipse all previous video incarnations.<br /><br /> Lucas' changes help bring the films into alignment with their (newer) prequels. They are, for the most part, pleasing and harmless CG upgrades. In a few cases, actors from the current arc are subtly inserted into the older films. Most viewers will enjoy the little surprises planted along the way -- but maybe not the major one at the end of the third film.<br /><br />The job involved cleaning up something like 100 pieces of debris per frame. Amazingly, the wear has vanished. All of it. These look and sound like new films. Visuals are bright and bold. Contrasts run high -- Darth Vader's helmet is as black as his heart -- and the colors appear oversaturated at times. It's a handsome look with plenty of pop -- but one that takes getting used to. The 1997 laserdiscs look soft, murky and artifact-riddled by comparison.<br /><br />The Dolby 5.1 EX audio makes consistent use of the rear-center speaker (for a change), but the audio mix just isn't on par with the visuals, especially on \\"New Hope.\\" The mix is obvious and light on ambient effects. Dialogue can be muffled and the volume drifts now and then. (No DTS to the rescue.) John Williams fans will suffer a disappointment in the first Death Star battle scene, as his score gets a downgrade in the new mix.<br /><br />Kevin Burns' 2 1/2-hour documentary \\"Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy\\" anchors the features. The film's sole point of view appears to be the greatness of George Lucas. Burns says he enjoyed editorial freedom, but the docu plays like an endless Hollywood making-of featurette as it recounts Lucas' struggles and triumphs. (\\"It's hard to remember a time before `Star Wars,' \\" the narrator intones ridiculously at the beginning.) A curious decision to let the film drag on so, given the DVD medium's many interactive possibilities.<br /><br />Still, \\"Dreams\\" has plenty to offer even casual fans. Burns landed interviews with virtually all of the key talent, executives and craftsmen. At every turn, there are rare photos, concept sketches, outtakes or candid clips.<br /><br />Three snappy featurettes cover the evolution of the Jedi knights' light sabers (a huge technical problem early on), development of the \\"Star Wars\\" characters (Luke Skywalker was a little person at one point; a 60-year-old general at another) and the series' legacy (James Cameron, Ridley Scott and Peter Jackson discuss the films' influence on their work, especially the concept of a \\"used future.\\").<br /><br />A 9-minute preview of the third prequel features shots of Hayden Christensen donning the Darth Vader helmet -- yikes.king-of featurette as it recounts Lucas' struggles and triumphs.

While some people are complaining about the length and pace, I could have easily read another 900 pages.

B00003CXCT|4.0|For those of you complaining about the extra footage being added, just shut up.  George Lucas wanted these DVD's to be like the Directors Cut, previously he was unable to add the extra footage because there wasn't enough room on the VHS.  Now that he has the capability of adding the shots he wanted, fans are lashing back at him.  <br /> <br />He enhanced the sounds and quality of the movies, which are much better than the original, and the extra footage he added is only space scenes and a few shots of Tatooine.  Its not as if he changed the entire plot.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I give this CD 5 stars not necessarily for the quality of the music (which is excellent), but just for the fact that I've been waiting a long time for an album like this to come along.  Albums these days are too often either one or two singles along with half an hour of filler, or the same song twelve times.  Green Day had been a little guilty of sameness in some of their earlier music, and as much as I like the earlier material, they would have been one of the last bands that I would figure to produce a \\"concept album.\\"  But here it is.  In a sense, this CD is the fusion of three different eras.  Green Day updated their neo-punk style, bringing it in-line with the musical style of the 21st century, while reverting to an album-making strategy with its roots in the sixties.  Dookie was a great CD in its time, but it has not aged very well.  But by making this CD reflect the social and political exigencies of our time, they have proven that their art is as valid now as it was back in my days of teenage angst.  The difference is that now it sticks in your head, and I don't just mean the tunes.  If an artist writes a song in protest of contemporary society, one may be immediately moved by it, but when it's over, one hears a sappy love song or a song about the joys of drinking, drugs, sex, or whatever, and the lesson is forgotten.  And that is exactly how the society that is being protested works: every time we are spurred to action by a perceived injustice, we are soon distracted by some trivial matter.  We are easily distracted in the information age.  But Green Day makes us listen.  This is not a collection of songs; this is a journey through a landscape of anger, frustration, and disappointment, and we cannot detach ourselves from the story.  The word \\"we\\" appears more times than is normal on a rock album, involving us in the plot.  To free ourselves from the distractions and trivialities of our time, we must struggle with the characters in the story.  And so for once, we stay and listen to the whole disc; no skipping around allowed here. <br /> <br />By the way, I am writing this after having only listened to this CD once.  I can only imagine what my reaction will be after the next few hearings.  This may be one of the few rock albums I've heard that gets better (instead of more boring) each time I listen to it.  I sincerely hope this CD starts a trend in popular music.
068987474X|5.0|Men are usually quite transparent when it comes to women. Unfortunately, women sometimes project their own inner complexities on us and assume we are emotionally similar. We're not. If we want to be with someone - and that particular someone indicates any degree of interest - a freight train couldn't stop us from colliding. Men are hard-wired predators and will pursue unabashedly anyone found to be compelling. This is not to say that we won't pretend to ignore someone who doesn't reciprocate our feelings [defense mechanism], but the moment the door is opened, we'll be standing outside. As a heterosexual male who has  experienced the come-on by gay men, I know that the moment I so much as smile I can absolutely count on that person making a move without my having to lift a finger. Women know this all too well about straight men. If we don't call, it's not because we have intimacy issues or are suffering shell-shock from a previous relationship. We're just not interested. If we were, you'd know it. TRUST ME! The dirty little secret is, men are very difficult to get rid of once we're hooked and our pattern of behavior is as consistent as a Martha Stewart recipe for 300 inmates.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Anyone noticed that on average 2 American soldiers die per day in Iraq while hallibuerton make on average at least 20 million dollars a day in Iraq. This film might be one sided but every day we hear lies from the white house about how our children have to die in Iraq because Saddam was an awful dictator. HELLO i would want my children to fight to kill and capture tose who attacked us on the 11th of september 2001 but i wouldnt want to lose a son so some people in Irawq can have a better life, our childrens blood is worth more than that and this film aims to sjow us that this administrations values green bits of paper over red pints of soldiers blood. Those 140,000 us troops in Iraq could be busy hunting osama bin laden in Afghanosthan but NO, they are painting targets on themselves i Iraq because of this administrations criminal policies. Over a thousand dead and counting and for what? Can anyone say it was worth it? I know for sure Michael Moore doesnt think so and neither do I so if you want your kids to die for hallibuton then avoid this movie, if not just watch it and keep and open mind.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and I plan to buy a copy to loan out as well as show in my home.  Mike Moore stands up for the Americans who seem to matter the least to our government.  The young soldiers, recruited from low income neighborhoods and malls.  They are now dying at an average of 3 a day in Iraq. This movie tells you why.  The fact behind every comment made can be found at [...]  I have heard a great deal of criticism of this film and the facts, yet the remarks are unspecific when it comes to  the content of the film because they are being made by people who have NEVER seen the film.  Like John McCain.  Nothing makes a person look dumber than to make a critical remark about a film, book, etc without first-hand knowledge.   I have yet to hear any of the critics of this film explain why there are only 8 state troopers in Oregon?  Why is the FBI wasting its manpower and resources on peace groups composed of cookie-eating Americans?  Or an elderly man, who should have the right to his opinion?  Why didn't the Congress take time to read the Patriot Act?  Why wasn't the Bin Laden family detained for questioning about his whereabouts?  Why did Powell and Rice both assure Americans in early 2001 that Saddam wasn't a threat and had no capability for building wmd only to flip-flop after 9/11?  Why were only 11 thousand troops sent after Osama and the Taliban?  Why were they allowed to escape? Why is George I portrait hanging in a Saudi palace?  Why was George I and Bin Laden's brother-in-law in a business meeting together on 9/11?  Where is our unbiased, un-corporate owned media?  You will not come away from this film untouched.  The first half is hilarious at times while the last half is heart-wrenching.  Every American should see this film and start asking questions of our elected officials.  I'm so glad to see it ranks #2 on the Amazon sales list.  Maybe the average American is not as apathetic as the Bush Administration hopes.
B000005J08|4.0|Anyone heard \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" by Suicide?  John Zorn IS Frankie Teardrop...he IS the bloodcurdling scream that follows the gun shot.  He IS the bullet in your stomach.  He IS the man you saw on television that drowned his baby in Lake Michigan.  He is the cancerous growth that killed your uncle.  John Zorn invented your nightmares (with a saxophone, mind you), and he is still somehow listenable and cool.  Hip doesn't even begin to describe the cat that could even make James Chance blush.  His version of \\"Tv Eye\\" made even the creator of the song, the Iggster himself, drop his jaw.  What a talent, what a performer. <br />Don't tell your friends about this...their lives are peaceful and secure...don't mess that up for them.  Keep this one for yourself.
0316666343|2.0|This and other \\"book group\\" books like The Secret Life of Bees, Bee Season, The Corrections, etc. typify the decline of American culture. Though I suppose that in the past, the \\"popular\\" books were not the ones that survived the test of time, much as, I'm certain, these won't, either. <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones was a decent read, though given the subject matter, oddly devoid of emotion. There are some aspects that are disturbing, which is okay, but others that are downright silly. But when I got to the scene where Suzie enters her friend's body so she can have sex with Ray, I just lost it. This is SOOOO Hollywood and such a cheap trick. Well, at least I am forewarned, not to see the movie version, which I'm sure will play up this totally stupid scene. This ruined the book for me.
0800177177|5.0|Coppola's version of Dracula has to be his greatest work since the Godfather series.  The movie centers on Dracula's search for his lost love.  And he sees it in Mina Murray, Jonathan's fiancee.  Looking at the picture of Mina, Dracula is drawn to the woman's beauty as she reminds him of the woman he loved and lost.   <br />In his quest for blood, he looks for Mina to be reunited with her leaving Jonathan to be held captive by his \\"wives\\".  He changes from the old, pasty face coif-haired to a dashingly handsome man finding Mina in downtown London.  Mina is seduced by him but knows that she is also much attached to Jonathan.   <br />Gary Oldham is an outstanding actor portraying the centuries old count and the young transformed man.  He carries himself well in the movie.   <br />Coppola gives a more romantic rather than gothic version of Bram Stoker's novel which is why some viewers didn't take to it very well when it first came out.  They were expecting blood and guts.  There was blood but there was also a story line as to why Dracula came into existence and why he preyed on his victims.  The movie gives us a small history of the real man behind the character Vlad Tepes.

Pi is a resouceful, well taught pilgrim, and his adventure, outlandish <br />and frightening, becomes our own. <br />But the ending of \\"Life of Pi\\" is what is the surprise, and we find ourselves thinking <br />back to Aesop and his fables. <br />A wonderul, delightful tale.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This is my first movie review and I'm only compelled to write it because I hated this movie so much.  If you haven't yet seen this piece of drivel, you've probably heard, like myself, how absolutely stupefyingly fabulous it is.  Right?  Well, no, not exactly.    This movie would have you singing in the streets, believing that love is all around.  Different types of \\"love\\" are explored in it.  The love of sister for brother, of client and agent (aww), of man for woman (who cannot speak the same language), etc etc etc.  But truly, the movie's 8 stories do not ever really come together to form a coherent whole.  Each one of them is slightly more ridiculous than the previous, culminating in a trip to Portugal of such unbelievable proportions that I found myself nauseated, actually.  Every single \\"character\\" in this movie is a homonculus and it's not even funny when it comes right down to it.  A man in love with his best friend's fiance?  Hilarious, right?  A mid-life crisis forces a husband and father unto infidelity?  Hah hah hah.  What a spiffy comedy!    I feel sorry for every stellar actor in this movie because they are all tragically underused, while I felt really used at the end of watching this stale piece of work.
B00003CXCT|2.0|the sound, and visual quality are great and its nice to have them on dvd, but the films have been altered further to create more continuity, including voice dubbing over boba fett's original voice, altered dialgoue between the emperor and Darth Vader with a new holographic emperor in empire. and the last scene in return of the jedi the original actor who played the spirit of anakin skywalker has been replaced with hayden Christensen. All of these things really alter the films for me and make it a far different trilogy than the one I grew up with.  So I will say I'm not fond of the changes and additions.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I discovered Interpol after Spin magazine gave them a lot of editorial space and favorable reviews.  I would like to thank Spin magazine for introducing me to one of the most unique, original bands in the past twenty years.  The album is dark but exquisite.  Every time I listen to \\"PDA\\", easily the best song on the album, I get lost.  I'm entranced and when the song ends I feel a slight depression.  Therefore this album has become an addictive habit.  Probably the best legal drug on the market.  I am anticipating the arrival of \\"Antics\\", their latest release.  Along with \\"PDA\\", every single song will get inside you and tease every pleasure principal your ears posess.  I'm serious, it doesn't get any better than this.  Bring on ANTICS!  I haven't more excited about a new release in years.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I will say that Star Wars DVD was worth the wait but I cannot say that honestly.   <br /> <br />The music on the DVD is outstanding and can never be matched.  This helps if you still have the old VHS version and never bothered to get a special edition. <br /> <br />However unlike the special edition VHS cassettes, the DVD version atleast to me are very dark.  I had to put on my brightness just to accomodate this movie.  This never was like this with the VHS version. <br /> <br />I think Lucas screwed this over big time.  He should have not made major changes and just used the Special Editions as they were.  I don't approve of making more changes espeically adding in characters or settings from the first three prequels.  I don't like that at all. <br /> <br />He should have taken his time to get the DVD edition out.  Now I feel like  I wasted my money for this.
B0000025KI|5.0|I'm not one of the \\"Bruce can do no wrong\\" crowd either. But on most of his albums there is a song or two that you (if you have any interest in Bruce at all) will love. Do you ask more of anyone else? First, the song \\"The River\\" is a song that will be remembered as a snapshot of a time in American History for 50 or so years to come. If you know \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\"... well, it's of that caliber. \\"Independence Day\\" is also an excellent song, though not quite as brilliant as TR. It has many of the same themes, the same general mood--Springsteen's albums often have a mood. And a lot of the other songs are either good, entertaining, or some combination of the two--eg. \\"Sherry darling.\\" The albums from the 70s are brilliant too. Most of them are important in the development of the history of American rock music (I won't claim Elvis status--by the way, I think I saw him in a 7-11 last week--can anyone confirm?). Long story short, spend your 20 some dollars on this.

B00030590I|5.0|As somebody else said,  this movie is about philosophy and spirituality.  It's also about romance.  I wish I had seen the original version,  since I heard it was better.   <br /> <br />Anyway,  this is the kind of movie that will flow throughout your soul and leave you feeling changed when it's over,  if you're looking for a deep message.  The words are potent,  the colors show deep emotion,  the actors are fierce and the choreography is fantastic.  Of course the choreography is not supposed to be realistic.  It's artistic and flowing.  Want realistic?  See The Matrix.  Oh wait.. :P <br /> <br />My sister didn't like this film too much because she's a slow reader and doesn't have much of an attention span to begin with.  If subtitles are hard for you to deal with,  I think watching the movie a few times would help.  I know that I didn't catch \\"every\\" subtitle,  but I got the point of the story.   <br /> <br />I only wish my TV were the size of a movie screen so I can see it again in it's full glory.
6301640659|3.0|During the production of this film, there were many protest groups, mainly Gay Right Activists, who made attempts to halt production and influence their opinions as to the tired stereo-typing of films that depicted gay characters as psychotic serial killers.  Which, believe it or not, had actually become quite common in a long list of films.  God bless the activists.  Therefore, during the filming of this movie, the director William Friedkin, felt pressured to alter the story at different points, and so what we have here as an ending I don't believe was supposed to be the actual ending.  That explains why the storyline leaps into the Outer Limits at times and loses it's way back.  Wouldn't it be nice....  if this ever shows up on DVD with perhaps a long lost director's cut... with maybe the original storyline/ending... no matter how bizarre or gory it may well be.  As long as we are given an ending that makes sense, I'd be content.  Al Pacino has always picked roles other actors may not have touched: the bi-sexual bank robber in Dog Day Afternoon, and this kinda-sorta-maybe gay character in Cruising, and with these roles he brings a warmth and understanding that allows one to connect with his character.  Kudos to Al for doing this movie.

B000001Y2U|5.0|When this came out, People were blown away.  Parents and Christians began picketing (And still do) his concerts; not realizing that they are only adding to the fuel of the fire.  A large portion of what I can say about Antichrist Superstar can be said in Manson's own Autobiography the Long Hard Road Out of Hell, so instead of repeating what is said in that marvelous book, I shall state how I discovered Marilyn Manson, the meanings, and what I think of Antichrist Superstar.      I live/grew up on the edge of my town, without cable and very few people around me.  Therefore it was quite easy for my parents to shield me from the world.  I grew up as a kid with a foggy idea of what was around me so to say.  The one thing about my parents was that they were not very religious.  I have never gone to church except for weddings and funerals.  Heck, I didn't really find out about the concept of God until fourth grade.(Yet I knew what Christmas was; thank you Public Schools!)  I had always heard of Marilyn Manson and when you \\"hear of\\" Marilyn Manson, you hear the Rumors of Marilyn Manson.  I thought he was a psycho who did things with his ribs.  When the whole Columbine thing happened, I was afraid that listening to his music would brainwash me.  At the time the only song of his I heard (Still thought was good, but was afraid of listening to it) was the song on the Spawn Soundtrack that has the same title as his book.  After a period of time and occasionally hearing a song here and there, (Rock is Dead, Sweet Dreams) I wanted go deeper into what Manson is all about and examined his music and messages carefully.  What ended up happening is that Manson is now one of my favorite Artists/bands and I own all of his/their records.  Ironic isn't it?      The album Antichrist Superstar is a concept album which tells the story of the rise and fall of the Antichrist Superstar.  It's his growing up as a worm; to becoming the man that you fear.  It is a view on our society and how it functions.  It has the reputation as Manson's darkest and most industrial album.   There are 3 Parts.  This is how the story unfolds.      Part 1: The Heirophant  Irresponsible hate Anthem: It's February 14, 1997 (Valentines Day) The Antichrist has risen, but we most go back to the beginning to understand his origins.    The Beautiful People: The Worm is born into a world where you must look good to succeed in life.  (Awesome Video too)  Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World: Throughout childhood the Worm has been used by people so that they can succeed and not him.    Tourniquet: This is the Worms's love life; every woman has taken advantage of him as well.  He tries to create \\"the perfect woman\\", (see the video) but in the end he is her tourniquet and he is back to square 1.  (Or so it seems)    Part 2: Inauguration of the Worm  Little Horn: Dark clouds begin to gather and The Worm is growing.  He tries to save others, but he knows he can't.  On an additional note, Little Horn appears in the Bible in the book of Daniel.  He was a man that spoke out against god, it is often interpreted that Little Horn is the Antichrist.    Cryptorchild: Even though the Worm is weak, his metamorphosis is starting and he will become stronger.  (The video for this was banned by the way)  Deformography: This is where he begins to become a rock star and starts to learn the tricks of the trade. Some people start to look at him as a leader.    Wormboy: He is just starting to understand what is happening to him.    Mr. Superstar: A Song that analyzes the way rock stars are seen as gods by their fans.  His control over people is growing.    Angel with the Scabbed Wings: His followers and fanatics are doomed, simply put.  He is now inhuman.    Kinderfeld: The title is Field of Children in German.  Technically it's about Manson's grandparents. It's a type of flashback of when the Superstar was a Worm and he is reflecting on all that he has gone through and prepares himself for the final phase.Part 3: Disintegrator Rising  Antichrist Superstar: At this point he tells the people that He didn't do this to them, it was themselves.  He has become the monster.    1996: It's an Election year and the new leader is none other than the Antichrist Superstar.  This is the peek of his wrath.    The Minute of Decay: After all the destruction, hardly anything is left and though he might as well go down, he wants to take everyone with him.  Surprisingly it's a slow song.   The Reflecting God: It turns out that at the end, the only God was himself.  This is where the whole be your own god attitude comes from (I think).  He gives not himself or anyone forgiveness.    Man That You Fear: A nice slow song that shows History repeats itself.  Any Worm can become the next Man that you Fear.    Then there are the untitled silent tracks.  Track 17 is 9 seconds long, tracks 18-97 are 4 seconds long.  And track 98 is 5 seconds long.  I have no idea why it's like that, it just is.    Track 99: It's a small electro plea from the Antichrist.  Is the he really gone?  Lyrics are not given and I had to look them up via the net to understand it.      I honestly feel that this album is a masterpiece.  The only songs that I occasionally skip are Wormboy, Mr. Superstar, and The Minute of Decay.  However it may take a few listens to fully understand everything.  Very angry, original and has yet to be copied.  Manson used to have my fear but now he has my utmost respect. I hoped this helped.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I discovered this CD while visiting Australia, and happened to catch the video...  plus, the local radio station was playing \\"Take Me Out\\" relentessly.  It just goes to show you the power of air play: I was hooked...and had to have it!  I ordered it from a cyber cafe in Sydney.<br /><br />When I got back to the States to find the CD waiting for me, I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of all the tracks.  Smart, sophisticated but \\"crowd-pleasingly\\" popular, too.<br /><br />Let's hope the promise of this CD will pan out to their future endeavors!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the year of 2003 Britney returned to the music scene from her wild year of antics with the infamous MTV kiss with Madonna. In November 2003 Britney released her stunning Cd 'In The Zone'. Britney released her best album yet. She transformed herself from a sexy young teenager to a provocative young woman. In the Zone takes listeners though a journey of different styles of music. From Hard hitting dance tracks, to dirty ghetto Hip Hop to viby trance tracks to beautiful peaceful ballads. This album shows Britney at her best. This album made critics label her \\"The New Madonna\\".  <br />Me Against The Music - This is the infamous duet featuring Madonna. It is a hard hitting club dance track, very different from what is on the radios these days. The track is just about being in a club and being oblivious to everyone and freestyling. This is my 2nd Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. 10/10  <br /> <br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - This track is an Up-tempo Hip Hop track perfect for the clubs. The track has also has an Indian vibe to it. This track features the Ying Yang Twins, which gives the track a dirty ghetto, feel to it. This song is my 3rd Favourite song on the album, and is one of the best Hip Hop songs I have ever heard. 10/10  <br /> <br />Showdown - The famous UK producers Bloodshy & Avant produced this track. It is a great sexy dance track which features Britney whispering \\"I don't wanna be a tease. Would you undo my zipper please\\" This track is done very well. Again very unique. 9.5/10  <br /> <br />Breathe On Me - This song is very club-savvy orientated and is one of the most sensual tracks on the album. The song has a HOT beat and is reminiscent to Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head. This track describes the intensity of a relationship so hot that they don't even need to touch, just breathe. This is my Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. I can automatically see this song go #1 if it is released. 10/10  <br /> <br />Early Mornin - The second this track commences you will automatically know that it is Moby produced. This track is very sexy and has a trance feel to it. The song is very vibey and is about the next morning after a big night out. 7/10  <br /> <br />Toxic - This song is produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The song is HOT and fits Britney perfectly. The track is a hard hitting dance track which could easily be used as the theme song to Alias or the next bond movie. Critics are describing it the best song Britney has released since I'm A Slave For You. I love this track so much because of its uniqueness. 10/10  <br /> <br />Outrageous - This is a typical R&B penned track. The second the song commences you will automatically realize it is R Kelly produced. This song is again perfect for the clubs and has an Indian vibe to it. The chorus is very catchy. 9.5/10  <br /> <br />Touch Of My Hard -This is the most sensual song on the album. This song is a beautiful dance ballad reminiscent to Madonna's The Power Of Goodbye. This song is an ode to self-love. Although this song is not dirty at all, it is Britney's most mature song to date and has a sexy vibe to it. This is definitely a stand out track on the album. 10/10.  <br /> <br />The Hook-Up - Redzone, the famous team behind the Britney/Madonna duet, produced this track. This song has an R&B reggae feel to it and is fairly uptempo. This track takes some getting used to but when your hooked your definelty hooked. 9/10  <br /> <br />Shadow - This track is a beautiful ballad produced by The Matrix. This is very reminiscent to Avril's I'm With You. This track shows Britney's vocals at its best. 9/10  <br /> <br />Brave New Girl - reminds me of her earlier stuff, Lucky in particular 10/10  <br /> <br />Every Time - This track is absolutely stunning. Britney shines in this tale of heartbreak. This is definitely one of the most beautiful ballads ever written by not only Britney herself but of all time. Thesimple harmony makes you feel the words and the pain Britney has felt. This is a Guy Sigsworth produced ballad. 10/10  <br /> <br />Me Against The Music (Remix) - This is remix to the First Single. The song was remixed by Peter Rishi and an Indian vibe has been added to it. The song is still very clubby and is probably one of the best remixes I have ever heard. 10/10  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Take me away-good song, good beat,though too similar to evanescence's \\"bring me to life\\".  <br /> <br />together-i was a little iffy about it. lyrics are ok but the singing isn't as good as i thought it would be. it's ok but it's the worst song on the cd.  <br /> <br />don't tell me- this is one of my favorite songs on this cd. it's catchy, very well written, and has good singing.  <br /> <br />he wasn't- i like this one a lot too. the lyrics in the chorus are good but it's not very creative as far as the beat.  <br /> <br />how does it feel- too sentimental for avril's style. i guess it's ok   <br /> <br />my happy ending- I LOVE THIS SONG!!! it has to be the best song on this cd. it's awesome!  <br /> <br />nobody's home- good song. not much to say though.  <br /> <br />forgotten- again it gives off an aura similar to evanescence.  <br /> <br />who knows-great song with great lyrics.  <br /> <br />fall to pieces-good song. more like avril.  <br /> <br />freak out-it's ok i guess. good lyrics.  <br /> <br />slipped away- it's a good song. it's not about a lost friend like most people would think, though. it's about her grandpa. depressing.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|I read \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" just before seeing the movie, and to my surprise, I didn't hate the movie.  Sure, a few things were changed or deleted, but you have to expect that with a movie based on a book.  I know that the first 2 movies were hardly changed at all, but this film was different:  darker tone and a new director.  It was going to be changed based on those factors alone.  Also, if every single detail from the book were put into the movie, the movie would have been drawn out too much (not so much in length, but in story), and for those who haven't read the books faithfully, they would have gotten bored  with so many explanations. <br /> <br />I'm giving this 4 stars because it's a really awesome movie with great cinematography...but I was (and still) weary about one factor:  the new Dumbledore.  Not that he doesn't look great or go by the book, but to put such a different take on an established character is just not a great idea.  I mean, I can look past it, but most audiences can't.  Hopefully Gamble will grow on audiences with Goblet of Fire comes out next November (2005).
B0001CCXY8|5.0|If anyone can do this music, how about YOU trying PLAYING IT YOURSELF???? Then he calls RATM \\"Real metal\\" (WTF!!!). Listen here, RATM is good and all, but they ain't real metal. They RAP-metal. No metal that's metal has ANY rap in it AT ALL!!!! Of the bands you listed, only Sepultura is better than CC, but that's another story. To that one other guy, if CC's drummer sucks so much, how YOU play their songs yourself?<br /><br />Now about the album, it's a good CD. It's my fav CC album.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|To call this film a \\"death of west\\" film would not do this film justice nor would the moniker \\"spaghetti western\\".  This is an American western with a European sensibility but it does not diminish it's importance as a true western.  This film distinguishes itself from Leone's other westerns and is somewhat of a homage to the work of John Ford, but anyone familiar with Ford knows that he was always reimagining the genre.  The story in a nutshell involves an Irishman and his family killed by Frank (Henry Fonda), a hired gun of a railroad baron who desires a piece of land the Irishman owns.  This sets off a chain of events where diverse persons emerge on the scene after the massacre.  They include Jill(Claudia Cardinale), a prostitute the Irishman marries in New Orleans whose occupation was probably unbeknownst to him;Harmonica(Charles Bronson), a gunfighter who has a grudge against Frank; and Cheyenne(Jason Robards), a half-breed outlaw who is framed for the murders. The cast is uniformly excellent with Fonda standing out as the ruthless Frank, with his stand-out scene being his cold-blooded murder of the Irishman's young son.  Leone paces this film leisurely but it is never boring, just very deliberate in taking the time to tell a good story.  Enough cannot be said about Ennio Morricone's musical score.  Every major character has a theme and it feels operatic.  This DVD also has an excellent commentary by a British biographer of Leone's whose name escapes me.  To truly appreciate how good the commentary is here, compare it to the lame commentary that Richard Schickel did for \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\".
B0002MPU1K|2.0|I loved his first CD. This one exposes all the weaknesses -- a mediocre voice and lack of depth, included -- while giving short shrift to his many strengths. The standout is \\"raise the roof.\\" It swings and has an original modern jazzy appeal. But too many songs here are pop shlock that could have been taken straight out of a Disney soundtrack. Pete, make a U-turn fast and don't try to become a Michael Bolton! You have the potential to be a great jazz vocalist.
B000022TSY|5.0|I can recall the first time I saw this film.  Since I was only 6 years old in 1969 I didn't see it on it's original theatrical release.  I saw it on commercial television circa 1980 in the days before video stores and cable TV.  The movie was slotted in a two hour block and they started the film at the \\"Born to be Wild\\" opening credits segment.  When I saw it on video a few years later I was shocked that Fonda and Hopper made a drug deal prior to their trek to Mardi Gras.  There were other excisions, usually relating to drug use.  Why is this an important film?  Our heroes(?) aren't exactly noble individuals.  There is no real discernible plot.  The direction is haphazard at best(legend has it that director Dennis Hopper was probably stoned to the gills while making this film).  Well, this holds up as a picture of America at a time when social mores were changing.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Most impotantly, this film heralded the entrance of a new force in films, Jack Nicholson.  When Jack comes into the picture as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer the screen just lights up and maintains this aura in every scene he's in.  The scene where he smokes pot and explains the Venutian plot is classic.  The energy of this film deflates once he departs from the film.  I wonder though what relevance this picture has to a more youthful audience whose reference point to Jack is \\"The Joker\\".  To a younger audience Vietnam and the civil rights movement are things that may or may not have been taught in civics class.  I recommend watching this DVD (If you've seen it before) with Hopper's commentary on because it's a good one.  And the documentary on the disc isn't bad either.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I was torn at the begining because I heard 75% Billie Holliday and 25% Peggy Lee. But it quickly became clear that rather than being an imitation, Peyroux was simply naturally blessed with a voice, style and grace that combine aspects of these two great singers. Peyroux adds a tasteful selection of material that is not easily categorized and avoids -- and hopefully will continue to avoid-- the tempatation to succumb to girlie pop and soundtrack shlock. Her interpretations of Leonard Cohen and Dylan materials are stunning. Her own compositions are great. Let's not wait another 8 years for the next one. We could be looking at a great and long lasting mega career here. Bravo!
0790729644|5.0|In the twilight of Clint Eastwood's career an epiphany came to him.  The western types that he played in most of his films were essentially bad people.  This film is something of an atonement for those films.  His character, William Munney, after a life as a killer, is amidst his new life following the death of his sainted wife as an unsuccessful farmer.  Word comes to him that in a nearby town that a prostitute was mutilated by a some cowhands and a reward is being offered by her co-workers for the murder of the cowpokes.  Munney rationalizes taking up this offer by thinking that these boys are vicious and deserve to die and that doing so would not make him a bad man.  Before Munney can collect his reward, though, he has to get through the peace-loving sheriff, Little Bill, who will make sure nobody collects on the reward no matter how many beatings he has to administer.  The cynic could say that Eastwood made his bread and butter off violent western types and this is an attempt to cater to politically correct types.  I give Eastwood the benefit of the doubt here because this may be the best performance of his career and this film is so well crafted.  Gene Hackman is more than his equal as the sadistic sheriff.  The beauty of the western is that it is always being re-evaluated and this film stands at the top of the list of great westerns.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I was at Tower Records tonight, and I noticed something.. they seem to sell out of specific albums depending on the rating they receive from the hipster-megasite: Pitchfork Media.    My only legitimate argument with Pitchfork lies within their rating scales. The Fiery Furnaces are a load. Yet they receive a 9.6. Why? Because they're \\"indie,\\" and it's \\"art,\\" they're \\"redefining independent music,\\" and they have to be sure not to offend the aging hipsters who read their site.    Yet, sometimes, I calm my aching, obsessive-compulsive soul with thoughts that that whole incident was just a joke. To really see if people would take someone elses' word over their own ears.    With that being said. How come only a 9.7? My own rating far exceeds that of a ten point scale. And it is only .1 away from the abomonation of music that is \\"Blueberry Boat.\\"    I was giving a friend a ride home, and she pointed out the tremolo in Butler's voice. Which to me, emphasizes the album's theme, the tone. It's alarmingly somber in mood, yet throughout the deaths that provoked the writing of \\"Funeral,\\" the overall sound is uplifting and hopeful. That is no easy task.    \\"Funeral\\" is the combonation of the ocean and fire. Don't believe the hype; make your own judgements. You'll appreciate the music universally if you do.    Before you immediately consider this review \\"not helpful\\" to your ego and your liking of the Fiery Furnaces, consider that this isn't about them, at all. And that my dislike of the Fiery Furnaces is my own opinion, and not yours.
1592400876|5.0|Oh what a wonderful read.  This short work by Lynne Truss is a pedant's delight as it takes a knife to all those who mangle the English language with sloppy, lazy or just plain stupid use or misuse of punctuation.  In an era of the internet, mobile phones and emoticons, it is a pleasure to read the work of someone who cares about the written word.<br /><br />One of the great beauties of English is its marvelous flexibility.  There is no equivalent to the Academie Francaise with its pernickety rules that only serve to hinder the development of French as a modern language.  However, having said that, English is being done no favours by those who think that rules are irrelevant.  English is a precise language and if people fail to abide by basic structural features (that is, punctuation) then we are all the worse for it.<br /><br />As one who works in an office, it never ceases to amaze and anger me that so many seemingly intelligent people have such a poor grasp of the written sentence.  Only yesterday, I was asked to \\"please enshore that this job is done\\".  I'm not kidding!  The writer of this email has ensured that, in the future, he can only be regarded as a fool!<br /><br />So, for all pedants of the language, buy and read this book.  You will not be disappointed.
B000274THQ|4.0|Just as Rip Van Winkle slept through the American Revolution and woke up twenty years later to find himself a citizen of a brand new country, so Kathrin Sass, an East German woman, slips into a coma on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall only to wake up eight months later a member of a capitalist society.  This is the premise of \\"Good Bye Lenin,\\" a clever and affectionate tale about truth, love and family ties that transcends all national borders and boundaries.<br /><br />Kathrin, a woman who has dedicated her life to the perpetuation of Communist Party ideology, suffers a major heart attack that plunges her into a comatose state a few months prior to the dissolution of the land she knows as East Germany.  While she is \\"asleep,\\" governments tumble, barriers crumble and a whole new tide of Western goods and values comes flooding eastwards to a ravenous, eagerly awaiting public.  Then she wakes up.  Fearing that the shock of finding such a radically changed world will lead to a second heart attack, her loving son, Alex, devises an elaborate scheme to shield her from the truth and to make her believe that the world she lives in now is the same world she knew eight months before (the basic premise is not that different from the one in \\"Jacob the Liar\\").<br /><br />\\"Good Bye Lenin!\\" is an amusing regional comedy that derives its laughs from two basic sources: the near-slapstick nature of the charade Alex is attempting to perpetrate, and the script's satirical view of a society rushing madly to embrace the joys of unbridled consumerism they have been so long denied.  Given its gimmicky premise, \\"Good Bye Lenin!\\" could have emerged as a one-joke comedy were it not for the fine sense of irony and absurdity that writer/director Wolfgang Becker (working with co-writer Bernd Lichtenberg) has brought to the project.  In addition, young Daniel Bruhl as Alex and Katrin Sab as Kathrin deliver expert, moving performances that go to the very essence of the mother/child relationship.<br /><br />I must confess that this film, despite its generally upbeat tone, brings with it a certain rueful sadness that the filmmakers may not exactly have intended.  Could it really have been a mere fifteen years ago that the events depicted in this film actually happened - a mere fifteen years ago that the future of the human race seemed so full of joy, hope and promise?  Now, in a post 9/11 world - where sectarian hatred and international terrorism rule the day - this image of people coming together to cast off the shackles of bondage and embrace freedom seems already like a quaint memory from the long distant past.  In a strange way, the film has become something of a relic in its own time, outstripped by a world that has long since moved on to bigger and more dire concerns.  \\"Good Bye Lenin\\" reminds of just how long ago and far away the Cold War really was.ionship.   <br /> <br />I must confess that this film, despite its generally upbeat tone, brings with it a certain rueful sadness that the filmmakers may not exactly have intended.

Pratchett and Gaiman riff off of each other with unparalleled skill in this send up of the apocalypse. Make that THE Apocalypse. <br /> <br />If you can find the highly talked about end of the world something to laugh about (and clearly Pratchett and Gaiman can), you'll be rolling on the floor from cover to cover. Yes, it's that good! <br /> <br />Readers who have appreciated either writer's other works, or the works of Douglas Addams, will find this book an absolutely necessary edition to the library. This is the book I've had to buy over and over again, because I keep lending it out to folks who abscond with it. I can't say as I blame them too much.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I have not even seen the dvd set yet, but from reading what is included in the set, I can say that they SHOULD have ADDED all the deleted scenes from the trilogy, since they probably had the disc space anyway. The scenes were from Ep IV: The Biggs-Tank- Anchorhead cut scene and the Biggs & Luke scene, from Ep V: The Wampa scene where the Wampas were breaking into the Rebel Echo base and the dead Tauntaun scene where the 2-1B Medical Droid inspects it after Luke, and the sandstorm scene after leaving Jabba's barge on Tatooine in Ep VI. (There may have even been more deleted scenes.) <br /> <br />This was Lucas' chance to add several versions of the movies or at least a deleted track option if you wanted to view them with the movie or not.  <br /> <br />Someone in one of the recent comments/reviews here asked why Lucas added the \\"ghostly vision\\" of YOUNG ANAKIN to the trio at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI (deleting the old Anakin). The answer is that Anakin turned to the dark side when he was a YOUNG man, not an OLD one, so by reuniting him to the Light Side, he became rejuvenated to young again. Just a theory.  <br /> <br />I give the DVD set 4 stars out of 5 because Lucas didn't include deleted scenes. <br /> <br />-Ed Schodde <br />-Pittsburgh, PA  <br /> <br />EddeeBee@netzero.com
0316776963|5.0|My stepbrother gave me a copy of \\"Naked\\" and \\"Holidays On Ice\\" for Christmas one year. I may have stopped laughing long enough to grab a bite to eat or mix a drink. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is even better. <br /> <br />Sedaris, in his own charming, self-deprecating way, tackles living in a foreign country, a childhood speech impediment, and the difficult subject of being gay (without making it the center of his works) delightfully. His wit - dry in places, far from dry in others - and charm shine through in every story. <br /> <br />Really, the best part of these stories is that just about every one of us can relate to most of them. Strange neighbors, childhood traumas, etc. Sedaris proves that every life is interesting and full of memories. I can't wait for more. <br />
B00005MJ13|5.0|This has to be considered one of the best 9ths out there, no question. But the sound will be a problem for some, and so that caveat should be offered. But for those who can get around such things--and I am always amazed at the number of listeners who cannot--true riches like in wait. By the way, one of the reviewers below said that Steven Ritter of the American Record Guide dissed this recording in the Third World \\"Listener's Companion to Classical Music\\". This is not true. Mr. Ritter wrote on Dvorak's choral music in that excellent guide. It was Mr. David Moore who did not like this recording.
B00008EY65|4.0|Let me start off by stating I have never read the Hellboy comics or graphic novels. I'm not much of a follower of comics, though I do think the artform is a very worthy one. I was, however, fortunate enough to see Hellboy in the theater accompanied by several friends who are huge fans of the series. We were all impressed.<br /><br />Perlman gives an excellent performance as the glib, urban Hellboy, who looks freakish on the outside, but maintains a typically disillusioned spirit. Jeffrey Tambor, John Hurt and Doug Jones are all excellent as supporting cast members. Only Selma Blair's performance falls flat, as (in my opinion) she so often does. Blair detracts only slightly from the film.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are somewhat disappointing. Seeming a bit haphazard and slap-dash, the interviews and making of portions are at least worth watching, though I really wish more of the cast members had a chance to speak. The deleted scenes are worthless (not because the scenes are bad, but because there are 3 of them and each one is less than a minute long. Why bother?).<br /><br />For those fans who demand consistency between comic book and film, there will be lots of disappointment. Mignola himself is satisfied (or at least claims to be) and explains that he wanted del Toro to craft his own vision of his work.<br /><br />Neither deep, nor heavy, \\"Hellboy\\" shines as a film worthy of del Toro. Simply put, it's just a lot of fun.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I first found out about the book, Wicked, when a friend of mine was reading it. Then, a few years later, I found out they were turning it into a musical. The only picture I had seen was of Glinda and Elphaba in front of Dorothy's house. My first introduction to the music was when they performed \\"One Short Day\\" at the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. I was swept away by that one song alone. Then, when I was in a production of Our Town, some friends of mine were playing the CD in the green room and singing along to it. They were singing along with \\"What is This Feeling\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\". A lot of my friends had seen it so I figured, it's so popular it may just win best musical. Then, I read all these bad reviews about the CD. Bulls***. When I saw them perform \\"Defying Gravity\\" on the Tonies, I thought, \\"that's it. This musical is gonna win Best Musical.\\" Then, I read the paper the very next day. Wicked lost to Avenue Q. I was shocked that a musical with a song that moved me to tears lost to a musical with gay puppets. Mind you, now I wouldn't mind seeing Avenue Q. Then I got the CD and saw the show.    Well, that's the story of how I fell in love with Wicked but now here's my review. The score is amazing. Stephen Schwartz is officially one of my favorite composers along with Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Lynne Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have two of the most gorgeous voices on Broadway. Idina Menzel deserved her Tony for Best Actress in a musical. I didn't get to see Kristen Chenoweth when I saw the show last August. I saw Jennifer Laura Thompson and if that's not her real voice (re: high and squeaky), she sounds like she's doing a cheap imitation of Kristen Chenoweth, who has the voice of an angel by the way. I knew that from the minute I heard her sing in You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown and The Music Man. I didn't get to see Joel Grey or Norbert Leo Butz but I loved George Hearn in the part of the Wizard. My favoritesongs in the show are \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\", \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"What is this Feeling\\", \\"Dancing Through Life\\" (which is a lot longer on Broadway) \\"Popular\\", \\"I'm Not That Girl\\", \\"One Short Day\\", \\"Defying Gravity (greatest song ever)\\", \\"As Long As You're Mine\\", \\"No Good Deed\\", \\"March of the Witch Hunters\\", and \\"For Good\\". Basically, I love all the songs.     I highly recommend that you go see the show before Idina leaves because that woman IS Elphaba. She totally owned the part. And a word of warning: There is a song called \\"The Wicked Witch of the East\\" which was not included on the CD. You see, the story actually has a bit of mystery going on throughout the show. If you know the whole story, especially the end which has a bunch of surprises, then there's no point in seeing the show if you know what's gonna happen. A great deal happens in the song, \\"The Wicked Witch of the East.\\" It is sung by Nessarose, Elphaba, and Boq and some things happen that play pivotal parts in the story of Wicked as well as The Wizard of Oz. The voices are some of the best you'll hear in a long time. The story is great. You will never look at The Wizard of Oz the same way again. Trust me, it's more than an excuse to show off a bunch of Broadway stars and flashy sets.
0375759174|5.0|I've always appreciated the wit of Jane Austen. Understated and sly, she manages to portray the inner wit and wisdom of early 18th century upper-class English women quite well. The choice is never to marry or not. The choice is always whom to marry and why.    Unlike her other works, Northanger Abbey is a satire on the gothic \\"horror\\" novel so prevalent at the time. Full of suspenseful build-ups and hysterical interruptions, the story revolves around Catherine Morland, as unlikely a heroine as ever graced the pages. Amid the story, Ms. Austen interrupts with witty attacks on Mrs. Radcliffe and other gothic novelists.    As always, Austen's humor is stylish and full of truths. She was perhaps a much happier forerunner to Dorothy Parker, in that she cut right through the sheen and told it like it was, as she knew it.    I'd recommend Northanger Abbey to anyone who enjoys Austen's writings, gothic novels, or sly humor.
B00005JN7O|4.0|to me this story seemed like the kind of comic book the would have been written in the 50s.  except for the fact that i think this movie really empowers its female characters more than would have been normal in the 50s.  you have the character polly perkins as a perky newspaper writer who never backs down from a challenge or from anything that keeps her from her story.  she has a history with the male hero of the story, joseph sullivan.  this is the world class flying ace that will set out to save the world.  he is a great hero and like all great heroes he saves the day.  then there is the character of frankie of the british forces, coolly played by angelina jolie (she looks great in an eye patch and with a british accent).  all the characters are sterotypes, but they are stereotypes that people get behind and believe in.  also i think this movie is heavily influenced by war of the worlds except this on is updated.  instead of aliens to fight there are giant robots that terrorize the city.  there are even parts where it sounds like the war of the worlds.  the movie is very grainy almost as if it were shot in the 50s and it was like a classic film noir kind of picture.  all of the actors emote well in front of a blue screen and they are only half of the wonder of this movie.  the graphics of the movie really are quite amazing and often times really seem life like.  the movie contains great action sequences in the sky and under water.  some of the chases really do keep you on the edge of your seat.  then there is also the love story between joe and polly.  and the love story really provides all of the humor found within the movie.  there are some very funny parts within the movie especially when frankie asks joe about polly and she is refferred to as \\"that\\".  go see the movie it is visually great with great action and a great story.
B00005MP58|5.0|Hands down, this is the best adaptation of a novel I've ever seen. Oh, there are great movies made of books, but this is a true screen adaptation that follows the novel quite closely. <br /> <br />Adapting a Jane Austen novel can't be easy. So much of the interaction between characters isn't in dialogue, but in description, yet the writers, cast and crew of this A&E production did an outstanding job. Simon Langton directed beautifully, and there aren't enough words to describe the praise I would like to offer Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle and the rest of the cast. <br /> <br />Two cast members who never get as much praise as they deserve for this work as David Bamber and Alison Steadman. Bamber's portrayal of Mr. Collins, the obsequious cousin, is beyond compare and Steadman's vision of Mrs. Bennett couldn't be more spot on. <br /> <br />At first, I was content to borrow this from a friend on VHS, but after a single viewing, I had to own the DVD. Probably the best value I've ever had for my entertainment dollar as I watch this mini-series repeatedly. <br /> <br />The sets and locations are astounding...well, I could go on and on. Please do read the novel, if you haven't already. I definitely won't say that the mini-series surpasses the novel, because I don't think that it does, but it certainly does it justice. <br /> <br />The film verion of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was very well done. \\"Emma\\" was nice, but this adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would make Jane Austen proud. Please do watch it if you get the chance.
B00005JMAH|1.0|Chris Columbus should have directed this, and I will not see another HP film in the theater that is directed by anyone else.  <br />So many things are wrong with this film that it would take nearly an hour to list them all.    <br />Awful, just awful. Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson could not save it either. <br />What was Curon thinking!? <br />I will not own this film either.  I was so let down.  <br />
0345404475|5.0|As everyone is no doubt aware, this novel is the story behind \\"Blade Runner\\", arguably the best science fiction movie ever made, and one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. I've heard several friends report this as the once instance where a film has surpassed the original book, but I can't agree, as much as I like the film. <br /> <br />Dick is of the old school. His writing is straightforward, and his emphasis is on the storytelling, rather than on the setting. Even so, some of the elements that pop up in \\"Androids\\" are sufficiently unique and ahead of their time. <br /> <br />The central question of the book is: Where does artificial intelligence end and humanity begin? Dick doesn't answer the question, but he definitely explores it in depth through the experiences of his characters and their startling interactions. <br /> <br />\\"Androids\\" remains one of the classic SF novels of all times. There is a reason that so many successful films have been made from Dick's novels and short stories. He was a visionary writer who transcended his genre. Here is Philip K. Dick at his finest.
B00005JKGO|5.0|I love director Federico Fellini, and La Dolce Vita was the last great film of his I anxiously awaited to be released on DVD, and Koch Lorber does this film a great justice. The film is one of Fellini's greatest and most entertaining. It concerns the life of a journalist as he examines the self indulgent upper class and how he eventually becomes part of it. As far as picture and sound quality is concerned, what the Criterion Collection did for restoration on Fellini's masterpiece 8 1/2, Koch Lorber does for La dolce Vita. It looks absolutely stunning and virtually flawless. If you have only seen the full screen version on TV or video, you will be delighted to see this film in it's original widescreen format, which is amazing to behold. Also included is a wealth of special features that are bound to please fans of the film. Highly recommended for fans of Fellini and/or of European cinema.
0345350499|3.0|\\"Mists\\" is one of the few MZB books I've been able to make it through, and I enjoyed the read. Exploring the Arthurian legend (for legend it definitely was) from the perspective of the women involved, Bradley weaves a marvelous tapestry of magic, intrigue and religious persecution. <br /> <br />Up to a point.  <br /> <br />As always, I find Bradley's treatment of the male character condescending and ham handed. Many of her male characters are trite, throw-away and without any depth whatsoever. Nevertheless, the story is beautifully done, and the perspective on the legend of Arthur is unique. <br /> <br />One can safely ignore the sequels to this work... I found them horrid, almost beyond recognition as originating from the same writer. \\"Mists\\", however, is delightful and interesting, if thin in places. In all fairness, I can't give this work any more than 3 stars, though perhaps it deserves more for imagination.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|\\"Year of the Cat\\" has nine songs, and I think seven of them rate five stars, and the other two a mere four stars. I won't tell you which ones, because every listener will have a different preference. This is a stronger disc overall than \\"Time Passages\\" although the title song on that one is even better than \\"Year of the Cat\\". Al has many great songs scattered through his other releases, especially the historical sagas, so in his case, I do recommend \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Song on the Radio\\" as the starter kits, with \\"Year of the Cat\\" a third choice as one's introduction to Al. If you like your initial dose of Mr. Stewart, then you are ready for songs such as \\"Road to Moscow\\" and \\"Nostradmus\\" and \\"Ryiad.\\" Look them up and give them a chance. Al was filling a need in the '70's and '80's, combining a folk feel, with rock underpinnings, but writing lengthy sagas about obscure historical moments which had intellectual appeal. It's probably a love him or hate him kind of encounter, but a friend introduced me to his work around 1985 and it was love at first listen.
B00006IRJU|4.0|The 1987 album from Icehouse was the record that broke them in the US, despite a large body of work that was well known Internationally. Iva Davies is a very good vocalist in the Bryan Ferry vein (there are moments when \\"Man Of Colors\\" starts sounding like Roxy Music, especially the title track). While the songs here tend to be very good (and \\"Electric Blue\\" became a substantial hit), the synth heavy production sounds very much of the period. However, that won't keep you from being drawn in by the tale of \\"The Heartbreak Kid\\" and the pop confections of \\"Crazy.\\" John Oates even gave his seal of approval by adding background vocals to \\"Electric Blue,\\" and you can hear Davies stretching for Daryl Hall/Paul Young moments of soul here as well. If that was the kind of 80's music that got your ears (Roxy, Fixx, H&O), then \\"Man Of Colors\\" is where you'll find love in the Icehouse.
B0001XAS2G|4.0|since the hits from this one, \\"Time Passages\\" and \\"Song on the Radio\\" are available on other CD's, along with companion tunes which are a bit stronger than the other seven tracks here. I must say, however, I like \\"Valentina Way\\" a lot. Al is mostly mellow, and often cerebral, sometimes obscure in his history sagas, but he enunciates beautifully, and the guitar-dominant accompaniment is always good on his albums. He did unique stuff, and his best compositions are truly remarkable and hold up well to repeated listening. If you are new to him, look for his \\"Greatest Hits\\" or the \\"Song on the Radio\\" compilation, then dig in to the originals from the '70's and '80's one-by-one.
0930289234|5.0|This series is regarded as being seminal and groundbreaking in the Comics media. Its fame is not without a reason. Its marvelously writing by Alan Moore (probably the greatest writer in the business) and impeccable artwork by Dave Gibbons come together in a masterpiece that turned the world of comic books upside down, literally.<br /><br />The very concept of a masked vigilante chasing robbers on the steets is explored to the gut. Why does an individual choose to put on a 'halloween costume' and fight crime? To see Justice fulfilled? No. Moore teaches us that Justice's got nothing to do with this. It deals more intimately with psychosis, childhood traumas and abuse, personality disorders, sexual perversion and other not so merry instances of human existance.<br /><br />Aside from the profound psychological debate surrounding the characters, the plot offers a terrible and shivering conundrum which keeps the reader stuck to the book, at times willing to skip meals and sleep hours in order to get through the whole thing (that was personally my case).<br /><br />Absolutely astounding and worth every penny.
B000000H57|5.0|im not usualy a type o negative type fan but i heard about this album where these guys were called the beatles meet black sabbath and had to check it out.its really more pink floyd goes to ireland but its awesome nonetheless.its a one of a kind.every song is good on the entire album!the 3 i liked best were be my druidess.its a very unique love song with celtic highlights.no im dont mean gay (...) dancers with tap shoes i mean druids.theres another funny style love song about gay (...) chicks called my girlfriends girlfriend.its very funny.then theres one which sets the new record held for like 20 years by pink floyd.pink floyd had a song called\\"several species of small furry animals gathered together in a cave and grooving with a pict\\".it has long been known as the longest song title since 1973 or thereabouts.the song by type o negative is called.............take a huge breath!.........................the glorious revolution of the peoples technocratic republic of vinnland by the combined forces of the united territories  of europa\\",thereby setting the new record.all 15 songs are increwdible!the art inside is breathtaking!its a classic!
B000001YOW|4.0|It's been noted that Porcupine Tree continues the tradition that Pink Floyd, Hawkwind and Ozric Tentacles has started in making progressive space rock. Steve Wilson's vocals are okay, but Porcupine Tree's playing is really what they're all about. I've listened to this disc several times and I find myself liking the instrumentals the most.See what you think. I was impressed with the title track \\"Signify\\", the spaciness of \\"Pagan\\", \\"Waiting Phase Two\\",\\"Idiot Prayer\\" and the jazzy \\"Intermediate Jesus\\". Truly a delightful collection of tunes. A must-hear.<br /><br />Later addition: Do keep in mind that this review is for the 'Signify' 1-disc release that was initially put out on a U.S. label - Ark 21. I got to see Porcupine Tree on tour in support of their 'Fear of A Blank Planet' and soon there after that, I am sorry to say that had lost all interest in the band. Good to see they're still active.

B00003CXCT|1.0|In 1977, I was asking by my girl friend to go and see this movie.  I originally had no interest in it simply because of the title \\"Star Wars!\\"  War to me was never something to enjoy and the previews seem to imply some of this.  So, I simply was not interested but my girlfriend was so I went. <br /> <br />The theater was pack and we had troubles finding a seat for the both of us.  There were a lot of kids there and also adults.  We finally found a place to set and throughout the movie my girl friend kept on throwing her arms around me.  So, when I left the theater I felt I was wrong because I thought I enjoy the movie.  Well, we broke up about a year later after I took her to this movie 10 times. <br /> <br />A few years later they re-release Star Wars again accept this time I saw it alone.  This is when I discover that this was exactly what I thought it was.  A war promoting film!  Sure, I have had the same speech given to me about that it is only a movie but I have seen other movies that seems to get people upset. <br /> <br />This movie is suppose to be a fantasy but yet war began to look like a game instead of the deadly hell it really is.  War is destruction and if there were no real wars going on then I would agree.  Star Wars is just a movie. <br /> <br />I did watch all 3 of the films including the Episode One.  I enjoy it some because there was little killing in it.  It let the robots do the fighting and dying for them.  I am aware that some aliens got killed but not too many.  Episode Two I cannot say anything about it because I haven't seen it.  The preview implied that it went back to the original concept.  Murder and slaughter the bad guys. <br /> <br />I did rent Star Wars IV because I wanted to hear what George Lucas had to say about the movie.  So, I watch the commentary first and then I watch the movie.  The only reason I watch the movie was because it's mention that in 1977 they actually did a 6-speaker sound track for the large theater that had this equipment.  Then they did a stereo version and then the majorities were monaural.  Since I have a 5.1 surround sound system I was curious to what would sound like.  I was amaze by the sound effects and the music but to bad the story of the movie wasn't as good. <br /> <br />I give the whole Star Wars series a one star because I simply hate war films.  War films are dangerous because they make war look like a game. <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|on the album cover there are the 4 beatles crossing the street.with all the paul is dead hoopla,some people thought it was odd that he was walking barefoot on hot pavement and belived he was doctered into the picture later.hes also wearing black which is traditional for dead people.but the real kicker is if you look really really close to the vw on the left side of the street,the liscence plate says \\"28if\\".this led the beatlemaniacs to say that paul would have been \\"28\\" \\"if\\" hed seen the release of the album.i checked.thats accurate.this album begins with \\"here comes the sun,\\"a beatiful song.next is georges only second song,\\"something\\" which is a ballad he wrote for his then wife patti.she left him for eric clapton who wrote layla and wonderful tonight.it went #1.then theres \\"maxwells silver hammer\\" about a killer.\\"octopuses garden\\" is another yellow submarine style song john wrote for children.its very pleasent!then,all at once, the mood changes to a weird song called \\"come together\\".it did go #1 though. and \\"i want you[shes so heavy] is a song you definately do not play for chicks.they dont realize youre calling them groovy but think youre calling them fat.\\"because\\"has the beethoven classic \\"moonlight sonata\\" playing backwards. .the next 8  songs, are unfinished songs turned into a medley.it is a great journey..theres a bunch of short songs next.they were all unfinished as the beatles were fighting too much to complete them.they are all run together like a medley.the 1st one is \\"you never give me your money\\".its a very underated and beautiful song.then theres another song with mixed english and french like on \\"michelle\\".its called \\"sun king\\".it paints a utopian vision.it couldve been a #1 if it was finished,i belive.\\"mean mr mustard\\" was pretty funny.\\"polythene pam\\" was a tosser as far as im concerned but its beatles and they could turn crap into solid gold.\\"she came in through the bathroom window\\" is about cheating i think.i wonder which beatle it was.\\"golden slumbers\\" was an abselute gem!\\"carry that weight\\" is good.\\"the end\\" is a small,short poem that was supposed to be the last line of the last song on the last beatle album.however,they snuck in \\"her majesty\\" afterwards if you wait it out long enough.it takes about the same amount of time to wait as it does to sing ot through. however,the beatles broke up but thier record label put out \\"let it be\\" full of more of thier songs.so,technicly the last ever thing said was john saying,\\"on behalf of the band,id like to say,i hope we passed the audition\\".
B00005JNEI|5.0|You can argue that some things were edited a certain way to make a point, but there is way more than enough ACTUAL REAL footage of Bush, (and Bush sr.) Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Cheney, etc. saying and doing f'ed up things. I'd say Bush is the real flip-flopper: \\"We have no reason to beleive Saddam has WMDs\\". a year and a half later: \\"We know now that Saddam has and intends to use WMDs...blah blah blah\\". And now over 1000 American soldiers have died, and still no sign of Osama Bin Laden. This movie is amazing, it's real, and Michael Moore is our savior. What's wrong with the truth being your agenda??

B00003CXCT|5.0|The long wait for the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is over, and despite the many improvements to both the audio and video, the revisions are getting the most attention.  Mr. Lucas created these films, and they are his intellectual property.  If he does not feel satisfied with the originals, and wants to alter the films to conform to his concept(s), I have no problem with it.  In point of fact, I find that the films have all benefited from some much needed tinkering.  I realise that there are a host of dedicated fans that want the originals as they were, and I don't slight them for feeling \\"cheated\\". It would have been more considerate of Mr. Lucas to give those fans the option of purchasing those originals, just as he did when the Star Wars Trilogy was remastered and released on VHS.  As for this release, beyond the somewhat cheap packaging, I feel no hesitation in giving it a well deserved five star rating.  If, however, you want the original versions and nothing but, you might want to pass on it.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I absolutely loved the Bourne series books. I couldn't wait to see the movie. I loved the first one and liked the second. I wish the camera work was better. I  wish it was more \\"steady\\". Liked the chase scenes but would have loved them had I been able to actually SEE them. Hated the fact that they killed Marie in the first 15 min of the movie. Looking forward to The Bourne Ultimatum. Hopefully the camera shots will be better.
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a waste of oil and the other resources it took to put this piece of caustic waste. Moore (Dan Rather on ludes) needs help. It seems all he really wants is to cause trouble and be devisive. You can save the world Mikey, but first look in the mirror and see what you need to fix first.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Before I write my glowing review about Whale Rider below, I want to talk about Keisha Castle-Hughes and Niki Caro. As a frequent viewer of all types of movies, there is no doubt that Keisha gave the best performance as an actress in 2003 and was robbed at the 2004 Oscars - simply because she was a child.  Keisha is the most naturally gifted young actress to be seen on the silver screen in years. The camera loves Keisha's screen presence, her beauty and expressive eyes. I was blown away when I read in 2003 that she didn't have previous training as an actress. She gave an astonishing performance. Keisha's cameo as the Queen of Naboo in Star Wars: Episode III should be a treat to behold as well. It is the hope of millions of her worldwide fans that Keisha makes the correct decision to continue to pursue an acting career along with her high school studies. She has had offers, but she's seems to be postponing them at this time. Niki Caro is in that elite group of exciting new female directors along with Sophia Coppola, et al. However, what distinguishes Niki from the rest of he contemporaries is her ability to let her actors develop their characters as they overcome obstacles in the story and as they come to grips with their character's emotions leading to the character's growth. Keisha has stated, \\"She [Niki] didn't just direct me, she gave me options.\\" Check out the Director Commentary section of the SPECIAL FEATURES of the Whale Rider DVD. Niki will be seen next director Charlize Theron [Best Actress Oscar Winner 2004] in \\"Class Action\\" for Warner Brothers. Ironic that Niki's next directing assignment would star Charlize who was given the Oscar over Keisha.  <br /> <br />As for Whale Rider, not only was was it IMO the best movie of 2003, but it is the best all around movie to hit theatres in many years. This tiny, low budget plays like a BIG MOVIE. Yes, it introduces many of us to the Maori culture and the beautiful New Zealand coastline, but the real themes of this movie are about REJECTION, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, BELIEVING IN WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE TRUE (DEEP INSIDE YOURSELF), AND EXERCISING THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL TO OVERCOME TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES TO REACH YOUR GOALS. This isn't just a story about Pai's [Keisha Castle-Hughes] triumph or about girl power. It's a universal story that occurs every day with heroic children and adults around the world. Whale Rider gracefully portrays these attributes of the human spirit in a beautifully scripted, beautifully acted, beautifully directed, beautifully photographed movie. Many terrific reviewers have mentioned the school speech scene as the most memorable. Yes, it is. But, I feel the scene that hits the core of the movie's emotion is when Pai has decided to live with her father Porourangi [Cliff Curtis] and is saying goodbye to her grandfather Koro [Rawiri Paratene] who has love/rejection mixed feelings about her. Pai also says goodbye to grandmother, Nanny Flowers [Vicky Haughton], who has always protected her. Pai's sad, tear-swollen eyes embody a myriad of deep emotions - love, rejection, hurt, disbelief, reluctant resolve [she's agreed to leave], bravery, et al. In acting, the eyes are the \\"windows to a character's soul\\" and Keisha, like all great actors (e.g. Mel Gibson), has actor's eyes. I initially screened Whale Rider in the summer of 2003. I've seen it numerous times on DVD, and each time this magnificent film gets better and better.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I bought this CD alone for Take Me Out. After listening to songs like \\"The Dark of the Matine\\", \\"Auf Asche\\", and \\"This Fire\\", this CD is full of really great (and sometimes underrated) songs. <br /> <br />Why four stars? I don't like \\"Jaqueline\\" that much, \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" gets a little annoying, and the last three tracks aren't that great either. <br /> <br />Anyway, it is a CD worth purchasing.
0735619670|5.0|When the first edition came out, I grabbed it off the shelf and read every page. The second edition is updated and even better. It includes current technologies and approaches and updates the information, not like some \\"updates\\" that just change a couple new words here and there. This is the new bible for code development. Excellent gift idea for anyone that doesn't already have it. I passed the first edition on to someone else and the second edition took its place on my bookshelf.
B00008G9JM|5.0|I owned the 33 1/2 LP when it was first released I believe in 1972 or 73. Not really sure.<br /><br />I wore the LP out then, now I find myself \\"burning\\" copies for friends. You just \\"fall into it\\" it's that good!<br /><br />If you want a little bit of TULL from the beginning to the end, it's all on here! Get the \\"enhanced\\" CD which offers the video \\"The Hare who lost his specticles\\".......way beyond it's time!<br /><br />If you liked TAAB, you'll love \\"A Passion Play\\"!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie mixes thruths lies and suppositions based on political opinions, It is a blatant attack to Bush and his policy.  <br />Well if Kerry will ever win the elections, so will the muslim fundamentalists, and the comunist countris as North Corea.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|From what I've heard, metal is a big taboo in the Middle East.  It goes against their anything-but-secular system of submission... er, government.  But here we have a band that takes their distaste with all of the religious hypocrisy and 'holy wars' in the region and makes a positive album related to it.  The music is not preaching, as the satanic black metal guy said it was (closed mindedness is bad), but is not an attack on faith as most inept metal is.  This is intellectual metal, addressing a very real issue in a constructive manner.  The album features some traditional instruments, which are very good, and has well-composed songs with exquisite musicianship.  The vocals are diverse and strong, and add a lot to the music.  There is a bonus disc with some (maybe all) copies with an exceptional acoustic show they did before the release of this album.  I'd buy it again just for that.  Certainly a worthy addition to any thinking man's (or woman's) metal collection.
B00005JNEI|1.0|When are people going to get that you can edit things to make innuendos and appearances of impropriety's no matter which side of the fence you are on.  I get sick of both political parties saying their s*$t doesn't stink.  Come on now this guy is a hyppocritical admitted socialist. Why do you even bother listening to him.  People on both sides of the fence do not practice what they preach.  And I hope that the sheeple of this country one day will open their eyes and see how messed up this country is.  But everyone keeps living in their little fantasy world instead of educating themselves.  Whether you are left or right, don't waste your time with this garbage.  Both sides have valid arguments about things, so instead of passing out propoganda why don't we do the right thing.  Oh I know why because everyone is so selfish and noone wants to give something up for the common good.
B000000WJK|5.0|It's hard to explain what this album is <br />Maybe I should said it this way , it's not for everyone <br /> <br />If you are looking for catchy tune , you won't find it here <br />This album consist of some alternative sound that some people considered as 'garbage' <br />It never sounds like it's from 1993 , the music was so 'futuristic' <br /> <br />My favourite track from this album is Already There <br />A very dreamy song , which could lead you to 'the other side of music' <br />It's dark and you could 'feel' it  <br />It's like a kind of drug , once you're 'there' <br />you can't go back <br />
B00004Z4SD|2.0|What a great story and lesson about humanity!  Why mess it up and bury it in a cornpone rendering of the midwest.  Using local talent to provide local color was a big mistake - none of the townspeople can act and they come across worse than Floyd and Goober in Mayberry.  I grew up in a small farm town and noone was that lost to reality as these people (really the script writer, this thing must had script problems from day one).  Is portraying a vacant town supposed to say something?  Seems like all the more reason to get out of there, looks like some sort of post-apocalyptic armageddon.  And after all the delicious encounters with the blind happen chances on the road why his interaction with his brother is limited to the word yup?  This is supposed to be the central motivator and it is completely wasted.  And what the hell is Sissy supposed to be?  Her speech impediment character is unbelievable and just detracts from the main story.  She has nothing of value to say that has any bearing on anything.  Hallucinating about the child with the ball looks like it might provide some real meat and then never provides and impetus to the plot.  And where did that guy to to cinematography school?  Film the pavement as a bus slows down?  Come on! <br />I must say though, some of the finest background music ever composed with the few scenes of rural America that work. <br />
B00003CXCT|2.0|Seemed like a rush job, but was still technically well done and restored. Even digital coloring enhanced trying to be like how the LOTR movies were done. At the average price of $40, still a reasonable deal since each movie on DVD would be about $14 each at the cheapest. If the original list price was truly $70, then maybe the distributers may have gotten a deal as well. Considering the controversy that this trilogy isn't the original, that may explain why. As for Lucas vowing not to release the DVD's until EpIII was done, my personal theory is that the superior LOTR films compared to the talentless prequels have devalued the mystique of SW and Lucas knows the original DVDs highest marketable value date has changed to before EpIII's release instead of after where EpIII if as inept as the other prequels could ruin purist fandom and marketabilty even further. The big question about the infamous changes since the special questions; again my personal theory is that Lucas is trying to dilute Marcia Lucas' oscar-winning edited version along with his obsession in proving his independence from the \\"corporate studios\\" even to the point of justifying the originals had to be \\"improved\\" since Fox studios had rushed him through the finishing of SW. However ESB and ROTJ have no shred of improvement justification since Lucasfilm ltd. was totally responsible for the production. If I could say one suggestion from all others, Lucas, I'd say use of CGI is still flawed. Stick to at least a hybrid of CGI and miniature and the model realism; take the LOTR film production as an example. Or even Star Trek: The Motion Picture Director's Edition(2001), where effort was actually made to blend the scenes in without any distraction as possible. Tieing in to the prequels in this latest edition is a flawed reason for using CGI enhancement. The documentaries were excellent however it ignored Tolkien and LOTR's influence on writing Lucas and Kurtz' space-fantasy script.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Clerks is the little film that could. Made with a shoestring budget using black & white 16mm film stock, Clerks is the shining example of how a film with no funding or exposure can achieve success with great writing, an original premise, and word-of-mouth buzz. <br /> <br />Since 1994 Clerks has become a gigantic cult hit, and Miramax did a great thing by releasing this 10 year anniversary set, for it contains tons of extras, more than enough for any Clerks fan to crap his pants in joy. The second disc contains the first cut of Clerks, with extra footage. The extras disc has a whopping hour and a half documentary taking the viewer from Kevin Smith's childhood all the way through the making of Clerks and it's purchase by Miramax. There is an animated version of \\"the lost scene\\" at the Wake. There is also a Q&A with Kevin Smith and cast, Kevin Smith's journals, and even his student film from his days at the Vancouver Film School.  <br /> <br />The picture quality for the first cut is grainy, but the quality of the theatrical cut is superb, and will probably be the best Clerks will ever look since it was originally shot on 16mm. <br /> <br />Anyone who is a fan of Clerks should definitely pick this up, it gives you a new perspective on the film and lets you in on the behind the scenes details on the making of the movie. If you are new to Clerks, you should also pick this up, for it is only slightly more expensive than the regular DVD but has superior quality and tons of extras.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Many people don't want you to see this movie, which should tell you that you must see it. <br /> <br />Michael Moore raises all the right questions about the trumped-up reasons for the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. After seeing it, you'll find it very difficult to vote for Bush.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album is blah. They are posers trying to be Avril Lavigne, but they have failed because Avril has been around longer than them and is much better~ They also try to be JoJo, but JoJo has been around longer...and has more talent....so why is Green Day trying to copy people?! Posers! They have to use technology to enhance their voice! I agree! <br /> <br />Don't buy this CD, unless you like wannabes. <br /> <br />I Recommend: <br /> <br />The Cheetah Girls <br />Jo Jo <br />Avril Lavigne <br />Justin Timberlake <br />Hilary Duff <br />Lindsay Lohan <br />John Travolta <br />Frank Sinatra <br />The Little Mermaid Soundtrack <br />The Lion King Soundtrack 2
B0002OERI0|5.0|First off, this is easily Green Day's finest CD. It is their \\"rock-opera\\" and in listening to it, this can be heard. The CD tells the story of a disillusioned youth who grows up alienated and confused; all of which is caused by the world around him. <br /> <br />If you listen to it in isolation, you can almost envision scenes between each song that would lead into the next song. Though I hate musicals, if this were one, I'd see it.  <br /> <br />All of the songs are incredible and flow into one another very well. Even the title track is important to the story. Just imagine it as the opening scene of the story that is \\"American Idiot\\". <br /> <br />Note: This album is not entirely about Bush and the government. Much of it talks about how society creates it's own problems and fails to take responsibility for the effects of those problems.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|To the reviewers who write about this album...but insist on talking about Jackson's so called strange persona...STOP! Michael Jackson is not strange...but innocent!  <br /> <br />Anyways...this album is a masterpiece! 63x platinum...need I say more?
0064407667|5.0|Of the eleven books out so far this is in the middle as far as best to worst goes.  I have heard some people complaining that these books are depressing.  Maybe you should examine the title or you could read a book about ponies.  This book is very humorous.  That is if you get Lemony Snicket's humor.  It is the best book in the series as far as Count Olaf's plots to steal their fortune.  It is very creative.  If only they could live with Justice Strauss.  Then again did you really think the book would have a good ending?      Thanks for taking the time to read this review.  If you want you can read some of my reviews I written on this series.  Please rate wether this review was helpful or not.   Thanks!
B000003Z12|5.0|This work is towering punch . There is not a track disappointed . Schon made a glorious journey through the different moods of smooth jazz , working with Jonathan Cain .<br /><br />Caribbean blue may be one of the best and sensual tracks , but Boulevard of dreams , Big moon or Zanzibar . No matter what you choose because there is no waste .<br /><br />Excellent buy and relaxing and refreshing moments that will reward you so many times that you will make of this CD one of your favorites . It has such magnetism attraction and meticulous sense of the harmony that personally I consider it one of the best albums in the nineties decade .<br /><br />A winner album .
B00005JMAH|5.0|First, this is a film, not a movie.  What most of the reviews posted seem to miss is that J.K Rowling asked that this film not be another unimaginative literal translation of her books.  She wanted a film that complimented the books and encouraged Alfonso Cuaron to find his own voice in creating it.  And it was a huge success.  This is an amazing film about an extraordinary boy entering into the difficult and often painful period of adolescence.  While the first two movies were tedious translations of words to visual that offered no additional insight into any character or event, this film challenges you.  I had actually given up any desire to see the movies, because I had already read the books.  I don't need to have them read to me again.  In fact, I have told people to either read the books or watch the movies, but there was no need to do both.  But, this film left me stunned, excited and wanting to see it again.  This is what a true director does.  Cuaron has taken the essential plot and created a study of youth that underlines the themes already present in the books.  Who knew these kids could act and not just recite lines?  Every performance in this film is right on the mark.  The visuals are stunning and the darker color tones used throughout lend to the emotional atmosphere.  Overall, this is a film for thinkers.  It is not the typical Hollywood schlock without which the American public cannot seem to exist.  If you have no imagination, don't see this film.  If you want someone to spoon-feed you the story that you just read, don't see it.  If you love these characters and want to see an exciting film based on a great book that adds a whole new layer to the Harry Potter stories, then this is a film for you.
B00000163G|2.0|Before I get you angry by knockin down this cd, let me tell you that I love 2Pac's music overall. His best album, \\"Me Against The World\\" is a hip-hop classic. However, he took his soul and intelligence and traded it in for a gun. This is understandable since label head Suge Knight of Death Row Records got him out, with the obvious idea that he would sell, and what would sell more, \\"California Love\\" or \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\"? The production is handled by many producers, but its Daz Dillinger who really shines, in the haunting electric piano-driven \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\", the deceptively slow \\"Got My Mind Made Up\\" or the overall beautiful sound of \\"Aint Mad At Cha\\". In those 3, Pac keeps himself ahead of most tracks. In \\"Ambitonz\\", although he is not 2Pac of old, he is Ok with the gangsta lyrics although not great. \\"Mad at Cha\\" is another good lyrical performance, even better just not classic. \\"Mind Made Up\\" puts the amazing collabo of Daz, Kurupt, Redman, Method Man & Inspectah Deck. Here 2Pac sounds like he did before, and the guests are amazing. The only good track in CD 2 is \\"Trading War Stories\\", and to a lesser extent \\"All Eyez On Me\\". \\"War Stories\\" unfourtantely features the Outlawz, but fourtunately they're Ok. Overall, a great song. \\"All Eyez On Me\\" has 2Pac with below-average lyrics and Big Syke going on a roll and almost not sucking (notice the \\"almost\\") but the beat is very well done. The rest is pretty much filler. The production is wildly inconsitent and 2Pac seems too thugged out to be able to illuminate minds. The weight of making a double CD was obviously felt, and the result is inconsistency and lots of filler. Get one of his earlier albums instead.
068987474X|3.0|I think Jeff Foxworthy summed it up when he said, \\"all men want to do is drink beer and see nekkid women\\".  Men really aren't that complicated to understand.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go gives off the impression of being written by a fourteen yr old (I'm 14 and I couldn't write a decent song either), Under My Skin is more mature. <br />I still love both, Let Go is great music to listen to whilst \\"doing\\" homework, and it's got some great tunes, allthough the lyrics aren't wonderfull.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I liked this movie and who the hell freak knew why! I hate Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor is a dork. It was the elements of magic and all the esoteric artwork. The whole movie is now one big puzzle. And if its about love than heck thats exactly what ya'll dont know the first thing about!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have to admit Slipknot's first CD was unbelieveable!They were so lively. Then when \\"IOWA\\" came out it just didnt compare to their very first CD. Or so i thought. they had went more indepth and more hardcore with the lyrics and with the instruments. when \\"Vol. 3\\" came out i thought i was listenin to Limp Bizkit or something cause it didnt even sound like Slipknot. then i listened to the whole cd and it was just like a reunion. that's because  <br />Prelude 3.0- 5/5 <br />The Blisters Exist- 6/5 <br />Three Nil- 5/5 <br />Duality- 6/5 <br />Opium of The people- 6/5 <br />Circle- 5/5 <br />Welcome- 6/5 <br />Vermillion- 5/5 <br />Pulse of The Maggots 6/5 <br />Befroe i Forget- 6/5 <br />Vermillion Pt.2- 6/5 <br />The Nameless- 6/5 <br />The Virus of Life- 6/5 <br />Danger- Keep Away- 5/5 <br />this cd is a must have for any true \\"MAGGOT\\". its got something that the other cd never had... \\"Truth and Meaning.\\" <br />
B00028HBKM|3.0|Having watched this movie, I came away wondering about the accuracy of the film as I heard reviewers discussing about it.  A lot of the dialogue and events in the film just didn't come out of the Bible as I remembered, so I went and reread.  And I must say, I think Gibson definitely added a lot of substance to this movie, at the obvious risk of losing to accuracy.  But I think it was probably needed, as the story (as related by Matthew Mark and Luke) doesn't have the amount of detail to make a good movie. <br /> <br />The gore and violence were over the top.  As one reviewer here has already stated, losing that amount of blood during a scourging would leave a person unable to stand, much less carry a heavy cross the way Jesus was shown to do.  Also, running nails through hands and feet would definitely NOT lead to blood draining out, as shown in this film.  As Gibson pounds nails though the hands and cross, blood is seen running out and pouring onto the ground.  This is completely fictional, unless the nails were hollowed out with blood grooves, as anybody who is experienced with this sort of thing knows.  The object piercing the body seals off the skin around it, and typically you have a bloodless wound with this type of piercing. <br /> <br />I think Gibson's vision of Satan (another addition by Gibson to the story) was drawn from modern horror films.  The black-hooded, menacing figure with bugs crawling though his body just seems so Stephen King.  I am reminded of the Bible's own depiction of Satan as \\"masquerading as an angel of light\\" 2Co 10:15, which would make Satan a beautiful creature to see. <br /> <br />As a movie with a vision of the suffering of Christ, this certainly holds its own and is doubtful ever to be replaced.  This movie is shocking and mesmerizing, as was its intent.  But please, no more about \\"accuracy\\" and \\"drawn straight from the scriptures.\\"  If it is, I'd like to see that version of the Bible for myself.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|That was the tightest movie ever. crazy hilarious
B000002OX5|5.0|Wow. At first I did brush it off as goofy '60s silliness, after growing up on their \\"Who's Next\\", seventies-type stylings and so on. Then I listened to it more and more, long past the time when one would normally get sick of even a good album, until I knew it by heart, which took just a hint of the shine of unexpectedness from it. However, replacing that anticipation is the looking forward to one's favorite tracks or snippets thereof, commercial bits, etc. This album has entered the all-time favorites list. The variety is awesome, for so many different moods. They were hitting their peak, both creatively and technically. <br />Some examples of favorite bits: Keith killing them drums on \\"Jaguar\\" (catharsis-orama, get me a drum set now!), John/Pete/Keiths's rhythm on \\"Silas Stingy\\", the absurd pseudo-sincerity of Pete as he emotes, \\"Odorono...could've saved the day, could've helped her to win the part...\\", Roger's voice as he rolls through \\"Melancholia\\" and \\"Tattoo\\" (I think a lotta today's body-art obsessed youth could benefit from that one, eh), all the great psychedelic beauty of \\"Relax\\", \\"Sunrise\\", \\"Rael\\".....Pete's soulfulness in \\"I can't reach you\\", \\"Our love was\\".....on and on. I can't say anything that hasn't been already spoken probably. This is my album of the year perhaps (aside from Planxty and Dervish, due to my Current Celtic Craze). Anyway, Sell Out, where have you been all my life. Love discovering new gems. Sgt. Pepper was never a favorite anyway....not even in the same class as this one.
B0002S947K|5.0|The first word on the first track of his first album is enough to make any casual listener a devotee. With depth that accompanies wisdom, the grit of anxiety and influences of yesteryear's troubadours, Ray LaMontagne's voice lets out a cry and a lament. He sings \\"Trouble / Been doggin' my soul since the day I was born,\\" like the words have been growing in his throat for years, waiting for a moment to be born.  <br /> That first line from Ray LaMontagne's recent release, Trouble, speaks to the quiet power of the album. It hails the emergence of a new artist to watch but will probably avoid the title of `next big thing.' In the way that the snare drum rim shot at the beginning of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" blazed the way for the brilliance of Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, LaMontagne's first word is the wake-up call to everyone looking for the next singer-songwriter whose skill in simplicity is matched by his strength with words. Ray LaMontagne may well be the reason folk music has a future. <br /> LaMontagne's past is the dream of every folk singer trying to pass himself off as the genuine article. He was born into a family of six children from various fathers and traveled around the country throughout his younger years, not because of his mother's whims, but out necessity. He lived in tents and cars, barely making it out of high school because he was always on outsider. It took a song by Stephen Stills to make him into a musician. <br /> LaMontagne credits Still's \\"Treetop Flyer\\" from the 1991 album Stills Alone for his conversion from a factory laborer to a folk singer. Following the revelation of Stills, Ray sought other musicians of his ilk, finding Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, among others. Trouble sounds like those artists have been gathered together and distilled in a finely crafted, simple and beautiful debut collection from a new artist with no place to go but up. <br /> \\"Narrow Escape,\\" four tracks into Trouble, is another indication of LaMontagne'searly accomplishment. With guest vocals by Jennifer Stills and gentle brushes of cymbals in the background, it is the tale of two lovers escaping the law. LaMontagne's takes his time on the harmonica, drawing out the somber sound while Jennifer makes the song into a effective eulogy. <br /> But Trouble is not a collection of depressing pieces and sad stories. On \\"Forever My Friend,\\" LaMontagne's deft use of the acoustic guitar makes a joyful noise that rolls along like a long walk through falling leaves. He knows how to take his time and every second comes through with apparent ease. <br /> Trouble is the sort of album that folk music has been waiting for. It is neither beholden to the genre's roots or given over to mandolins and banjos. It excels when it doesn't have to push its tempo or move away from a man's voice and his fingers.  <br /> The album winds down with \\"All the Wild Horses,\\" a soulful, wonderful song that uses a five-piece string section to give LaMontagne a chance to whisper and wish his way to the end of Trouble. In a voice that's part sagebrush and part sandpaper, he carries the album to a quiet conclusion fitting his first work, which will hopefully be a testament for greatness to come.
B00005B36H|5.0|While Aenima may have their most interesting and impressive work. <br />Overall as a record it was spoilt by untidy interludes and bizarre noises. <br /> <br />Lateralus is their best, and nothing else thrashes quite like it. <br />It goes straight from start to finish without the crap you got with Aenima. It mellows out and then it thrashes and keeps you interested. <br />The last track spoils the whole record - more unessecary talking and static. <br />But this is Tools best.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Bad enough we have to see the 'special edition' versions, but additional changes like putting Hayden Christensen in at the end of Return is just plain wrong. <br /> <br />Purists will also object to seeing the Ian McDiarmid emperor replacement in Empire.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Cleaned up, but more unwanted changes to the movies. <br /> <br />The DVDs look and sound great with cleaned up picture and sound, but altered dialogue and characters? <br /> <br />I HATED, again Mr Lucas, HATED the new younger spirit of Anakin at the end of ROTJ!  It actually made me mad, my wife too!  Ben and Yoda's spirits look like Ben and Yoda when they died and Anakin's should too.  It was right the first time.  We're all going to see Episode III George, you don't need to plug it by changing Anakin.  I didn't really like the new dialogue between Vader and the Emperor in ESB either.  There are other minor changes, Bobba Fetts voice for instance, that I didn't care about either way. <br /> <br />I paid for what I thought was a DVD of the \\"special edition\\" versions that were in theaters and on VHS.  I was unhappy to find the films altered yet again. <br /> <br />The add on disk is good but should have included the deleted scenes available on the CD Rom Star Wars Behind the Magic.  And why hide the blooper reel with the secret 11, 3, 8 code?   <br /> <br />Please George Lucas, we want the ORIGINAL version of IV, V, & VI.  Cleaned up picture and sound is fine, but NONE OF THE ADDED SCENES, just the Star Wars that we all fell in love with.
B00004U28G|1.0|The movie is good, however we cannot watch it because we hate the widescreen format.  Nowhere in the description and product details does it say that it is widescreen.  We looked. <br />What is it with the companies putting out only widescreen.  Give us fullscreen!  At least have both so that customers can choose. <br />The movie is good but the format sucks.  Because of the widescreen, we give it 1 star.  We recommend that you do not purchase this item until it is available in the fullscreen format.
0792156684|2.0|Too bad the overall movie wasn't as good as the special effects. When the ship starts to sink it actually gets interesting (though the storyline of the herione narrowly rescuing the chained up hunk put me in mind of a show like Aliens where every second counts; oh my will they get out?).  Give me a break<br />Up to the sinking though you have to put up with incredibly bad dialogue and a downright boring story
B00005JMH2|4.0|I have just returned from a sneak preview of this film.  I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, as evidently did the rest of the sold-out audience.  This version is simply 'different' than the Japanese original. Not better, not worse.  I laughed, I cried, I was swept away by the dancing, and all the characters were memorably charming. Richard Gere can still send me swooning, and his dance moves aren't bad either!  I recommend this film, but only if you want to have a super good time...
B000055Y0X|5.0|This movie has a ton of reviews and I probably cannot add anything of significance to what has already been written. Just want to add my voice with this simple comment.  If ever a movie deserved 6 out of 5 stars, this is it.  Number one on my all-time favorite list
B000060P79|5.0|This band reminds me of my school days when you just wanna go to your room and listen to some music that gets on you parents last nurve. The songs have a get up and jump feel to them and would me great at any party. If you wanna sing along BUY THIS CD
B0002OERI0|3.0|I dont feel that this album is as amazing as it has been hyped to be.  They have a 9 minute track that seems like a bunch of short songs smashed together, it doesnt really keep you listening to the song. I think Boulevard of Broken Dreams is an amazing song and so is Holiday. The melodies are gorgeous and catchy, great lyrics too.  My only problem is the title track, its got some cool melodies and classic style Green Day chords and changes, but people seem to be misunderstanding its message, to me its about the media, not President Bush.  <br /> <br />If it is about President Bush then I'm sorry I bought this album, he's doing a fine job at saveing the world and createing jobs in America. In 1996 we were in the same economic conditions as we are now and the Democrats called that growth, now that we're in the same situation after comeing out of a recesssion they are complaining and they have a candidate who lies, cheats, and changes his mind. In 1969 he fought in Vietnam, in 1971 he protested it and threw \\"his\\" medals at the capitol, now in 2004 hes wrapping himself back up in the same medals he threw away and thats the only reason he can give for me to vote for him, the man with the worst Senate voteing record in American history.   <br /> <br />If that's what Green Day supports then Billie Joe will find his little masterpiece in my garbage can.
B0002OERI0|5.0|i've heard a lot of people saying stupid things about greenday. let me tell you what i think: <br />1. They are getting BETTER with every record. <br />2. Warning was not popish or \\"manufactured\\" sounding at all, it was totally different from all the mainstream music of the day. It was a brilliant record that showed greenday's varying influences, and also showed that they are capable of playing music differently than all of there previous recordings. It was definitely punk. How much more anti-establishment can you get than Warning?  <br />3. to those of you saying they're not real punk: shut up, because you don't know what you're talking about. Yellowcard? Good Charlotte? all the other neopunk bands? Punk music is a cry against apathetic acceptance of societal norms, all that these neopunks do is whine and cry about how they're treated unfair, and don't say anything about society. Greenday has stayed true to the purpose of punk, though occasionally straying from the typical sounds of punk. <br />4. with this new record out they have done yet another amazing thing for the punk genre: they've brought punk back to the roots of punk music, both in sound and mind. american idiot mirrors the style of all the great founders of punk, while applying the same angst and anger towards the current problems in american society. <br />5. whoever said they're new is freakin stupid. seriously, you're probably 14 or 15, and you weren't around when they were popular before. keep you're mouth shut. <br />6. now which is better, American Idiot, or Warning? i like the sound of warning better, however i think that these two records are equal in quality, yet have slightly different sounds, and i prefer warning. but they're both excelent.

The stones are the Best live rock and roll band ever, everyone knows that.  So what could be better than having THE best rock band ever play JUST FOR YOU in your living room?  Well, that's the way I feel about this disk.  Its got all the hits.  Honky tonk, Cant always get, Brow Sugar, Jumpin, Sympathy. And some that are new or rare and a whole section of Old Blues tunes, even a version of George Thurogood's Bad to the Bone with different lyrics.  The song Around and Around is so cool.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I don't usually go for this kind of music but i was craving something heavy and my system of a down cd's didn't seem to do it. so i got this cd from my friend. to my surprise it's really good. <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0 - 8/10 - It's a good opening song for the cd but the begging is really anoying. <br /> <br />Blister Exists - 10/10 - i love drums so of coarse i love this song. the REALLY LONG drums solos are incredible. <br /> <br />Three nil - 7/10 - this one i'm not so impressed with. simply because of the chorus. it sounds so unorginized. <br /> <br />Duality - 10/10 - The first single and one of the greatest songs I have ever heard. <br /> <br />Opium of the people - 10/10 - this song has screaming throuh most but then comes on with a smooth singing chorus. amazing. <br /> <br />Circle - 8/10 - one of the few slow songs. the telephone in the beging is cool. some of the effects sound like stuff from alien though. <br /> <br />Welcome - 9/10 - not much to say except those guitar parts are sweet. <br /> <br />Vermillion - 10/10 - has a great chorus. its way better than part 2 <br /> <br />Pulse of the maggots - 9/10 - I love the verses but not the chorus. but sweet music tho <br /> <br />Before i forget - 10/10 - what can i say? this song is the greatest. <br /> <br />Vermillion pt. 2 - 9/10 - a nice slow song. <br /> <br />The Nameless - 10/10 - sweet verses and the chorus is slow but still awesome. great screaming bits also. <br /> <br />The virus of life - 10/10 - a slow heavy song. <br /> <br />Danger keep away - 8/10 - a little unorginized but still ok for a slow song. <br /> <br />I gotta say that slipknot wasn't who I thought they'd be but they're so much more.

The guy who has to tame her looks liek Mick Jagger in a monkey mask!!!!  Totally distracting.  Why couldn't they have picked Brenden Frazier, one of my favorite actors?  ANd speaking of Brendon, wouldnt he make a great superman?  That hair and face and Strong CHIN!!  He'd look great when he ripped open his shirt and you see the S and know.  Also he could be a conving=cing Clark KEnt.  Well, hers hopping!!
B00003CWL6|2.0|4 stars for the crisp cinematography, flawless performances, and incomparable artistry. <br /> <br />0 stars for the mindless message. <br /> <br />Poor Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). Society pushes him to the breaking point and then punishes him for breaking. Can't a guy just be left alone to pursue his own depravity (taking drugs, having sex with children) and not have to worry about responsibility? This is all \\"the man's\\" fault. \\"Yuh know whut I'm sayin', mofo?\\"  <br /> <br />Mean old capitalism. <br />
B00005JKGO|5.0|Federico Fellini's \\"La Dolce Vita\\" represents one of the high water marks of the Italian neo-realist film movement. It's full of lustful self pity, deep brooding passions and taut undercurrents of transfixed sexuality. The story follows Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), one of Rome's undesirable paparazzi. (* Aside: this is the film that labeled that gaggle of celebrity crazed photo journalists as such.) Seems Marcello doesn't much care for work unless it reads more like play for hire. After chasing down a helicopter that's carrying a bronzed statue of Jesus to the Vatican - and pausing just long enough to ogle a troupe of scantily clad Roman vixens in bikinis, perched atop a high rise, Marcello meets up with Maddalena (Anouk Aimee) at a swank nightclub. She's stuck in a dead end relationship. He's living with the overly possessive, Emma (Yvonne Furneaux). Fellini's direction taunts the viewer with a series of seemingly disjointed vignettes that are captivating unto themselves; Emma's failed suicide, Marcello's tryst with American sex goddess, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), a brief pub crawl with Marcello's father (Annibale Ninchi), and a thoroughly tasteless party scene in which Marcello (fully dressed), mounts a woman like a horse and shouts disgusted absurdities about the room. The most celebrated episode is undoubtedly Sylvia's erotic dance at an outdoor club and subsequent swim in the famed Trevi Fountain. Fellini delivers a deliberate sheen to this otherwise tawdry little film, giving it a scope and grandeur that elevates the subject matter to high art. Also in the cast is former Tarzan star Lex Barker as Robert, an abusive drunk and has been which - unfortunately - wasn't far off from his real life situation.  <br /> <br />Koch Lober DVD has done an absolutely outstanding job on remastering \\"La Dolce Vita.\\"  The gray scale exhibits a depth of field and superb balancing with deep, solid black levels and brilliantly clean whites. Occasionally there is a slight shimmer in the print but this is excusable and non-obtrusive to one's enjoyment of the film. The anamorphic transfer simply sparkles with a minimum of age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for a remarkably smooth visual presentation. The audio has been remixed for 5.1 surround. Though it's dated and sometimes strident, it sounds much better than anything you've likely heard before. Extras include several short featurettes (most self congratulatory on Fellini). There's also a particularly appalling set of interviews in which stars, Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni seem deliberately photographed in the worst light for maximum ugliness effect. Ekberg particularly looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt and Oprah sans make up and before her diet - stuffed into a dress that looks more like a beach towel. (*Aside: Ekberg still thinks she's 21.)There's also a stills gallery and a restoration comparison that will illuminate for the first time viewer just how much work was done to get this film into its current shape.  <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I recieved my first taste of Wicked on an airplane, and oddly enough, I hated it! However, I didn't give it much of a chance. I listened to it again, and I then realized how wonderful it was. Kristin Chenowith and Idina Menzel really hold up the show with their beautiful voices. Kristin, with her beautiful and heady soprano, is Glinda. Idina Menzel, with her strong belting ability, is Elphaba. Norbert Leo Butz is a bit above average with his Fiyero, and Federer is excellent in the little part that she sings as Nessarose.  <br /> <br />No One Mourns the Wicked: 7/10 It starts off really slow, but it is worth listening to. Glinda shows her phenominal talent as she hits her highest notes in the show. The history of how Elpahaba is born in also interesting  <br />  <br />Dear Old Shiz: 1/10 Hideous, Hideous number. The only bad song in the show: extrememly slow and resembles religious chanting. Worth skipping over... <br /> <br />The Wizard and I: 9/10 The beggining is a bit slow with Madame Morrible's boring intro, but once Idina starts, the song is unforgettable. She shows her extremely powerful voice here, and starts us rooting for her.  <br /> <br />What Is This Feeling?: 8/10 This is a good number, and many people's favorite. One of the second better of the duets w/ Idina and Kristin. Very catchy and funny, and will stick in your head all day. <br /> <br />Something Bad: 4/10 Not horrible, but it doesn't showcase alot of talent. It can be amusing if you have a good sense of humor.  <br /> <br />Dancing Through Life: 10/10 One of my favorites!!! Very very catchy, and keeps your toes tapping the whole time. Butz is his best in this song. I also extremely enjoy Boq and Nessarose.  <br /> <br />Popular: 10/10 Yet another one of my favorites. Kristin is absolutely amazing and keeps you laughing the whole time. A must listen, and shows Kristin's comic brilliance.  <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl: 10/10 The only song that Idina doesn't belt, and she uses it well. She tonesher voice down for a soft and heartbreaking ballad or hopelessness. Guaranteed to make you cry! <br /> <br />One Short Day: 7/10 Not one of my favorites. It includes the whole cast, and they sing well, but the song doesn't do much for me. But you might like it! <br /> <br />A Sentimental Man: 5/10 Boring and Mediocre. Not one of Joel Gray's best. <br /> <br />Defying Gravity: 10/10 Undeniably one of the showcases of the whole show. Idina really lets her voice go, and delivers one of the most powerful performances ever.  <br /> <br />Thank Goodness: 9/10 The best cast song on the albulm. Kristin is obviously the star of this song, especially with the spectacular note she hits at the end (listen for it!!!!!).  <br /> <br />Wonderful: 10/10 Joel Grey & Menzel team up to have a toe-tapping masterpiece. Joel makes us all laugh with his vaudeville/cabaret song. Wonderful... <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl (Reprise): 7/10 It's just a reprise people, except with Kristin. An allright song, but there's nothing really to comment on.  <br /> <br />As Long as You're Mine : 10/10 The one and only love song in the show, and both heartbreaking and romantic. Hautingly beautiful and the two have great chemistry. And I don't think that the orchestration is weak at all! <br /> <br />No Good Deed: 10/10 MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!! The best song of the entire show. Idina finally lets all her talent break out in the belted despairing song. Will definently make you understand Elphaba's reasoning, and also guaranteed to make you cry! <br /> <br />March of the Witch Hunters: 8/10 Amusing, and the Tin Man's little solo is fun. <br /> <br />For Good: 10/10 Hauntingly beautiful, and the strange combination when you match Kristin and Elphaba's voices together. Makes you cry and want to yell at the stereo to tell Elphaba to stay at Glinda's side. Very bittersweet! <br /> <br />Finale: 8/10 Not my favorite ending, but allright.  <br /> <br />This is a must have CD, and you should also read the original novel by Maguire.
B0002JP4L4|2.0|Herbert Ross' \\"Footloose\\" is one of those feel good flicks from the 80s that has dated at about twice the rate of most films from other decades. Its story is based in fact: that of a town ordinance that banned any form of public dancing. When Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) arrives with his family he can barely contain his distemper over the outdated law. He's young, rebellious and full of energy that just needs to be expressed. Together with the rest of the town's high school brethren, Ren resolves to challenge the law and its most ardent supporter, Rev. Shaw Moore - who lost his only son after a night of drunken abandonment and a fatal car accident and thereafter blamed rock music for everything. Moore's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is behind Ren's move to ditch the law. Actually, she's the model of good girl/bad girl, staying out late, smoking and making out with her studly boyfriend. The film also co-stars Chris Penn as Willard, a clutsy cowboy who becomes a high steppin' catch after Red teaches him all the right moves. And somewhere in this little trifle you'll find Sarah Jessica Parker as Rusty, another high school senior in desperate need of a better hairdo and a lot less lipstick. <br /> <br />Before you pull out you're wallet and cut loose you may want to consider that Paramount's new Special Edition of \\"Footloose\\" offers NO improvement over the previously issued DVD. The transfers are identical in their image and sound quality and a complete and thorough disappointment to watch. An incredible amount of film grain plagues many of the opening scenes. There's also more than ample digital grit and aliasing and edge enhancement problems to go around. Age related artifacts crop up everywhere and are distracting. Colors are muted and, at times, extremely muddy and dated. Black levels are never black but a tonal mess of brown and gray. Really, there's nothing to get excited about here. Extras include a three part documentary (it's beyond me why Paramount continues totake one documentary and chop it into three short featurettes that can't be simultaneously played) that includes interviews with the cast and crew and the film's theatrical trailer. Truthfully, though, this is not an outstanding or even ample effort for the folks on the mountain.  <br /> <br />
B00009UW0N|4.0|Halloween is the best slasher flick of all time.  No way Friday 13th can compare with it.  Besides its just about gore, sex, and drugs.  I liked Halloween because it is a simple film.  Unlike the sequals there is no weird plot about samhain and evil spirits.  The Camera view as if you were Michaels is terrific.  Donald Plescence and Jamie Lee Curtis deserve a A in acting.  The others should get a B-.  The good thing is there is no gore in the movie.  What truly maked Halloween scary is THE MASK Michael wears.  Some sound effects may seem a little corny though.  The music is very scary and goes with the movie well.  If you are a true horror fan you need to see this!!!!!!!!
0767827716|4.0|\\"Christine\\" is a high octane horror/thriller about a Plymouth Fury with a mind of her own. Based on Stephen King's best seller, director John Carpenter transforms King's creepy prose into a disturbingly good film. It's amazing how much pure evil personality he gets out of that car. The film stars Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham, a bookish high school nobody who's belittled and controlled at home by an over-possessive mother (Christina Belford) and weak paternal figure (Robert Darnell) and taunted at school by the local bully, Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander). Arnie's one salvation is his friendship with jock, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) and his burgeoning lust for Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul). However, as the film progresses it becomes obvious to all that there's just something a little bit not right about Arnie's devotion to `Christine'. After Arnie buys the run down vehicle and spends every waking moment and dollar to fix her up, Buddy and his gang defile the car during one night of unbridled vandalism. That `Christine' refuses to remain a wreck is the result of her love for Arnie and her all consuming hatred for anyone who gets between them. Watch out - this is one mean automobile. Road and Track has nothing on this babe! John Carpenter's direction is both reserved and slick, teasing the viewer with maniacal pacing that really builds the film's thrills and chills to a magnificent crescendo. In the process he creates a personality for an inanimate object that is absolutely terrifying and believable on the screen.  <br /> <br />Columbia Tristar made \\"Christine\\" previously available on DVD. This new special edition represents the exact same video and audio quality as its predecessor, adding three new and informative featurettes, an audio commentary by Carpenter and a theatrical trailer to the mix. The add on's are worth a repurchase. As for the film itself; the anamorphic transfer is remarkably smooth with bright, vivid colors, nicely rendered fine detail and very rich and solid blacks. There's very little in the way of either edge enhancement or pixelization for a generally smooth visual quality. Occasionally there is a hint of film grain but this is not distracting. The audio is 5.1 and very aggressive for a film of this vintage.   <br /> <br />
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This is by far the best AC/DC live DVD to be released! Period.  <br /> <br />everything is up to par. The sound is great, it does not sound like it was redubbed unless someone thinks that Angus sat in a studio re-recording all of his riffs again, which I very much doubt it. The sound and vocals are AMAZING! Brian Johnson and really shows that he is a great lead singer. Though I would much more prefer Brian over Bon Scott. Brian's voice being more scratchy and louder when he sings. I think that most peoples problem with this dvd is they tried to find things wrong with it, so they payed more attention to mistakes rather then the actual concert, which is just sad. Because they missed a great concert.  <br /> <br />SET LIST: <br />THUNDERSTRUCK <br />SHOOT TO THRILL <br />BACK IN BLACK <br />HELL AIN'T A BAD PLACE TO BE <br />HEATSEEKER <br />FIRE YOUR GUNS <br />JAILBREAK <br />THE JACK <br />DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP <br />MONEYTALKS <br />HELLS BELLS <br />HIGH VOLTAGE <br />WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE <br />YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG <br />T.N.T. <br />HIGHWAY TO HELL <br />FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK (WE SALUTE YOU) <br /> <br />Please, if you really want to find things wrong with this DVD instead of watch it for the concert, do not get this. But if you are a true fan of AC/DC, and want something that you will be sure to watch more then a few times....Get AC/DC Live at Donington. You will be glad that you did! I would also recommend AC/DC STIFF UPPER LIP dvd if you enjoy this one.
B0002O7XWC|3.0|\\"Easy Rider\\" is the 60s counter-culture classic that seems to wreak slightly of formaldehyde today. It stars Peter Fonda (Wyatt) and Dennis Hopper (Bill) as a pair of drugged out loners who trade a formidable amount of cocaine to `Connection' (Phil Specter) for a sizable amount of cash. Unfortunately, the best that either Wyatt or Bill can think of doing with their new found wealth is to mount a pair of truly sweet cycles and roam the countryside - looking for trouble and, ultimately finding more than they bargained for.  Along the way they enter into an on again off again tempestuous relationship with loose canon George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). Together the boys go through a heap of money, a string of hookers and more than a few ounces of psychedelic trippin'. Nothing seems to help cleanse these reprobates of their rebel without a clue - little boys lost - syndrome. Fueled by a soundtrack that features Steppenwolf's classic \\"Born to Be Wild,\\" \\"Easy Rider\\" is anything but, and perhaps, the closest realization of the decade's hippy counterculture ever put on film. That it today seems quaint in its hostility toward authority only serves to reflect just how lost contemporary film culture is.  <br /> <br />Previously, \\"Easy Rider\\" had been made available through Columbia Tristar in a moderately pleasing DVD transfer. If you're thinking of upgrading to this new 35th Anniversary edition for a better print of the film don't bother. This is the exact same transfer and extras previously made available. The only pluses to this edition are an extra CD of the film's soundtrack and a nicely put together pocket book on the making of the film. But the DVD quality remains the same. As for the quality of the transfer - beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image. Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrastand balance. Unfortunately, roughly mid-way through this transfer some strange digital happenings begin to occur, beginning with the flashback sequence in which Wyatt and Bill pick up a pair of hookers. Designed to reflect to an audience that the sequence is going on in the mind of the boys, its exceptionally grainy and slightly out of focus with a bleached out color scheme that is unflattering to say the least. On top of the inherent grain in the print we get an exceptional amount of digital grit which generally makes for a very harsh looking image. Also, the print quality after the flashback - which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done - is increasingly riddled with age related artifacts and grain which degrades the final third of the film's image quality. I really am unable to account for the reason this occurs but it does and is distracting. The audio is 5.1 and, as expected, dated. Dialogue is never natural sounding, obviously manufactured post production studio recordings that are tinny at best. The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.  <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I got this cd the day it came out last week. And I have to say this is the bestttt cd of this year so far. Songs like American Idiot, Jesus Of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, make this cd a classic. Thanks Green Day for this true punk masterpiece.
B0002234LS|4.0|This actually turned out to be a pretty good adaptation of an OK Stephen King tale. One of the better ones I've seen, actually. Johnny Depp plays Morton Rainey, a frustrated writer who is going through a bitter divorce, and has secluded himself in his weekend cabin way out in the boondocks to escape the pain. Both his writing, and his sanity are suffering as a result of this turn of events. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, a mysterious stranger who calls himself John Shooter (played rather well by John Turturro) shows up at his door, pointing an accusing finger, and proclaiming to him \\"You stole my story.\\" Rainey is shocked and flabbergasted and chaos soon ensues.  <br /> <br />Like I said, this dramatization didn't turn out half-bad. I actually *enjoyed* hearing the actors speak Stephen King's dialogue, for a change. Johnny Depp is on the ball, as always. John Turturro perfectly put forth the subdued menace of John Shooter's character, and the other actors were satisfactory. <br /> <br />There were of course the usual script difficulties that had to be worked out. In the book Mort has a pet cat. In the movie it's a dog. I guess it would have been much harder to train a cat to do the things that were required for the story. Also, the ending is different. Usually that sort of thing just pisses me off, but this time I was just struck dumb about it. I guess they picked a better ending, and Depp's character sort of justifies it in his final monologue, but I still haven't been able to decide whether I like it or not. I will say this, though. It wasn't even one tenth as frustrating as the ending I was expecting. As always, I strongly urge anyone who is interested in this flick to read the short story \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden,\\" from the collection \\"Four Past Midnight\\" before watching it. I think the impact and the inside jokes in the final scene will have a greater affect on those who do so, like it did with me.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What can one say about the Thriller album? I mean, it IS the biggest selling album in the world!! Thriller offers something for everyone. There is a little pop(example:Thriller), R&B(the lady in my life), and even rock(Beat It). How can I not mention the classic Billie Jean?! This album is definitely a true masterpiece and proves that good music cannot be replaced, remade, and never go out of style. Basically, I am saying that if you don't already own this album, GO OUT AND BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />ALSO----MICHAEL IS INNOCENT! I LOVE YOU MICHAEL!
B00005JMX6|3.0|After reading the reviews here I decided this one may be worth watching. It was entertaining and held my interest but it's a little overdone in spots and certainly can't stand up to Risky Business which it rips off very blatantly including using a lot of the same lines, many of the same sounds in the music track, and even the same type of voice over at the end wrapping everything up. I liked it as entertainment, certainly not as art.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Okay, all you people who bad-mouth the new DVDs.  Here is what I have to say. <br /> <br />You can't deny the fact that the original versions do not go along with the prequels that are coming out.  No matter how good or bad you may thing the prequels are, there's no denying them.  There's no denying the fact that the original films look old compared to the new ones.  While, yes, I do love the originals the most, I have to say that these are important. <br /> <br />These truly link all of the films together.  These DVDs do not look bad at all.  I loved the fact that so many things that I have always had problems with have been fixed.  Mainly, the fact that the light sabers in Episode IV are now actually blue, green, and red, as opposed to how they looked in the original.  I'm glad that the one scene of the Emperor of Episode V has been re-done.  I loved the fact that Hayden Christensen appeared at the end of Episode VI instead of some goofy-looking old man.  I mean, I will admit that Hayden Christensen is the worst actor in the world, but he's still Anakin. <br /> <br />So, everyone get over yourselves.  Watch, love, and enjoy the DVDs because they are the best.
B00005JNEI|5.0|My mom, a former Solidarnosc activist, compared this movie to 'Voice of America' in Communist Poland. And TRUST ME, if something is as good as 'Voice of America' in Communist Poland, it's good. There is no question. <br />All you people out there, don't believe all that stuff that this movie is propaganda. Every single Bush supporter I come across always says this, 'It's propaganda, it's propaganda!' I KNOW what propaganda is, all right? Poland didn't suffer half a century of it for nothing. <br />One thing that Moore didn't do is get the Polish side of the story. Here are some Polish facts on the so-called War on Terror: <br />*70 percent of the Polish population didn't want to go to war with Iraq. Not twenty percent. Not forty. SEVENTY.  <br />*You need a VISA to go to America from Poland. What's with the freakin' VISA??? Our famous Lech Walesa tried to knock some sense into Bush's head, but he didn't pay attention. I guess he was too busy playing golf. <br />*Even though Poland supposedly pulled out of Iraq, there are STILL 200,000 Polish troops stationed there. I'm not making this up. But hey, who cares about the Poles? What do you know about Poland anyway? The Pope? Polish jokes??? <br /> <br />Okay, I'm getting away from the subject. My point is, Farenheit 9/11 is NOT PROPAGANDA. Those guys who say it's propaganda ARE using propaganda. Trust me, I know. Poland didn't suffer fifty years of it for nothing. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMU2|2.0|This movie is exactly like Chasing Liberty. I didn't believe the critics at first. So I decide to see it for myself. Believe me the critics hit it dead on. I enjoyed better this movie better than Liberty. For one reason only because Amerie Rogers who played Sam Mackenzie best friend. She was funny and hilarious. Save your money and time. Because this movie is already out on DVD is called Chasing Liberty.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I feel that it's the same as Devil's night. But Proof, Kon Artis, Swift McVay, Em, Bizzy,and Kuniva Hold their own. All the songs are tight except the coffee house skit which blows balls. I feel Em's shining on many tracks as far as Git Up, Git my gun, American Psycho II, and My Band. Bizzy has a solo Track? <br />Em and Dre must have been smokin'. But the song is quite humorous though and Bizarre killed the Hi-Tek produced Just like U. Kon Artis gets a lot more serious than the last album. Especially on How come, Leave Dat Boy alone and Loyalty. I feel he needs to lighten up. Proof the hype man ain't no (Bleepin') Hype man when it comes to flows that guy can go. I listen to this album deep to give it the 5 star rating I thought at first the album was straight but after getting in to it and learning words it was tight. COmmercial break however is the best skit next to bugz. Young Zee rips the Kon Artis track and Bugz rips the Em produced track. American psycho 2 pushes the level with the doc's production. Kuniva stepped his flow up completely he ain't No joke he proved it on 40 oz. My Band, I'll Be Damned and 6 In the morning. Swift is the same guy a sick rapper that's in the middle of D-12. He's like Fred and Chopper on Making the band's first cd all over it. The Kanye track on there D12 World is yet the best beat on the album I wonder Why shady ain't rip that and why proof had one verse. Despite the great flow from Bizarre in his skit D12 World is pretty much the same as Devils night as far as ratings.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I loved the old Star Wars trilogy. I had them all on VHS and I wore out the tapes. Of course, like everyone else, I was psyched to finally receive the DVD set. However, I am very disappointed. Yes, the story is still there along with some of the cheesy effects that I fell in love with, but there are more computer animated scenes. With the [new] little things that Lucas stuck in to replace the old ones, it throws the movie out the door.<br /><br />It's just not the same anymore. You want a good series to watch, stick with Star Trek and LOTR.
B00003CXCT|3.0|No doubt about it, I would much prefer the original cuts. The added or altered scenes are noticeable even after not having viewed the VHS editions for about four years. They  aren't quite the same movies to me, even though I estimate less than 10% of the running time has been affected. <br /> <br />Mr. Lucas seems to have forgotten that many fans prefer nostalgia over perfection. Chances are anyone reading this has more than a passing interest in film. Can any of you honestly say there aren't pictures you prefer in black and white over more modern color? Anyone out there appreciate how obsolete language, fashions, or customs take you back to a certain time and place? Anyone notice that Hollywood had to be a bit more clever before the advent of computer-generated special effects? Ever consider how imperfections in the sound and picture quality can make a film such as Frankenstein or Dracula just a little more scary late at night? <br /> <br />Well, I am one of those people and fully sympathize with the purist point of view. Having said all that, I also recognize that for now, this is the only game in town if you want an authorized DVD version of the trilogy. <br /> <br />So, I plopped down my $45 and already viewed all three episodes. I thought the changes affected Episodes IV and V the most. Although they by no means ruin the story, they don't add anything to it either. The sound and picture quality seemed fine to me, so I'll hang on to my purchase. For the number of times I'll probably play them it will be a cheap rental. <br /> <br />And yes, if the originals ever do become available, I'll dump this set on the used market and buy what I really wanted in the first place.        <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|First of all, I guess I won't have any useful ratings for this commentary, but honestly, I don't care... just what I have to say is that I've been expecting this DVD set for a long time, and now that I can finally have it, i'm really not bothered about the changes made in the films. Yes, Lucas may release the old unaltered trilogy in a future, but in the meantime, I'll love this version of the movies, just as I loved the Special Edition back in 97... Over the top sound and video quality... what's not to like ??<br /><br />Now, as a true Star Wars fan, I'm deeply grateful with George Lucas because all of the fun and enjoyment that through Star Wars he has provided me with. I'll be loyal to Star Wars in no-matter-what edition... this movie is a HUGE part of my life.<br /><br />And if you are a Wacko, dissapointed with this release and the prequels as well, you think that Lucas has ruined it all and because that you want to throw all your Star Wars merchandise to the trash and send Lucas to the fifth hell, please write me... I'd be really happy to get all that as a gift. Otherwise, enjoy the movie and please GET A LIFE.<br /><br />Be a true fan... a inconditional one.
B000062X90|5.0|In college, I would have been lost without this album.  It was beaten to death during the 6 years I attended undergraduate and graduate school.  Of course, that was 25 years ago!<br /><br />It echos a somewhat radical time frame and regardless of time passed, it is a great album.  The instrumentals are phenomenal.
0375432302|5.0|It is one of the best books I've ever read. It's nearly as good as the Lord of the Rings. And you learn from it all the time you read it.
B00000IFWE|5.0|Tom is a great artist and this album is a great one that won't disappoint.<br /><br />It is reminiscent of earlier works, laid back, mellow in a lot of ways, yet kick ass in others.  You'll play it all the time.  Great guitar solos.
0452285186|5.0|I was having a rough start to my work day when a co-worker handed me this book.  Definitely turned things around for me.  The cuteness of the bunnies clashing with some very creative suicide plans makes for great humor.  The price is a little steep for such a short book, but it's worth it.
0060575816|5.0|I've only read the first chapter and I'm already hooked. This isn't as dark as most books like this would usually be. It's an interesting mix of Harry Potter and Series Of Unfortunate Events. I would reccomend it to anyone!
B00009QG73|5.0|this dvd is absolutely brilliant! i was lucky enough to see Roxy Music live in concert in august of 2000 at the greek theatre in los angeles, ca. the show was awesome and ferry never sounded better! it was great to see all of them rocking out like it was 1972! if you weren't able to make it to their tour a couple of years ago, (and sadly, i have to say their last) buy this dvd...it'll feel like you're there!
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is the best gladiator film, and one of the best films ever made.  This is Scott's best, Crowes best, Phoenixes best, and Harris steals every scene he is in (even though they are few).  The action is amazing, from the opening grand scale battle to the climatic showdown between Maximus and Comadus (lets not forget the incredible chariots sequence) the action is just the greatest (though of course its not like the matrix, but just as good none the less because its traditional swordplay done phenomenally).  The story is deep, the performances are superb all around, the cinematography is sweeping, the visuals are great, the score is unforgettable, the action is... well i covered that, its powerful and stunning.  This is film making at its best, in everyway.  One of the best films ever made, right there next to Braveheart and LOTR.  I recommend Troy, Braveheart, and The Last Samurai if you like this because they are both just as magnificant, but if you have any taste DONT SEE ROB ROY because its a disgrace to true hero films like this and Braveheart.  The extras are great too, can you believe they were gonna have Maximus fight a rhino, that would have been so freakin awesome, too bad they didnt put it in the movie.
B000002SE0|5.0|If you are looking for the ultimate studio recording of Puccini's Turandot, look no further. Every opera lover and Puccini fan will not want to be without this miracle of an album. Recorded between 1965-1966, the album was digitally remastered to high quality perfection. The cast is a dream come true - Birgit Nilsson as the Empress Turandot, Franco Corelli as Prince Calaf, a young Renata Scotto as Liu and in the minor role of Pong is Piero De Palma. At this time, all the singers in the principal roles were in excellent shape and enjoying immense success as opera gods of their day. Franco Corelli is considered one of the 20th century's finest tenors, right up there with Enrico Caruso, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavoratti. Corelli had an incredibly dynamic tenor voice, which was used for acting with consummate skill in all of his roles. He was usually paired with Renata Tebaldi and together they performed in the greatest of Italian operas. Corelli as Calaf is the definition of the role. He is romantic, intense, passionate, fighting with all his might against the cold and powerful Turandot, finally conquering her with his love. I have always enjoyed Placido Domingo in the role, and he is to be found in a top-notch production at the Metropolitan Opera with set design by Franco Zefferelli, in which Eva Marton sings Turandot. That is visually the best stage production of Turandot. <br /> <br />Birgit Nilsson was above all a Wagnerian soprano. She made all the great Wagner heroines come to life with great realism and technical perfection - Brunhilde and Isolde are her greatest roles. Nevertheless, being an artist, she expanded her repertoire away from Wagner and into the one heavy role of Empress Turandot. She has no problem singing in Italian, and as the Ice Princess she is believably cold, arrogant, powerful, goddess-like. On stage, she was considered the greatest Turandot of her day. Coincidentally, at the time of this recording, she was quite busy undertaking variousprojects, among them Brunhilde in Karl Bohm's album of Der Ring Des Nibelungen. Turandot is a powerful diva role, calling for solid and soaring high notes, a dramatic and forceful inflection and a transformation in the end. When she is kissed by Calaf, she is tamed and suddenly a changed woman in love, with a generous nature and with no bloodlust of which she suffered before. I like to think the role ought to be played as if she is under a spell until the spell is broken at the end through Calaf's kiss. Under her spell, she is consumed with rage and vengeance against all men, especially for foreigners such as the ones who killed her much revered ancestor Empress Lo-u-Ling. Nilsson sings the story in the definitive version of the aria \\"In Questa Reggia\\". Franco Corelli, a sexy pre-Placido Domingo type, is quite noble in the famous aria which has become the signature and ambition for all tenors- \\"Nessun Dorma\\". This is it. The studio recording album that beats all others. I highly recommend it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|People who critisize this movie don't seem to understand how true it really is. So much of it is just video footage of our President, and only parts of that are supposed to seem edited really are. It will literally make you laugh and cry. And worry about the fate of this country. <br /> <br />One couldn't make this scathing a documentary about Clinton or even Richard Nixon if they tried. If you're looking for an even-handed \\"un-biased\\" film, then this is not for you. Micheal Moore's main goal was to brutally assault George W. Bush, and he did. There is not a lie in this film, and unlike The Swiftboat Veterans, Micheal Moore recieves no fundings from the Democrats; he gives money to them! <br /> <br />This isn't just an attack on George Bush, but John Ashcroft, Condaleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and the rest of Bush's administration, plus previous american president's and their actions that led to this, and several corporate liars. <br /> <br />It's a shame the MPAA had to silence this film by giving it an \\"R\\" rating, because this needs to be veiwed by every American with acess to a TV. Watch this fascinating truth about our Great Country's government, and you literally laugh, cry, and vote against George Bush, if you even vote at all. <br /> <br />And one more note to the Republican reveiwers calling this \\"Democrat, liberal, or communist garbage\\": Micheal Moore said that if John Kerry wins the election the cameras will be on him, because as a documentarian, that's Micheal Moore's job. <br /> <br />10 out of 5 stars, baby!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Alright, I've had this cd for about a week and I can't stop listening to it.  All the tracks are unique in their own way.  As you start off with \\"American Idiot\\" you're hit with the Green Day you know and love, fast and non-stop. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", although almost 10 minutes long gives you a fast-paced song with melody changes but seems to all fit.  \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" has got to be my favorite song of the whole album, it's a powerful song that exposes what it's like to be a loner with no one to trust but yourself.  \\"American Idiot\\" is one of the best albums I've heard in awhile and i listen to alot of music.  Take my word for it, \\"BUY THE FRIGGIN ALBUM!!!!!!\\"
B00005JNEI|5.0|Most, if not all of the critics, pundits, and swill spreaders have called Michael Moore a liar and condemned this movie as lies without offering one example.  Then come the ad hominem attacks.  Moore said the right-wingers would come at him with name-calling and personal attacks.  He was right.  In today's political discourse, the louder, more abusive person seems to win the debate.  It's time for facts and footage to win the hearts and minds of the people. <br /> <br />Moore steps back and presents footage to back up his facts.  This movie is different from his others in that Michael is not on the camera much.  The subject of the picture is the victim, be it mothers, soldiers, Iraqis, or American people. How can anyone call Moore a liar when footage shows words coming out of Bush's mouth?  The Bush cabal has snuggled up to the Saudis.  There is footage of them together in this film.  Yet the pundits call it a lie. <br /> <br />Michael Moore has put out this movie for the sole purpose of getting Bush out of office.  After seeing this movie, it is impossible to have a good feeling toward the administration unless you are on the payroll or completely brainwashed.  Many say the movie is lies but they are hiding their fear that seeing it will give them a bad impression of Bush.  I can understand that but I can't sympathize.  Are we Americans or ostriches? <br /> <br />I challenge anyone that wants to condemn this movie as a bunch of lies to go see it and point out a few.
0316666343|4.0|Although I used to spend, what most would consider, a small amount of time watching TV, I had decided to instead spend this time reading.  At first I would go to my parents house or the library and pick up whatever sounded interesting.  Being that I have NO friends who read, or that are interested in talking about a book, I depend on book clubs and YES even Oprah (gasp! I don't think there is anything wrong with a person giving anyone a reason to pick up ANY book, time well spent in most cases).   <br /> <br />I have read about a book a week for the last year or so and I would have to say that this is one of the better books.  I think a lot of the reviewers on this site failed to understand or misinterpreted some of the major events.  Only someone who has lived through a brutal attack can understand what it does to you and only through describing that event in painful detail can one try to convey it (anyonre who has read knows what part I am speaking of). <br />And in perhaps the other most talked about part, when she comes back down to earth, I interpreted it much differently than a lot of you.  I saw that she was a girl, who at 14, was jealous of others for the things they had in life and this continued in death.  She wanted a life too, she wanted a sexual experience that didn't include brutality.  She wanted what a lot of girls her age want.  But most of all she wanted life.  She wanted to be touched and kissed (her grandmother had made such a big deal about it) and she wanted to be normal.  Most people responded by saying, well why not contact her family first.  She had been a presence in her families' life all along and had broken through a couple times, she was capable of planting seeds of ideas in their heads (i.e., about the killer in the first place).  The scene wih her and Ray was something completely different and maybe can even be seen as somewhat selfish.  She wanted something just for her.  Anyway thats my interpretation and I'm sticking to it. <br />Recommended to all with an imagination.  Only wish I knew about it when I was helping a friend experience a loss.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is definitely worth the money and the time to listen to it over and over again.  <br /> <br />It reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd's - The Wall but more contemporary lyrics, and the hammering power cords that green day is known for.  <br /> <br />I am sure the kid's that buy this album won't get a lot of what Billy is writing about here, but I am sure they will enjoy it even if they don't understand who Jesus of Suburbia is.  <br /> <br />I have been a fan of Green Day's since....Hell.... 92 (man I feel old now), and this is the best I have seen them, I am glad too, because I really got the feeling Billy was running out of stuff to write about, but George W. Bush brought out some fire and it shows on this album.  <br /> <br />Long live Green Day, and Vote Kerry! :)
B000002LE6|2.0|To me, Lovesexy is Prince's version of Joni Mitchell's Hejira. That is to say, it's an ambitious but very flawed album that is extremely over-rated by the artist's cult of fans.<br />There are many Prince fans that will tell you that this album (and the tour that accompanied) was the greatest moment of his career. However, a more objective observer probably won't find much to like here. There's one good-but-not-great pop song (alphabet st., a decent but not top-tier Prince single) surrounded by occasionally inspired but mostly listless funk/jazz jams. Some of the tracks are messy but fun (especially the title song, which is appealingly weird and spacey) but some are just bland - Glam Slam, Positivity and Eye No are dull and sound tossed off. I'm not going to bother discussing the lyrics, other than to say that they suggest Prince was on the verge of mental collapse.<br />Apparently this album was pushed into production when Prince decided to abort the Black album project - it certainly sounds like a rush job. However, I also have to add that, while I would definitely rank Lovesexy near the bottom of his output for the decade of the eighties, it is still a Prince album from his golden period, and as such has to be accorded a certain level of respect.
B00AVWIQZS|4.0|Sean Connery justifies the existence of \\"Never Say Never Again\\" (1983) with his admirably detailed performance as the older and wiser James Bond. A loose remake of \\"Thunderball,\\" Connery's farewell appearance is superior to the mostly ludicrous Roger Moore efforts. Thanks to Irvin Kershner's on-target direction, the film has a stylishness long absent from the official 007 series. Another strength lies in the classic villainy of Klaus Maria Brandauer and Barbara Carrera. \\"Never Say Never Again\\" has its flaws - a forgettable score, disappointing climax and Rowan Atkinson's dreadful comic relief. Despite the occasional lapses, it's a refreshing change of pace from the usual 007 formula.
B00000IMTE|5.0|A fantastic, rocky, and still modern sounding effort from Ritchie Blackmore's new band on leaving Deep Purple - actually all of Elf bar the guitarist, rebranded and given a punchy new sound.  Here you'll find the peerless Man on the Silver Mountain, the superb Black Sheep of the Family (benefitting from the superior vocals of Ronnie James Dio), and much more.
B00005ATQD|1.0|\\"A Masterpiece,\\" \\"Stunning!\\" These are the words that were used to describe Kubrick's misfire Eyes Wide Shut back in 1999. I remember seeing this at the theater in Houston, waiting for something to happen. About 2 hours into the film, I turned to my friend and said, \\"Where the hell is this going?\\" Sadly, I never found out. This turgid, long, dull and s-l-o-w-l-y paced piece of crap thinks it's making a statement on monogamy and fidelity. Vanilla Sky did it much better, and was far creepier and more interesting. Why does Nicole Kidman speak like she's running out of batteries? Why does nothing happen for 3 hours? Why is the pacing so goddamn awful? This \\"film\\" only goes to show that Kubrick lost his relevance shortly after The Shining. This is the work of a pretentious, crazy hack--hell, it might as well have been made by George Lucas. There's another director who, sadly, thinks he still \\"has something to say.\\" Tragic.
B00000AFDW|2.0|I'm sure the Kiss sunshine-pumpers will unanimously vote \\"no\\" as to whether this review was helpful or not, but I say \\"whatever, dudes\\". I've been a Kiss fan since '76, so I'm not bashing for the sake of bashing...but this CD is so \\"ehhh\\", it's hardly worth your time, unless you're one of those folks who HAVE to have everything the band puts out. The songs are average, the production is inconsistent, and with the exception of maybe two songs, it's most certainly NOT a reunion album (by now it's been well documented that Ace Frehley & Peter Criss were shut out from most of it...they should be happy, 'cuz at least they don't have to own up to this mess). I can't even get through the damn CD without cringing at how calculated it sounds...you'd think they were making \\"Son of Destroyer\\", but with only a fraction of the effort. For the love of God, spend your money on a remastered version of \\"Alive!\\" instead. As for Psycho Circus, if you HAVE to buy this, go to a used CD store...I know there's ALWAYS a surplus of used copies where I live, so I'm sure it can't be much different elsewhere...
B00005JMXX|4.0|The Day After Tomorrow has some of the most amazing special effects I've ever seen.  The cast does an amazing job with what they have to work with,(Quaid and Gyllenhaal do a wonderful job as well as new comer Emmy Rossum).  It does have some pretty funny moments as well,( Americans crossing into Mexico illegaly.)  The script could be better as well as some parts of the story line.  Altogether though it is a wonderful movie that I would recomend.
B000002KD5|4.0|I am twenty-five years old, and not alive when this album was released.  However, I have found it to be just as powerful to me today as my mother says it was to her nearly 30 years ago.  Although I have nearly all the songs on this CD in other Fleetwood Mac compilation discs, Crystal is one of the hardest and most beautiful songs one could try and find. It is high above the musical programme of anything recorded today. I have searched for Crystal for awhile since losing my original recording of this album.  Anyone wishing to purchase this should listen to the sample of Crystal, and they should know instantly that this is one of the greatest albums in rock, well music history in general.
B0002TSZK6|4.0|What a rip-off, Dont buy Fahrenheit 9/11 from Amazon.com/Hollywood Video $50 !!! Wow <br />I found it for $19.99 USD at Circuit City and at Best Buy.

B000002MP2|5.0|I have been listening to these songs since like 6th grade so it's hard to judge them anymore but i know at one point i thought that this had to be one of the best albums ever made but i barely listen to this anymore i hear some songs on the radio but i would rather listen to 39'smooth, kerplunk, insomniac, nimrod, warning, shenanigans or american idiot than this album it was was simply overplayed. I believe this is Green Day's essential album even though it's not their best. It's Like the Clashs' self -titled , sex pistols never mind the bollock,ramones self -titled, descendents' milo goes to college or misfits walk among us. If you are new to Green day get this album or International Superhits! I think everyone i know has owned this album at one point of their lives. I think these reviews are mostly for little kids who like the new copycat bands like simple plan, new found glory and yellowcard.

B00003CXCT|5.0|What on earth is wrong with all those people that keep complaining about the changes that George Lucas has made to his movies?    In 1997 George Lucas and his staff improved the sound and the picture quality and some of the special effect, and they added  two deleted scenes (just a conversation between Jabba and Han-Solo, which links \\"A New Hope\\" to \\"Return of the Jedi\\", and a kissing scene with Leia and Han-Solo). But these changes didn't effect the story the slightest bit! Some of the hard-core fans seem to forget, that most of the changes were VISUAL and TECHNICAL, and what is wrong with that? ... Now it's 2004, and once again George Lucas has made improvements to the trilogy - and this time he has made them for the long awaited DVD release. ... Well, has he changed anything in the story? No. He has made no changes whatsoever! He has given the (faceless!) bounty hunter a new voice and Anakin Skywalker a new face - Hayden Christensen's face - at the end of \\"Return Of The Jedi\\". And the sound and picture quality has once again been digitally remastered.     The above-mentioned hard-core fans have absolutely no reasons for their anger and disappointment. \\"A New Hope\\" hasn't changed, nor has \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" or \\"Return Of The Jedi\\"  - it's still the same trilogy. NOTHING in the story has been changed - absolutely nothing. So how can these fanatics claim, that there's any difference between the so-called \\"original\\" trilogy and this new DVD-release?? It is simply not true.    I sure hope, that the new generation of Star Wars-fans don't listen to the crap of these people. Many hard-core fans take \\"Star Wars\\" much too serious - it's like a religion to them or a holy book, and if you change anything in that book ..... ooohhh!! ... They seem to forget, that it's only entertainment, and their attitude certainly don't reflect the charming humor and irony that you find in \\"Star Wars\\".    If you really love and enjoy \\"Star Wars\\", there's no way that these visual and technical changes (= improvements) can ruin your day. On the contrary: The updated edition will make your day!    Good actors + an exciting story with a romantic touch (Han Solo and Leia) and a lot of humour + wonderful music by John Williams + beautiful pictures. What more could you possibly want?      George Lucas has completed his masterpiece! Well done!!!!
0156027321|5.0|All these reviews make me sad.  Either these reviewers have missed the point of the story...or I have.  Besides the intriging story of how a young boy can stay alive at sea for 227 days with only a tiger as company...the greater story is that of a question.  For those of us that have an unquetionable belief in God, we must ask ourselves a question. Life of Pi makes us ask ourselves questions in such a way that make a true believer, like myself, find this parable of a story a remarkable accomplishment.  For those reviewers that found the ending weak, I can only suggest that you re-read the beginning again where the author states that \\"This is a story that will make you believe in God.\\"  Martel tells readers in this sentence what they need to bring to the story to make the work fully rewarding.  If you do not bring a part of yourself into the story, then you may end up agreeing with those that claim the ending is weak.
B00003CXCT|5.0|For the same reason I knew that hardcore fans would slam the changes made to the original movies upon their re-realease into the theatres, I knew that fans would hate the prequels because they would never live up to the \\"Citizen Kane-like\\" bar they had set, I knew fans would have negative critiques of this latest DVD release.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are changes that Lucas WANTED. Lucas has said over and over again that the changes that he has made have moved the films closer to HIS vision of the Star Wars universe. These movies are HIS life project, not OURS. As fans we should appreciate any revisions he makes to bring the movies closer to what he originally envisioned. If you want garbled, color bleeding, ear straining versions of the films, check Ebay. If you want crips picture and remastered sound check out this version.
B00006AUIG|4.0|ok... I just watched this movie late last night and was totally fascinated by the footage of this whole insane asylum that these guys were working around in... but I'm really not sure about being totally scared. I wanted to be scared, believe me... I love a good horror movie, but I just wasn't. I was waiting for insane \\"Mary\\" (from the session tapes\\" to perhaps step out of the shadows (not dead), or even other mental patients to be looming around either in physical form or spirit, but actually it was just the workmen only that seemed to be losing their own minds and doing weird stuff... I feel that the film needed a little more life to it and perhaps some better dialog/plot as well. Oh, and I would have kicked that young \\"mullethead\\" off my work crew in a second! He was annoying as hell. Good riddance. <br /> <br />one more thing: check out Shaun O'boyle's site \\"Modern Ruins\\" for some extremely creepy photography (he may have already captured this same asylum in his work? Some Awesome Stuff.
B00005V331|5.0|People complain about bad production values for THE best heavy metal in history !!!!!!!.Do like I did:GET ENOUGH SIGNAL PROCESSING !!!!!!!!<br /><br />I applied heavy graphic,parametric,and dinamic eq,apart from harmonic processing and achieved a sound almost as good and brutal as anything recorded in 2004.SPEND SOME MONEY ON AUDIO EQUIPEMENT,coz rock records are the farthest from perfectly recorded as they come,especially those from the 80's.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Is a pain-free life more worthwhile? After Joel (Jim Carrey) learns that his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had him erased from her mind following a terrible argument, he decides to do the same.  He goes to the special clinic where the procedure is offered, and we meet the people who work there - as it turns out, they've got their own secrets and their own hidden entanglements.  They set to work on Joel's mind, zapping memory after memory of his relationship with Clementine, and as the procedure is being done, we see that Joel is regretting it.  He doesn't want Clementine out of his mind and, desperately, he tries to hide her deep in his brain, away from the merciless, pain-eradicating technology.    The movie gives us an unsparing look at a relationship - what enchants one partner about the other, and how they also find things about one another that are really irritating and nearly intolerable.  But love is still worth it at the end...  it's beautiful to see Joel realize that; despite the boredom that can set in during a relationship or the arguments that might arise, he still loves this woman and what she has brought to his life.  Jim Carrey gives a great performance, full of quiet, subdued humor and real emotional pain.  It's wonderful how restrained he is...  even in one scene, where he is a four-year-old, he manages to make it funny without going over the top.    Though I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief enough about the technology used to zap memories (especially the way the procedure was done, in Joel's home, with the technicians smoking pot and dancing half-naked on his bed), I liked the issues that the movie dealt with, how it didn't simplify things, and how much feeling ultimately came out of it at the end.  Like other Kaufman films, it's imaginative and funny and has truly poignant moments.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This movie is literally a long chase and a face/off between two spies. It's also part revenge flick, even though the vengeance and justice wrecked upon the wrong-doers are not as explicit as being displayed in the blood soaked \\"Kill Bill\\". <br /> <br />\\"Bourne Supremacy\\" bears little resemblance to the original Ludlum novel. Partly, the movie studio wanted to avoid its controversial content (assassination of a Chinese vice-premier) and opted for an albeit, lamer botched up CIA operation that claimed the lives of two CIA agents. <br /> <br />Matt Damon, with his deadpan performance as Jason Bourne, disappears into the role of the super spy completely. Totally absorbed and with a single-tracked spartan approach to pursuing his often faceless enemies, Bourne wrecked havock through the continent of Europe, climaxing with the most thrilling bumper car chase this summer has to offer. <br /> <br />This DVD seemed to be a good buy. But of course, I am writing this in a biased point of view. I love this movie a lot, in fact, more than its predecessor. I have absolutely no problems with the fly-on-the-wall jerky cinematography. In fact, I think it enhances the feel and atmosphere of the movie whereby it's cat and mouse chases all over Europe and Moscow.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Star wars. Hm. You think of a cheap old-fashioned sci-fi film. Think again. Star wars. You launch the rockets to destroy the Death-star and save many a planets. You blast through space with the millenium-falcon. Good? Even perhaps perfect? No. Even better. The Greatest of the Great.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This second album from Britney Spears is her best one out of the four!  Unbelievable catchy songs, and the first four songs kick hard, especially when Oops, Stronger, and Don't Go Knockin start it off before her attitude heavy remake of the Rolling Stones' I Can't Get No Satisfaction.  I like Don't Let Me be The Last To Know, the one Shania Twain wrote.  It has that early '80s feel to it.  What You See Is What You Get sounds too much like Oops and Baby One More Time in terms of the chorus, but it's still funky! Lucky talks about having unexpected fame, but feeling so  unsure about accepting it.  One of her best ballads is Where Are You Now.  Everytime from her 4th release of 2003, In the Zone is no contest to this one. Even her 3rd album was her weakest compared to this superior 2nd. One of the first albums to have both Max Martin and Rodney Jerkins-produced songs on here! Both Martin and Jerkings had hits back to back in 1999 and 2000 and even their own songs were playing back-to-back on the radio! This was a major hit in that pop music period of 1997 to 2001, before everyone shifted to adult pop, mature songs, crunk hip hop from Atlanta and other kinds of songs. But Britney's albums have held up against all that heavy competition!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I spent my teenage allowance on the brilliant dreamscapes of Star Wars, so forgive me for still believing that the original three Star Wars movies are classics that newer versions will never come close to matching.<br /><br />Which is why it's supremely annoying that Mr. Lucas couldn't leave well enough alone and found it necessary to ply every sparse shot with needless digital effects to drive true fans to distraction. There are even a couple of scenes that're \\"restored\\" for perhaps no other reason than he had the footage lying around.<br /><br />Yet, this is probably the reason to get this four-disc collection of expert filmmaking and behind-the-scenes footage: to uncover the, um, exciting and traumatic discoveries. There's even a spectacular two-and-a-half hour documentary that's worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />If you, like me, still find yourself giddy every time John Williams' theme score ushers in the famous prologue \\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..\\", then this is a no-brainer of a purchase; it's the kind of stuff DVD technology was made for.
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a load of crap.  A documentary is supposed to be based on facts not lies. I give it one star because there is not an option for zero.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I know that crime is not supposed to pay, but whether you are watching Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the Old West or during the Great Depression you end up wishing that it sort of would.  \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is probably best described as a buddy movie because in terms of the Western genre it is an odd sort of film.  It has more than its share of comic moments, thanks to the deft touch of scripter William Goldman, but it is certainly not a slapstick comedy like \\"Cat Ballou\\" or a send up on the genre like \\"Blazing Saddles.\\"  Then there is one of the most depressing endings endings ever, which speaks to the more sobering aspects of the Adult Western epitomized by \\"Shane\\" and \\"High Noon.\\"  The only other Western that comes to mind as being in that neck of the woods is \\"Destry Rides Again,\\" which has something of the same sly sense of satire.<br /><br />Director George Roy Hill had a big hand in making \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" a different sort of Western.  There are plenty of people getting gunned downed in this movie, but Hill avoids the Sam Peckinpah-like bloody violence that was introduced that same year in \\"The Wild Bunch.\\"  He also comes up with a rather contemporary musical score that goes so far as to take B.J. Thomas' \\"Raindrops Keeping Fallin' on My Head,\\" throw it into this movie, and make it work (who is going to complain about watching Paul Newman ride a bicycle?).  Hill puts together another couple of musical montages, both written by Burt Bacharach, with \\"Old Fun City,\\" as Butch (Newman), Sundance (Redford) and Etta (Katharine Ross) leave New York City, and \\"South American Getaway,\\" where happy voices make happy sounds while the Bolivian police chase los banditos Yanqui.  But in the most dramatic moments of the film there is no music at all.<br /><br />But the chief attraction here is the combination of wit and drama.  Butch and Sundance keep spouting one-liners (Goldman provides just as many great ones here as he does in \\"The Princess Bride,\\" which would make him the undisputed king of such things), but we always get the sense that they are trying to make light of a situation that is pretty dangerous.  From using too much dynamite (\\"Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?\\") and being chased relentlessly by an unknown posse (\\"Who are those guys?\\") to jumping off cliffs (\\"The fall will probably kill you\\") and visiting foreign lands (\\"This might be the Atlantic City, New Jersey of all Bolivia for all you know\\"), these two guys are a step away from ending up dead.  The second time you see the film you can see how much the ending of this film is foreshadowed.<br /><br />The ability to really have it both ways is why this film remains popular with audiences, even if critics had no idea as to what it was doing when it first came out in 1969.  The stars and dialogue are so winning that audiences manage to enjoy the film even though it is basically a tragedy.  There is even a point where one of the characters, Sheriff Ray Bledsoe (Jeff Corey) lays it out for not only Butch and Sundance but also the audience, telling the boys: \\"You know, you should have let yourself get killed a long time ago when you had the chance. See, you may be the biggest thing that ever hit this area, but you're still two-bit outlaws. I never met a soul more affable than you, Butch, or faster than the Kid, but you're still nothing but two-bit outlaws on the dodge. It's over, don't you get that? Your time is over and you're gonna die bloody, and all you can do is choose where.\\"  It is rare to find a film that is so insistent about confounding the expectations of its audience and so successful in getting away with it.  No wonder that in its wake first class Westerns have been few and far behind (e.g., \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" \\"Unforgiven,\\" which also underscore that the heights can still be scaled in that usually neglected genre).<br /><br />\\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" won Oscars for not only Goldman's original script and Bacharach's music (and song) but also Conrad L. Hall's cinematography.  The film made $100 million at the box office, which was a lot in those days before \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" redefined the term \\"blockbuster.\\"  It is strange to think that Redford was not considered a star before this film or how close this movie came to having Newman and Jack Lemmon or Steve McQueen, not to mention Hill having offered the two stars the opposite roles they ended up making famous.  Even when Hollywood hits a home run with a film it is amazing how close it comes to the foul pole once you know the story behind the movie.original script and Bacharach's music (and song) but also Conrad L.

B00003CXCT|4.0|If you think you have seen Star Wars or heard it you ain't seen nothing yet. I understand old schooler's don't approve of any changes to a classic. I saw Star Wars in 1977 and what has been lost over the years of grainy video tape is a crime. I've awaited this release for a long time! Widescreen binging in lost elements but the colors so vivid the red light reflecting in 3PO's coverings on the Blockade Runner, lost to video tape. The print is clean and clear an obvious miss at cleaning up the effects was in \\"The Fighter Attack\\". The blocks around the Tie fighters were not removed in this sequence one reason for the 4 stars, other is no deleted scenes. The deleted scenes are every where so why not include them in the collection. The set is well worth the price even if you pay the MSRP of $70.00. If you do not have a Surround Sound system don't worry the sound has been cleaned up as well. Leia finaly gets to shoot a laser rifle instead of a 9mm in the swing to freedom. The sound was fixed after all the previous releases where the sound of the blank round was left in the sound track. Any Star Wars fan will wan't this collection, I haven't seen such a clear great sounding copy since 1977 and it has been a long wait guess that makes it that much sweeter. By all means hold onto your laser discs and pre- special edition VHS they will be worth money. Lucasfilm should have included a second track to watch it old school and earned a 5 star fom even the most hard core fans. I for one say Star Wars looks and sounds its best bringing the original magic back!
B00005JMUA|2.0|It should be remembered that \\"Kill Bill\\" is essentially one movie split into two out of running length necessity; the (rather sensible) logic was that NO ONE would be able to take in a single feature that ran 248 minutes (just over 4 hours) in length.<br /><br />So what you have is a similar situation with \\"Kill Bill\\" as with Tarantino's last full-length film \\"Jackie Brown\\"; a good movie that (in my opinion) simply runs too darn long.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill\\" peaked with \\"Volume 1\\", a movie that ran at just under two hours but seemed to go by much quicker, ham-fisted dialogue notwithstanding.  \\"Volume 2\\" is actually over two hours but seems to go by a third as fast.  \\"Volume 2\\" features much more introspection and less action than \\"Volume 1\\"...and as a result the plot just drags.  Introspection is well-used in a movie where there is a level of intrigue involved (see prior Tarantino examples \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and even \\"Pulp Fiction\\" to a degree), but in an action spectacular like \\"Kill Bill\\" it does nothing but slow things down...BADLY.  The flashback sequences do this movie no favors (unlike \\"Volume 1\\", where the flashback involving Oren Ishii actually was one of that movie's true highlights), and the personalities of the remaining \\"deadly vipers\\" simply aren't as powerful as those slain (perhaps prematurely, in terms of plot pacing) in the first movie.<br /><br />That in itself could perhaps be forgiven...but the final act is such a tremendous letdown.  What should have been an epic battle between two warriors built up over nearly four hours of screentime as demigod-like figures is unforgiveably underdone.  David Carradine once infamously got on martial arts/action cinema icon Chuck Norris' bad side by failing to pull his punches in the filming of \\"Lone Wolf McQuade\\"; that and his history as Kwai Chang Caine would seem to warrant a more pronounced presence in the final confrontation.  But four hours of plot development (again with a reference to the length of the movies; I do apologize, but it does much to color my overall impression of both films as a whole) leads up to a fight sequence that lasts perhaps a minute, if even that?  That may be well and good for Sergio Leone pictures where the pull of a trigger takes but a second and ends a life equally as efficiently, but a good martial arts movie demands MORE and SUSTAINED ACTION (see \\"Enter The Dragon\\", \\"Return Of The Dragon\\" \\"Project A\\", and basically any Bruce Lee and/or Jackie Chan movie ever made for reference).  The Bride's fight with Copperhead and GoGo from \\"Volume 1\\" was far more exhilerating and much more worthy of a climactic ending than the inevitable showdown between Bill and The Bride (whose name, finally revealed, is one of the coolest things about this movie).<br /><br />Logically speaking, anyone who likes \\"Volume 1\\" should want to see \\"Volume 2\\".  However, while I can recommend buying \\"Volume 1\\", I can't in good faith say that my money was well-spent when I bought the concluding DVD.  I believe, knowing what I know now, I would have felt better with the story ending unresolved.e movies; I do apologize, but it does much to color my overall impression of both films as a whole) leads up to a fight sequence that lasts perhaps a minute, if even that?

B0002IU988|4.0|Alter Bridge sounds good judging from that first single. And Myles Kennedy sure can sing!  The three remaining members of Creed still sound solid in their newer band.  They still like to follow the old Creed formula of 4:45, 4:58, 5:24 and 5:09 to 6 minute songs, yet do a new take of it.  Their lyrics still remain positive and uplifting with Alter Bridge now. The first single still sounds like My Sacrifice or Higher from Creed in some places, so the familiarity is still there.  I hope that this band is successful this year.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I'd be here for hours if I were to try to explain how I felt about this movie. I felt betrayed and utterly disappointed. This should have been the biggest and best film yet. Having read the book over the summer with my children, we were very excited to see what we thought was going to be one hell of a movie. I was so disappointed and shocked that this was IT, that I nearly cried while the credits rolled. Wish they could use Hermoine's necklace to go back and fix this wrong!!
B000002KDI|5.0|I was turned on to this album in the early 80`s and it has wielded its influence over me ever since.Neil Young was not new to me but I was not a huge fan and this was at a time when I needed to hear it.I was a confused teenager looking for answers to questions I spent alot of time thinking about....my place in the world,love,drugs,impending adulthood,ect. and this album helped me out.From the opening of Sugar Mountain to final chords of Tonight`s the Night you are treated to an overview of Neil`s output from the Buffalo Springfield to his work with Crazy Horse. <br />All of the songs are knockouts and each one tells a different story....about childhood,relationships,growing up,growing old,women and the list goes on.If you want to listen to music that can actually move you then this is an album to have - to be a teenager and hear this album with fresh ears will never happen again but sometimes when I play it I can go back to a simpler time when at least somebody had some answers and for that I will always be forever in Neil`s debt.Thanks Shakey !!!
B00005M91K|5.0|Go into this movie with a completely open mind and you shall hopefully experience the journey that is \\"Baraka\\".  It truly moved and affected me, but that's just me.  It could make one reconsider many beliefs formerly thought to be \\"right\\" or \\"moral\\" or \\"meaningful\\".  <br /> <br />As one review described it, \\"imagine if alien beings from another galaxy reached earth and filmed what they saw on this incredible planet...That's Baraka\\".  This is meaningful and breathtaking film that paints the wonder of LIFE in a moving and seamless way. <br /> <br />In the end, no movie I have ever seen can cause one to ponder one's own existence in this great, big, universe...As such, I believe every person on the planted should...nay, must...see this beautiful film.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Just watched this movie for the first time in over 12 years! <br />I remember it being good, but had obviously forgotten that it was a masterpiece! <br />The movie is set in the present day, but its filmed in a 1930's-thriller style - complete with an (intentionally) over-the-top classical soundtrack, and sets that aren't intended to look lifelike - i.e. a similar style to `American Psycho'. <br /> <br />Next comes the acting. Wow! How I love good acting like this. Knockout performances from everyone. <br />Probably DeNiro's best ever performance. Nick Nolte is simply brilliant. And Juliette Lewis... oh my... she plays the part, of a 15 year old schoolgirl, who's unable to resist her sexual attraction for an ex-convict (DeNiro) who's the same age as her father - who subsequently seduces her in her classroom! The sexual tension in this seen is incredible, and Lewis plays the part to perfect, mesmerizing you along the way. <br /> <br />When all of the sections of a movie - acting, actors, story, screenplay, music, direction, cinematography, production - are perfect, and are masterfully combined, it creates something with this magnitude - `Cape Fear `91'  <br />
B000089RV6|5.0|I heard some songs from Back In Black over the years, but didn't get to hear the entire album until 1997(!).  AC/DC definitely rocked all throughout, one continuous, catchy rocker after another!  Back In Black has the most addictive riff of any rock record out there!  The opening two songs, Back In Black and Hell's Bells (which I still hear at sports arenas these days), set the standard for strong opening songs for an album.  You have to kick real hard in the beginning!  I like the final cut Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, proving that this band loves to make music and doesn't care what the panning critics think. Shoot to Thrill, You Shook Me All Night Long, and a bluesy kind of song (Have A Drink on Me) on the album are other surprises.  As I listened to the album, it kind of wears thin between tracks 8 and 9.  Obviously, those few songs are less interesting, because it follows such very phenomenal rock songs.  Since Back To Black, I've noticed that they've sticked to the same formula of recording their albums.  This album has a lot of rhythm to it along with the stomping, head banging and heavy pounding of your feet when you listen to it. Angus Young's rock leads are still legendary on this album! For the band to continue with Brian Johnson after the death of Bon Scott is quite remarkable as well as continuing the band's importance and longevity in music. One of the greatest albums in music history and it's still selling like crazy--over 19-20 million or so sold to this day! It had Mutt Lange producing it, which led him to making some of the greatest rock albums of the '80s'/'90s, the Neptunes back then of rock in his own right!
B00006690G|1.0|Why Em, Why take the media side. Controversy is barely in this album he sounds more commercial then britney spears. Sorry, but you sold your true fan out. I only liked four songs from this album - \\"White Amerika\\"- I dont care what you people say I love it, it just reminds me of this nation now. \\"Square dance\\" its almost close as good as his old material.\\"My Daddy gone Crazy\\" the only song with his daughter saying a bit of controversial stuff but its never close as \\"Criminal\\". Actually \\"Till I collapse\\" is the only good song of the whole album that I could listen to it a couple of times and not rant on it. I just wish he didnt made the commercial base songs this could of gone some where instead to my toilet. Im not even going to care if he comes with another album. Im just going back to listening to his two last albums and think he never made this album.<br /><br /> Oh One more thing - The \\"Superman\\" music video in 8 mile. Show that he could be the white version of Rico Suave it made me laugh like I laugh at Suave and know hes a joke. You sold out. You gone pop.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am 18 years old and have recently watched BoB for the first time, and the affect that it had on me was profound. The story of the Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division was portrayed so incredibly real that I felt like I was there with these men, experiencing their fears and anxieties. And getting to know the characters in the movie made me feel closer and gave me such an appreciation for our service men who are out fighting. The blood that was spilt, the lives that were given, and the comradeship shared evoked so much pathos. BoB shows the physical, emotional, and mental strain that is placed on these soldiers by the effects of war. It is grueling and full of heartache. You see this on their faces. I have never been in war and don't know the \\"reality\\" of it - but this to me shows the many sides and \\"realities\\" of war that we hear about from veterans but rarely see in other war movies. <br />I agree with the reviewer who stated that no high school student should graduate with out seeing this. I whole-heartedly agree. It has made me so grateful for our freedom and the men and women who sacrifice their lives to insure us of that. <br />And for those who have said that this movie was \\"American Propaganda\\" or that it resembles \\"teen melodrama\\" and over-glorifies American soldiers, I would like to say that I am ashamed that such people live in our country. Although this is not a documentary, one would hope that you would have a shred of gratitude in remembrance of the reason that you live enjoying liberty. If you think that this is something that \\"teens do on their spring break\\" I recommend you actually knowing what you are talking about before you express it. What a sickening comparison. Why don't we shove a gun in your hand and push you out of a plane and into Iraq and see how long you hold out, if you're so convinced that they wouldn't have lasted 24 hours. <br />For those of you interested in buying or watching BoB I would recommend it more than any other movie I have ever seen. It is educational and humbling. <br />GOD BLESS AMERICAN AND OUR SOLDIERS! <br />
B00005K9LK|5.0|Judas Priest's 8th studio album, \\"Screaming For Vengeance,\\" is a monster of an album. Though the ten original tracks (the only ones I listen to, I ALWAYS skip the bonus tracks) make for a fairly brief album (38 and a half minutes), it still rocks. Though not as good as Painkiller, Defenders Of The Faith, or British Steel, it is better than all the other Priest records except all that I mentioned above. The album has no weak points, even the 45 second prelude \\"Hellion\\" rocks. But perhaps the four tracks that stand out the most are the following: \\"Electric Eye,\\" the track \\"Hellion\\" leads into, is an excellent example of speed metal pandemonium, which is how a majority of the bands records begin. \\"Bloodstone\\" has kind of a feel similar to early Black Sabbath. \\"(Take These) Chains\\" is, I assume, a cover of a 60's rock and roll hit, considering the fact that it feels such and it also is not written by the trio of poets (Halford, Downing, and Tipton). And \\"You Got Another Thing Comin'\\" is easily the band's most recognized song, no one can not recognize that power chord. It seems that the band likes to open their live shows with \\"Hellion/Electric Eye\\" and close them with \\"Another Thing Comin'\\" (at least, that's what happened when I saw them at Ozzfest this year). So if you want an album that isn't their best, but still a monster, check this out.<br /><br />\\"Play it loud, don't play it low, BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS WITH ROCK AND ROOOOOOOOLLLL!\\"-Manowar
B00003CXCT|3.0|Ok, first off I really like Star Wars. However I do not like when chefs add way too much pepper and salt to an otherwise perfect dinner, and that is precisly what George Lucas is doing. Now I do not know about anyone else, but I love the look of the star wars films, everything seems to have a rustic, throw-together look about them which I think is great. However when it ventures off to another world it becomes no longer the star wars that I and fans alike remember and feel in love with. Now on to my real complaint. The DVDs are cool and the sound is good, which is a no-brainer, there is one thing lacking. THE DELETED SCENES. Ok the films were already blockbusters and they made their mark, so lets now present them in the uncut presentation. I mean, you can't have Luke Skywalker comment on a conversation, while giving C3P0 an oil bath, that never existed in the film. That is bad story telling. You do see the pictures in the gallery section of the bonus disk. Another example is that are we to assume that Han Solo automatically forgives Lando for turning him over to Vader? There is a scene in which they meet after blowing up Jabba's sail barge and they do indeed forgive each other, becoming blasting off into space. Another gapping hole, which ironically was the first scene of the movie that they shot and can be seen in the trailer on the bonus disk. and the list goes on and on. I keep my rating at 3 stars because the bonus disk does acknowledge the existance of these scences, but they are sadly missing. Just alternate angles and extended scenes can offer much more possibilites. How can every other director not be afraid of putting out director's cuts of their movies? Who cares if they are bad, at least we will see where you were originally going with character development. Star Wars is suffering, because it has just become a money making scheme, but at least we fans out there will have our original VHS versions to keep the dream alive. I really hope and wish that he will make and distribute the Director's Cut of Star Wars, at least a new hope. However I will never have a new hope of Lucas preserving and untanting the vision and simplicity that inspired us so much.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit had their best album with this 2000 album.  This album rocked harder. I liked Rollin' where Fred Durst does his Beastie Boys impression on the chorus.  Another song that stood out is It'll Be Ok, one of their best rockers and best guitar line that signifies the song. The Mission Impossible song was very well done, more experimental. The hip-hop version of Rollin was good, but Fred Durst screaming Are You Readyyyyyyyyyyy when the song starts comes off as silly and funny on record.  He gets carried away on a few songs. My Way is very optimistic, but shows Durst as his most honest. Their best album to me!
B00004T9UF|5.0|When I first herd \\"kill you\\" he related to me. Of the stuff I wish I could say to my angry mother that nags because shes can never be satisfied. Then I got bored of Stan because of the slow beats but still great lyrics. The rest just still makes my adrenaline pumping from the controversy. This is the True Slim Shadey. I dont care what they say he's the only one that use freedom of speech to its fullist. Get this album not \\"the Eminem Show\\" unless you want the changed soft Slim Shadey. I think this should of won for album of the year at the grammys.
0440241413|3.0|Yes, I grew tired quickly of her whining and panicking.  Good thing this is a work of fiction. Sadly, I'm guessing there are actually REAL people out there like this.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|I'm a loyal Floyd fan since I first stumbled onto them in the early '70's, but \\"Final Cut\\" is an awful piece of work. Compared to every other Pink floyd album out there, this one is the weakest. <br /> <br />Yes, it's subjective, so humblest apoligies to those who find it worthwhile. Personally, it's a lot of noise. If you want to introduce yourself to Pink Floyd, pick any one of their other works. Purchase this album only if you need it to complete your Floyd collection. This does not change the fact that Pink floyd is one of the greatest bands of all time, but they sure laid an egg with \\"Final Cut\\".
B0000C6K09|1.0|While I'm as big a fan of John Williams' music as anyone, I was *highly* disappointed by this collection for one simple fact--the quality of the orchestra playing his scores here is simply appalling.  For those used to hearing Mr. Williams' music being played by only the finest of ensembles, this recording will be an extreme let-down.  I was especially looking forward to this recording for its concert arrangements of songs such as \\"Flag Parade\\" that are unavailable elsewhere ... but I can't even bring myself to listen to it, the musicianship is so poor.  My advice:  skip this over-priced, substandard recording and stick with the original, official soundtracks.
B00000JCB2|2.0|Significant Other had good songs, but lame stuff.  Nookie is still their strongest record. It sounds like the drummer was barefooted when he hit the drums in the song.  But there are some flat numbers like Rearranged.  The pace of the song is BORING!  Good groove, but a very boring pace sometimes.  A few times, I went to sleep when I heard the song.  There seems to be an '80s feel in some of the songs and Fred Durst's raps tend to range from normal to offensive to outlandish.  They stick to the same song formula, rapid pace, then a slow breakdown before their big crashing endings.  But the lyrics are corny and flat in some places.  Even some of the song titles sound stupid.  So I just don't see this as their breakthrough. Just don't see it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|A great soundtrack! Probably the absolute best musical soundtrack since the sound of music :) Though I think girls would like the music/lyrics even if they haven't watched the series. Guys might really dig it if they really dig the tv show. Most of the music has the lyrics front and center above the music. A couple of them may be just musical scores, but the majority of the songs are of lyrics related to the show they were in and related to the whole series at the same time. Most of the real cast are doing their songs, so no, voices wouldn't be perfect to musical critics at every moment, though I think this makes the songs more endearing and heartfelt. Don't get me wrong, I'm not musical at all and I LOVE these songs! It is amazing the voices that came out of these actors and actresses, makes me think most could have had musical careers if they couldn't get acting jobs. My absolute favorite 3 songs are \\"Under Your Spell\\", \\"Rest in Peace\\", and \\"Standing\\" :) at least I think those are the names :)
B00006RU5B|5.0|Rage Against The Machine's frontman Zack De La Rocha left the band in 2000 to start a solo career (and for some creative differences). However, the guitarist-Tom Morello, bassist-Tim Commerford, and drummer-Brad Wilk wanted to keep the band alive. They went out looking for a new singer.     Soungarden had broken up in 1997. Their singer Chris Cornell had released his first solo album in 1999. While the album was good it was nowhere as big and great as his Soundgarden roots.     In mere months after Zack De La Rocha had left Rage Against The Machine, there were rumors of Chris Cornell taking Rocha's place in Rage. Rumors became fact and the new RATM+SG Love Child were in the studio writing and performing all new material. However, after a few months Cornell abandoned the project. After short break he came to his senses and rejoined the project. It was now when the band took full force.      It was now that they had began to throw around ideas for a new band name to keep old fans from disliking the new sound(learning from the mistakes of Van Halen). They called themselvles Civilian ,but settled on Audioslave.     Their first album was released November, 2002. The album was as great as any Rage or Soundgarden album. It even opened people's eyes to their older stuff. Some of the highlights were: Cochise, Show Me How To Live, Like A Stone, I Am The Highway, and Set It Off.     For all of you who would like to find out more about Rage and Soundgarden, the best Soundgarden album is \\"Superunknown\\", and the best Rage Against The Machine album is their self titled debut, \\"Rage Against The Machine\\". There is also a new track on the Fahrenheit 9/11 soundtrack from Zack De La Rocha. You shalt not be disappointed.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I was disappointed, like many were. Why George, why could you not find it in your big head to release two box sets. How about a \\" Directors Cut\\" which is what you presented us with this time around. And the the \\" Original Theatrical Production\\". Does this make sense to you George. Don't you get it we liked them the way they were.  Your ego should be left out of our memories.  Please give it some thought. Please give us what we want. Thank you.
B00000DOYR|5.0|Most likely if you've been in your car and heard an AC/DC tune, but don't know what it is. Just look on this record, it's 10 straight singles, 42 minutes of solid songs. Normallly you buy a cd, and there'll be a song you skip over, you WILL NOT find a bad song on this album.
B0002OERI0|4.0|To The Last Reviewer... You do realize if Bush gets re-elected he is likely to start the draft, and that you are at the prime age? Right? Mabie it is time to consider your future, like not being on the front line. You might have a choice in music, but the Government controls something more important... Your future. Green Day is cool, Bush is not. VOTE.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I never write reviews, but after reading the editorial review by Elizabeth V. I just had to speak up! This CD offers so much to just about anyone who likes music. It crosses all kinds of genres, it is pleasing to listen to, and it is one of the few records out there that can be played in it's entirety. Every track offers something special and if I could give this CD 6 stars I would.
B00000F14B|5.0|This good old-fashioned, stand-up-and-cheer musical stars Shirley Jones as Marian, an Iowa spinster librarian and piano teacher in the early 1900s. Her whole town is turned upside down with the arrival of the flashy \\"Music Man\\" - salesman  Harold Hill (Robert Preston,) who sells band instruments and uniforms; tiny Ronny Howard, as Marian's brother, overcomes his shyness with his new coronet. Despite her best intentions, stiff Miss Marian falls in love with the slick, fast talking con artist. He's smitten, too, and the whole town celebrates in song.<br /><br />Shirley Jones was never lovelier and has a beautiful voice in songs like Til There Was You and Goodnight, My Someone. Robert Preston makes a memorable flim-flam man with a heart of gold, and his big song, \\"Trouble in River City,\\" is a show-stopper. Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold almost steal the show as the very funny mayor and his wife.<br /><br />The film is a beautifully filmed celebration of Americana, and you just have to love a musical that can find a rhyme for \\"librarian\\"!  This is splashy, feel-good, wholesome entertainment you'll enjoy over and over again.  Extras include a good documentary by Shirley Jones.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Many of the changes made to these classic movies are unnecessary and, to some degree, take away from the magic of the Star Wars trilogy. HOWEVER, when viewed with just a modicum of objectivity, these are still three great, magical adventure movies that are a lot of fun to watch. <br />  There's been a lot of argument about who owns to Star Wars triology. Here's my 2 cents: George Lucas owns them LEGALLY, but, as soon as he released them and they were embraced by the world as part of popular culture, they became much more than just the celluloid reels shown in theatres. As is pretty obvious from the reviews posted here, a lot of other people's dreams, emotions, and beliefs got wrapped up in these films. I think that George Lucas, unfortunately, hasn't respected that, by stubbornly refusing to also release the original films. He must not believe that that is his responsibility. <br />  Moving on, after finally seeing these films on DVD, I have to say that I love them all over again. There's still a lot of magic and fun to be had with these films. It's just too bad that the fan-boys, who are proving themselves just as stubborn as George Lucas, are denying themselves the pleasure that they obviously hold in high esteem. They're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. <br />  My advice: Get over yourself and re-live the adventure of the Star Wars trilogy.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I WAS FLOORED BY THIS WONDERFUL DISC.  IT IS A GREAT CONCLUSION TO A GREAT MANS CAREER. THE CHOICE OF SONGS ON THE ALBUM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER. THE DUETS WITH SOME OF THE TOP PERFORMERS OF OUR TIME ARE TERRIFIC. ONE IS BETTER THAN THE NEXT.  IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY RAY CHARLES LOVER.  IT DESERVES THE HIGHEST RATING ALLOWED.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have never been much of a fan of the star wars saga.  I know how good the movies were and all, and def wanted this set, but I am really suprised to read all of these reviews that dislike the set.  I think the sound and picture quality of these movies is excellent, and I never actually realized how good these movies were! I guess the movies have been changed from the originals, but I think it makes the movies Better! You should def own this set if you enjoy action movies.
0783235666|5.0|This memorable tale of man versus bird stars Tippi Hedren as Melanie, a snooty San Francisco socialite who meets a dapper lawyer/weekend farmer (Rod Taylor).  He disapproves of her jetsetter lifestyle; she dislikes him, too...or maybe not.  She drives up the coast to his hometown to surprise him and is inexplicably attacked by seagulls. Soon, the whole town is besieged by murderous birds. Several people, including schoolteacher Suzanne Pleshette, are killed.<br /><br />The reason for the attacks is never given; we are left to wonder: Was it because Melanie bought caged lovebirds in the opening scene? Are the birds getting back at mankind for past wrongs?  We'll never know, but this is a very scary film (especially considering there is no musical soundtrack - only the menacing flapping of bird wings). Hedren is a classic ice-princess; Taylor is the earthy Everyman; they have a good chemistry between them.  The rural setting makes an interesting backdrop for unexpected thrills.  You'll be on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next attack of The Birds!
B0002S943O|5.0|Depeche Mode Devotional is the best concert video ever made! The music is deep and the visuals are incredible. You don't merely watch DM Devotional, rather you experience it through sight and sound. I saw this show live in Vancouver in 1993 and bought the VHS tape the day it came out and was a little disapponted to see that it only contained half the show. After 11 long years the whole concert is finally available! This is a must for all DM Devotees and I encourage even non fans to check this out. Anybody who sees this will surely appreciate the entire production. The Exciter Tour DVD is great, but this one is simply excellent.
B0000CAXID|4.0|Well I really wouldn't say demos since this was actually made up of songs that Dave recorded while drumming for Nirvana. This is a very good album and made me look forward to future releases and so far the Foo Fighters have not let me down. The song 'Big Me' may be very simple but it still is pretty poetic and it was a sign that things were going to get better for Dave, not to mention that I laughed my ass off when I watched the music video. There is no filler in here, its a very decent album with inspired and inspiring lyrics and great guitar licks. After this Dave gets a band and does another great album but this was the foundation and was truly a great place to start. Buy this if you like alternative, Foo Fighters and/or Nirvana.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Hey folks, I'm the dude who hates \\"Jaws 3,\\" but I suppose that really doesn't narrow it down. Anyway, I'm the dude who really went to town bashing it. First of all, I was in a foul mood at the time and I hope I didn't offend anyone, but I don't take back anything I said, particularly the bit about the original being \\"a masterpiece.\\" It is, and everybody should see it at some time. For people who don't like horror, don't worry. I don't find this film remotely scary except for a bit where we see the shark underwater and a man swimming just inches from it (shudders). I always find myself shocked by that image even though I know it's coming. As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the greatest films in history, even better than the original \\"Star Wars\\" and certainly Mr. Spielberg's best. For parents who are worried about the objectionable content, there's quite a bit of blood and some language, but I think I saw it first when I was ten, and I was fine.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney's musical, animated version of the old fairy tale is truly a thing of beauty. As the story opens, a handsome but proud prince shuns an old woman, thus starting the magic spell that turns him into a hideous Beast.  In the nearby village, the heroine, Belle, is considered quite odd because she likes to read books. She is pursued by Gaston, the town bully, but she'll have nothing to do with the lout. When Belle's eccentric father becomes a prisoner in the Beast's castle, she agrees to take his place. Gradually, she and the Beast fall in love, and as the magic spell that held him is broken, he becomes the handsome prince again, changed by the power of love.<br /><br />The outstanding soundtrack is full of clever, romantic, and fun-to-sing tunes that stay with you. Angela Landsbury plays Mrs. Potts, the enchanted tea pot, bringing warmth and class to the film. This is the stuff little girls' dreams are made of.
B000002L68|5.0|Although I've always felt that 1999 was Prince's true breakthrough (read cross-over) disc, it's hard to argue wth this masterpiece. Prince took it to another level with this one. Wherein on his previous albums he pretty much stuck with R&B/Soul with a punk attitude, with Purple Rain he took rock by the horns and breathe new life in it. As usual, let's look at it song by song. Let'Go Crazy: A flatout, head banging rocker that became an anthem for the most part of the 80's. Besides Sign O' The Times, it is the best album opener in Princes great career.Though the album version is great, if you can dig it up somewhere, the 12 single version is even better. We hear some of the 12 inch version in the movie. All in all, it's a classic. Take Me With You: Only prince can rock us out and then take us to a pop wonderworld without skipping a beat......and we like it! Prince is helped out in the vocals by a cooing Appolonia. Which actually sounds perfect for the popish groove of this song. It's one of my favorite songs on the disc. The Beautiful Ones: This love triangle song is most notable for it's ending. It's filled with primal screams of anguish by Prince. The last where he states \\"I want you, yes I do\\". The music, a synth drum beat coupled with a cymbal fade away. It's a heart breaking song that should be played very loudly unless you have very thin walls. The neighbors may think you're killing someone! Computer Blue: This is a turning point for the album and I'll tell you why in a second. It's starts with a very lezbo exchange between Wendy and Lisa about the water being warm enough? Very sexy! That fades into what is the heart of the song where Prince is asking us \\"Where is my love life?\\" There can't be more than a minute of lyrics before we move on to another stage of the song that is solely instrumental, mainly guitar. And a great guitar solo at that! This finally ends with prince again screaming at the top of his lungs to end the song. But as the last notes fade into the next song, you can hear what can only be describe as a whooping, howling scream by Prince. So why is this a turning point for the album? This album is from a movie of the same name. When people bought it they of course would associate each song with a scene or moment from the movie. This song separates the album as a unique work apart from the movie. This album could stand alone even if a movie about it never existed. AND, the album is much, much, MUCH deeper than the movie could ever think of being. This album is about pent up sexual, and personal frustration. Prince fights his own demons on a daily basis. Like Marvin Gaye, his demons are dealing with sex and still loving and serving God. Prince took it a step further by really beliveing that when we make love, that is when we are the closest we'll ever get to God here on Earth. The screams amd howls of excrusiating pain at the end of Computer Blue brings this to the forefont on this album. Darling Nikki: Another very important song on the disc. On the surface \\"Nikki\\" just seems to be a funny song about a very horny girl of the same name. By the end of the song though, after more  painful screams, the song fades into what sounds like a rain storm coupled with very weird backward singing. On the original album (and unfortunately you'll never be able to hear this from a CD) you could play it backwards. He sings praises and hallelujah to God and his plans for us. Now what a crazy way to end the most perverted song on the album! Again, it's the God and sex connection. And it's pure Prince. When Doves Cry: What can I say about this song? It is one of the songs I picked as the 5 greatest of the 80's and it is one of the best songs ever! Why? Really listen to it. It is the first song that solely uses percussion instruments for most of the song. The only melody is the lead vocal. Even at the begining of each chorus, those weird notes are played on a steel drum. A percussion instrument. Not until the end does the guitarcome in. Why is this so important? Rock and pop songs up until then were built around an instrument that could actually play a tune! Although R&B and soul definitely put more emphasis on the rythym section, this song took it to the extreme. Couple such an arrangement with some very oriental sounding keyboards and harmonies and you get the timeless classic that is When Doves Cry. I Would Die For You: A jittery classic. This is a fast moving song that on the surface just sounds like it's about undying love for someone. It's about far more than just that. Listen to the lyrics. In the context of the movie it is just about the relationship between two people. In the more layered context of the album, Prince is speaking to us as God/Jesus Himself! Think of the lyrics, \\"I'm not a woman, I'm not a man. I am something that you'll never understand\\". Later on he even says \\"I'm your Messiah\\". The real tell tale lyric is said close to the end in the \\"rapid rap\\" part as I like to call it that starts off \\"You're Just a sinner I am told. Be your fire when you're cold...\\" Couple all of this with an infectiuos melody and rythym and you have a classic. Please, go back and REALLY listen to this song. You will appreciate more. Baby I'm A Star: Prince saw his own future when he wrote this one. Yes you are a star my friend. The song itself is just pure hard rockin' R&B/rock, and a joy to hear. In the movie this was the last song, which was fitting the way the movie played out. On the album it's followed by....Purple Rain: One of the original \\"wave your cigarette lighter to the rythym\\" songs and maybe still the best. It's a bonafide rock 'n roll anthem. Prince does one of his best guitar solos in this one too. This is also another example of how the album is superior to the movie. On the album, after the main part of the song is done, Prince ends it with a very weird and mornful string violin coda that goes on for about 2 or so minutes. It helps the album stay consistant with the frustration felt throughout it. Had it ended with happy go lucky \\"Star\\" it would have made it a completely different album. The only album that has a closing song to compare to this one is Sign O' The Times' Adore. Although I feel \\"Sign\\" is Princes best effort, Purple Rain was a journey I'm glad I didn't miss. Thank you Prince for showering us, no DRENCHING us in your purple reign.
B000002J1U|5.0|This album is yet another Zeppelin masterpiece with classics like 'Since I've Been Loving You' and especially 'Immigrant Song'. This ranks at #4 on the greatest Led Zeppelin albums right behind II (3), IV (2) and Physical Graffiti (1). This album was not as good as the previous one (II) and not as good as the one that would follow (IV) but it was still a great album that any hard rock fan should own. Robert Plants majestic, high and low pitched voice made this album very pleasent to listen to while your doing homework and such. Jimmy Pages riffs made the album have a lot of kick to it and his solos are lyable to blow your mind. Need I say anything about John (The Sledgehammer) Bonham? He was the first great drummer with his Led foot and his pretty good hand drumming too. John Paul Jones is also a very important member, he makes some of the best basslines to go with Jimmys riffs and Roberts voice. Overall this is not Zeppelins best but its still worth every peeny if not more.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|This movie is by far a really good gangster movie with alot of good performances from all the actors.  Its shows a look into the rise and fall of a gangster, how one minute you can have it all and the next colombians are kicking down your door and shooting at you.  The movie has some really great shots, and the special features are great.  The only reason that I gave it four stars out of five is because at times it gets a little boring.  But overall I think its one of the best and memorable gangster movies around.  But it is by far not the best.  I do recommend this to people who love gangster movies (like myself) and who love good pacino movies.  One thing I love about this movie apart from its great director, producer, actor, and screenwriter, is the great scenes and moments in this movie.  Such as the ending and the babylon club shootout.  Anyway, great gangster movie, check it out.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I'm not going to go into details of the story, so there won't be any spoilers here. Let's just say that I'm highly disappointed in the changes that were made, for the sake of movie making. If LotR fans thought Peter Jackson beat up Tolkien, then Wolfang Petersen slaughtered Homer and left his body for the vultures. <br /> <br />The Bean Factor: Kudos to Sean Bean for being the perfect Odysseus. Smart, cunning, sympathetic and one of the most human characters portrayed. Although his part was much smaller than I, among many, would have liked, he was brilliant. <br /> <br />The Pitt Factor: I've never been a big fan of Brad Pitt, but I have to say this movie has certainly changed my mind. Not only did he look incredible, but his performance was quite good. I honestly didn't think he was quite that capable. <br /> <br />The Bloom Factor: There's been a lot of Orlando bashing since this movie came out, and again, I've never been a huge fan of his, but I honestly think he was perfect for the role. If anyone had read the book, (which I doubt most of the pre-teen squeeling movie viewers I was *fortunate enough* to be viewing this with, had) they would know that Paris was weak and basically spineless. Bloom played the part well. I certainly had no sympathy for his character, just as I hadn't when reading The Iliad. <br /> <br />The O'Toole, Cox and Gleeson Factor: Watching these three veterans was a joy. The played their parts to absolute perfection. I was mesmerized watching them on the screen. Masters, pure and simple. <br /> <br />The Women of Troy: No stand-outs here. I thought Diane Kruger's performance as Helen was flat. Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Andromache was pretty good. Rose Byrne as Briseis was probably the best, as her part was a little meatier than the others.  <br /> <br />Last but not least, The Bana Factor: All I can say is WOW! Eric Bana was absolutely brilliant as Hector. He played the part perfectly. A soldier with a conscience, pride, loyalty, valor,honor, sympathy and even grace. The scenes between he and Peter O'Toole were magnificent, and made me want for more. There is no doubt in my mind that his was the stand-out performance of the movie. <br /> <br />The cinematography and special effects were good. Not great, but good. I found the soundtrack to be very distracting. It was decent at times, but for the most part was overdone, almost as if they were using the music to carry portions of the movie, instead of supporting or enhancing it.  <br /> <br />I went to this movie to be entertained, and although I'm not sure if it was the overall audience distraction factor, or the fact that there was just so much I didn't like, that I found myself actually critiquing the movie instead of enjoying it. (I NEVER do that on a first viewing.)  <br /> <br />But, please, please, buy the film. The individual performances more than make up for the movies' (Petersen's) shortcomings. Based on that, on a scale of 1 to 5, I give the writers and director a 2, the acting a 5, for an overall 3 1/2. <br />
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is an excellent book that not only has one inparticular moral or meaning, but many that can be interpreted differently. It's also a quick read that I wish was longer!! I enjoyed the complexity of characters like Jonas, and the Giver as well as the simplicity of characters like Asher, and Jonas's mom and dad. It is a very interesting story; the very setting of this story drew me into it as well as the actual content of the book. It is amazing how much intelligent well though through information they put in this book. At first the book may seem a bit strange, but if you keep reading it becomes relatable in some way to our own lives. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, quick read. Also to anyone who enjoys books that make you think!! If you don't get into it right away hang in there the endings the best part!!
B000002JS0|5.0|I dont know why everyone was bashing this work of art when it first came out but its clear to me that this revealed that AC\DC was here to stay. This is above anything else one of the best debuts I've ever had the forune to listen to. 'Its a Long way to the top' is enough of a reason for you to buy this but thats by far not the only good song here. 'TNT' and 'Live Wire' are also both two great songs on this album and are definately worth recognizing. Every song here is great. Angus and Malcolm Young are one of the best duos on guitar and Bon Scotts high pitched voice and raunchy lyrics are superior in almost every way. Cliff Williams bass playing is awesome too, he provides a great rhythem in every song. I'm not sure if Phil Rudd drummed on this one but if he did he has done some pretty sweet work. Overall this is a great album that will find a home in any hard rock fans collection.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Reservations aside about the reworking of the \\"Holy Grail\\" of movie making of all time. (many have tried but none ever had the generational impact as Star Wars, expect Indy to a degree). The Star Wars Trilogy has never looked and sounded better, do to the advancements in digital technology. Not even seven let alone 27 years ago were such a gorgeous transfer and near perfect mastering (from the original master print) available. This DVD is one example of the positive aspects of the digital revolution. (some would say Episode II is the negative) In any fashion this Trilogy is well worth the price of admission, even the updated expanded (CGI) scenes play better than the last \\"special edition\\" release. Some have explained their dissatisfaction with the \\"special edition release\\" but most are confusing real critical objections with nostalgia. Let's face it. These movies play mostly to the thritysomething plus generation and the retrospect feelings of children of the 1970s (don't screw with my childhood objection) then the real dislike of George Lucas trying to improve his movies, which in this release he does. The only objection here is disc four, where an \\"official history\\" has been created for future generations, but once again these are Uncle George's (any man who has such an impact on an individual generation has got to be an uncle) movies and he can do anything he wants with them. Well...almost, the other \\"TWO\\" are forgettable and that has nothing to do with the \\"childhood objection\\" they're just BAD but he's still Uncle George's. 10 out of 12 ain't bad. ( I liked Howard the Duck!)

B000002KB8|5.0|Wow, its been a while since I wrote a Sabbath review, lets see...I wrote one for 'Paranoid' on my seventh review and I'm pretty sure this ones 41. Sorry about the wait Sabbath fans but now I'm ready to tell about a great album. <br />   Although this has only five tracks its still worth the money. Hell the song 'Black Sabbath' should be enough to make you buy this but if you want more reasons then read on. Other great songs include 'NIB' and 'Wizard', the five songs on here are all great but I still think they could have made more. Ozzy introduces his great array of vocal talent here and combined with Tony Iommis guitar riffs and solos it makes one album you cant afford to be without. The rhythem is very well made as well. Geezer Butler demonstrates some of the fastest and most complex bass playing I have ever heard. Bill Wards drumming is also worth noting, he certainly knew what he was doing. Great album, buy it now!
B0000E2FLC|5.0|this is a great live dvd. i love it its rips the speakers in half. i have been watching it at least twice a week. you cant go worng when you get into ac/dc to me they are the greatest har rock band of all time. all i can say is wow what a great dvd.
0582419379|1.0|Read a few chapters, found it boring and so I gave up on it. (DNF)
B000089RV6|5.0|this is just an awsome album by the ac/dc band. the boys really show us how to rock on this one. and its one bon would have been proud of. back in black just hits the heart- when thinking of bon scotts memory. and this album was in memory of bon scott not just a song here a song there but everyone of them. now i have heard it said. and i have read many times before. that bon scott and ac/dc tourd together with geordie- brian johnson's pree ac/dc band. and bon loved brians voice so much he himself said the boys of acdc that if anything happend to him he would want brian johnson to take the lead. well we all know what happend next. so i do think this album is one that is still as good as the day it first came out if not more. and again i think bon would be very proud of this album and of ac/dc them selfs for carrying on. and proud of brian as well.

B00005OAIE|1.0|I bought this Cd when it was at its \\"introductory $6.99 new artist\\" price(ironically, it was his SECOND cd album!) - where it remained for several months till it was elevated to $12.99...DUNNO WHY...he's NOT the new \\"JAMES TAYLOR\\" as has been implied - JAMES TAYLOR is still kicking ass as a recording artist(thirty some odd years later!) and no one else can ever top him in his genre...JOHN, enjoy your fame while it lasts! Your Grammy was awarded only because you topped the heap of boring, indifferent and aimless artists the season this Cd was issued. You'll be history soon...your music is SO BLAND. JAMES TAYLOR won a GRAMMY too, and he's the REAL ORIGINAL!

B000063UR2|4.0|Scott's \\"Legend\\" is a capable rendering of a romantic, mythic story. It has unicorns, fairies, a prince (not The Prince) of darkness, a man of the wild wood and of kind heart. They all come together in a well made story.<br /><br />The sets and effects stand up to the standards of 1985. The elves, fairies, and trolls are good, though they lack Henson's genius. Tom Cruise is young and handsome, with the emphasis on young. Tim Curry (aka Dr. Frank-N-Furter) is buried in his evil character - the character is good, but with that getup, it could have been almost anyone in there.<br /><br />The story comes together, the characters come together, the effects are effective. Somehow, though, the total seems less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I like it. I'll watch it again. It's good - it's just not brilliant. Given that Scott also directed Alien, I hoped for more.<br /><br />Some scenes suggest real violence, but only suggest. Unless your little ones are skittish, I'd call it kid-safe.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0002TT0NM|4.0|\\"Something wicked this way comes!\\" sings the Hogwarts Choir and indeed, something wicked is coming for Harry Potter!<br /><br />After a falling out with the Dursleys, Harry is on his own, for a while, but strange things happen.  He is menaced by what looks like a wolf, the arrival of a magic bus is the only thing that saves him.  Worse still, the train to Hogwarts is stopped and searched by monstrous \\"Dementors\\", black-cloaked creatures who are ruthlessly hunting Sirius Black, a fugitive from the feard Azkaban prison.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Harry is introduced to the mysterious Professor Lupin, who teaches him how to fight the evil Dementors.  He must help Hagrid save the beloved hippogriff, Buckbeak, from slaughter.  Finally, he learns of the dangerous Sirius Black, responsible for the death of his parents.  How will he deal with the killer?  The Dementors?  Poor Buckbeak?<br /><br />The Prisoner of Azkaban has a darker, different feel to it than the previous movies, but that does not work against it.  The children are older, as such their challenges must be greater, more sinister.  The actors hold their own, the special effects are superb.<br /><br />SOMETHING WONDERFUL THIS MOVIE IS!!!!

0515123447|4.0|Jack Reacher is a guy you want on your side.  The is filled with serious action, violence, and crazy plot twists that actually hold together.  Child's writing style takes some getting used to...it is filled with short sentences, but not quite in the style of James Ellroy...it is rata-tat-tat.   Still, something is missing...what I just can't put my finger on.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I've never seen anything so cleverly edited to present only one side of issues. The total goal of this film is to totally distort facts to impune our President. Anyone who sees this film and allows their opinion to be influenced is foolish. Mr Moore has a vendetta against Mr. Bush and will do or say anything to bring him down. I cannot recommend such a destructive and one sided film.
6304493681|4.0|I just saw \\"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\\" over the weekend and absolutely loved the movie. I saw it after seeing a trailer for the film when I went to another movie last month. I loved the combination of traditional Japanese animation and computer generated images. The imagery was nothing short of stunning. So I knew I had to see the original \\"Ghost in the Shell\\". I found myself enjoying this movie immensely but next time, I will set the movie to Japanese w/English subtitles. The english was kinda made the film cheesy. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed watching Motoko Kusanagi (a/k/a The Major) and her companions who are also in the sequel search for the mysterious Puppet Master who is this superhacker. Yes this film is confusing at least for this manga newbie however I still enjoyed watching it and managed to keep track (somewhat) of what the characters were doing. I personally enjoyed the music to this movie. I wasn't bothered by the Japanese singing. My only one regret is not seeing this in the theater like I did with the sequel and see/hear this film surround sound. I also saw where \\"The Matrix\\" copped some of its ideas from which I find rather disappointing because it shows lack of inventiveness when you take something unique and original like what I saw in this movie and turn it into some overproduced, overhyped crudfest like \\"The Matrix\\". The bonus features on the dvd like the half-hour documentary of the making of \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" was cool. I found it fascinating to see how the film was put together and the amount of work the artists invested their time in. Although I don't consider myself a fan of anime, I could really see myself getting into this type of anime. I think \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" really elevated animation in general to new levels.
B0002BO0AS|1.0|The Stings of Conscience RULED.  It is one of the best hardcore/ metal cds around, still a classic for me.  That said, I was disappointed with this album.  I would probably give it a 3 but it has gotten so many 5's that it doesn't deserve.  SOC was an original, powerful, brutally awesome cd.  This is cliche.  They have injected every song with your stereotypical in flames melodic riff.  God, another hardcore meets In Flames band.  As if there aren't enough already.  There are a number of parts on this album that sound like KSE for god's sake. Of course, Unearth sacrifices their originality and power for trendy metalcore riffs, and what do you expect happens?  They get way more popular.  What is that called, people?  You got it, selling out.  Selling out is NOT when a heavy band gets soft.  Selling out is when a band changes their style to suit whatever trend is currently big.  Exactly what Unearth has done. I saw them last night, and the highpoints of the show were DEFINITELY when they played My Heart Bleeds No Longer, Only the People, and One Step Away.  Classics.  This album yields zero classics.   <br /> <br />Yes, the playing is superb, but they have become way too melodically trendy.  Not that this is a bad album, but just please, please don't neglect the Stings Of Conscious, a true hardcore/ metal masterpiece.  No originality on this one.
6305313687|4.0|It's probably not surprising that so young an actor as Edward Norton did not get an Oscar for his riveting performance in AMERICAN HISTORY X back in 1998.  Actors in the 20s, usually get passed over on the assumption that they've got plenty of time to prove themselves over the course of their careers.  (I believe Adrien Brody's recent win for THE PIANIST made him the youngest winner ever--and he was pushing 30 by that point.)  Of course, cinema historians may find Norton's loss to the now somewhat discredited Roberto Benigni particularly galling (at least give it to Nolte or McKellan who were also up for the award that year--but Benigni fever, however benign it was, was running rampant that year and dictated otherwise). <br /> <br />Norton's performance, as is generally acknowledged, is a tour-de-force.  Aside from his age, the other thing that worked against him as far as recognition from the Academy goes was the disturbing nature of the film.  Many reviewers have noted that the very articulateness with which Norton's character Derek expounds his racist views is downright scary.  One cannot dismiss him--as one can with nearly all of his neo-Nazi colleagues--as a complete ignoramus.  Even the supposedly canny and diabolically charismatic group leader, Cameron (Stacy Keach) is pretty much a cypher.  At the very least, Keach needed more screen time to establish why he was able to exert such a hold over Venice Beach's alienated white youth.  Do such groups really rely on middle aged Nazi gurus for inspiration?   <br /> <br />The failure to develop Keach's character is only one of many dramatic flaws--many of which have been detailed by other reviewers below and elsewhere.  The relatively short term (three years) that Derek serves in prison seems unlikely.  His in-prison conversion, mainly through the influence of a black inmate who befriends, him is certainly plausible, but also a little cliched.  The outreach efforts of a former teacher, also African-American, rings abit truer but is also a bit dramatically suspect.  Finally, one could argue that someone as intelligent as Derek would not be so quick to reveal his change of heart to potentially dangerous former colleagues without first having made some provisions for his family's and his own safety and security. <br /> <br />In short, there are gaps in the plot that you could drive a semi through.  That does not make the film--and Norton's performance--anything less than gripping, however.  The film's ending, which some may find a bit heavy handed, at least serves to remind the viewer that neither Derek's moral transformation not that of his younger brother (which Derek has begun to help effect) can prevent tragedy.  It is a final, powerful reminder that the cycle of hate is nearly impossible to break. <br /> <br />For those who might be doing some programming or who simply like to do their own in-house double bills, consider running this film along with Mathieu Kassovitz's equally hard hitting HATE (LA HAINE). <br />
B000001DYA|3.0|would you believe blue cheer invented heavy metal and paved the way for led zeppelin? no. how about invented heavy metal and paved the way for grand funk railroad? very loud. very crude. absolutely no soul. even on blues classics like rock me baby and parchment farm. was this the start of heavy metal and punk? maybe.  drooling idiots should add 2 stars.
B00005JNEI|3.0|I wholeheartedly support the release of this DVD. In an artful manner, Mr Moore poses a new perspective on the policies of the present Bush regime. even though some of the material presented is a bit exaggerated and extreme, I suggest everyone to view this before voting in November, and I suggest you view it before your freedom to do so is taken away!
B0002OERI0|5.0|ce cd est super bon les tunes sont toutes diffrentes mais suivent aussi une ligne conductrice. Billy Joe est tjours aussi bon pour crire des textes sur des thmes qui touchent tlm.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I was more than moved by this film. Sitting alone in an empty cinema, I thought to myself, 'Can someone love another so much, that life would be easier having never known them than knowing and losing them?'  <br /> <br />Sadly, I later learned that such love and heartbreak does exist. It's almost enough to make one forever fear falling in love. <br /> <br />And though I love this movie... I'm anxious about the upcoming DVD release. I feel it's so personal and beautiful that I must own it, yet I'm not certain I could handle watching it again after my experience. I know it might possibly make me feel better, but knowing that it may make me feel worse is too much of a risk, for the sake of my own mental tonacity.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|This album is so diversified and so good. I can't stop listening it. The lyrics and the beat are so deep and perfect. This is real punk not pop like simple plan. They keep the power and the freshness of their first album but they grown so it's one of their best c-d.
B00003CXRP|3.0|This started out to be a good, regular movie -- and Tom Hanks was a handsome administrator of a nationally known company.  The scene in Russia was fabulous with his proving his point that it takes much too long to deliver packages long distance, or here in America.  He's an excellent actor, but as the movie progressed he regressed into a savage from a jungle.  Not just the ultimate survivor on an isolated island somewhere no one else ever comes near. <br /> <br />I kept wanting some of the Gilligan's Island silliness to intervene with his deterioration mentally.  \\"Wilson\\" was the substitute for a real companion, yet only a volleyball gone astray. <br /> <br />When I saw it was FedEx featured in this film, it delighted me as several weeks ago I wrote to the owner of a local radio station that maybe he'd never heard of FedEx.  It was taking too long to get a part for the transmitter for his station which aired \\"Music Of Your Life\\" network.  A few months previously, the same part was needed after a storm struck the antenna and it was 2 months or more before the network was back on local airwaves.  This time, the part apparently was never ordered.  So my reference to FedEx was not impressive to him as he owns a large sports equipment company in Nashville.  No FedEx for him! <br /> <br />The preview to becoming a castaway was entertainment par excellence.  Afterward, however, his character becomes a mental case and it was not easy to watch.  Surely no place could be that isolated so as not to even have birds or animals, only a small type of fish and a scorpion which he ate -- showing he is the ultimate survivor. <br /> <br />If he'd been stranded in Iceland or the North Pole, the story might have been believable, but on a beautiful island in the middle of nowhere was just too much. <br /> <br />Thank goodness, he switched to playing character actors after that ordeal which suits him better anyway, for he is a good actor.  The movie itself was not much and very little dialogue which made it almost like watching a silent movie from the olden days with the exceptions of his grunts and guttural 'help's.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening to this non stop (I'm listening to it right now in fact) ever since I got it.  Now, don't think I'm a poser, I bought my first GD album when i was five, but I honestly didn't think Billie Joe was smart enough to write lyrics that are this deep.  Until now.  The whole album is the best representation of the state of our country I've heard in the past four years (and all in under 60 minutes!).  What's genius about it is the integrity of the music doesn't get watered down by the politics at all.  The lyrics are incredible, entire songs can be quoted. And while it is a concept album, songs like She's a Rebel and St. Jimmy wouldn't sound entirely out of place on Dookie.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I understood Lucas' interest in trying to add in scenes in 1997 that he just couldn't get completed with 1977 technology.  I didn't exactly agree with it, but I thought it would be interesting to see how he could make it work, and whether it would add more depth to what were already amazing movies. <br /> <br />The additions didn't add anything.  And some of the changes were distracting. <br /> <br />Now, the entire trilogy has literally been butchered in the name of \\"perfection.\\" <br /> <br />I'm not a die-hard Star Wars fan.  I loved the movies growing up-- they're part of my childhood.  I could care less about exactly how fast the Millenium Falcon can go or how many worlds were affected by the Imperial Senate. <br /> <br />BUT... there's a point where messing around with a film just obliterates what was so special about it in the first place-- and Lucas has now done that with his original three films.  One of the beauties of Star Wars were how the special effects turned out-- for their day, they were amazing.  Rather than throw CGI into it (that have honestly looked so fake that it makes scenes laughable), marvel at the complexity of models and hand-made special effects.  Celebrate the achievement that Star Wars WAS.  It won the Oscar for special effects-- the hard work that has now been taken over by poor CGI all for the sake of Lucas' \\"perfection.\\" <br /> <br />Now I just need to figure out how to get my VHS copies of the trilogy into some digital form before they become unplayable-- because these new, doctored versions are simply unwatchable for anyone who enjoyed the movies as a child. <br /> <br />Rated 1 star out of 5-- the only star being given for restoring the color of the original picture.
B00005JMYI|5.0|...because all we're doing is giving our humble opinions about this and many other movies.  Though, there are some who want ya'll to think of this movie like they do.  Not me.  But, I will say what I thought of it.  IT WAS SO DAMN FUNNY!  Whoever the hell said it was trying too hard is a damn fool. <br /> <br />So, like I said, we're just giving out humble opinions. =)Enjoy.
0553573403|5.0|I only recently discovered George r.r. Martin's writing after reading the Hedge Knight. I wasn't sure what to expect, probably a fantasy novel filled with heroes, magic, faeries, and talking trees. Well, to my suprise, i couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />  Martin's characters can not be described as heroes, and magic is mostly talked about more than actually performed. But what Martin does is write about people that you care about. Whether you hate them or love them, you get a good understanding of them and when Martin does something unexpectedly, it can be upsetting. But you keep reading because the story has enraptured you.<br /><br />  The lack of magic and inclusion of sex and gore may bother some, but this book is not for young audiences. As for the sex, Martin's descriptions get more graphic in the next two novels. As for Game Of Thrones, it is filled with backstabbing and double dealing in a world where no one can be trusted.<br /><br />  Throughout the three novels Martin introduces hundreds of characters, family histories and their hereldry. At times you may start to feel overwhelmed, but you always manage to understand who everybody is and what side their on. These rich histories are what help bring the world alive.<br /><br />  Overall I recommend all three books, but i believe that Game of Thrones is the best of the three.
B0000251W2|5.0|In my humble opinion - this truly is the greatest studio album, Maiden have ever produced (rivalled only by Piece of mind) - and i own all but 2 studio albums (Brave new world, and X factor) I am a big fan of Maiden's earlier work - pre 1990's - and for me this album is the epitemy of Iron Maiden's greatness - it combines technical brilliance - with fast, catchy metal riffs. songs like Caught somewhere in time, and Heaven can wait are great examples of what Maiden can do. This album also produces some brilliant but less typival iron maiden songs like Sea of madness and Wasted Years. A must own for any Iron Maiden fan
B00000JCOV|5.0|Good from start to finish.  Wait and Bleed, Sic, Eyeless, Surfacing, Spit It Out, No Life, Diluted, Liberate, all tracks that I'll never get sick of.  I'm an easy listener, therefore, I won't recommend this to anyone.  I like anything and everything.  If you like the obvious Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Mudvayne then you should have no problem with this.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I found this CD to be very moving, and the beats + rythms are exceptionally unique - HOWEVER, I must agree to the other reviews. What happened? 0_0; Her hair is blond, and she looks like Britney Spears... o_o; My favorite 2 songs were Whenever, Wherever and Objection(Tango), but when I saw Whenever, Wherever's music video I couldn't believe what they were making her do.... ! The video was entirly about her trying to show off her body, and the sleezy producers trying to turn her into Britney. x.x I found that rather disturbing and sad.<br /><br />She has a great voice, unique style, and the only thing bothering me are the Music Videos and the Fact she is now a blondy over her usual Burnette color.<br /><br />Think about it - When you were little, about 10 years old or so, did YOU like seeing people that showed off there body just to<br />A. Make Money<br />B. Impress People &#62;.&#62;<br />(*cough*Music Videos*cough*)? More into thought, how do think Shakira would feel? If Shakira were 10 years old, and could see the music video clip she would be making in the future, she most probably wouldn't be sitting there saying, &#34;WOW! That is SO cool!&#34; Well... Would you? I know if I were 10 the LEAST thing I would want to be doing is seeing the product of such nonsense. (Am I getting over detailed? 0.0;) IN fact, I bet Shakira wouldn't like the videos - if she knew what was soon to become of herself it would kill her spirit - well, at least it would mine if it were me up there... &#62;.&#60;<br /><br />Sorry about my ramblings .... it was something I had to share... xD<br /><br />Anyways, the CD is great, I DO suggest it, and if you put aside the cover of the case, and her video's I think most would agree this is a great item to own ^^
B000002J09|5.0|A great album from start to finish! No song is bad. Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest bands ever to play music. I'm sure if it weren't for John Bonham's tragic death they'd still be playing! This is one of Zeppelin's many classic albums and should be owned by any fan of Rock and Roll. Overrated? Hell, no. People love it for what it is, a great album of great songs. some reviewers said it was overrated (and thats their opinion and everthing) but its not. It may be the most popular zep album ever but that does not make it worse than the rest! Its a totally awesome collection of tracks! <br /> <br />Now for the fun part: rate the members: <br />Robert Plant: An amazing vocalist who never lets me down. <br />Jimmy Page: An terrific guitarist, the only better is Jimi Hendrix! <br />John Paul Jones: The most underrated musician on the whole freakin' planet! The master of amazing bass! <br />John Bonham (RIP): The best drummer of all time (in my opinion)! <br /> <br />
0800141660|4.0|When I first saw this movie after I read the novel, I was disappointed. I know that screenwriters are often forced to leave out scenes and details in adapting a novel--this movie would have to be a mini-series if Emma Thompson hadn't done some trimming. But what I didn't understand was why Thompson (whom I've always liked) ADDED scenes and subplots, made changes that didn't seem to save time or add clarity, and eliminated at least one semi-important character (the elder Ms. Steele) wholesale. <br /> <br />Still, there's no denying it's an excellent movie, from the art direction and costumes to Thompson's crafting dialogue that sounds as though it's direct from Austen's pen. <br /> <br />I've found the movie grows on me, though. This was especially true after I watched this DVD version with the commentary track by Thompson and producer Lindsey Doran. Yes, this is an unabashed chick flick, and I found the all-chick commentary refreshingly casual and well-informed (and relatively free of the usual self-congratulatory tones). Thompson's obvious familiarity with and appreciation for Austen's work (as well as her knowledge of the social conditions--such as limited options for women--of Austen's time) slowly made me forgive and understand her changes. <br /> <br />As for the acting, I don't think it could be better: Thompson, Alan Rickman, Kate Winslett, and even Hugh Grant were all great. But I also had a gripe with Thompson and Grant being so much older than their characters are in the book (19 and 23 respectively). This gripe isn't cosmetic or ageist. It's clear that Thompson and Grant are both in their thirties in the movie. This implies more knowledge about life and love than ages 19 and 23. One could say Elinor is always mature for her age, but the irony of how mature she has to be for her age is somehwat lost when the actress playing her (even when playing her very well) is so much older than the character. On the upside, Elizabeth Spriggs is an absolute delight asMrs. Jennings. <br /> <br />If you feel Thompson's taken too many liberties with her screenplay, view the movie with her commentary; if it doesn't make complete amends, it should at least console you.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|**spoilers below**<br /><br />I laughed out loud in the theatre when Kate Beckinsale died.  It was so badly scripted and acted, and oohhhh so predictible.<br /><br />Two stars because Dracula's brides were the bomb...and that scene when the three of them descended upon the town was killer.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Man, this is a cool album.  My favorite tunes are \\"Holiday\\" and \\"We Are The Waiting\\".  However, every time I listen to it I add another one to my favorites list.  The whole thing is really good.   <br />One thing I've noticed in reading some of the reviews on other sites is that people want to draw a line and say that all of the Green Day albums prior to this one are the immature, \\"punk\\" Green Day, and that this one is the new, evolved, \\"mature\\" Green Day.  One professional reviewer (I don't remember the paper) commented that, with this release, Green Day has, \\"Stopped pretending they don't care.\\"  Of course, there are obvious signs of evolution on this record (the use of additional instruments, the \\"rock opera\\" format\\").  But I don't think that the essential message that the band is conveying here is much different than it ever has been.  A lot of critics have charactrerized Green Day, and the punk pop bands they have spawned (like Sum 41) as apathetic, immature, and resigned to failure.  But I don't think this posture should be taken so literally.  I have always seen it as a statement; as a way of expressing frustration, disenchantment, and maybe hopelessness.  These are all valid feelings, and I don't think there is anything particularly \\"immature\\" about them.  Billy Joe Armstrong has always laid it all bare.  As if to say, \\"Yeah, I'm afraid, insecure, indecisive, confused, and self-absorbed, but I don't know what to do about it except to tell it like it is, and maybe make fun of it a little\\"  I've always considered this kind of vulnerability to be way cool.  I think what the band has done on American Idiot is adopt the \\"rock opera\\" form, and the inherent drama that it contains, in order to kick it all up a notch.  This is entirely appropriate considering the times we live in.  We no longer live in a benevolent country, and anyone with half a heart feels like they might get it crushed.  You've got to kick it up a notch if you want to be heard, even if it is a little melodramatic.       <br />
B0006284JQ|4.0|Wow this album is worth buying!! But im pretty sure it won't be a big seller tho. I don't think she has don enough songs to release this album. I think she should have added 2 other hits, \\"FROM THE BATTOM OF MY BROKEN HEART\\"and \\"DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW\\"
B00013BN4S|5.0|Back in the early seventies when my friends and I were sorta hippie, sorta bluesy, sorta blue-grass...all long-haired and raggamuffinish...we chanced to attend a Merle Haggard concert<br /><br />(imagine, if you will, 4 california not-quite-post-hippie teenagers, rockin out to the strains of \\"We don't smoke marijuana in...\\")...the opening act was a tiny little woman with a HUGE voice...thus we were introduced to Emmylou Harris.<br /><br />After that, every time she came out with an album (umm-hmm, vinyl) we got it. The harmonies alone are priceless.<br /><br />On the morning of 9-11, as i sat watching to horror show that was the news, and calling friends just to touch base with fellow humans...the words to Pieces of the Sky kept filling my ears:<br /><br />\\"what if pieces of the sky were falling<br /><br />in your neighbors yard<br /><br />but not on you?\\"
068987474X|3.0|I saw the author on Oprah's show last week.  The one thing I disagree with him on the show, was the comment he made, \\"Men need to raise their game when they find that special lady.\\"  And? And? <br /> <br />In my opinion, \\"ladies need to raise their game too, if they want that special man to be into them.\\"  I am a business owner who finds it difficult to find a mate, because women say I talk about business too much (I do make time to date and talk about other things).  If the ladies I dated raised their game to learn about building businesses too, them perhaps I would be into them.  This is why for me it has been difficult in finding a mate.  It is really going to be more difficult, once more success comes, because I am not going to be able to trust ladies, because they would only want my wealth.  Wake up ladies, there are plenty of good men like myself who are out here looking for a mate.   <br /> <br />The author does makes some good points, but this stuff is common sense.  Ladies, here is a tip if you want your relationship with a man to work (this only works for men who have a vision): be open minded and join our vision, so we can join your vision. 'Nuff Said!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just got this cd on friday from Amazon, and I would have to say its the best Green Day that they've ever made.  Its pretty cool that there's two songs in the cd that have different songs inside of the song.  Sounds weird but you'll have to check it out to figure out what I'm saying.  The only thing I wished they did differently was add some better bonus features.....all it is a link to buy ringtones.  All in all get this cd its by far the best cd I've bought this year.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This was the last Foo album I bought, and I'm glad this one was last. I saved one of the best til last. This album slightly changes the sound, compared to their debut. This album sounds like their debut, only not as raw, but a lot heavier. <br /> <br />The album starts of with \\"Doll\\" which is obvoiusly an intro song, as it's only 1:20 long. It's a very soft song, sang very well. Then we get to \\"Monkey wrench\\" which suddenly appears out of nowhere. It's a very fast-paced song, very punky, and poppy. At the bridge of this song, Dave screams a load of lyrics for about a minute and doesn't stop to take a breath. The next song is \\"Hey, Johnny Park\\" which is one of my favorites. It's slightly like something of Nirvana's In utero album. The verses are kinda soft and the chorus is load and grungy. \\"My poor brain\\" is very similar to Johnny park , but slightly less grungy and more catchy. \\"Wind up\\" gets the album heavier, as it has lots of screaming by Dave and it's quite punky again too. \\"Up in arms\\"... this song starts off slow, but then it instantly rolls off with great fast drumming and into another fast song, but this is more of a pop-rock song. \\"My hero\\" is the classic of the album. I guess everyone knows who it's about. I don't really know what to say about this, accept it's the best on the album by far. The darkest song. Listen to it! \\"See you\\" is not a very popular track with others, but I quite like it. It lightens the album up a little bit after \\"My hero\\". It's more like a country/western song or something. \\"Enough space\\" is a lot like wind up. There's lots of screaming again, but it's quite an irratating track. \\"February stars\\" is one of the softest on the album. It takes a little time to get used to, but you'll like it sooner or later. For 3/4 of the song it's soft until the last quarter when Dave repeteadly starts shouting \\"February stars, floating inthe dark\\". One of the greatest Foo songs, \\"Everlong\\", is the second best on this album. Great guitar riffs, extremely catchy... and if you thought the video for \\"Learn to fly\\" was weird, you need to see the \\"Everlong\\" video! \\"Waling after you\\" is the softest song on the album by far. It's a really beautiful acoustic song, which may take time to get into also. Finally \\"New way home\\" ends the album. It's one of my least favourites, but it's quite good. It's quite a fun, fast song, but it gets broing to quickly. <br /> <br />I still think their debut album is their best one, but this is second place. If you want to hear their more heavy grunge stuff then get this, or if you want their more poppy grunge, get their debut.
B00005JMH2|4.0|Remakes of successful movies run tremendous risks of comparisons, of rattling the cages of 'purists', of losing the original intent for the sake of making the remake look 'new'.  Director Peter Chelsom appears to have all the right ingredients and the right motivation to transcribe the delightfully thoughtful Japanese original film into an American statement: he maintains the core idea of loneliness in the business of living in a big city (here, Chicago), the desire for 'something more' in the life of a successful, supposed-to-be-happy businessman (here, John Clark, a good probate lawyer who ties up people's lives and asks 'well, is there anything else?') in a good marriage to a good woman more concerned with her own career and the intricacies of raising their teenagers than communicating tenderness to her husband, a forlorn dancer-turned-teacher in private pain from a lost love affair, and various people trying to find some surrogate for happiness and subjugate that urge by settling on a diversion of Ballroom Dancing.  For this film Chelsom has gathered some superb actors:  Richard Gere as John Clark understands the inner disquiet he feels as his commuter train passes by the window of Miss Mitzi's Dance Class where stands Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) gazing into the emptiness that her world has become.  Susan Sarandon completely inhabits her role as John's wife, so convinced that all is right with her marriage that when fellow workers discuss marital infidelity she engages the help of a detective and his able assistant (Richard Jenkins and Nick Cannon) to see if she is a possible victim.  John follows an impulse and begins dance lessons at Miss Mitzi's (Mitzi is portrayed by the very talented and underused Anita Gillette) along with two other men (Bobby Cannavale of 'The Station Agent' and Omar Benson Miller) both of whom have private reasons for wanting to learn the frivolity of ballroom dancing. Also involved in the dance class are Bobbie (in a powerful cameo by Lisa Ann Walter) and Stanley Tucci (a co-worker in John's firm who is dancing in macho secret).<br /><br />So why with all of this intact does this film not content itself to be an adult drama about 21st century isolation and loneliness and the need for belonging?  For this viewer (who incidentally liked the film very much) the addition of slapstick (wigs for Tucci, homophobic comments ad infinitum, overplayed talent show antics, etc) lowers the beauty of an otherwise very tender story.  Gere and Lopez dance beautifully and have a special relationship much like the original, but the two have so little screen time together that this important potential transition suffers: the magic goes wanting. Sarandan, Tucci, Gillette, Cannavale, Miller, Jenkins, Cannon, and especially Lisa Ann Walter just burn up the floor - they are all that good. The ending is somewhat predictable but plays out well in Chelsom's hands. Since this review is based on a preview screening there is still a chance that judicious editing can tidy up the shtick and allow this very good film to breathe as it should.Ann Walter) and Stanley Tucci (a co-worker in John's firm who is dancing in macho secret). <br /> <br />So why with all of this intact does this film not content itself to be an adult drama about 21st century isolation and loneliness and the need for belonging?

B0001AP12G|5.0|Top hip-hop album of the year, Kanye West shows no disappointment with his freshman album titled \\"College Dropout\\". 20 released tracks on his album, it is all real no fake bullsh*t that 95% of rappers say they went through to gain street credit. He's not claiming to be gangsta, not claiming to have gotten shot 9 times and actually lived, he's telling you what really went down in his life. \\"With Through The Wire\\" he states the obvious that he got into a car accident so bad that he got his mouth wired shut. Remarkably he still went to the studio and rapped while he still had wires in his mouth (even Pharrell Williams couldn't believe it). The highly controversial song \\"Jesus Walks\\" is a hot single (thank god radio played this, it needed to be stated) and even have gospel shows airing his video. He has diverse songs in his album, not all straight hip-hop but even club mixes as we can tell from \\"The New Work-Out Plan\\". Kanye is not only a producer and a rapper, but a far more true artist that we will see for years to come.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love these films and am a fan yada, yada, yada..., But why did George feel it was necessary to make changes to these films yet again. <br /> <br />The two most irritating changes (there are much more but these are my top two most irritating) are in Empire: <br /> <br />1st. The scene where darth vader is summoned to talk to the Emporer was completely changed along with the dialog.  In the old good version you just partialy saw the emporers face in the hologram image which made the emporer seem more mysterios.  When I saw the new version with a full frontal view of the emporers face I laughed because it looked so stupid and out of place with the rest of the movie.  <br /> <br />2nd. They changed Boba Fetts voice from the original to some irritating New Zealander accent.  Why do this George? Just because Boba Fetts father Jango Fett (from Episode 2) spoke with this annoying accent doesn't mean you have to butcher your originals any further by making changes so that they match the first three episodes. <br /> <br />I first asked myself why wreck your originals by making further changes, but the answer became obvious, George is trying to make all six movies and stories tie together.  When I first watched Episodes 1 and 2 there were plenty of ocassions where I though to myself hang on a second this contradicts what happens in Episode 4, 5, 6 e.tc. <br /> <br />For example in Episode 5 Obiwan appears as a vision before Luke when he is laying on the snow and instructs Luke to seek out Yoda the Jedi master who instructed him.  But in Episode 1 Obiwan's master and instructor was Qui Gon Jin not Yoda. <br /> <br />The changes should never have been made to 4, 5, and 6.  From the start episodes 1,2, and 3 should be chopped and changed and hacken and edited, and rewritten so that they make sense and relate to 4, 5, and 6 not the other way around. <br /> <br />Ultimately these films are George's and he can do as he wishes with them.  But it seems insulting to the actors of theoriginal trilogy (and to the fans) to replace their voices entirely or drop their scences complety for the sake of covering up for the fact that the story telling in the prequels didn't match events that would occur later in 4, 5, and 6. <br /> <br />Fans have waited for a long time for these films to come out on DVD, and it seems slighty disapointing and insulting when we part with our money to watch films that are not the same as we remember and enjoy. <br /> <br />And just one final note on Episode 3. It will be more of the same of 1, and 2.  Characters you don't give two hoots about, bad acting (Hayden Christian I'm talking about you), and CGI galor.  In fact George why not do the whole film in CGI and use no actors at all.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0393312836|5.0|I am going to start off by saying that this book is not for everyone.  I repeat: IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!  If you are offended by violence and other \\"adult situations\\" then you will not like this book.  It is also an intensely difficult read for the first chapter or so.  This is due to the fact that Anthony Burgess invnented his own kind of slang, through which the story is narrated by the central character, Alex.  There is no glossary so re reading is a necessity if you're going to enjoy this book, simply to figure out what the language means.  For a book written almost 50 years ago, it is quite a ways ahead of its time.  The way all of the characters can be loathed and loved at the same time is just mind boggling.  Even Alex can be felt sorry for after he is subjected to the government's rehabilitation program.  To sum it up, amazing, but not for the faint of heart.

B0002OERI0|5.0|It's been four years since the severely underated album \\"Warning\\". That album saw Green Day experimenting and trying many new things, and with this album, they follow suit. \\"American Idiot\\" is something we never saw coming, an all-out punk/rock-opera! <br /> <br />This cd draws from every punk influence, and beyond. Traces of Queen are seen all over this disc. \\"Are We The Waiting\\" is the most obvious one. And we also see The Who all over, on the two nine-minute epics \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\".  <br /> <br />Musically, Green Day are rocking harder than ever here. \\"American Idiot\\" sets the tone for the album perfectly, serving as an introduction to the main point of the story on this concept album. The songs are solid, and soar high in the air above everything that Green Day has done before. <br /> <br />Lyrically, the cd tells the loose story of a person from \\"Jingle Town\\" which is pure suburbia, and it's about how he is getting angry with everything happening around his life, from parents to politics, and so he runs away. From that point on, this disc covers everything that over twenty years of punk has raged about, runaways, drugs, gangs, suicide, heartbreak, politics, and regrets, all wrapped up neatly into a 57 minute music experience that will undoubtedly blow you away. <br /> <br />After almost 15 years, this is undoubtedly the masterpiece that Green Day would release. One can now classify Green Day as punk gods, right alongside with The Sex Pistols and The Clash. Hell, you could say that Billie Joe Armstrong is the next Pete Townshend after hearing this. If you are into punk, this is a definite must, it gets more addictive with each listen, because you pick up little things about the story that you didn't get on the first spin. Enjoy!
B000002AP1|5.0|OK, to clear things up, the item on this page is not the remixed version. That is listed under a \\"Millenium\\" edition. This is the original CD issue.<br /><br />Many people have problems with the different mixes of this album. I own several different versions. On the original, I don't know if the mix is really Bowie's fault or the Stooges. But the way the guitar jumps out of the mix on \\"Search and Destroy\\" is pretty cool I think. Yeah, the bass and drums are buried too deep. But it isn't an unlistenable album. \\"Gimme Danger\\" is a great track as well. I think there's a chaotic feel to the original that is truly unique.<br /><br />Now, I bought the remix about two weeks ago, and I haven't stopped playing it. I think it's great. A reviewer before talked about how it's a \\"distorted mess\\". It's the Stooges, you idiot! I love the levels of distortion in this mix. It makes you think your speakers are about to blow out. Like iggy said - \\"Everything's still in the red.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gimme Danger\\" is also given a much fuller band sound. Although I think it's a different vocal take than the original. I don't know which I like more. Also the drums in \\"Penetration\\" don't sound as flat as they did before. Altogether, I don't know if this is an example of a pre-Bowie mix, but I love it! So buy the remix, but don't get rid of your original. There are things to like in both.<br /><br />There are also several IMPORT versions of Raw Power. I don't know about those. I'm guessing they probably have bad sound. I do own ROUGH POWER, though. It sucks! Half of it is terribly muddy sounding demo tapes, the other half is a radio show recording of DJs playing the crappy demo tapes. The whole album is horrible. The terrible sound of ROUGH POWER made me love the Bowie mix more. That disc is only for historical value or if you're a Stooges completist. The sleeve says it's \\"digitally remastered\\". Right. I mean, it sounded like somebody wiped their ass with the original tapes. It sounds that horrible. So again, avoide ROUGH POWER.<br /><br />I've heard the vinyl version sounds better than the Bowie mix CD. I'd like to get it one of these days.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, let me know. I like writing them.ROUGH POWER. <br />I've heard the vinyl version sounds better than the Bowie mix CD. I'd like to get it one of these days. <br />If this review was helpful, let me know.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I have enjoyed reading through the reviews because you can pick out the people who have been twisted by love and those who have not.<br /><br />I admit I was swept almost immediately by the plot of this movie.  The dialog seemed like it was speaking directly to me but I think that is one of the things about love that makes it so powerful--it is a shared experience.  Most people who have been to the depths of love will resonate with this movie like a tuning fork.  People who have been at the surface of love will see this film and say \\"what is all the fuss about?\\".<br /><br />If you have ever felt total dispair in the face of love you will really enjoy ESOTSM.  In fact, you may even want to watch it twice in a row.
0451196716|4.0|I am an avid reader of Stephen King.  This was the first book that made me wonder about the society these boys live that would allow them to take this walk.  I loved the characters, friendships formed, and alliances that were forged and help among the boys to shield another.  The only part that tore my heart out was the ending.  After all that such heart break. I had to read the ending several times and then to my husband to get the whole meaning. Bravo Mr. King!
0425170349|4.0|This is a big book. This is a thriller. This is a page-turner. This is a fascinating dive into the lower dregs of terrorism. The first idea you have to consider is that terrorism is a profession and terrorists are professionals. Hence to fight against this phenomenon, which is in no way new but which has very new means and weapons, you need to have professionals anti-terror fighters. This leads to the question of who can control these fighters. It has to be a multinational body under the control of some agencies, but which ? The book takes the stand that ultimate control comes from the CIA, the FBI and the US military, and yet this body of fighters must keep their autonomy and hence be able to intervene under no control except the « ethics » of war, even when war is not declared, and in any country, with or without the agreement of the local government, though the latter case is only considered for countries like, in order of appearance, Australia, Venezuela, Brazil. This leads to serious questions about the legitimacy of this anti-terror group and also about the US leadership that seems to negate local laws and even local authorities, as if, as the book says, a new sheriff were out on the frontier that the world is. But the book goes a long way farther. All kinds of officially known and identified terrorist groups are seen as the heritage of the past (the new islamist groups are not taken into account) and these groups are manipulated into doomed actions. But this reveals that there is another possibility in the field : terrorism coming from american corporations that have tremendous means of action. They are rich and can use enormous amounts of money. They can take advantage of all privileges of international and multinational big corporations that enable them to by-pass all regulations in the field of air transport, customs controls and financial management. Hence they are beyond legal control. What's more they are managed by very small groups of people who have practically no accounts to give to anyone, even the shareholders, as long as money is pouring on the latter's bankaccounts. The case taken into account in this book is an international american-based pharmaceutical corporation that can mobilize tremendous research, development and financial means to reach their aims. They can also use professional spies or ex-spies, some of the best and best-trained in the world like the ex-KGB spies, to develop activities in the field of terrorism. These ex-KGB people, when turned capitalists, are particularly dangerous due to their connections and prestige in some « revolutionary » circles. The book shows how the newly-set Rainbow anti-terror group can cope with such menaces. But the motivation of these criminals is their love for nature and they are so extreme, and, since no differenciation is made between these and normal environmentalists, the book seems to condone those who consider that the environment must not be taken into account at all. The conclusion of the book is just absurd since it is a reference to the « Brave New World » that is coming in the future : but this reference to Aldous Huxley's novel promises us a strange future : the conditioning of any individual from birth into one of five classes of people without any possibility to escape this social hierarchy, except by getting away into some kind of rebellion in some wild uncontrolled territories. How can we accept a future in which one will be forced into one social class by some technocrats or politicians transforming everyone into an unconscious pawn on a chessboard that only this narrow ruling group can control ? In other words this vision leads to a totally undemocratic and unethical world that Aldous Huxley rejected and denounced and that Tom Clancy seems to endorse entirely. A fascinating book that leads to a dangerous vision if the reader does not inject his own distanciation into the discourse, if the reader does not see that this allusion to the «Brave New World » of tomorrow has to be read as an ironical warning about the future of this anti-terroristic vision and management of humanity. And we will credit Tom Clancy with this distanciation in his mind, even if his book does not in any way goes that way.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUNew World  of tomorrow has to be read as an ironical warning about the future of this anti-terroristic vision and management of humanity.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I don't think it goes to far to say that this film changed my life. It is perfect. It is divine. And I'm not being helpful in the least now am I? This movie perfectly describes a son's journey to find the truth in all his father's tall tales before his father dies. The story covers everything from love and adventure to the extended metaphor of the \\"Big Fish.\\" I was skeptical at first, because most of Tim Burton's other films were rather menacing, but I fell into the story as easily as diving into a pond, and I never got out. I had to stay in the theatre for ten minutes after the movie was over so I could get control of myself. That moving. Really. My mother and I went out and bought the soundtrack as quickly as we could, and bought the DVD the first day it came out. Even on the small screen, it was STILL excellent. Fabulous movie all the way!

B000065U1N|4.0|this movie was rather entertaining to those who havent read the book. as it is, it is an interesting movie, though of a sad and depressing topic matter. something that was a disapointment though was in the real incident, there was a small group of navy SEALs there as well... very sad they didnt get any recognition in the movie. rangers stuck in somalia, have to go in to get some violent militia leader, get stuck longer than expected, people killed, one dude captured in, big suprised, his black hawk down. for those who have absolutly NO idea, a black hawk is a helicopter used in the army/marine corps/ air force that is used for hauling medium weight loads. the seahawk is the navy/ coast guard equivalent. same thing except equipped for water and stuff.
B0000DG00B|5.0|If for nothing else than day two's Mountain Jam with the one of the better drum solos, and for the three guitar extravaganza with Johnny Winter.  there's a couple of minutes there toward the end of Mountain Jam that is just mystical.  Don't laugh.  This entire project is a five star rating but those couple of minutes are the stars.  Ya know with Duane there and before Dicky's hubris, and maybe they were just too tired and too stoned.  but hey, those were magic times.  I guess every generation has their time, and I'm happy that I was there for mine.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Being a long time green day fine I was both excited and nervous to buy this album. On one hand you have a long standing punk-\\"ish\\" band Green Day with albums such as Nookie and Insomniac on one hand and a slower more serious Nimrod/Warning era Green Day on the other hand. If not overproduced and well paced.......could Billy Joe and his companions finallly write there \\"White Album\\" per say ? most definately yes. <br />Anyone who doubted their song writing talent before this should be eating crow. Well written smart and thought-out lyrics and complex melodies fill this album along with 2 songs that old school Green Day fans will flip-out over. Lets begin with : <br />1. American Idiot (4/5) - A great first single, more nimrod era Green Day in sound. Catchy and not over annoying just not the best. <br />2. Jesus of Suberbia (5/5) - Possible one of the best songs Green Day as done yet (more on that later). A 6 minute opus that changes pace a few times, totally not overdone with a fantastic middle. Second best on the album. <br />3. Holiday (4/5) Semi Slower song with a good hook however doesnt stand out very much. Saving point is good lyrics and a great beat.  <br />4. Blvd. of Broken Dreams (4/5) A slower and extremely memorable song. The guitar in the background grabs you, excellent lyrics and a very good melody.  <br />5. We are the waiting (2/5) Slow song very decent lyrics but too over-the-top-sappy for my liking. Its alright but definately one of the low points of the album. Generic. <br />6. St. Jimmy (5/5) Pure green day ala Dookie. Fast Furious with good lyrics and just a excellent fun song. Would be fantastic as a single and would grab fans. <br />7. Give me Novacaine (5/5) My vote for best slower song Green Day has ever done, hands down. Fanastic lyrics, amazing melody and absolutely enthrawling from first note to last. Most recomended. *My vote for best song on album* <br />8. She's a Rebel (3/5) Another old school Green Day song. Not the best on the album,its alright but I find it annoying instead of catchy and uninspired/generic lyrics. <br />9. Extraordinary Girl (4/5) Odd start and very......different from traditional Green Day. Picks up in middle/last bit and a very decent song. Lyrics keep it down though.......again almost like this song would fit in the 50's.....odd but good. <br />10. Letterbomb - (4/5) Semi-Old school Green Day. Closer to something on Insomniac. Good catchy song. Remembers its not over until its too late :) <br />11. Wake me up when september ends (3/5) Definately not the worst song on the album just stands out as average. Most people seem to dislike this song. Its a semi-slow song, good guitar solo and good lyrics.  <br />12. Homecoming (3/5) A little too overproduced/over the top. Longest song (9 minutes!) and tends to run after about 4 minutes. Definately the weakest track. Not bad just doesnt fit. <br />13. Whatshername (4/5) Great song to end the album. Starts off slow and picks up very nicely in later half. Great lyrics and great song to end album. <br />
0393035158|5.0|Isn't it about time you did? <br /> <br />Seriously, though, Sam Harris has performed an extraordinary service through his taboo-breaking book. As other reviewers (like Natalie Angier in the New York Times) have pointed out, Harris has articulated openly what many people have long thought about religious beliefs and practices, but were afraid to say publicly. It's as if Harris has disabled the internal censor that inhibits the Secular Humanist in us all, and now others feel free to follow his example. <br /> <br />Even religionists themselves acknowledge that religious behavior isn't rational or sane when they witness practices in other people's religions that strike them as absurd or creepy. Harris just takes the analysis several steps further and points out the fundamental incompatability of all the \\"Abrahamic\\" religions -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- with a world where potential weapons of mass destruction can fall into the hands of their respective fanatics. Religious \\"freedom\\" served a valid purpose when our European ancestors knew a lot less about reality but wanted to end the Protestant/Catholic wars for practical political reasons. The science of the time couldn't decide the truth of competing religious claims either way, and the available technology for warfare and terrorism wasn't that destructive.  <br /> <br />But when we are in a much better position to understand how reality works, and we have learned things which throw doubt on the reliability of religious myths, it's irresponsible to pretend that beliefs like a coming \\"rapture\\" are any less ridiculous than the predictions of UFO cultists that aliens from the mother ship are going to abduct them. <br /> <br />If humanity can pass through the current bottlenecks and survive in an enlightened and economically comfortable state, our outlook will probably be more like Sam Harris's than like Jerry Falwell's or Osama bin Laden's. Harris deserves credit for writing what could contribute towards the blueprint for a livable world in the 21st Century.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film was touching, truthful, and rightfully damaging to the regime we call the bush administration.  All republicans do to condemn this movie, which most dont even watch, is say it is full of lies, which it is not, if so-prove it!  They cry \\"Moore has an agenda to get Bush thrown from the whitehouse because he is biased\\".  Of course he is!  When your president is so completely unfit for his command why would you not be biased towards him.  Get him out and try something new.  I often laugh when debating a repub over  our president , because they are so brainwashed and argue about a movie that in my experience they hadnt even watched.  I ask, how can you argue that point when you havent even watched it. And the reply is \\"Yeah...and ill never watch that garbage. \\"  I mean come on!  Pathetic is a word that comes to mind.  There may be others as well.  Get some balls, watch the movie, try not to let your head explode with frustration as you wonder how your president could be so careless.  Then in typical republican fashion just disclaim the film as all lies! LOL. You have no argument. Wake up. The proof isnt just in the film, but in the feelings of many soldiers in iraq right now.  In the feelings of hundreds of protestors at every single stop Bush makes across the country.  A country divided more than ever.  There has to be something to these strong feelings.  Its time for our own regime change.  Wake up <br />America - Bush doesnt care about you. Michael Moore should be saluted for his bravery.  The patriot act probably has him classified as an enemy combatant now.
B000089RVX|4.0|I have owned this cd ever since it was released almost 18 months ago.  I still think it's excellent and Amy Lee has beautiful voice that has been used to good potential here.  Despite the fact that people say that the songs sound glaringly similar - Evanescence have managed a well rounded opus... Remember guys this is only a very first internationally released cd - it can only get better from here. <br /> <br />Considering that I own every single piece ever recorded by Evanescence, perhaps I can provide a balanced view of this cd. <br /> <br />1. Going Under - This is an original piece of this cd and is well structured. It certaintly highlights some talented guitar work and gutsy vocals from Amy Lee. <br /> <br />2. Bring Me to Life - There is another version of this floating around, but I think I like this best. The male vocal here accentuates this piece quite well... Though I would be interested to here the original piano version of this song. <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool - This is probably my least favourite Evanescence song... I don't know what I don't like about it. It just grates on me. Again this is another original piece created for this allbum <br /> <br />4. My Immortal - I really like this song a lot and still do. Including the band version, this is very well rounded and poignant. Though I do have a copy of this on Origin <br /> <br />5. Haunted - There's another version of this song, I'm not sure where it's from exactly but I think I like to better. I hardly listen to this one. <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet - This is a very cool song, I think it shows Evanescence's gutiser and darker side. It raises some interesting thoughts about Christainity and Suicide. <br /> <br />7. Imaginary - I really like this song though the version on Origin is heavier. I still think it's a well rounded piece and I really enjoy the way it sounds. <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me - This is a great song I've always liked this ever since I heard it. It is another piece created specifically for Fallen. <br /> <br />9. Hello - This is a really haunting piece and I think it deserves a little more merit. It the first Evanescence piece that I taught myself on the piano. I think it's just beautiful. <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath - This would have to be one of my favourite edgier pieces from Evanescence. This is reallly great lyrically and again has some fine guitar work in it. <br /> <br />11. Whisper - I really like this song a lot though I think I would have preferred it to be without the chamber choir towards the end. There is an alternate version of this piece from one of the Evanescence EP's but I can't remember which one. At any rate I think this piece rounds out the cd well. <br /> <br />12. Breathe No More - I'm not sure who's bright idea it was only to release Breathe No More in a few countries because I religiously listen to this song I love it so much. I had to download it and it took weeks to find an uncorrupted copy. This is a beautiful piece... I think I like it better than My Immortal and that's saying something!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I've never been a big fan of Green Day - in fact, I once gave away the only Green Day CD that I ever owned (Dookie) to my Brother.   After listening to \\"American Idiot\\" about 3 times all of the way through, I have to admit, this is a really great CD!  It's not that often I'll listen to a CD anymore than once or twice, but this one seems to get bettery with every listen!  Highly recommend it~even if your not a big fan of their other stuff!
6305428557|3.0|This was a very simple film.  I felt at first it was going to be an enormous \\"chick-flick\\", the story is actually much deeper than just the love connection between Grant and the local girl.  It is actually a story of a town and the strength of their belief.  It also portrays a small town coping with the loss of so many young men and boys to the war.  While I thought it was going to be nothing but the usual Hugh Grant film, it was less about Grant and more about this little town in Wales.<br /><br />Based on a true story, I watched with amazement as townspeople put aside their differences, put aside their hatred, put aside their lives, to create a mountain from a hill. This mountain represented more to these people then money, then jobs, then anything that we now take for granted. Could you honestly say that if your hometown asked you to build a mountain that you would join, or would you wonder first if you had the time?<br /><br />I am impressed with this style of film. I have only seen a handful of films that have the theme of community as their central focus, one is going to be my movie homework, another is a great British film called Saving Grace where a community comes together to help a local widow.<br /><br />I did have some issues with this film. One big one was the title. Please, if you are ever going to make a film do not make the title also the plot. I mean, I think you can gather from the title what the entire film is going to be like. Another problem was that this film was too simple. I felt that some deeper sub-plot could have been created to bring some depth to this community. I think the director tried to do this with the story of the local boy who had gone to war only to return mentally unstable. I think this could have been such a great sentimental story, but it just was not developed enough. This goes the same for the girl that Grant fell in love with. I felt that it was well too rushed. It only seemed that near the end of the film they truly loved each other and wanted to marry after only spending three to four days together.<br /><br />Maybe times were simpler back then, and perhaps that is another smaller theme, but I think this was a much deeper film.  Deeper than I could have imagined. Bravo to \\"Star Trek\\" man Colm Meaney with his portrayal of Morgan the Goat. He stole this film away from Hugh. See this film if you have the chance.<br /><br />I don't think you will all like it, but it is worth watching at least once.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****uly loved each other and wanted to marry after only spending three to four days together.  <br /> <br />Maybe times were simpler back then, and perhaps that is another smaller theme, but I think this was a much deeper film.

B00004RF9I|5.0|What is often repeated about this film is how in 1976 it predicted the future of television.  \\"The Howard Beale Show\\", \\"Sybil The Sooth-Sayer\\", and \\"Che Guevera Hour\\" have their predecessors in Jerry Springer and reality shows like \\"Fear Factor\\".  But back then there were only three major networks competing among themselves for ratings with no competition from cable outfits.  Some of the film's assertions were dismissed as paranoid fantasy.  It is my understanding that this film germinated from scriptwriter Paddy Chayefsky's mind after becoming disillusioned with the direction network television had evolved.  This from a man who wrote \\"Marty\\" for television only to see it evolve into a sea of \\"Gilligan's Islands\\" and \\"Six Million Dollar Mans\\".  I cite Chayefsky as the primary force behind this film because it is essentially dialogue driven but Sidney Lumet does a superb job directing the proceedings.  The ensemble acting here is superb led by Peter Finch's crazed newsman Howard Beale, Faye Dunaway as the ratings driven program director Diana Christiansen, William Holden as the the voice of reason, axed newsman Max Schumacher, Robert Duvall as hatchetman, Frank Hackett.  Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight shine in smaller roles as a corporate type and Max's spurned wife, respectively.  In 1976 this film was typecast as dark comedy.  Today it would be a reality show.  Are you listening, Donald?
B0000DIXDR|5.0|80s<br /><br />Dancing<br /><br />Patrick Swayze (in tights)<br /><br />Baby's in the Corner<br /><br />Abortion<br /><br />Lake Dancing<br /><br />Who wouldn't think this was one of the best movies EVER.  Even as a very masculine male I find this film very entertaining.  It represents a time when films could be based completely on dancing and music without the modern day clich&eacute;s.  This film represents a time when love could blossom in the summer, and also the unending (yet creative) story of a daughter who grows to be a woman ... through dance.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****
B000059H99|5.0|I was a kid growing up in Philly when this film came out in 1976.  To say the least this movie was an event in my hometown.  Philadelphians being stuck between New York and Washington have a strong sense of pride but also have something of an inferiority complex.  When this film about the ultimate underdog getting a shot at the heavyweight title won best picture at the Oscars the city went nuts.  Back then they used to platform movies and they would play for months.  First they played at upscale theatres(downtown Philly) and after that they came into the neighborhoods(there were few multiplexes).  The film came out around Christmas and didn't come to our neighborhood until May, 1977.  We waited months for it and when it came to our neighborhood the lines were around the block.  Naturally, I saw this film about 3 or 4 times and would unquestionably love it.  Subsequent sequels and lousy Stallone films(Cobra, Judge Dredd, etc.) cooled me to this film.  I did not revisit this film until it's DVD release and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a gritty little film with a lot of heart unlike it's sequels which are slick and soulless.  This is not the best directed or acted film in the world and the dialogue is corny at times, but that is part of the film's charm.  I get nostalgic when I see Philadelphia as it was in the Bicentennial year, some that still exists and some things that aren't here anymore.  Unlike Rocky Balboa, this film triumphed at the Oscars over formidable competition(\\"Network\\",\\"Taxi Driver\\",\\"All the President's Men\\",\\"Bound for Glory\\")and may not have been the \\"best\\" picture, but it's the one that audiences most responded to.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I knew that this trilogy was the edited version before I bought it, but when I was at Costco the other day I purchased it anyway.  Well, now I'm really mad!  The three movies are MORE butchered than I remember.  The computer animation has GOT to go!  The most upsetting part in the series to me is the sand pit scene.  The original uncut version was one of my favorite parts and now they totally ruined it.  There is now a big computer generated plant mouth(that looks like the plant from Little Shop of Horrors)coming out of it.  This made me soooooo mad I had to fast forward it!  Why in the heck would someone want to add that in?  I could go on and on about the stupid new scenes but that would take for ever.  I gave this a one star because Empire Strikes Back was not totally butchered and was actually watchable.  Don't buy this series!  Keep on watching the originals on tape or laser disc.
B00003CXA2|4.0|\\"Forrest Gump\\" is a prime example of how good acting can overcome a mediocre script and OK direction.  This film does not so much contain a story but a series of random events that our hero stumbles into(Stupid is as stupid does).  What is most impressive about Robert Zemeckis' direction is how CGI is utilized to integrate his characters into historical events.  What least impresses is how these techniques detract from the characters.  What distinguishes this film is the acting, particularly Tom Hanks as Forrest.  Yes, Forrest has an I.Q. of 80, but he's nobody's fool.  What ingratiates you to this character is that he has a heart a mile wide.  This is a tricky bit of acting that Hanks does here because playing somebody who is mentally challenged is a slippery slope(If you want an example of how not to play the mentally retarded,see or don't see Cliff Robertson's performance in \\"Charly\\").  The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with Gary Sinise as the embittered Lt. Dan, Robin Wright as Jenny(though I thought it too much that she had to suffer so many indignities), Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, and Sally Field as Forrest's mother.  This film in subsequent years has been criticized, fairly or unfairly, as sappy or condesending.  What I would add to that is the public took this character into their bosom.  I think it's a fair assessment that you can fool at least some segment of the theatre going public.  I don't think this film would have been the phenomenon that it was if the public thought they were being taken for a ride.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Wow. That's all I have ot say. Wow. Nightiwsh's best album yet and that's saying a lot since all their other albums have been awesome as well. Tuomas does some of his best work on this album and Marco 's song was good as well. Congratulations Nightwish. All true fans will love this album. Let's just hope this isn't their farewell.
078322737X|5.0|Let me preface it to say that there are few films that I would give more than the 5 stars allotted to reviewers.  To say that I love this film is an understatement.  When I saw this film theatrically in 1978(it was the extended director's cut not the original version that played theatres in 1973) I wished that I was in Modesto, California cruising the streets to the sounds of the Wolfman.  This film suggests the kind of director George Lucas could have become if he had not become engrossed with \\"Star Wars\\" and ILM.  Our loss.  The story deals with young people on the cusp of adulthood going out for one last fling.  Their stories aren't earth-shaking ones.  John, the rebel, has to usher around an underage girl.  Steve, the responsible one, is trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, Laurie.  Terry, the geek, is trying to make it with a Sandra Dee wanna-be.  Curt, the brain, is pursuing the elusive blonde in the white T-bird.  Along the way various things intrude on these pursuits.  A drag race, a gang initiation, etc.  Lucas has crafted a dream world here that is every much as wonderous as that of \\"Star Wars\\".  Enough cannot be said of the period music that comments on the action of the film.  And of course Lucas assembled a largely unknown cast (Richard Dreyfus, Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, Paul LeMat, Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, etc.) who portray young people not dumb teenagers.  One of the devices that Lucas uses to illustrate that youth is a temporary state is show title cards about what happened to the principle characters later in life.  This film illustrates the innocence that was contained in this country prior to the social upheavals that occured later in the 60's.
0393035158|1.0|This book is a testament to the dangers of what happens when a scientist thinks he is a philosopher.  <br /> <br />I don't mean to brust anyone's bubble but faith isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Not to mention that the author's interest in eastern religion reeks of New Age nonsense. <br /> <br />I am not even a christian, muslim, jew, or member of any organized religion. I do not believe in miracles, revelation, that God tells anybody to do anything, or in the supernatural, but I still believe in God and an afterlife (no hell though) because life without those concepts is meaningless. Real Faith means more than blind trust, it means an uncompelled leap of belief. If we do not view the Universe in anthropomorphic terms then you might as well just be a robust atheist like Bertrand Russell. <br /> <br />As a healtrhy anitdote I recommend Martin Gardner's \\"The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener.\\"
B00005K3NR|5.0|i loved this movei. I read the book in a day and couldnt wait to see the movie. Spacec played a great role for a kid who gets picked on and her mom creeeped me out. the scariest part of the movie for me was the very end
B0002OERI0|4.0|I've been a big fan of Green Day since Dookie (I'll admit I hadn't heard of them until 1994 mostly because I was only 11 at the time but I love their pre-Dookie stuff now too) but I have to admit I was very skeptical about buying this CD after hearing the title and seeing the promos on TV where they are hyping up their new-found political edge.  I will most definitely be voting for President Bush in November so I obviously don't agree with Billie Joe's politics.  I was worried that the band I've enjoyed for the past 10 years was going to release some brainless NOFX-like Bush bashing garbage, but I was dead wrong.  This CD is amazingly well written lyrically and musically, and the political lyrics are actually written intelligently instead of with blind rage like most of the punk bands that have been stepping forward in 2004 thinking that their music can help get Bush out of office.  I'm always open to hearing an intelligent commentary from the other side so I wasn't really turned off at all by the lyrics on this album.  Maybe I'm missing something, but the only songs on the album that I really found to be centered on politics were the title track, \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Holiday.\\"  And if I am missing more politically driven songs, well then I guess ignorance is bliss.  I also have no problem with the fact that this isn't the same Green Day from 1994 like some reviewers seem to have.  Songs such as \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", and \\"Whatsername\\" are great, and (I know its been done before) the whole idea of the album telling a story is excellent, so I like the maturity they bring on this CD.  I kind of feel like I've grown up with Green Day so their music has always appealed to me at the age I was at.  So this CD gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of the politics, but if you are a fellow Republican don't be afraid to go out and get this album, because you'll really be missing out.
B000002KXO|5.0|I've been a Stevie Nicks / Fleetwood Mac fan for 22 years now, and it all started with purchasing the \\"Mirage\\" LP back in 1983 after seeing the \\"Gypsy\\" video on MTV.  Perhaps this early experience made me biased, but in some ways, MIRAGE is the Fleetwood Mac album that I've always gone back to and listened to the most.  TUSK may be their artistic pinnacle, but over-all this and RUMOURS are their most appealing records.  I credit Lindsey Buckingham, as usual, for his sonic inventiveness and his brilliance with creating multi-layered textures and moods for these tracks, both instrumentally and vocally.  I disagree with anyone who's written that MIRAGE was an album that was merely 'by the numbers,' or 'uninspired.'  The craft and effort are all there - by all three songwriters. <br /> <br />Christine McVie offers two tracks on this album that are simply spell-binding - \\"Only Over You\\" and \\"Hold Me.\\"  I LOVE the harmonies and the languid, swoony mood of \\"Only Over You.\\"  \\"Hold Me\\" has a fantastic instrumental section in the middle of it, and the arrangement shows what Lindsey can do musically with such a simple, repetitive song.  The tune was a huge hit, and deservedly so!  I can see why the band doesn't perform it live - it's extremely dense.   <br /> <br />\\"Love In Store\\" is a pleasant opener in that \\"Little Lies\\" kind of mode.  \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is also a very pretty closer to the album.   <br /> <br />Lindsey's rockabilly and early rock 'n' roll influences are revealed in \\"Can't Go Back\\" and \\"Book Of Love.\\"  Again, like TUSK, the vocal harmonies are brilliant and gorgeous.  \\"Empire State\\" and \\"Oh Diane,\\" don't do much for me, but \\"Eyes Of the World\\" builds to an awesome crescendo and shows the band in peak harmony.   <br /> <br />I've longed for years for Stevie Nicks to do a full-out country record, and one only has to listen to \\"That's Alright\\" to figure out why.  The song, written early on in her career, is absolutely stunning.  Her voice was in peak form during this period (on record at least), and this song shows off her vocal chops.  And again - gotta love those harmonies!  \\"Straight Back\\" is definitely not one of her best - the mysticism in this tune seems kind of garbled.  Finally, there's \\"Gypsy,\\" which is perhaps her greatest song, and with the exception of \\"Sara\\" on TUSK, the bands supreme recorded achievement!!!  There must have been some kind of magic in that studio when the band recorded this tune, because the result is sublime alchemy.  Everything comes together in a flawless way.  No live performance or demo of the song to date has even compared to the finished track on this album.  It's the song that made me love Stevie Nicks and this band, and the 'glitter has never faded!' <br /> <br />I'm going to end this review on kind of a downer note, because I must bring up the fact that this CD is now the most awful sounding in my collection!  Warner Bros. listen up - you need to remaster this album BIG time, just like the great jobs you've done this year with FLEETWOOD MAC, RUMOURS and TUSK!!!  It's an awesome album that deserves a better reputation (and a better CD release) than it's been given.
