They gave me the gift of a Kindle and then  downloaded this Bible for me.  What  a  blessing!!  I  have  a  large-print  NIV, but  it  is  so  heavy.  This electronic version makes carrying my Bible  convenient  and  easy. I  feel  blessed  to have  lived  long  enough  to  enjoy  this modern marvel and so I'll  say one  more  time,........WHAT  A  BLESSING!!!
0060723513|4.0|This story is well written informative and entertaining.  It could very likely have been true instead of fiction.  I suspect a Unity Church influence.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|While I was downloading this game, I had some  doubts, I wondered if it would be as terryfing as the pc version. Then the game launched itself and my doubts vanished as slenderman appeared in front of me when I collected my second page. My kindle hates me for sure now. The game is updated adding new features like fog and image effects which takes the horror experience to a new level, and also new maps, like the farm, playable by day or night. Also the price is so cheap that you can't pass by without buying it. Hurry up, the notes are not going to collect themselves !
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book said something I will never forget. Man's true meaning, like a movie , is not revealed until his life is over. Reason is what man gives himself<br />for motivation when he is faced with unavoidable suffering.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is one of the best books my friends and I have read. I think this book is great for kids of all ages. My fifteen year old sister even liked Jeff Kinney`s \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator application is great.  It works just like a real calculator and it comes in handy when you need to calculate something.  I have had no problems at all with this app.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I watched the show first but the comic is so amazing! I love this story and cannot wait to read the next!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for the whole family we play it every day the olny thing I don't like is all the game requests. You get when your trying to play the game and some times it wount load
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I think that Josh Groban is a favorite of mine. I listen to all his recordings as I go to sleep each night. I have a CD player that plays 1 CD ---- then turns itself off --- as I go to  sleep. I dearly love all things 'Josh'!!!<br />Lita
B000W9DSVW|5.0|A great way to sepnd a rainy Sunday.  More action than yhou can imagine, but well acted and well written.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|This game is lots of fun.  The simulation is amazing.  I would recommend this game to any pinball enthusiast. Thanks!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Another great performance by Denzel! Not what I expected from the title but turned out to be fantastic movie.  Highly recommend renting!
B0029LCJJS|3.0|It is enjoyable to imagine the history involved in this story.  However I feel the sex scenes are cheesy and low class.  I am not sure if I would recommend this to anyone.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Wonderfil for kids. a must have for any phineas and ferb fan. totally worth it. i totally reccomend this epic game.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Not only is The Social Network a fantastic movie and I feel it should have won Best Picture (it lost to The King's Speech), but this Blu-ray offers more than just the movie itself.  Along with a gorgeous looking transfer of the movie with top-notch picture and sound, this disc has a looong documentary showing the making of the film.  It's entertaining and very enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />I can't say enough great things about David Fincher's work here.  He took a recent story that I thought sounded meh when I heard he was working on this project, and with the amazing writing by Aaron Sorkin and directing OCDness by Fincher himself made a GEM of a movie.<br /><br />Incredibly rewatchable, this is what most films aspire to be and few achieve.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I loved this movie.  Sad about the ending but addressed a very real killer in our world.  Alcohol, infidelity and realizing what is real and love is the only thing that matters.  You understand what I am saying to you?
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This book holds my attention, and it's excellent!  It is the best one yet!  I cannot wait to get the time to finish reading it.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|A perfect blend of CSI, Law and Order and ER. Wonderful talent and well written. I can't wait to jump into season 2.
B008220DIC|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is the master (no pun intended) of the slow-burner.  Usually this pays off; MAGNOLIA and THERE WILL BE BLOOD are true wonders of filmmaking.  At other times, such as with THE MASTER, the technique is a bit uneven.  The film follows WWII vet Freddy, a driftless sort cast ashore in a world he doesn't quite fit into.  Drunk one night, he wanders aboard a boat mastered by the personable Lancaster Dodd, a man who has slowly gathered around him a tightly knit group of people.  Dodd's goals are lofty: to cure the world of everything he sees wrong with it, one individual person at a time.  Sensing a guiding light, Freddy latches onto Dodd much like a dog--loyal and eager, but feral at heart and ultimately unpredictable.<br /><br />THE MASTER is an actor's piece.  As usual, Joaquin Phoenix gives it his all; his performances can often be polarizing--sometimes he goes too far--but here, he shines.  Matching him step for step is Philip Seymour Hoffman; where Phoenix is over-the-top and theatrical, Hoffman keeps his performance subtle.  It's a perfect counterbalance, and the chemistry between the two is at times purposely unsettling.  Digging into their meager roles are the supporting cast: Amy Adams, Jesse Plemons, Laura Dern, and others, who rarely have much to do, though Adams gets a couple of moments to shine (enough to get her an Oscar nom).<br /><br />There's probably a reason the film's three Oscar nominations were for acting.  The script and directing are solid--make no mistake, this is a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you're going to get something superbly put together.  But the film meanders; the central performances are never less than riveting, but the story takes a backseat somewhere along the way.  What made Anderson's previous efforts so successful was that they were character studies with flow and rhythm; here, we simply have a dual character study.  It's interesting, and it's rendered beautifully, but it's slow going.  If you can set aside a couple of hours (that will probably feel like a couple of hours), then you owe it to yourself to give THE MASTER a shot.  It's not a film about cultism, as has been feared; rather, it's a film about people, one that never passes judgment.  Some viewers will be a little unsettled by Anderson's ambiguity; most, hopefully, will appreciate a great filmmaker taking a stab at rendering his perceptions of humanity onto the screen.couple of hours (that will probably feel like a couple of hours), then you owe it to yourself to give THE MASTER a shot.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|I became a Fringe fanatic after viewing it my Kindle. I could never get a fix on the day or t-v time for the show. I love the way the stories were weaved together. Loved Olivia and Peter- they brought heat to the screen. You could see the tenderness. Loved the way Peter handled Walter- their interaction was quite touching. Walter's character was played so well as were they all. Astrid, Phillip and Monica along with C. Francis- just great<br /> I simply love, love, love it. It should be on for at least seasons!!! Went through 1-4 seasons in a flash. will look at the 5th season next week. Writers, don't stop!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is all around fantastic! I have to get this review done so I can play some more!<br />Go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I loved this film and the spirit and soul of Rodriguez - A humble man, and a man of wisdom; many pearls to take from his story (i.e., wealth and fame are fleeting; there's no shame in hard work, etc.); to top it all off, the music is pretty darn good. Highly recommended!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The proud nation had stringent laws with disproportinate penaltiy for petty offense illustrated in the case of Jean Valjean, the victim of the system.  Fearing to be identified and returned to the galley, he became so humble and passive as to be at the mercy of the most advanced of scheming and blackmail and threat of exposure.  One love was left to him - Cosette - yet even she was kept away from him - by a jealous<br />worthless lover who relented only too late; the ultimately high-minded man of great physical strength expired and passed to the realm of the angels, divested of the will to save himself.<br />Victor Hugo was a writer who detailed both sides of each dilemma and his use of vocabulary appropriately fits to clarify his point.<br />At times the writng becomes repetitive and the reading is tedious.  Such, however, is the price extracted for this experience of the writng of this literary seer, a genius of his time.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Definitely worth seeing. Probably my favorite film of the year so far for storyline, acting, adventure, intrigue and drama. Higly recommended.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Strong character development, solid plot with a number of well formed and very interesting side stories. Very &#34;human&#34; main character. Harry takes us with him through trials that are beyond &#34;normal&#34;daily life and does so with a strength of heart we should all hope to have if ever faced with the horrors of Harry's job. One of the &#34;good guys&#34;. I look forward to following Harry through the next set of challenges that he will reluctantly accept!
B00BESCJII|4.0|Definitely worth seeing for this genre of film. The acting is solid and the storyline has value and meaning beyond pure fluff.
B004O7EVLY|5.0|Go back in time and mix sabbath, cream, zepellin and all those in a blender, love them 3 albums, great!

B001JIES4Q|5.0|This falls into my top five feel good movies. For a multi-story line film, it is easy to follow. The characters are well developed and the acting is exceptional.
0156012197|5.0|\\"Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.\\" The Little Prince is a strange little book, but it is also amazing. Actually, the first opera I ever saw was an adaption of The Little Prince, and I first read the book soon after.    As I said, the writing of The Little Prince is somewhat odd, but also endlessly inventive. The book tells of the prince's adventures on his own planet, with the special rose that he finds and raises, to the strange other planets that he visits before finally coming down into the African desert and meeting the crashed pilot who narrates the story.    The Little Prince is full of whimsy and charm, and is a lightning fast read. It probably took me about twenty minutes (at most) to read. I think my favorite section of the book is when the prince has left his planet, and is visiting many of the other small planets. On various different planets live a king who has no subjects, a drunkard who drinks to forget that he's ashamed of drinking, a business man who owns the stars but doesn't do anything with them, a geographer who doesn't know what formations are on his own planet, and a lamp-lighter who must put out and light the lamps once a minute because his planet's rotation. All adults, of course. After the prince visits each of them, he remarks that adults are so very, very strange.    The Little Prince is a fable of sorts, and an excellent one at that. I don't Love it with a capital L, but I did really enjoy rereading this little book. I may try some of Saint-Exupery's other novels, like Night Flight.    [...]
B000IDGBWU|5.0|One of the best romantic movies ever made. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze have wonderful chemistry. The music, dancing, and acting make it a five star feature.
0307454541|4.0|I'm not generally one for thrillers, but I saw this one at a library sale and picked it up for a whopping $1. I am on occasion fond of a smart thriller (practically an oxymoron, I know), so I took a chance. And I really enjoyed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. It reminded me a bit of State of Fear, but it was much better, and was a mystery thriller as opposed to an environmental thriller. \\"Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.\\" More specifically, Bloomkvist is hired to investigate what happened to Harriet Vanger by her old uncle.<br /><br />Like many 600+ page thrillers, it takes a while for all the book's various sub-plots to combine. You have the story of Blomkvist's battle against libel charges, the story of Lisbeth Salander, a lot of background information, and of course the main mystery. For nearly half the book, Lisbeth and Blomkvist's stories don't converge, although Lisbeth is interested in Blomkvist.<br /><br />There is so much going on in this book, and there are so many members of the Vanger clan that the reader must be suspicious of. This book is so complex, and there are so many different threads of the narrative that have to drawn together. And drawn together they are, very skillfully.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is definitely an \\"adult\\" novel, if you know what I mean. There are many deeply disturbing scenes.  I did really like it though; it had its darkly funny moments, and its moments when one of the \\"good\\" characters gets their revenge, and you, the reader, feel so good too. And, like most thrillers and mysteries, there's a moment when the detective (in this case Bloomkvist) makes a major break-through in the case.<br /><br />I enjoyed both the characters of Bloomkvist and Lisbeth. They are both so complicated, and so interesting. I also learned a lot of things that may (or may not) be true about the Swedish system. This is the first of a trilogy, and I might read the sequel, though this book wrapped things up pretty well. I loved the various twists and turns in this book, as the mystery grows ever deeper.<br /><br />Check out my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.ean. There are many deeply disturbing scenes.

B000SZNET6|5.0|I always make my family watch traditional Christmas movies. Imagine their surprise when I picked this one night. Now, it's the only one that I'm sure everyone will watch. This is a classic Bruce Willis movie. Great action, shoot outs, explosions. And it does take place during Christmas!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I have read Amazon's tips for writing great reviews but this movie is just thin, without any real sense of purpose and simply awful. To make the effort to try to reason why it is bad, would be more poetic and with more effort than what seems to have been given to write the screenplay.  In my opinion, you should just keep searching and let this one land somewhere else!
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Ive Been A Fan Of Papa For Many Years Ever Since I Heard Last Resort. I've Got Most Of All Of Their Albums. I Got This Album For Christmas And Let's Just Say I'm Glad I didn't Pay For It Or I'd Want A Damn Refund. Huge Disappointment For Sure :( After The Last Time For Annihilation I Was Expecting Good Things But No. Don't Get This Don't Waste Your Time Or Money.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|While I enjoyed this book, the writing style seemed to change about half way through and it started skipping the reader ahead by big leaps and bounds.  Still a good read but left holes.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Super fun to play with face book friends. Or by yourself. But credits are.exspensive.you dont earn.daily credits
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic book.  I purchased the next one right away.  Not as &#34;racey&#34; as Fifty shades but the reader definately gets carried away.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is one of the best of its genre. Really captivating and a good story line.  Gave it five stars.
B0045EA1P6|4.0|I bought cause Some Nights is an amazing album (start to finish), which you don't see much anymore in these days of one hit release albums.  This is a very good album also, and I really dig a couple songs on this one.  Overall very happy with this band and with these albums.  I hope they continue on a similar path, would hate to see them go out on a tangent like Radiohead after OKComp/Kid A.
B008N1V11U|1.0|Looks amazing, unfortunately the one I down loaded seems to have a glitch, it plays just passed the title screen about 2-5 mins and then blanks out, the app closes by it self and puts me back at the home screen:( so now I just don't use it at all it's a shame because I love the dark knight rises movie, and was looking forward to this game, waste of $7 bucks
B005PK56TA|5.0|very good.  I enjoyed watching. keep me wanting to watch more. will continue to follow this searies. will tell others
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I ordered it yesterday, yes it is free, but I can't even find it on my Kindle. So, I don't know what to review.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I currently have 2 i5s and a 6 core amd in my house this i7 even though it is the lowest of the LGA2011s can out perform all of them. It is a great buy for the money and its benchmark/ price makes it a great deal as well. The tolerance of this CPU is also great, having run it hard with a malfunctioning cooler it never even flinched. This is a great and sturdy product that I would recommend to anyone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is an amazing story with twist and turns that are completely unexpected!! I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down!! The ending took me totally by surprise and I only hope the movie lives up to the expectations that I have!
B004OZZ624|5.0|This is a little different role for Crowe, as he is not the &#34;badass&#34; in this movie as I remember him being in the past.But I think he does a good job. Movie is a little long, so that might turn some fans away; I don't mind though.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|this is based on an event that happened when i was just getting into high school so its history in that sense resonated with me.  i had never known before that that these things [taking people hostage and away from their family, friends, way of life] happened.  i admit i don't remember the 6 and i certainly never heard of how they were rescued, but the movie [whether or not it took liberties] was fascinating.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book really sucked me in for the 1st 3/4. I love the split narration. Really kept me interested. Unfortunately, I feel as if the book deflated at the end. It felt like an easy way out.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|I haven`t read science fiction in quite a while by I did indeed enjoy this book. Tug is definitely an interesting character.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Really worth the money.  Robert Downey Jr. is as hot as ever.  If you get this movie, be sure to get Iron Man series and Thor as well as Captain America and the Hulk so you have the complete set.
B0041D843M|5.0|easy to read - i recommend this book to everyone! and be sure to pass it on when you finish.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Definitely worth the money.  Hilarious and chocked full of good actresses.  If you have kids that are completely clueless about what it was like when blacks were considered second-class citizens, this is a great way to inform in a great presentation.  Highly recommend.

B007LB1O3I|5.0|Never was a Madonna fan growing up. However I heard one of the songs off this and had to buy it. Now, I have a few of her old CDs and I am amazed at some of the songs from the 80's and 90's that I dismissed, that I now like partly becasue I am listening to them on good headphones.

B00B7Y0206|5.0|Great app. Downloads the videos quick, with very little, if any, skipping. Sound is good and the search performs quickly.
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|I don't mind movies that most people would be offended at. I don't mind juvenile thinking, pranks, and jokes. This goes so far beyond that, there are no adjectives to describe it. There were a few funny laugh-out-loud parts, but for the most part, it wasn't funny. Don't waste your time buying or renting this movie. It's not worth your time.
B007V65R54|5.0|I really wish he would have kept out the chapter on baseball or at least related it more to the rest of the book.<br /><br />However, I he gave me a new perspective on prediction / future / statistics.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Saw him in a 1 hour interview, his story was compelling.  The book even more so.  The scientific community still cannot explain how he recovered from such a rare and aggressive form of meningitis. Yet he did, and lived to tell about his experience.  Furthermore, I love how he explained in such vivid detail his experience on the other side yet paralleled that with why this type of brain function could not have been possible based on scientific fact, and he provides that evidence in the book. There is a reason the universe chose a highly scientific, left brained neurosurgeon who had very little faith in heaven - who told his patients that experienced the &#34;light&#34; that it could all be explained by scientific data....had this supernatural experience that cannot be explained.  In fact, his experience could actually be proven to be IMPOSSIBLE. Yet it happened.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Eventually I just stopped carrying about what happened to this government they're trying to overthrow.<br /><br />This book was characterized by two things: it's not believable and it's mostly about which boy a 17 year old girl wants.  When I put it like that, I'm not really surprised I didn't like it.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Love this album.  It has a terrific rock and roll vibe.  &#34;God Save Rock and Roll&#34; and &#34;Mr. Rock and Roll&#34; are jump up and dance tunes.  I am a Spinning (r) instructor and these make great workout songs.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I have seen some really bad movies based on books and I was really skeptical about a live action based on an anime.  My ultimate favorite anime at that.  However, this was really not that bad.  It did have it's cheesy moments (I won't spoil it for you) but overall, it was really good.  If you're a Yamato fan, I would highly suggest you get this for your collection!
B004KPS90E|3.0|Just more of the same in the Saw series. If you're a fan of the series it's worth a watch.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|I am a die-hard Twilight Fan and this Blu-Ray was Perfecto...just like the Movie/Series! Great Buy/Great product! Loved it and Everyone should get it!!!

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I so love this tam it reminds. me so much of tiny wars and my country. and so many more games it is free and well worth my time and effort
B00ALCBU4M|4.0|I am a sucker for WWII movie and this one has great story and a lot of action. And most of all, the casts are great especially Vinnie Jones is AWESOME! The CG is pretty poor probably due to very low budget. I wish they had more budget to do CG like Saving Private Ryan or at least near Band of Brothers. Hope they make another one with bigger budget.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good insight into the kids who don't say much.  Sometimes they learn to believe in themselves, that they can contribute to the world too.
B009SCRERI|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie. It is getting pretty a<br />frequent viewings. It is super cute and fun for mom to watch as well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|i love it it is awesome it will wake me up and i dont have to be late to school who ever is reading this u should get this app cause it really works
B000ID37RM|5.0|I'd read Harper Lee's &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; as a child, but seeing it brought to life through the medium of film was a wonderful new experience. This movie is fantastic. The acting, even of the children, is excellent. A moving story following a young girl's life in segregated America during the Great Depression, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; reminds us to rise above prejudice by showing us the problems it causes and also what it means to rise above them. If you haven't seen this movie, you NEED to!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really great game. Uses a fun distribution twist to a city game. I really enjoy this game. I would suggest it to others.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It was everything I thought it would it would be like and more, couldn't put it down. Starting volume 2 now! Must read for any can of the tv show or even if you haven't seen it and just enjoy zombies.
B0091QS88K|5.0|Its a cool game for children. They get to make different foods and also learn thing about making food as well. Overall its a good game. I would def recommend this game to others with small children!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that the game was very good I would definitely recommend this because it is fun and addictive so I would encourage people to install this app
B003M6TVQI|5.0|This is an entertaining show.  Matt Bomer can &#34;knock it out of the park&#34; with his acting,<br />looks, and style.  The supporting cast does a nice job,too, but it is Bomer's show~
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. Fast paced.  great graphics. my 10yr old loves it.  Slightly addictive.  Wanna play it over and over again.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If you like the tv show--you will love the CD. Have it in my car and listen to it every time I drive.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We watched this movie with our 9 year old daughter and we all loved it! It was a great story of a father's love for his little girl.

0316228532|5.0|When I first began this book, I was expecting a Harry Potter read. When it wasn't what I expected, I almost put it down. I am so very glad I didn't. This book is a journey deep into the heart of humanity, the compassion and insight Rowlings weaves through the pages is one that will open the heart and broaden the vision of any person who believes in human compassion. So many books today have two-dimensional good guy, bad guy, overtold stories to tell. In The Casual Vacancy Rowling takes us into the complexity of the human heart and through the power of the most real character development and story telling shows what a profound impact human beings can have on one another, for good, or for bad. Anyone with a heart who reads this book will walk away a bigger more conscious person than they were when the started it. It was so difficult to put the book down, I read nothing else until I finished it. I hope that this is only the first of Rowling's post-Potter books, I am so looking forward to the next one.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|AS the title says, good movie for the marvel and everyone in between. I feel it fell short in some parts and trying to tell a bigger story in a limited timeframe made some parts rather rushed and left some questions lingering.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Seth McFarlan has created a HILLARIOUS character (much like Willard the dog).  Welcome change from Disney style movies designed for ADULTS :)  BRAVO !
B009C7JS14|4.0|Gives a lot of info in a glance. Time, two free locations, temp, wind speed, forecast for coming days,rain sleet or snow
B002XMGGJM|5.0|I will most likely put this in my collection as a classic.  Gerard Butler replaces Bruce Willis with intelectual indestructability,  needing no accidental Deux ex Machina to carry his luck.  I guess I like his empirical style and mental command. I see prosperity and fame already and expect even better movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show! I love how it has evolved over each season and just keeps you coming back for more each week
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I did not rcv the UV disc as advertized.  I expect one asap.  I have been a customer near 20 yrs. I think that is FAIR.<br />tyvm<br />Gilbert H. Ewing II
1250010489|1.0|As much as I liked the \\"Zero Day\\" - \\"Trojan Horse\\" turned out to be a great disappointment. So much that I quit reading in the middle of the novel (never happened to me before). I get it - Mark is not a professional writer, and so I am inclined to forgive him numerous awkward sentences, the same quixotic expressions used over and over again and so on. But using the same improbable scenario of a captive (a geek) who manages untie him/herself to break loose from captors (professional foreign intelligence agents) - not once but TWICE - is more than a shortcut - it's dangerously close to be an insult to the reader's intelligence. At least the type of reader Mr Russinovich better not to antagonize...
B006YM9JSW|5.0|If you know about computers and you want to build a \\"SUPER COMPUTER\\" I couldn't recommend a 2011 chip more.<br /><br />Overclocks to 4.3GHz with EASE.  5GHz is not easy.<br /><br />I bought this used on Amazon for less than $2Hundred and overclocked it to 5GHz on a AsRock Fatality Champion ($2Forty-Five) (nothing to do with Fatal1ty's gamer handel)<br />I used the Thermaltake Extreme Water 2.0 and a Thermaltake Level 10 GTS and with excellent cable management Stock Temps: 28c idle and 38c 100% load.<br />I overclocked my CPU to 5GHz and 100% load is 65c +/- 3c<br />Windows 8 was installed on SSD in 12 minutes 7 seconds.<br /><br />I believe this is the way to build the ultimate computer now.  I may upgrade to IvyBridge and a Titan GTX.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Loved it. Although the humor is not for everyone. Humor can be crude for the faint of heart. For me I love it.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|Sorry, you just can't go wrong with Bond..and this is no exception. Pierce Brosnan was fantastic as Bond,and to me was taken out of these way to soon. Grab the soda and popcorn, its Bond, James Bond night!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really like show, can't wait to see the next season.  Will watch again real soon.  Why do I need so many words for review
B009329ZF2|4.0|Honestly, you just never know what you are going to see In these movies. This one however was a pleasant surprise. Had my attention all the way to the end,and the acting was very well done. I would recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE. IT.  Got my dad hooked on it as well, and he thought the whole concept was stupid.  He watched every available episode of this show in one weekend.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|This was a surprise. I have to be honest and say, I simply did not like the remake of clash of the Titans. This however, was terrific. Not tons of violence, so in my opinion is ok for kids 12 and up.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|This is such a great movie! It has a good plot and is packed with great performances. I have seen it several times and would see it again.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Yep, this ones a sleeper. Guy Pierce was awesome in this. His  character was completely different to what he normal plays. Good story line. I think you will enjoy it.
0920668372|5.0|I love reading this with my son. It conveys a very strong message of love between mother and son. It will make you cry though.
1452110581|5.0|this is definitely something to get for any cat people in your life. the poems are cute, funny, and relateable. i love it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you like books like The Perks of being a Wallflower, you'll like this one too. The shorter chapters made it feel like a fast read too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Cris Kyle has a great book about the life of a SEAL sniper.  It is certainly a shame that after all he went through  as a warrior, he was murdered as a civilian trying to do good.  My question is was it a crazed killing or was there more to it by someone who didn't want him writting?
B00A757EFW|5.0|Classic. Entertains me and the best part is, that it was for free. I might purchase the full version though
B005LAIH2W|5.0|It is a crying shame that the quality of something come affixed with a price tag. I know what i like.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like this better than Angry Birds, and Angry Birds Seasons.  I have had the most fun with it, and have found the levels very challenging, but not impossible.  I love the music, and I love that some levels have you freeing caged birds, instead of just killing or knocking over the monkees.  The monkees are harder to deal with than the pigs.  I like it, and it is a fun way to kill time in between errands, pick ups and drop offs of the kids, or when I just need a little break from something I am doing !<br /><br />Highly recommend !
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This is a book that I really enjoyed from a business perspective on innovation and also as in insight into the world of sports. The applicability of statistics and innovation to any industry can be gleaned from this story. I found the book more exciting to read after having watched the movies as that gave the characters (in the book) more life.
B00BHMF578|5.0|well deserving of all of its accolades.  a must watch for all americans - the history behind the hostage crisis was never publicized in the u.s.
B004R1Q2EG|4.0|Good book that I often recommend to others but it is light on the science and underlying explanations. The examples are good. A classic in the business world but also useful for understanding learning profiles of people (and your children).
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|special needs, indomitable spirit, infectious enthusiasm - all in a true story set in the Bay Area.  this is a wonderful movie and I want to now watch the previous movie on his life that also won an oscar!
B008YI91HS|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites! I was excited to see that I could buy it at such a cheap price and have it streamed right to my computer and/or portable device!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can't believe it took me so long to read this series. I always wondered what the craze of the &#34;hunger games&#34; was about. But man, I could not put my kindle down for a moment. Read the entire series in 3 days!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was hard to put down I practically read the while thing in one day! The end of the book get a a little slow but make sure to  have some tissues near!!
B000NTPDSW|2.0|The resoltion with the original Godfather blue ray disc is terrible, I did not enjoy watching one of my favorite movies. I have not viewed the other discs yet.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is the best 007, in my opinion.  I love Daniel Craig and he is the best since Sean Connery.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat is a huge problem in our modern world.  The number of illnesses and symptoms associated with this &#34;frankenfood&#34; is astonishing.  I think everyone should check to see how wheat may be affecting their health.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I would have loved it, but I hate reading the f word over and over.  I didn't think that was necessary.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Book is great it will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Some very unexpected twists and very well written.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I think that Katniss should have just killed Snow. That is the one big thing that she should have done. Also I think Gale and Katniss would be better  than her and Peeta because in the very beginning Katniss had in a way fake love for Peeta.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This is a very concluding book of the trilogy, but not nearly as riveting as the first book. Though Larsson is a great author that keeps his readers turning his pages this book lacked the attention to detail that his first book had. As a reader I felt shuffled between the characters without really gaining a full understanding of anything.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Does what it's supposed to. Adapts my existing power adapters to my new MacBook Pro Retina.  I bought several to have them at the office and home.
B00846REIS|3.0|A very similar novel to the Shades of Gray trilogy. Not a bad read, but again at times I felt like I was reading Gray.
B000002J09|4.0|Other than some audiophile snobbery about preferring the LP, I have nothing but great things to say about this album.<br /><br />I'd been wanting to get the CD for a while, as LP's are hard to play on your MP3 player or in the car.  My daughter's band had the opportunity to play with Mark Wood (of Trans-Siberian Orchestra fame) and they did some Zeppelin music.  Much to my delight she decided to delve further into their catalog.<br /><br />So...we get to share the CD now, and a love for great music.<br /><br />If you've never listened to Led Zeppelin before (how??) this would be a good starting point to introduce their sound to you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series with complex characters set in Post WWI Great Britain. I would recommend to everyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I just got started with this workout DVD and so far I can tell that if you stick with it you will loose , the first time I did it , it kicked my butt and was so sore the next day!  I will update later after I've done it a while.
B004WY2M8I|4.0|i am very pleased with the e-dict and go to function. however, if the e-dict can modify a little so that it includes every single word in the book that would be better. i always expect more from the e-dict.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|The second book in the Mercy Falls trilogy does  not disappoint.  Fast paced and highly imaginative the story maintains high reader interest throughout the entire book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Very suspenseful and quirky, the plot twisted and not anticipated.  Would recommend theis book to anyone
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This was a fast paced Bond movie reminiscent of some of the earliest movies in the series.  It wasn't written by Ian Fleming, but it is just as good.  Can't wait to watch it again
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book.  I enjoyed the twists and turns in this novel.  Since I remember the assassination of JFK and was a young girl during that time it was even more enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|THis was a great book with the right about of love and passion and makes be want to get a HOPELESS tat now
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a great and intricate story, well told.  The casting is perfect.  The costumes are fabulous! It left me wanting MORE!
B007SXB498|5.0|My absolute favorite story of all time and I can and will read it again and again. It is such an easy read with love, passion, and intellectual exchange. If you have never read this story it is a MUST READ.
1932100660|5.0|Just want to note that I took a look through all of the negative reviews here. As a freelance writer myself, I know that there are writing gigs out there that actually hire people to write product reviews, and I also know that there are people who work for companies who post good reviews to promote their products and bad reviews of the competition. That should come as no surprise, unless you're really naive. To see that all of these negative reviews repeat the same points and they are all long-winded and supposedly fact-laden makes me really question if they are legitimately from the common users. All of a sudden all of these people have time to write these long reviews that aren't so typical for most other books here on Amazon, and of course, this is a book promoting a plant-based, cruelty-free lifestyle that, if more people adopted, would harm the ridiculously profitable industries that exploit animals, namely the meat and dairy industries.<br /><br />Read the book and then learn more from other scientific sources, and adopt the vegan lifestyle to see how much your health benefits from it when you do it correctly.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a slower read than I expected as I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan. the story was well written and had suspense in all the right places with love and need to keep reading to find out what happens to the characters
B004U8VX2M|5.0|i have been a fan of Upstairs Downstairs for years.  so glad to see it again.<br /><br />stories, costumes and settings are fabulous
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for the new season to be available. This was the best season. I loved being able to watch it on amazon video.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Selected this for our monthly Book Club.  Everyone enjoyed the book and especially being familiar with the area made the adventure even more personal as we could truly picture the places she was.  Totally recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|First, I must say that I am a Nicholas Sparks fan and have read and enjoyed nearly all of his books.<br />However, my big fault with this Book is the repetition.  The author uses the exact same phrases multiple times throughout the book.  I understand that other authors do similar things but they don't use the exact same phrase.  The author could have used other phrases or imagery to convey the same meaning instead of the continued repetition.  This would have made the book a lot more interesting to read.<br />Also, the ending with Jo was intriguing and when the book was over I felt like I wanted to know more.
B005COO1X6|2.0|The general plot would be good for a children's book.  Boring and predictable.  I would expect much better at this point.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|imangi studios has again done an awesome job on the new and improved just for kids to enjoy temple run 2!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|this is a badass book. This wasw so awesome because it just filled me with excitement at the really good parts (excuse my language)
0671449028|5.0|I love this book and I love reading it to my nephew. I thing I love it more than he does. It also help to get him use to the bed time process.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Completely addictive.  Best value...especially since it is free. Finished about half. Gets better and better. I recommend this game for anyone. Even my wife loves it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|We have quite a few games on our Kindle Fire, this one is played more than any other.  The competition between us too if fun.  Challenging.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This games a fun time passer but it's so repetitive that it gets boring fast. I like it, I just wish there was more to it.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|heard it at friends' house...ordered it next day.  if you are a stones' fan, you must have this cd.  many hits on one disc.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Finally a game with some variety! I was the option to purchase games with in credit points was more realistic but the mini games are great!
B0072OFM28|5.0|i am a huge fan of the show and in the stores it runs for 30 bucks so lucky i found it!
B009CPJHY4|2.0|this movie was not what I expected. I found it to be more confusing than entertaining. Can't win them all
B008N9AASC|5.0|An overview on human existence.<br />By this film it's possible to understand our actual nature as living species on this planet.<br />Wake up your mind !
B00471TLZS|5.0|Classic. I loved it growing up and I wanted to share the experience with my wife. Its still an awesome movie. She is not a big horror movie fan, but she did like this one. its a winner
B007REV4YI|4.0|I was expecting more from the third Daniel Craig installment.  The story was weak and had no relation to the previous two.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Fits in your pocket and does a good job.  I am old school when it comes to my knife and sharpening it but this produce works very well.  100 strokes on each and you have a sharp knife.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|One of the best Star Trek movies available.  Great story, awesome visuals (space battle!!), and the Borg...what more could you ask for?
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I watched the movie first and loved it. The book was much different, but just as enjoyable. I definitely recommend.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I purchased this DVD movie because I loved Looney Tunes when I was a little kid especially Space Jam. Plus, I wanted to have some movies around the house for when my niece and nephews came to visit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book, because the unexpected has happened at every turn. It has kept my interest and attention. Good writing!
1419705849|5.0|I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my twin nephew's because they have the whole collection of books and they have seen and they have all the movies that have come out to this date.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It and its sequel were easy reads that will touch your heart in many ways. You find yourself pulling for the couple wanting them to make it, but the slight twist leaves you wondering if they can. Take the time and read both these warming stories.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I rented this movie and watched it in Amazon's Instant Video. I really like the movie it was very funny.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This is a terrific novel. In my opinion, it starts by tempting your interest w/ a very unique theme, it gains a bit of steam as the story develops just before it tappers off into a more mundane, Groundhog Day-esque, nature. Alas, if you keep reading, it emerges like a Phoenix and goes into over-drive for the remaining thrid of the book. Just trudge through the middle section & you'll be in for a treat.<br /><br />Total page turner!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I purchased this app for my kindle Fire, so I wouldn't have to log in through the Internet every time I want to check my email.  This Yahoo mail app works great!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I first saw the trailers on television for The Hunger Games, I thought, &#34;ewww who would want to see that? But a few friends read the books and raved about them so I decided to take a chance. And they were worth It! I didn't want to put it down at all and just kept reading at every chance I got!But I just did not want to see the books end. Of course they did and at some point in time I may just read them again even though once I have read a book I will not do a re-read.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|The extra content in the directors cut makes this a much better film. I felt like I was watching a new movie.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love the case it's my favorite color and it holds the kindle fire HD 7 in place I had no problems with shipping . The case even arrived a day early  !!!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love the walking dead, can not beat the cost of this movie, looked all over and it was the lowest price I could find. Movie arrived on time and no damage to the case, good picture quality.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Felt it was overall good but very slow. I Kept waiting and waiting for the next thing to happen !
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The children love this movie, the price was right and the shippment came as expected, no damage t the movie and picture quality is very good.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I sure wish that you could make the camera both front and rear leading.  It takes beautiful pictures but the camera  part is not easy to use to take pictures of other people and objects.
B0053O89JM|5.0|The movie was priced just right and it showed up when expected, No damage and picture quality is very good.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game to pass the time when there is nothing else to do.  One of the better games you provide
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has a way with telling stories that makes you feel as though you are living it - you become so engrossed in the characters lives you forget that you are actually reading it.  I read this book in three days, but it only took me that long because I am a busy mom.  When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it, and now, a week after I've read it, I can't stop thinking about it!  Great read, I really think you'll enjoy it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Mostly kids game and it gets boring after a while Not a good game for very young kids as it teaches them to be aggressive and angry
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|a twist on the Rapunzel tale - with a female protagonist who doesn't take any crap from anyone except her &#34;mother&#34;. The twist on the story is very fun and well done, and as I said in the headline - the kids sat still as if captivated by the movie.<br /><br />From a technical perspective - the water, hair and movements of the characters was extremely well done. I dont remember any other movie or videogame doing hair animation so well - I was quite amazed.<br /><br />The movie zips along without any real lull in the action, and of course has a happy ending which makes everyone happy.<br /><br />Great movie - highly recommended!
B000HKYOK0|3.0|Funny how far we have come electronically.  Watching this old series with its outdated &#34;futuristic&#34; electronics is amusing.  But it was entertaining!
B00ADQ7JCS|4.0|John Young, Frosty Beedle and Nick Beggs have done a wonderful job here - with help from Steve Hackett and others. John's compositions are very well done, the rhythm section of Frosty and Nick is tight and wonderful. I really enjoyed this album from start to finish, with the flute & guitar melody in track 5 sticking with me throughout my entire commute to work, humming as I was walking around from meeting to meeting through the day, then back in the car for the drive home and finally humming as a lullaby to my kids as they fell asleep - just wonderful stuff!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B005V1WZ10|4.0|Korn have led an enormously successful, influential, and original career. Starting with their self-titled debut album in 1994, and continuing on to spearhead the rap/rock crossover movement in 1998 with that year's \\"Follow The Leader,\\" there have been innumerable imitators that have followed the alt/nu-metal prototype created by this Bakersfield-bred quintet.<br /><br />And here we go again. After releasing a \\"back to roots\\" effort in 2010, Korn returned the following year with their tenth full-length, \\"The Path Of Totality.\\" This album successfully blends together the band's patented nu-metal sound with elements of dubstep and electronic music. As a result, there are multiple guest appearances from dubstep artists throughout this record -- there is at least one per song. The likes of Skrillex, Noisia, Excision, Downlink, 12th Planet, and Feed Me all lend their names to one song or another at some point. Regarding this musical fusion, frontman Jonathan Davis has been quoted as saying \\"I want to trailblaze. I want to change things.\\" And that is precisely what he and his gang do, here; because with \\"The Path...\\", Korn has created a new generation of dubstep-metal bands (including Periphery and Asking Alexandria, two groups that have released dubstep remixes of songs.)<br /><br />\\"Chaos Lives In Everything\\" has a positively danceable and jazzy drum fill in its intro, followed by electronic and futuristic-sounding synth beeps, and soaring, melodically-sung choruses. And these choruses are made even catchier and more memorable when they are followed up by very brutal and slamdanceable breakdowns to lead off the subsequent verses. \\"Kill Mercy Within\\" takes a concertedly less-heavy root, though, as it is a near power ballad highlighted by good, accomplished clean singing. Next comes \\"My Wall,\\" which marries hooky, staccato beats and pulsing, beeping, throbbing bass lines in the verses with downright soaring and anthemic vocals in the choruses.<br /><br />\\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" and \\"Get Up!\\" are two other highlights, as they are both hit lead singles. The former tune is one of the catchiest things that Korn have ever penned, and is also easily the band's best and most infectious single since \\"Here To Stay\\" came out in 2002. And the latter tune features deft DJ scratches, heavy, pounding guitar hooks, and a particularly fat bass tone. (Fieldy lays down some really fat and meaty bass riffs throughout the track's four-minute playing time.) And, of course, \\"Get Up!\\" also has huge, and instantly memorable choruses, too.<br /><br />From that point on, whether flirting with Nine Inch Nails-like swing (\\"Illuminati\\"), dipping into distinctly Manson-inspired melodrama (\\"Sanctuary\\"), or opting for outright mosh-able moments (\\"Let's Go\\" almost takes a page out of the hardcore playbook, and \\"Way Too Far\\" might darn well be the record's heaviest song), \\"The Path Of Totality\\" never relents in its interestingness and unpredictability. \\"Burn The Obedient\\" is another standout, as it is a bass-heavy/driven tune. And the set closer, \\"Bleeding Out,\\" is also worth noting, as it is filled with a cool piano line, schizophrenic synth work, and crunching guitar and bass riffs. And it is further highlighted by an excellent, spot-on bagpipe solo to end.<br /><br />\\"The Path...\\" might not dethrone Opeth or Machine Head for being \\"Album of the Year\\" material; but it is, without a doubt, one of the most wildly innovative and successfully experimental hard rock/heavy metal releases of 2011. Therefore, everybody who was a fan of Korn before is highly encouraged to check this album out; and if you never liked Korn, you still should.ibal\\" and \\"Get Up!\\" are two other highlights, as they are both hit lead singles.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I put off buyong this because of the title and cover. I was very pleased to discover that there was very little JFK &#34;coverage&#34; that I thought would be a big part of the story. Glad I finally purchased.
006135323X|5.0|Great book.  Everyone should read it.  Gives some real insight as to why people (me included) make decisions that simply don't make sense.  It lead me into the world of behavioral economics.  Its a newer area of economic study, but very palatable for the layman.  You should also check out Freakonomics which covers the same subject matter with a little better storytelling.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Highly recommended! This book has the power to deeply impact and change your life. A must-read. Pick it up today!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game! But I wish it would cool it with the advertisements in the beginning of the game.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Like it back then when it  first came out and its even much clearer, fun to watch on blu-ray as often as possible.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Bruce at long last accepts that he has no hair.<br />the time travel was done well, though I think the PK part was just a distraction in the over all movie.<br />the story was good but some of the plot holes were SO HUGE.<br />great action<br />and Gordon Lovit's portrail of a young Bruce Willis was great, and had I not seen Bruce Willis in Moonlighting back in the day I could have been convinced that they were indeed the same person.
B008NW67E0|5.0|It is nice to listen to. I like the singer's voice, and the rythm is great. I love the banjo in the background.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|not really to my taste, the teddy bear could have been replace by any slacker and it would have been almost the same movie.  the hook is a teddy bear that drinks, smokes pot, does coke, and has sex with hot women.  with a minor in coming of age.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|When l saw this book rated so high, I had my doubts but that was put to rest within the first chapter. I could not put the book down.  Have downloaded 2 and 3 and can't wait to read more about Thor's adventures.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|I remember reading this when it came out in comic book form, the artwork and story are very true to the original.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I thought that Downton Abbey is really great,  but I was missing an episode.  Other than that it was great.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I think the time travel aspect was handled very well, perhaps a physicist was consulted.  It had more story/plot than the second one, though without the real dynamic of the first.  I would watch it again.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A good read with some keen insights into the human condition. A page turner with a satisfyingly ending. I recommend it.
B001O22ELQ|5.0|friends had recomended this to me for a couple of years.  I at last rented it, and had to buy it.  wow.  the bad guy writing a blog and telling about his evil plans that is being read by the police and the super hero guy.  HAHAHA.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I am a few days into the workout and I love it. It is an intense and quick workout. It works out the entire body and you definitely feel it the next day. The way it is broken up into 3 circuits of strength, cardio and abs makes the workout go by quick. I would definitely recommend this workout video.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent read... Good pacing...<br />I want to learn more about Pat Peoples and Tiffany. Picked this up after the Oscars and I'm glad I did.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love this series, and nearly everything about it.  A great contemporary take on a classic series.  Moffat is still a genius.  The only thing I didn't like about it is that they haven't continued the series with a &#34;Return of Sherlock Holmes&#34; style comeback (yet).
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I thought from Thrift Shop that the album might just be a good time&#62; i was pleasantly surprised when I listened to the other tracks and found a variety. I might be late to the game, but I was an instant fan.
1451695195|4.0|This is one man's journey to another realm.  He succumbed to a disease he should not have acquired.  Physically, any part of his brain that should have been an explanation for his experience was dead.  He recovered (Miracle) without any mental deficits (he should have been a vegetable) and eventually returned to his profession of brain surgery.  This experience changed his life!
034580404X|4.0|I loved this trilogy so much I read it twice, but this set was purchased for my American pen friend.<br />Despite the really bad reviews these books got on the UK Amazon site I totally disagreed with most of them. I found the writing style very refreshing, it was almost as if the author and myself were sitting in a bar chatting. Much better than some of the drivel written by writers of romantic novels.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have found this app very helpful for it's function. I wish all the apps I purchase would perform  as well as this one has.

B008QMMEOE|4.0|My son loves this.  My only complaint is that sometime the pieces will be lined up but will not fall into place.  Doesn't seems to bug him to much though.  He has played all the puzzles several times.  He also likes the bubbles/balloons you can pop when you finish the puzzle.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I mainly listen to hip-hop and R&B, but I must say that this music is awesome. It makes me feel happy listening to it, its something about British artists. i feel like they are giving Adele a run for her money.

B0095P31L6|4.0|We enjoyed this film. As usual, Johnny Depp is fantastic. The storyline is a bit loose in places - like it doesn't know where it is going - then it turns itself around into a hero... oh wait, that is the storyline!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|excellent book. tells how snipers develop their skills, also on how they depend on other troops from the different forces.<br />one big family defending the USA and the people for the liberties and freedom we have.<br />so sorry for the family when Chris was shot. may he rest in peace.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Lena struggles with the decisions she makes while Ethan suffers from lost love.  This brings the story into focus until... well you know, the whole story blows up into a new and exciting adventure filled with evil, intrigue and LOVE!  Must read for those who crave excitement!

B00B5HQL50|3.0|I am old school when it comes to Bond. I am not too crazy about excessive violence. The usual Bond &#34;charm&#34; was missing. This was more like another action thriller than a Bond movie.<br /><br />Like I said, it wasn't so bad, but.....
B000X5SPBI|5.0|The whole entire series is amazing! I got my boyfriend hooked into the show and he says there needs to be a warning label that reads &#34;Warning may cause addiction&#34; I don't know anyone who can sit there after watching the first season through and NOT be addicted! Best show on the planet!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It was a great movie and I wish I would've bought instead of just renting. I would watch it over and over!

B000E5KJES|1.0|The DVD was bad. It played only half disk then stopped. I tried too many times but it still the same. I already sent email to the seller to exchange a new DVD  but no respond yet in two weeks.<br /><br />  Thanks anyway

B00ATCVA4O|3.0|A mix of all the 80s glam sound rolled up into a raw entertaining mix of guitars, drums and vocals.  Very easy album to listen to.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series. Can't wait til Season four comes on! Watched Season one on Netflix.  The quality on Amazon was great. The purchase process was very user friendly.
B005VTS4EY|2.0|Would love to give it 5 stars, but it won't run without a connection to the internet, which makes me want to suggest one of the other apps that have the same gametype (assuming they're any better).

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I researched a lot of backpack camera bags before purchasing this one.  I have to admit the modest price tag made me question the quality of this product. Comparable bags run around $100 (i.e. Lowe). After reading the reviews I decided to purchase it.  I will never regret it. This bag has everything I would ever need. I have been using it for about 3 months and find more to love about it everytime I go out with my camera. It holdseverything I need and then some! I would highly recommend this bag.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|This movie was well done. I learned much about Bob Marley and his influence beyond the music. A must see!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Just had to read this before hitting the cinema to see it.  I love Sparks, don't find him to be sappy at all.  That said, I didn't think this was his best work.  Very predictable, a little slow at times.  Saw everything coming, except for the end!  OK, he did well with that!  Knew one character had more to add, really loved how that worked out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|just started reading and am having a hard time setting it down. start is slow but once you get past first few pages it picks up fast

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It's just appalling what happened to this poor woman. I picked this up and couldn't put it down after a Facebook recommendation from a friend.  Insightful and inspirational how Jaycee came out of this situation a whole person.
0143119680|4.0|I liked it, different approach, I even pre-ordered the next one (and was sorry).<br /><br />That being said, not sure exactly why it was so compelling. An enchantment spell, perhaps?<br /><br />I think the draw was that she writes of what she knows. The wine parts were great, the history was accurate but not hitting you over the head with it. The people were genuine people.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun for all the family decent plot and some interesting and varied mini games. Graphics and sound effects very good, although like most games sound is turned off after fist half hour
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book captured me, and I am certain that it will remain in my personal top 20 list forever.  The story was mesmerizing.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is a must see! It does such a good job of stressing the importance of fatherhood and in our culture that is so rare! Even without it's Christian message, this movie stands on its own as a very fine film. I have share it with many friends with very diverse viewpoints and they all were deeply moved and inspired by it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|this is a great book. I'm just sorry Chris is no longer with us. I would recommend this book to everybody
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a fabulous and a very easy read! I am so glad I read it before I saw the movie:)!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a very touching movie.  There is a shooting scene in it but the way it was done, does not emphasize violence at all.  Makes the movie exciting enough to keep everyone interested.  Very well done and a wonderful message that families in our nation desperately need!
B004QX07G4|3.0|I am an avid reader and I love to watch ellen's show, so I bought her book. All i can say is that it was a lot of rambling. Some parts were funny, but I don't think it was worth the buy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down.  Being in the computer science field, I found the topic especially interesting.  This is my first Tom Clancy book so I am unable to compare this book to past work by the author as other reviewers have done.  I can attest, however, that I will be looking to download other Tom Clancy books after reading this one.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A well written suspensful novel that has great flow.  You cannot put the book down once you have picked it up.

B00130EVSS|5.0|This is an EXTRAORDINARY film. However, it is also a story involving an extremely violent portrayal of Russian mob violence. Since Eastern Promises takes place in England, where gun ownership is minimal, all the violence involves beating, strangulation and death by knife. In many ways it is far more visceral, brutal and terrifying than if the protagonists used guns.  Viggo Mortensen is absolutely convincing as a mob enforcer.  .

B000FC1PNE|4.0|Mousy,plain, no personality to speak of, Penelope Featherington loves Colin Bridgerton, who is so handsome and charming. Penelope has loved Colin since she was fifteen. Now she is twenty-eight and still single and still in love with Colin. She is best friends with Eloise, one of Colin's sisters and since she is at Eloise's home often, she sees Colin a good bit since he has returned from his travels. As inept as she is around most men, Penelope is able to talk with Colin and he with her. As they spend more time in conversations, she learns of Colin's talent for writing and encourages him in this area, probably the first person to ever recognize his talent. Colin begins to see subtle changes, some attractive ones even, in Penelope that he had not noticed before and wonders why he now sees them.

0316187216|3.0|I have enjoyed all of the books set in this universe.  However, Abercrombie seems to be running out of steam.  This latest novel lacks the scope and intrigue of his prior books.  He also was trying to be cute with hiding a major character's past and tries too hard to bring other characters from his past books into play.  It may be time for Abercrombie to start a new series.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is this reviewer's favorite Hitchcock movie.  It shows a man of action and adventure L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) laid low by an accident (the movie implies an incident at a racetrack) and confined to a wheel chair and a cast.  Jefferies has been so confined for some time and is only a week away from getting the cast cut off.  Bored, hot and chafing under his plaster fetters, Jefferies begins to spy on his neighbors.<br /><br />Jefferies' neighborhood is one that simply invites a voyeur.  He simply looks out the rear window across a quadrangle lot into the windows and lives of perfect strangers.  One is a lonely woman, another a frustrated songwriter, a retired couple and their dog, newlyweds, a sculptor, a dancer, and finally a traveling salesman who has a nagging, invalid of a wife.<br /><br />Our voyeur can only surmise the private going-ons of his subjects, but he studies them intensely.  The audience is also drawn to his watching, and with Jefferies, they draw the same conclusions.<br /><br />Jefferies focused observations of his neighbors is contrasted by his lack of introspection.  He is desperately courted by Lisa, played by none other than Grace Kelly but he is unable to commit to such a woman.  Instead he pushes her away.<br /><br />One evening something happens that make him suspect that there has been a murder-and the hitherto beached man of action rapidly starts to search for clues and bring others into his project of bringing the suspect, Lars Thorvald (Raymond Burr) to justice.  As the movie progresses the people Jefferies watches begin to have intensifying personal troubles that parallel Jefferies troubles in search for the truth.  In an ironic twist, Jefferies feelings for Lisa only surface when he sees her through the Rear Window.<br /><br />The movie is packed with a tremendous sense of danger, sexual tension, and gore of murder but these things are subtly hinted at and are carefully wrapped in a movie set of artistic beauty.  In different viewings this movie's thick detail can be enjoyed differently each time.  The first time you watch, the suspense is overwhelming, the second Jefferies bone-headed stubbornness can only be marveled at, finally you can feel sympathy for Thorvald-who almost brakes free from a terrible, grating burden only to be stopped by a man of action in a wheel chair.fferent viewings this movie's thick detail can be enjoyed differently each time.

B000W4SE6G|3.0|Our world is indeed out of balance because there are too many people, but this film seems to be sending the message that it's our fault. It isn't. Nature made us this way and now we have to pay the terrible price of overpopulation. Koyannisqatsi says we are to blame. The truth is much more terrible: we are victims of nature.

044024630X|3.0|I have read all of Lee Child's Reacher novels, and this one, like all of them, is a page turner. I'm a slow reader, but this one only took a few days of off and on reading to finish. That said, with all Reacher novels, there is a certain amount of &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; that you have go through. With this one, the amount was much higher. To paraphrase another reviewer, what are the odds that four of the most beautiful women in the world all live in the same small Mississippi town? And one of them happens to be the sheriff of the town. Reacher, an Army major, is sent to the town under cover to try to solve a murder that seems to involve someone on a nearby Army base. The spectacularly beautiful and sexy female sheriff is immediately on to his under cover act and tells him to leave town. He refuses and then she apparently thinks, &#34;well, okay, I'll sleep with him instead.&#34; They like to make love and climax just as the midnight train roars through town, shaking the room and everything in it violently. It heightens their thrill.<br /><br />Another point of disbelief is that Reacher kills people with impunity, among them: a superior Army officer in the officer's Pentagon office, and a U.S. Senator. Of course, it doesn't matter that he is witnessed doing the killings, and the witnesses have no problem with them. The ones he kills are bad guys and Reacher is allowed to kill bad guys, so the reader is led to believe. After killing the senator and the senator's son, which is witnessed by the spectacular sheriff, Reacher and the sheriff go back to the hotel and make love while the midnight train shakes them violently in their bed, as usual. Oh, and the midnight train is the coverup for the senator's death, because he and his son are left dead in a car on the train tracks, so the train will hit them at 70 MPH and destroy all evidence of how they were killed.<br /><br />Lastly, the beginning of the book happens in the Pentagon after all of Reacher's goings-on in the Mississippi town. It ends with Reacher leaving the town and driving to the Pentagon for whatever awaits him there. But the beginning and the end don't agree with one another.<br /><br />Why did I give it three stars? As I said, it is a page turner, and, despite its flaws, it still entertains.in the Mississippi town. It ends with Reacher leaving the town and driving to the Pentagon for whatever awaits him there.

B000FC1MCS|3.0|I choice this rating because I find myself reading it just to finish it.  He took everything far afield - it certainly hasn't held my interest!  I'll be glad to finish it - I'm at 77 percent done and really couldn't tell you anything about the book.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for reading - or my mind was on other things while I was reading.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen, even consider her a friend! - as in, -I feel I could easily hang out & chat with her like old friends, after just meeting face to face for the first time. :-)<br />But seriously... I enjoyed this book. It's the first of hers I've read so far, and I will most likely read one or more of the others - after I check out the reviews. It was a \\"light\\" read for me - as well as a relatively quick one. For its light-heartedness, it scores well. No really revealing information - but entertaining, like Ellen's show.<br />Honestly, I was hoping that this book would offer more insight into the life of this talented comedian... I truly admire Ellen, and would love to know more about what makes her *who* she is. Perhaps one of her earlier books tells more of her story.<br />Overall, if you want to \\"LOL\\"-  which I did often - this book will deliver.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very interesting with a lot of twists and turns. This show reminds me a little bit of old The X-Files.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's hard to put into words, but I'll try...This book brought me back to High School, where most of us go through these raw emotions ourselves, and we feel so alone at times. There's little bit of Wallflower in all of us and,as I read this book, I learned more about my young self, and realized many things about who I am now... I hope this makes sense :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl is a very good writer and this is a very therapeutic book.  As she endures hardship you become inspired with respect to your daily existence.  Even if you are not much of an outdoors person, her trek is motivating and I find myself wanting to hike through the woods and look at tall trees even if I would never consider the Pacific Coast Trail.  I did not anticipate liking this book so much.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|All is right, Thank you<br /><br />I hope that the third Season will be as good as the previous two.<br /><br />Bye
B005HSL626|4.0|I absolutely love this app.  if you are reading this review, I would strongly suggest buying this app.  thank you for reading. bye.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|To all Fast and Furious Fanatics this is a must buy for your collection as the heist seen at the end of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat.  The story is amazing and the cinematography is astounding.  They deter from just the cars and create a well thought out story and piece it all together in a nice package.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Like its predecessor, &#34;Sherlock Holmes,&#34; with many of the same actors, this film brings another era to life as if it were the present day. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law's Holmes and Watson are a wonderful pair, bickering their way through dangerous adventures, and the addition of Stephen Fry as Holmes' &#34;smarter brother&#34; is delicious as well.<br /><br />Who knew that Sherlock Holmes was an action hero, not just an armchair philosopher? The folks who read the original stories, and didn't just watch the older films, that's who.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This app is a lot of fun.  I have always loved pinball since I was a child.  Now in my 50 plus years I still love it.  The games are fun and it really is like playing with a real pinball machine in front of you.  If you love pinball you will love this app.
1935597760|5.0|Touching, funny, and horrific. This is a carefully knit together novel - not a slap-dash modern romance. I thought the Irish accents were entertaining and the horrifying experiences in the 1940's orphan workhouse were as tastefully presented as such distasteful subjects can be. The surprise ending caught me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think that this game is the best kindle game ever. It makes me want to use my kindle more than before.
0316187216|4.0|Western themed tied into Epic fantasy - I honestly thought it couldn't be done well. I was wrong. This was amazing. Having read most of Joe Abercrombie's works, I knew he was a great author. This book just reinforced that.<br /><br />It was gritty, painfully bloody and intense. I felt an itch between my shoulder blades through out the entire thing.<br /><br />This was solid, stark and great for one you're in one of those moods to just punch someone in the face. Not to mention, it dealt with moral issues, decisions that are not easy and basic determination to get back what's yours and right.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. You get attached the characters both American and German. I also liked how the author told the story from both sides. A well written book and an amazing story that should have been told years ago.
0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain's book was a total relief for me to read. I admit when I finished it I spent a number of weeks holed up in self-rightous creative solitude. It was great! I do love my friends though, but am happy to have this new perspective as to why I just hate it so much when they have parties!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun for adults and kids, great to pass back and forth on a plane or a long car trip!<br />Good variety of difficulty in levels.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|We loved it. The cast and storylines are both great. I liked it much more than season 1. I can't wait til season 3.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This dvd is totally eye-popping even if you followed what happened during one of the biggest scams pulled on the American people and global population. Very worth the money!!
0786956291|5.0|I got it in good condition and it was exactly what i expected it to be. I enjoy it greatly
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a great dvd to watch with your kids. It has a great message for kids and adults as well. Kept me interested throughout the whole dvd. It is well-written and well-produced. Computer animation.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Game is really interesting I love hidden objects games like this, you have to keep em comming. Kudos to th ok s one.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|this was right up my ally answered a lot of questions for me and told me things that was going on that are pretty bad that we really did to do something about and stop.
1599290634|5.0|Uno de los mejores hasta la fecha. Bellas imagenes y suficiente material. Gran cantidad de arte contemporanea de alta calidad y lo mejor de los ultimos tiempos, excelente recopilacion de imagenes , recomendado para los amantes del arte fantastica y futurista.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|watched this move years ago it opened my eyes then and still leaves me with the same impact, just a shame that Mr. Al Gore didn't mention the impact that raising so much beef as on the environment, could be because his family raises beef.Shame Mr. Gore
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|I would have never guessed that a movie geared for kids would have such evil undertones.  We watched this with movie with our 4 year old and will definitely review our G rated selections more carefully in the future.  Witches, spells, and a mother turning into a bear definitely raised questions and caused angst for our daughter.  Ugh.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel was very believable and the flight scenes were terifyingly real. I cannot imagine if it were me on the flight and never would want to go through what the passengers and crew went through.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I did like the movie, but this story makes so much more sense. You can even assume Matthew Quick's writing style is less about his limitations as a writer and more about his skill rendering the prose of a brain damaged man.  In the movie, I was pleasantly distracted from life for 90 minutes or so. Reading this book, I was moved and sent into some thought provoking funk for days. Don't read that as a bad thing--catharsis is a classic Greek thing you know. All in all a good illustration of how a decent book is so much more of a though provoking experience than a pretty good movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The movie would not play on Amazon so we had to order it on Dish. I just wanted people to know this is a gret movie that deserved the 4 stars.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Imagine if one of your old favorite TV shows was resurrected with a ton of special effects and a huge production budget. Here you go with the new Doctor. I really like all the new Docs, each has their strengths. Matt Smith takes the baton and keeps things going-you won't be disappointed.  (I predict.)
0060527986|5.0|Paulo Coelho writes in such a spiritually elevating way, particularly in this book about overcoming failure and maintaining a warrior spirit as you pursue your own destiny. I think this is something that connections with everyone and is what makes Paulo such a beloved author. This book is different than some of his better known stories ([[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]], [[ASIN:006133880X The Witch of Portobello]], etc.) because it is a manual - basically a collection of short thoughts good for one or two a day - but is equally inspiring and impacted me in a great way. It is easily read in one sitting but I think works best if read in small bursts and digested slowly over a period of a few weeks or a month as the ideas sink in. I also think he intended for The Alchemist to be read before this, so I would read that first if you haven't.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris can be heard on NPR pretty often. It's not necessary to hear him in order to enjoy his books. But if you do hear him, you can read his stuff with the sound of his delivery echoing inside your head and laugh even more. A little 'rude' for sensitive folks, but certainly he is one of the best resources of humor in the last century--at least.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It only took 40 years, but the world finally has met the sugarman.  Rodriguez is a very talented singer-songwriter, without question the best the world had never seen!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This jrpg starts slow and does not impress initially.  The graphics are so-so and the animation is lacking.  Music is average, with only a few memorable tunes.  However, the story gradually picks up steam and gets exciting in the second half.  The characters are interesting and there are some twists in the story to keep it interesting.  The gameplay starts off simple but gets better as you obtain tablets, which let you customize character combat skills.  It also has a nice intro movie.  Bottom line is that I will definitely try Kemco's other rpg's after having such a positive experience with this one.  Highly recommended even if the first few hours are kind of boring.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I reviewed season one and it was a glowing endorsement. Season two continues with the same quality of writing, directing, set and costume design, acting, editing, sound...well you get the idea. Somewhere along the way of watching season two I realized it had turned into more of a soap opera than the drama it had been. I kept hoping some characters would get married or at least decide they would, others would find there way through a wilderness of obstacles to finally be able to be together; there are other plot threads all that smacked more of melodrama than attempts, no matter how futile attempts in that vein are, to portray a &#34;realistic&#34; set of characters and circumstances. But you know, I didn't care since I was so captured by those characters and their stories in the first season. My wife and I watched the first two seasons with a fervor reminiscent of the &#34;Battlestar Galactica episode of Portlandia&#34;. We have so far managed to keep our jobs, but if there is a season 4 who can say. I love this series.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Made me understand myself and be proud to be an introvert. Its difficult being an introvert in a largely extrovert world. Definite once read.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I do not know why I have to write 19 words to submit just a feedback I seriously mean it
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really enjoyed Argo, even after reading about the inconsistencies with the &#34;real&#34; story.  I think it would have been just as good without the extra &#34;drama&#34; added, especially to the ending.  I was a teenager in the 80's and very much remember the hostage crisis.  This was a chapter of the story that I'd never heard of until this movie.  It was so interesting to see this movie and remember how it felt to watch the Iran hostage crisis unfold.  The movie was well done and I was happy to see it won the Oscar for Best Picture.  I saw all 9 of the nominated films, and it was in my top 3.  I also loved Life of Pi and Django Unchained and would have been happy if any of those 3 had won Best Picture.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series. What a great season, and I absolutely can't wait for Season 3 to be available on Amazon.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great way to pass the time. I was able to get this on a daily deal and have since gotten others from this publisher.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss' major strong point is eloquence in emotive language... and frankly in general. This was the first epic fantasy book I ever read and I've been hooked ever since.
B00966TN1Q|2.0|No surprises, lack of a decent plotline, could have been so much better, get the feeling he is coasting now, his last2 or 3 books have been big disappointments to me.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I didn't care for the movies. The previews lead me to think this movie would go in a different direction then it did.  The movie stopped and buffered at least 10 times.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show....i saw the first 2 seasons of episodes on Netflix and now I order each episode of Season 3 on Amazon...its sooooo good!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|As an American Sniper from the Vietnam Era, I found this book riviting. Could not put it down, Chris Kyle was a Gr8 warrior nand American
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|In this Album producer David Foster obviously explores the more \\"commercial\\" vein of  Andrea Bocelli's voice.  This is not bad nor good, just a matter of taste.  The selection of songs and singer partners reaches a more \\"universal\\" audience resulting in a very rare mix of styles, languages and forms. But Andrea Bocelli's voice remains always the same beautiful voice, and that's is the more important thing.  Brazilian rithms mixes with some spanish \\"boleros\\", old italian encores (also in Naples dialect), adult contemporary pop, french (with Edith Piaf license) and also \\"portuguese\\".  Although all of them seems to mix well in this production.<br />Some things to remark are that the production and arrangements explores Andrea's voice lower register (many \\"baritonesque\\" and \\"piano\\" passages and less \\"fortíssimo\\" \\"lyric tenor\\" ones) and this shows us one of the most warm, intimate and beautiful sides of Andrea's voice.<br />The use of acoustic guitars and violins (strings) solo and ensembles as well as acoustic piano and latin percussion reaches toward an old fashioned, simple and \\"latin passionated\\" orchestration that always is a good accompaniment for Andrea Bocelli's voice, and contributes to give the disc some uniformity and coherence between so many different styles and forms.<br />The CD is an easy listening experience for all who loves Andrea Bocelli's voice and has enough aperture to \\"tolerate\\" the more popular and commercial turn.  But the most important: Andrea's voice still IS the main protagonist and I love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|would recommend this series to everyone, customer service was great, correct product description, no problems at all, on time shipping would do business with you again
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Easier to use than I expected. No problems so far. It has had a positive effect, and I am pleased.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|After all the hype of &#34;Bond is back&#34;, this movie didn't deliver.  A weak plot and just not a good movie.....
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Love this show and it's great to steam season 2 with Amazon Prime. Picture quality is great! Only small negative is that the sound is a bit off (music loud, dialogue low) compared to season 1 on Netflix with the same audio system.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|Okay, it doesn't have force feedback. Guess what? I don't care. It is a blast to use and I don't miss force feedback at all! It's versatile, well built and provides options. Do you want standard shift knob or flappy paddle? Or on what side do you want the shift knob, American or European? Do you want it mounted on a table or on your lap? Both options are provided for you in the way of a table clamp or add-on lap plates. It would have been a tad nicer if an AC wall wort was provided, but that is nit picking.  Some folks complain about the brake and gas pedal being a bit to plastic-y, I think that's not fair, they work just fine. Over all, the $150 +/- price provides lots of fun and a good product. So, to sum it up, if you want a mid priced steering wheel that works with XBox and you don't want to pay 400 to 500 hundred dollars, this one is for you. Now go away and let me get back to racing. Vroom vroom!
B001IMFHTS|5.0|I now own THREE (slightly) different Beethoven cycles with Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic - two on DG CD, and this one on EuroArts DVD.<br /><br />This DVD is the set to have out of the three, and for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The sound is better on these DVDs than either of the CD versions on DG<br /><br />2. The Ninth in this DVD set is a superior version to the one in the DG sets, especially as regards bass soloist Eike Wilm Schulte, who far outclasses Thomas Quastoff's singing on the CD versions (both of which are the same performance)<br /><br />3. The price of this DVD set is a bit less than the \\"purple\\" DG CD 2001 set and about half the price of DG's \\"green\\" set from 2000.<br /><br />Truth be told, I was happy with Abbado's initial release in 2000. I found it to be rather elegant in its approach to Beethoven, which is hardly the norm these days. His \\"apology\\" set from 2001 - as heard on these DVDs and on the DG purple box - is pretty much a sop to HIP practices. The 2000 set still has a lot of Karajan's band in it. The 2001 set is a conscious rejection of the Karajan ethos in favor of a more-aggressive, less-polished approach to Beethoven. I tend to like the Karajan ethos, so I didn't see the need for a remake.<br /><br />But the remake is with us, Abbado is a serious musician who deserves to be heard...and he may best be heard on these DVDs. I say that because it would appear that Abbado has now decided to embrace HIP to a large extent, so if you want his latest thoughts on Beethoven, this is it. I would avoid the DG purple CD set of this cycle as they sort of botched the sound from the DVDs, and it also contains an inferior Ninth. If you're looking for a CD and not a DVD, then I'd advise you go with Abbado's \\"green\\" box from 2000. Don't believe all the marketing hype from both DG and Abbado as regards these two cycles as they appear on CD.<br /><br />BTW - what's with the bland cover art on this DVD issue?<br /><br />Recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|no complaints, works just as intended. nice big buttons,  easy to see, perfectly fine free calculator app. go ahead and just download it, already!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Now I am ready for the movie. Love the characters and the twists in the plot!<br />Great book for a rainy day!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it. Even if a lot of people die. I recommend this awesome series. Their are three books in the series.
0446581356|5.0|the book contain all the basic! Because i have never try any makeup before, so i don't even know what is the difference between lip gross and lip stick. After i read this book, i learn more about make up and cannot wait to try doing make up myself. This book has all the basic techniques. Perfect to beginners! However, If you are not beginner, i don't think this book will help that much though.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story was an excellent mixture of pathos, humor, and realistic characters.  Even though it took a turn I didn't expect, I found it very satisfying.  I didn't want to put it down.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love how in the end it turned out to be pimples and he overreacted.  How funny.  Greg seemed like such a jerk.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The graphics are great.  Dragons are very cute and colorful.  Takes a lot to earn enough money and/or gold to buy things.  Gold is a little expensive when most items take so much gold to get.  Love the way the little creatures move and develope.  Colors are fantastic.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game takes a long time to load and after the wait provides little instruction to figure out how to play it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book was very good, I lovely love story as usual but there are some great twists in the plot.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|I guess this was a special event. I pre-ordered it, and took the day off work. It arrived on time and I dove into it. Yes it's good, as should be no surprise. I was hoping there would be a DVD-A 5.1 mix, but instead this package has the CD, DVD-A stereo and DTS and DD 5.1. The DTS mix is fine, I guess, although I had my heart set on the warmth of a DVD-A 5.1. Still, I quibble, it's a fine album. Very prog, respectfully touching base with such disparate elements as Spectrum era Billy Cobham and Genesis both in Trespass and Lamb eras, with a little Tulla nd Yes, even, but respectfully so, very respectfully so, and not in a cheesy way, just using it all as a part of his palette. I found his guitar playing better than ever, and flawless. Personally I get everything he Wilson produces in 5.1 mix because I love surround and he understands the medium better than anyone else, I think. I remember at the end of the first track, Luminol, thinking that if this were the only track on the album it would be worth it. The album is like a three sided record, really long loud song followed by shorter, softer song, repeated three times. Interesting. Anyway, hard to say much after the first day, before the songs have really sunk in, but the main questions now, is it good, is it worth it? Yes and Yes.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|If I pay $100 for headphones...I damn sure expect them to last a while. I enjoyed these while they lasted, but one day the right side just stopped working and Sony doesn't seem to care...
B008PZ69T8|5.0|It is a very nice collection of all time classics. I rediscovered Bach and Chopin and now looking for good collection of their music. It is very educational, now I can tell almost instantly what the composition is and who the composer is when I hear it somewhere. I love it)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season Three of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; was so enjoyable! I couldn't wait to wach the next episode! I must admit I was a bit disappoinyed in how the last episode ended. But, it will open up a great Season Four!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is very easy to download, easy to use and it makes my life easier. Now most of my college books are digital and I don't have to kill my back every day ;-)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the best game every. I love the way all the different birds go after the litle piggies. I like the different chalanges the game offers.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|I purchaed this album for the songs getting airplay, but every song on the album is great. If you are on the fence, buy the whole album.
B004PGO25O|4.0|It sounds so easy...and it is.  At least getting started.  That doesn't guarantee greatness, but it does beat back the dragons.  And as far as feeling good about moving forward that's what it takes.  Do the work, fight the dragon and keep moving.  If you take the advice Pressfield gives and move forward step by step, you WILL finish your project.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great suspense, great characters, great acting and terrific story.  Sure I had it figured, then changed my mind.  Hard to stop watching.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|Lots of these adapter will not let you hit two directions at the same time but this one does.  I'm using it  with the stepmania dance game and a red octane dance mat.  I didn't install any drivers, it worked out of the box for me. I'm using windows 7 64 bit.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The game play is good and provides enough of a challenge to keep me interested in playing while I want to pass a few minutes here and there. I'd give it 5 stars, except the link to view the Leaderboards does not work, so I can't see my scores except when I set a new record and post to Twitter. Overall, though, the game is very good and I really like it.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I enjoy this film each time I watch it. I like the Louisiana feel. James Lee Burke's books are always looked forward to.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|this video did not stream well. It was slow and never fully loaded. It was grainy and pixilated. I am very disappointed with this and will download shows from itunes next time.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|Writing this review as a warning... skip it.  What a piece of crap.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The storyline is like a fine aged wine... it got better over time...more full, more rich, more intoxicating, even addicting at times.
1609611543|5.0|I've enjoyed the information that this book has to offer.  It has definitely opened my eyes and am hoping for some good weight loss!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The latest book featuring Kay Scarpetta is set in Boston. Kay is emailed an interesting video and the case begins. On the same day, she is called to pull a body from the water and the plot twists and turns from there. Lucy, Marino and Benton are all included as the mystery unravels and the bodies keep piling up.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|This franchise is tired. Deadly dull. Bonds shot in the heart and survives. Then he's shot from a sniper rifle, plunges off a bridge hundreds of feet below. Is this a movie or am I watching a cartoon?
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|We were a little disappointed that Denzel Washington would play the part of a drunk and druggie.  However, he did an excellent acting job.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is a beautiful album and no matter what the reviews say, I will love it. It transports you back to a better time when we would put the Moody Blues on the turntable sit back and enjoy the music. Anne Dudly has brilliant orchestrations on this cd - From Art of Noise and all her solo music and sound tracks. Every song Justin performs on this cd are wonderful. Thank you Justin for thinking of us  music lovers and puttng out something that we can cherish. I could go through each song and disect but I will leave that to you all. it is rare that the second time playing a cd your singing along already. Lazy Afternoon is an instant classic in my opinion.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an excellent love story with some twists that I never saw coming. I highly reccomend this novel!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Seth Macfarlane takes his Family Guy brilliance and applies it to a live action major motion picture. For those who have seen Family Guy will understand what ted is all about: light on plot but laden with crude humor,pop culture references aplenty and cameos by celebrities.<br />For the most part the movie works. There are times when,unlike Family Guy, it tries to get sentimental and a little serious. That is its only flaw.<br />Seth is not afraid to offend as his hosting of the 2013 Oscar event can surely attest to. No ethnicity, group,religious organization or national tragedy is off limits. Many will find that offensive but in an age of rampant political correctness it is a warm welcome. Nothing should be culturally taboo that we can't at least laugh it. Seth Macfarlane just may save our culture from the overly offended and extreme right and left who want you to think and act a certain way.
1250012570|4.0|Meeting on the school bus where Park offers Eleanor his seat when no one else will give up theirs. They soon bond over comic books and music and start hanging out with each other.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park come from two different backgrounds.<br />Park for the most part is okay with who he is, he does not want a lot of attention, but he does want to be accepted.<br /><br />Eleanor's fiery red hair matches her feisty personality. She comes from a poor family, never having enough or the things that she really needs. Her father is horrible, her mom just accepts things for the way they are and does not try to protect Eleanor and her siblings or try to make their lives better. No matter what she goes through, she hangs in there. She is a tough cookie.<br /><br />The story is told from alternating points of view, which helped to get to know Park and Eleanor better. I love stories told this way.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />These two could not have been more different. I liked that even though they were; they took a chance with each other, found things in common, and shared a connection. They were friends who fell in love with each other. It was a sweet, yet emotional ride.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />Reading Eleanor and Park brought back memories of what it was like to fall in love at a young age; the warm fuzzy feelings and the bittersweet moments as well. It is a super cute coming of age story that I instantly fell in love with.<br /><br />** I received this book from St. Martin's Press in exchange for nothing, but my honest review. Thank you!**
B0087JTAKW|3.0|An odd but interesting tale that pulls us out of our presuppositions about time. It kept me reading but wasn't my favorite.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is awesome, makes you think about what you would do if this ever happened in reality. the only downfall was the ending of this season. but it left you hanging so well that it made you start the second season!<br /><br />I would recommend at least trying to watch it, takes 2 or so episodes to get into but after that your hooked.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A good yarn , except I hated the ending.<br /><br />The horse served the enemy and should have been shot for treason.<br /><br />Also the boy stiffed the old man 100 pounds. What a selfish brat. He will live on while the old man only has the horse to hang on to. If I were the old man I would have shot the boy and bury him next to the granddaughter.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Basically a good story line, but some parts hard to believe.  Such as having the baby alone, then accepting help at the last<br />minute.
0393343405|5.0|This is a wonderful read for anyone interested in history or western civilization. I especially enjoy Greenblatt's descriptions of how Rome and Florence appeared to Poggio Bracciolini in and around 1400 AD. The descriptions are so vivid you feel you are there. The Swerve provides great insights into the human condition and helps link and explain the various philosophies which shape our current world view. Truly an exceptional read!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I had figured out the issue with upgrading (needing to uninstall then reinstall from the Amazon Appstore). But...the Amz version is still 6.8, not the 7.0 version on Google Play. If Amazon is going to be a player, it needs to keep up! This is really annoying.<br /><br />Edit: The appstore finally caught up, albeit a few weeks late. We can only hope that this doesn't happen again.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|What an awesome story!  I watched four seasons in two weeks' time and really was sad to see it end.  It was a wonderful story!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|this is a great movie for teenagers and has been enjoyed fully. it was a great value for money also.
B005WFUZTE|2.0|As a frame of referrence, I'm an old school Megadeth fan who loves 'KIMB' through 'Rust In Peace', likes 'Countdown..', and can tolerate 'Cryptic Writings'. The other releases, I can do without.<br /><br />I WANT to like the releases, but they have just been boring for me. I don't know whether I have just bored of their modern sound or if the riffs & songwriting just isn't for me...I just know I don't care for it. This release is no different. My wishes for Megadeth would be to speed things up a little and add some more emotion. Their modern sound seems cold, clinical and \\"by the numbers\\".<br /><br />Since they came out around the same time, a lot of reviewers have mentioned Anthrax's 'Worship Music'. I loved it. 5 star review from me. Great songwriting on display there. Another example of an older band releasing something new and great is Flotsam & Jetsam's 'The Cold. I am not stuck on bands having to sound like their \\"old selves\\", but they still have to write songs I like.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|How can you not be addicted to this show? So many people are hooked on it!  Glad to own it.
B000025XKM|5.0|This CD is mesmerizing and in spite of the darkness Nick Drake endured he created a soothing set of songs.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|If you like Homes. Is is a must have..&#34; I say Homes&#34;<br />Pick it up.. . Great to have. You will be glad you did..
0062127241|2.0|i'm a huge who fan and am so disappointed/bored by this book. the effort is certainly there when it comes to detailing the attendees at recording sessions (yawn) but there is really no emotional life to this book.  examine his recollection of keith's passing, which is terse and unemotional....or compare anecdote about how he developed his windmill technique of playing the guitar with this explanation on david letterman's show and you'll get a sense of what is missing from the book.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game that is like majong, but a lot faster and colorful. I like how the timer ticks while you are playing so you can see if you are close to beating your fastest time. My nieces also like playing it and the are 7 and 9.
B00ABO573A|2.0|I watched this because I'm a fan of Thure Lindhart. He was pretty decent in the film, however I've seen him in much better films. I believe he was limited by the mediocre script, directing and co-actors. This is a run of the mill gay story of a guy trying to save his drug-addict boyfriend. Very basic made for tv movie drivel. Nothing particularly new or interesting happens here.  The story is pretty disjointed and the editing is odd as you never know where you are in the story. They do flash a couple of dates on the screen so you have an idea of what year it is, but it was pointless. Did 8 years actually pass? Much more should've happened. They don't really explore any of the characters in any depth. This probably would've worked better as a short film, or in the hands of a more experienced writer and director.  All in all, Thure was the only good thing about this, and he wasn't all that great.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Wow! Who knew this show would be such a hit? It is a mainstay in out TV line up. Good laughs and fun.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|A must for any Barbra Streisant fan. If you love musicals, you will love this movie. It is just  a great movie
B0095R64AO|4.0|If you like chick flicks, watch it!<br />If you don't, don't!<br />Pretty simple :-) really. You kind of know how these will go but its good entertainment if you like movies
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Simple in principle, but with a surprising amount of depth and replay value. Really fun artwork. Thanks for the new levels!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book, light hearted and funny.  Enjoyed the comical tension between the characters and the Author did a great job keeping you interested.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book got a little strange before it took it's big turn to the story near the end.  It became totally unbelievable, and proved so at the conclusion.  It made me feel like I waseted my time believing the emotion and action in the book, as it approached the deliverence of the message at the end.  Good message, big waste of alot of time before getting to it.
0811876373|5.0|What a great book with so many cute ideas for making cake pops! A must have for people ho want to be crafty with cake!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|If you like sci fi, you're bound to love this show - all seasons are fantastic!  We watch them all.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Out of ALL the Christmas movies we always come back to this one. It is the most special to all of us. Muppets at thier best.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Wow.<br />Here I was thinking that this was a quasi-fictional story about WWII and I'd end up being Impressed but Depressed. WRONG!<br />This showed a slice of the horror suffered by Europeans (Jews and non-Jews) by the very efficient German propaganda and fear machine (ever wonder why the people didn't just tell the Germans to go to hell or go back home? This is scary-explanative). The use of subtitles brought the different cultures into sharp focus, and they weren't distracting at all; I appreciated the clever use of French by the smarmy Nazi \\"Jew Hunter,\\" who managed to seem so reasonable in his terrifying, sickening \\"mission.\\"<br />And Brad Pitt was a delight in his role as a soldier from Tennessee with Apache heritage, forming a team of Jewish-American guerilla fighters known to the Germans as the \\"Basterds.\\" They keep the Nazis hopping mad with their ability to strike without warning and disappear like smoke, taking the \\"souvenirs\\" Pitt demands.<br />When a French Jewish survivor of her family's massacre catches the eye of a young Nazi \\"hero\\" whose starring role in a propaganda film puts her in a unique position for revenge, things get sticky.<br />The movie was emotional, insightful, and despite Quentin Tarantino's name on it, it wasn't filled with any more blood or guts than the story deserved. I was impressed.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Everything about this movie was so right on.  I loved it.  I've watched it once in the theatre, and once streaming here on Amazon.  I will be buying it when it comes out on DVD.
B003LXSY60|5.0|Well not really the 70s, but listening to this album you could easily be fooled. I'm a huge fan of the Black Keys and every album has a slightly different sound and feel to it, all very enjoyable. Brothers sounds more produced than the previous Attack & Release and Magic Potion albums and that's a good thing. The sound of the band was evolving and progressing, and it shows in the depth and richness of the sound on this album. A great and welcome addition to my collection.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|So thrilled that there is more of the gang to watch whenever I want! Lots of laughs from a talented cast!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend that any person, of any age read this book.  It is thought provoking and requires examination of our own societal norms.  Are we that far away from the hunger games?
B008AT71WI|4.0|I have a great respect for directors and creators of movies, and I dislike seeing great material revised just because another storyline will generate more sales. Nevertheless, I understand why Frank Oz had to change the end of his movie, because it would never have made money with the depressing original ending -- homage to B-movies notwithstanding.<br /><br />The film looks great on blu-ray, and it sounds great, too! If you like this film, just buy it.<br /><br />I only deducted one star because it would have been nice to have a regular DVD copy of the director's cut (even sans commentary) that I could watch on another TV in my house that doesn't have a blu-ray player connected to it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This may be the best 3D movie for the home TV that I've seen and I have quite a few.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This is probably in the top five worst movies I have ever seen--no plot, not funny, bad acting, and a waste of time. However, if you just want to see nearly naked guys with awesome abs this is the movie you are looking for.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is easy to use and is efficient. I enjoy connecting to other people's artistic talents, styles, and interests
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|I have always been a huge T.I. fan. From the first time I heard Dope Boys, I knew his lyricism and confidence would be in the game for a while. Trouble Man is his best work yet. He continues to get better and is among the top lyricist in the game. The production is amazing throughout. There are songs for hustling, working-out, reflection, girls, parties, life, and everything in between. I would recommend this album to any hip hop fan. It is well worth $4.99. This is now one of my favorite albums of all time. Hip Hop is not dead anymore and the king of the south definitely has his crown back....not that he ever lost it. I can't wait for the next chapter of Trouble Man which will be released this year. If you haven't bought this album by now....What the hell are you waiting on?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E L James has captured the perfect fantasy within the pages of this book. The romance, mystery, suspense, and adventure are the perfect ingredients for this non-stop page turner!
B005ZUR724|4.0|I like the idea of it but should be free so it is easier to make parts ect. not cause i want the game but so more pplz on to invite. makes it a more massaively multiplayer game like rappelz and ddo.
0061928356|5.0|Fabulous read - everyone in book club enjoyed it as well.  Loved her pattern of revealing the details & connection of their lives.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|Just loved the book! It was always a mystery to me as to how come Rafa is so consistent and almost like the Arnold Schwarznegger of the tennis world! This book not only demystified this but gave a great insight into the 'other&#34; facet of Rafa and how grounded he is in his personal life!
B0091REZMW|4.0|very good game to pass the time very addictive no glitches on the kindle fire. need more energy though ran out.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Ann Hathaway's one song excluded this movie lacks energy and skill.  The unrelenting closeup shots alone make this movie a waste of time.  How can you make such a sweeping epic look like a pick and pan old style TV show?  They did, and it suffers for it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I had no idea who the murderer was even though the clues all fit in the end. Well done again
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Thé White Noise app is just what I needed to help me sleep at night.  It is just the perfect distraction from my husbands snoring.  Thank you White Noise!!!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I will forever listen to this album. This album is just raw talent. I love him and his music!! My favorite song off this album is Yellow Raincoat because its just so sad, it reminds is that he's not perfect he's human and he's not always happy like we think.
B0053FANS6|5.0|I enjoyed these movies so much that I bought the Blu-ray version!  Wondering if there will be another Mummy movie.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Nice story lines and character development. A welcome expansion of the Star Trek universe. I'm excited to see more episodes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It was very fun.  It is a good way to pass the time.  Some of the games are harder than others.  As the prices on the games get higher the challenge difficulty rises too.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Do not waste another moment, go ahead an purchase the MP3 version currently at $ 1.99. That is cheap. Do it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the most exciting game in history and I really lieutenant they speed it up . I found out about it because my sister's was playing it on my cousins cell phone . I love this game and I can't wait . Until they come out with a new one !!!
B00881VLCE|1.0|did not enjoy. Maybe it needs a lot more work, or maybe its was just me. I'm not sure. I guess for free it was just a little entertaining. Sorry !
B0091REZMW|4.0|a fun game, easy to follow. great way to spend free time,have learned to save diamonds wish icould get on my phone as well
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This isn't a game for anyone under 13, but it's really fun for adults. If you have a lot of people I recommend the expansion packs. Great game!
1451696205|5.0|Absolutley one of the best books!  I was a senior in high school when the plot of this book took place so I completely got it....  Perfect
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Love the story of this book.  It takes you through such a rollercoaster of emotions.  Great book.  Will try her other ones.
1619491370|3.0|I was disapointed with the book because I had to do a review on it for college, but there was no information about the author, the  publisher, and when/where the book was published. Otherwise the print was clear and easy to read.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Never had heard of this movie, so I was surprised that it was as good as it was. Tommy Lee Jones makes everything good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a great thing to have it is awesome they give you the right answers and that good part is that it is calculator
B009XPGJYY|5.0|Amazing show, must watch.<br />The whole show is great, all the way from season 1, definitely worth it.<br />Not for kids though.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Best movie of 2012!!! I've already seen this movie three times. Can't wait to own it myself. It should have won an Oscar!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|I loved this book and was so excited to read the recipes that were supposed to be included in \\"Appendix B,\\" but when I went to find the Appendix, it was not there.  The book ended without the recipes referred to in the last chapter.  This is a huge disappointment!  Any suggestions?  Thanks!!<br />Update! Just found it! Awesome book with fascinating information!
B004J09ONG|4.0|Beautiful story of the rescue, human interaction with,  and release of lion cub.  Loved the scenery and animals of Africa.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. You feel like your cheeringon the main character all the way through. It was hard to put this book down.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very detailed  and realistic. Good fun for all horse  lovers! I was looking for a realistic horse care game and this is exactly what i was looking for.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This whole album is great to listen to. It has a variety of songs - slow, fast, fun, love. I just love their voices and to listen to their music. I highly recommend this album!!
0439023521|1.0|Piece of garbage.<br />Abysmally written.<br />Reprehensible heroine tries to kill her sister's cat, in front of her, on first page. Hate this person right off the bat, don't give a damn about her.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'll keep this short & sweet --<br /><br />I loved this story. What I loved most was its honesty. In other books that confront the topics of cancer and suffering, they are often compiled of &#34;fluff&#34;, or an over-glamorized image of what those things are. This book is loaded with genuine suffering, but also honesty and humor.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have to admit that the story keeped me reading. Usually I have at least 2 things going at a time, but I read this straight through.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very interesting take in some familiar fantasy...although it has a protagonist that a teenager would better relate to, the story and the world the author created engulfs you!!! It's like a twisted take on time travelling X-Men written by less potty mouthed Stephen King...READ IT...<br /><br />The narrator is a little distracting when he tries to sound like a British woman though.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I chose this rating because it was hard for me to get into but the rest was delicious! I would recommend this book to whoever likes suspense!!!!
0525478817|5.0|Great for adults as wells as teens.  Very thought-provoking and written with language used today.  John Green brings you in and you can't put it down.  It's also great to get to know the author on YouTube, what a great person!!!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|A really good holiday read, almost not-put-downable. I have now read all this author's books and would like lots more!
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I loved Pitch Perfect from the beginning, and wanted to have the music anytime.  There are a couple of songs that I wish were the originals from the movie and not the studio recordings, but it is still awesome.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book provides cannon fodder for many hours of zombie nerd conversation.  All the scientific, political, military, etc minutiae we have speculated about since Romero's &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; first broached the topic of the zombie apocalypse -- it's all in here.  Have fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well done British show.  One thing I like about Downton Abbey is its balanced portrayal of people, both rich and poor.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|A movie of focoused dissipation that was both enigmatic and boring. Staying with the movie was a chore, despite a good performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
0375507256|5.0|I got this for my brother for Christmas! He really liked it and is currently reading it right now. Thanks!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Broadly written characters, a bumbling upper class nice guy and a humble butler who can solve anything makes for a laugh out loud comedy from beginning to end.
B007712XAU|5.0|I loved the whole series, it is so entertaining and inspiring. Makes you forget your troubles and takes you to another era.
B0085OELXK|4.0|We enjoyed an updared version of theis old story. We had a good time and it is the dark side of the personality.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Remarkable, grabs your attention, plays with your mind and them drops you like its hot.This and paranomal activity are the scariest movies 2012
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Carry it in my vest pocket at all times. Great for keeping the knife sharp when I'm repeatedly cutting twine on hay bales.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Everything is here as expected! Great quality and brings me back to my childhood and I'm glad that I can pass this on to my son!
B00782O7IY|5.0|A great film to watch. it will make you laugh and cry and end up feeling great. Wonderful !! I will watch it again.
1558908323|3.0|This is movie is different. It is kind of scary especially the sound the creature makes.  I think  it was okay.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Beautifully crafted CD from beginning to end. Versatile and beautiful in voice and production, Josh is his best on this outing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Just a Great Book, would buy from this author again.  Keep the books coming and I am looking forward to more.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Liked very much, although missed some of the other story lines & characters.  A bit sloggy at times & then ripping at others.  Engrossing storytelling.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|Two advanced degrees and I still can't figure out something that I'm sure is utterly simple.<br /><br />I wish this book just laid it on the line, this is what you do, a, b, c, and d.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|product came quickly in the mail and the quality was good. don't know how great the movie is but i will be watching it again soon.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I have all ready reviewed this but will say again, this is a very exciting television show.  It  could have been a movie too.  Highly recommend this  too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an awesome story, I couldn't put it down. I have have read many of books by Mr. Sparks and this is one of my favorites.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|has some problems.....<br />I just finished this game and although I enjoyed the storyline and the puzzles,  some of the hidden objects were hard to find because the areas were somewhat dark and when I did find them,  I had to tap on them a couple of times before I could get them from the scene.  Other than that,  it was an interesting story and I wished that it was longer.
1455502758|3.0|I approached Mr. Hitchens’ last book with great interest. But as I’ve read it and re-read it, trying to find some significant arguments in a text slanted to highlight medicine’s failure to help us—and oddly for an atheist, how little lots of people praying for the sick would do that can help—I ended up disagreeing with the excessive merit bestowed in this book. This doesn’t mean to disagree with the man himself; I would’ve loved to meet him and learn more about his work. Mine also isn’t an ad hominem argument—so popular these days. It is that, unfortunately for the reader, what’s compiled of his last writings doesn’t match his great reputation as atheist debater and intellectual. Dead robs us from everything, and even the greatest minds at the end get extinguished in pain and nothingness—Hitchens knew and confronted this better than most of us.<br /><br />The book does spend time talking about sickness and the troubles it causes as it ravages the body, and there’s an enlightening discussion about the falsehood of saying “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” The medical bits are written from the patient’s point of view and are no different from other accounts of suffering cancer—I’d say there are somewhat less informed when it comes to medicine and way too specific to the author’s suffering. Understandably, but still something sounding like a lament of ‘why me?’ goes on for half the book. The author’s curse of losing his voice and at times the ability to write is an awful fate for a great talker and a man of words, and Hitchens reflects beautifully about the loss of our practice of talking or dictating books rather than just typing them.<br /><br />Perhaps what most disappointed me about Hitchens’ book is that I expected—from such public and knowledgeable atheist—some great end-of-life philosophy and a final confrontation between man and God, or more appropriately, between man and the No-God. I’m sorry to say that’s missing, perhaps as the disease advanced so rapidly that robbed us from the musings of a man confronted with the abysm of non-existence. Our time, with its ever-present conflict between faiths and the shunning of those who profess not to believe, deserves (and needs) much discussion about the differences and the relative benefits of living with or without a belief in God (I don’t want to leave this debate to Penn Jillette and his books about atheist show-life). There’s in these musings a puny consideration of the value of Pascal’s wager, but (without transposing materials from Hitchens’ other works) not much about the philosophy of the non-afterlife. Hitchens, in this book, is no Sartre, and at times he seems to be giving a selfish version of “The Last Lecture” of Randy Pausch. You don’t know how sorry I am to lack this last and great open discussion, lost to pain like we have lost to memory Pascal’s never finished “Pensees”.<br /><br />We have lots of written stories about and from the terminally ill, self-inspecting searches that in a few cases reach greatness. When you go beyond the hype about Hitchens’ last book, it’s not really one of those that reached on high.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a fun game. its ok with the diamonds at first but hard to get more after that hoping it gets easy to get the diamonds
B00991TCOG|5.0|I listen to this at least once a day, ever since a friend first suggested her.<br /><br />The dubstep is a bit weird at first, but she has an incredible sense of where her music is going and she plays it extremely well.<br /><br />I made my entire family listen to it on Christmas (at a low volume), with no complaints at all, and that overs a pretty wide range of age groups. Great for ambient background, or at louder volumes, for a decent laid back party.<br /><br />I cannot suggest this cd enough. I am eagerly awaiting her next release.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This is an enjoyable series.  I bought them all, just waiting on season 4 to come out.  Taped it on at&t and am trying to get caught up on the series.  I was a late watcher.  I will buy season 4 when it comes out and erase the taped version on the uverse.<br />Highly recommed it.  It will suck you in...............
B006WQLH7G|5.0|There are several choices in this app to use including a firewall.  It is very easy to use and I am very glad it was available.  This one would even be worth spending money on!
B00296A4F4|5.0|Hooked on the this show.  Loved being able to watch the entire season one right after the other on instant video.  The music was great, the characters charismatic and the stories were always interesting.  I have become a real fan and am on to next season!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I learned more about the Middle East issue and how dangerous it is for Americans in Yemen. I thought the writing was very good, but I got a little turned off by the constant wise-cracking of the protagonist. Good story.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I love this game, it's amazing! I do play it every day. And I have spent £6 buying gems & coins. (That's a biggy because I never buy anything app related lol)<br />But I do think it costs way too much to progress through the game! I can't fight on the higher levels because I won't spend £36 on gems & coins, to buy weapons, armour & skills. (Yes, it would cost that much, at the least)<br />OFFER US SOME FREE STUFF GAME LOFT! GIVE US DAILY SALES, HALF PRICE GEMS ETC!!<br /><br />in all honesty, if I found a similar game on my kindle, I'd move on to that, just to play something different, I will get bored of the same levels on DH3,<br />I play a casino app, and they are very generous with free stuff and sales, and I have no problem wasting money on that!<br /><br />So PLEASE gameloft, give us a 100 gems for watching your other game clips, give us a half price sale!<br />Give us something, ANYTHING!<br />I do want to keep playing!
B007N9FKCY|3.0|I was sucked in by the retro Mario-esque feel, as I'm from the early 90's gaming age.  But the main character, a jumping bean, does just that...he jumps. And jumps, and jumps.  You are constantly jumping and use the left-right arrows to control which way he jumps.  This makes the game really hard, and the extra challenges in the game nearly impossible (for me, anyway).  To master this jumping motion you'd have to spend a lot of time practicing, or else you just stumble through the levels and don't accomplish much.  I wanted to like the game, the music was cute, but I did not like the way Bean moved through the levels at all.
B00117W1HQ|4.0|I only watched  a few episodes of this.  Can't buy anymore tv shows right now but if I could I would buy this.  It has vampires, witches and werewolves.  MY kind of show.  I like spooky.  Go see Dark SKy with Kerri Russell if you want a fright.  It makes you stop and think.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Child 44 is one of the best books I've ever read.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|This is such a classic tale, Gemma Arterton did a wonderful job of capturing Tess's character.  She embodied the challenges facing a poor female of the times, modesty, pride and the sheer beauty of Tess.  The cinematography is stunning with rich settings and backgrounds. The love interest shows such promise to only magnify the differences applied to women of the age. I found I looked forward to the next episode and would have loved it to be longer. I highly recommend it if you enjoy period pieces founded with a love story being the backbone of the story. Wonderful.
0345803507|5.0|This book can send you into areas of wonder. I don't have a full blown sex life but OMG some of this I liked and some I would have ran from. Good Book. lol

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this series.  It is not only funny and bloody and scary but its a different spin on the blood suckers.
081297381X|4.0|Black Swan by Teleb is a wonderful rant about randomness and how that concept is misunderstood in the world causing enormous harm. The central theme of the book is that most non-natural elements do not follow \\"the normal distribution\\" but that a lot of predictions are made based on the assumption that they do. Instead, the distribution is 'fractal' which can cause extreme outliers which are outside any model. These outliers are per definition unexpected and Taleb calls these Black Swans.<br /><br />The book consists for 4 different parts, of which part 1 and 2 contain the main message and 3 and 4 are clarifications on that. The first part explains the concept of unexpected events --Black Swans-- and why we aren't able to predict them and our inability to realize this. It describes several fallacies that humans commonly follow which flaws their thinking. The second part takes this further and takes a bunch of philosophy and history to show that humans never have been good at predicting the future and what the reasons for that are. Here it also takes stabs at professions that do predict the future and basically calls them frauds. The third part has chapters clarifying his earlier statements and trying to give some useful advise on what else you can do. The last chapter is an ending chapter with concrete advise on how you can change your attitude taking the Black Swan into account.<br /><br />I found Black Swan a wonderfully rude and controversial book, claiming that a lot of the world-as-we-know-it is flawed and explaining why. It is definitively insightful and I loved the arrogant attitude the author has towards his subject and the related (un)science. I did find the book hard to read at times and repetitive. From that perspective, it isn't a book I'd recommend everyone to read, it isn't exactly light reading either.<br /><br />All in all, I did enjoy the book and was thinking about giving it five stars as it is definitively different (at least, for me, especially not having read his earlier work yet). Based on the editing and the not-to-easy-to-read-ness, I decided to scale down back to four stars. Still, a fun read!t having read his earlier work yet).

B001NHNG64|4.0|One of my favorite Jack Teacher novels, so far.  Lee Child's makes every word count.  He writes suspense on every page.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I normally finish hidden object games in an hour or two. This one has lasted three days so far and I still haven't finished the game yet. So worth the money.

B001XUT6AG|5.0|This was a good movie. I skipped though the trial scene on the second viewing. Other than that it was a good movie to watch at home.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is season 2.  I  have season  1 and 3 they are all good.  I am waiting on season 4.  When it comes out I will purchase it.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw this movie twice at the theaters and I can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD. What a great movie, amazing dialogue!! This movie will become my fav of all times
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reachers introduction.  Lee Child is a master of suspense and action.  His writing skill is amazing.  I look forward to reading all of them.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This app provides access to your tablet camera. It givers many options for self photos etc. A very good app for taking photos on dual camera units.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love mahjong of any kind.  It allows me to multi task and keeps me totally involved in several things at once.  It also allows me to go back and do over.  Love it.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|[Good]<br /><br />Bond is more human: I really like this about the new Bond. He's no longer perfect with perfect luck. He makes mistakes and he doesn't always get his way. Nor can he always save the girl.<br /><br />Bond is expendable: The mission is the most important thing to MI6. All of its agents are expendable including Bond himself. This is very believable.<br /><br />Action: The action is on par with previous Bond films. I would argue even better. Bond is human. He gets tired and he gets hurt. It's a nice touch of realism mixed in with all the unbelievable stuff.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is great and it feels like a Bond film even though it's been updated, just like the last two films. Lots of exotic locales and lots of awesome crazy action.<br /><br />[Bad]<br /><br />Plot: Out of the three new films, this was the worst one in terms of plot. Granted you don't watch Bond for plot, but the last two films were pretty decent plot wise. Why couldn't they continue the SPECTRE plot that they painstakingly brought up in the previous two films? I didn't need a weird version of Golden Eye. This movie was a good action film, but it just didn't feel like Bond once you got past 1/2 way through the movie. Yes I see the metaphor / allegory of Bond representing the new Bond movies transitioning to the modern Bourne era and the rogue agent representing the old Bond movies post Sean Connery aka Roger Moore. I don't watch Bond for allegory and metaphor. It was clever but not enjoyable.<br /><br />M: I didn't like it that the movie was basically one big goodbye to the current M. I also found it strange that M seemed to act as Bond's handler. It's like the CEO of McDonald's micro-managing one employee in one store in Ohio when they have thousands of stores and even more employees worldwide. It's ridiculous and it makes no sense. I think I didn't question this in the other movies since they were good enough plot wise for me to ignore. This time my disbelief just wasn't suspended enough. Classic Bond does M better. Hopefully they go back to that.<br /><br />Computer hacking: This is a really minor gripe, but it just annoyed me. Hacking does not involve lots of pretty computer graphics. If you didn't know what it was, it's actually pretty boring looking in real life. It wouldn't have been as bad if they didn't keep showing it and just left it at that.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Watched the  show which is a spoof on the serial  that was on in the sixties.  Johnny Depp is great in this.  I laughed through the whole movie.  I recommend it any time.  Invite friends and watch together its very funny.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It's not very often that I read a book that sticks with me after I've read it, but A Higher Call is one of them. From the minute I picked it up I was absolutely enthralled with the story and how a chance meeting between the two principle characters had such a profound impact on both of them for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />If you're a history buff, a military aviation buff or just someone who likes a good story, you owe it to yourself to read this book.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|There are some very good things, some great things, some just OK things, and some bad things about this game.<br /><br />I'll start with the great.<br /><br />The artistry is fantastic. The animations are clever. The little extras made this game very entertaining. For instance, one must visit other villages to earn hearts to buy special items that can only be bought with hearts. And while you are visiting neighbors, you have an opportunity to make coins by playing \\"Where's Waldo \\" except you're looking for Scrat. He hides behind palms, or in plain sight, and when you find him quickly you are rewarded more coins. The amount you win depends on the neighbors level. You win 100 coins multiplied by the level number. For example, find Scrat in a level 50,and win 5000 coins. Find him quickly and win 2500 PLUS the 5000. HOWEVER...here's the bad. I haven't been able to connect with anyone I have tried to friend. I have tried over 20 times to friend my sister and we haven't connected..ever. I've tried game loft live connect...nothing. I visit MANY villages, get lots of coins...but I haven't gotten any gifts or likes in return. I am level 62.<br />Furthermore, the update that now includes the underground DinoWorld has slowed and bogged down all aspects of game, making it tedious instead of fun. Difficult to rearrange animals and decorations because moving buttons don't work.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|Provides an option to print to your home printer from your cell phone or tablet. There is a process you must complete<br />for the app to work properly. I've reviewed the app and found just not what I'm looking for at this time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|very relaxing and easy to listen to and fall asleep to. I would rate this app a 10star if I could.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|My biggest complaint is the weak and choppy story line. Judy Denche's character could have been developed so much better. Craig seemed to be only partly into his role and so his intensity as Bond was lacking, even forced.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Loved it.  Romance, excitement, blood, thrills and chills.  What could be better than that.  I have seen the  whole series.  Very enjoyable.
1609611543|5.0|Book was written in terms I could read and understand.  I now know how to read labels, what to look for.  What's good and what's bad.  Eating food that I never used to because I was told it was fattening.  Well I'm losing weight and eating those foods.  I went from a 29 inch waist to a 27 inch waist.  Noticed the weight loss in stomach area first.  I'm eating like this forever!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is such a love story. I think that even though most people think Nicholas Sparks is basically a<br />&#34;chick&#34; author, this book will appeal to everyone. It certainly speaks to todays violence against women by<br />those who love them to &#34;death&#34;.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a heartwarming story about rural folks in a poor town looking for love. There is also some awful stories about what life was like for young boys in a Scottish orphanage. True descriptions of how they mistreated the boys. Well written and very good character development.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Love this movie! So glad it won an Oscar!! Well deserved! Great story and most obviously know the ending but very well done!
B002QE3CTY|2.0|Perhaps my tastes are not suited to this type of book written with such mediocre skill, but I found this book very unsatisfying.  I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen and for something believable to occur.  The author did create enough suspense to keep me reading, waiting for the big finish, which never came.  I did finish reading the book, however, primarily because I had purchased it (although by accident) and didn't want my money wasted.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app!  I really enjoy seeing and interacting with such a huge sharing of ideas.  ive recommended it to all my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you've seen the first season, you can't resist the second. Great cast, great story, wonderful costumes, spectacular location.....the best period show yet!
0765325950|5.0|Being book 15, you really need to start at the beginning, but everything about this book lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />Those who died left me feeling their loss, those who survived their joy.  The sheer epicness of this book delt with everything it should have, and was an amazing ending.<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked was if they expanded more on the aftermath and the rebuilding of the world, at least a chapter devoted to everyone moving on, not just directly after the battle.  I feel like this story could go on and on, and its fans would still read it, even with such a new setting and story that has been derived from the last battle.
0345803485|5.0|Very moivating! Hard to put down, you want to read and read to the very end. I love it! A must buy!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I had the same style charger from Griffin for my previous iPhone and was in love with it, so the first thing I wanted with my new iPhone 5 was the same thing with a lightning plug. It took a bit to be release, but it doesn't disappoint. It seems sturdy, worked well, and charges fast. It is a little pricey, but worth the price of entry.
B001LMKEGG|5.0|I just love this movie.  It's the the kind of sappy love story that somehow leaves me smiling every time
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book explains several conditions that allowed certain people to become outstanding.  In addition to birth year (which is significant) the number of hours a person engages in his area of interest - at least 10,000 - is the key to sucess.  Anyone in High School should be required to read this book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, and the truth about the war.  It really describes what are troops have to endure when deployed.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Great movie.  Gave everyone I know lots of laughs.  Definitely not a family movie however, but one in which a group of friends can get an enjoyable night of laughs out of.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The story of an ordinary, boring , average everyday man, struggling along in life with a marriage that has lost its way due to a family tragedy.  When a person from his past writes him a letter, a person who helped him out in his earlier life, saying she is close to death, Harold decides to walk to see her 500k away from his home.  His wife is stunned by his decision, but off Harold goes.  This is the story of the things he sees, the people he meets and ultimately brings he and his wife close again.<br />Lovely book - highly recommended
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I needed one battery, and found that if I bought five pack it was actually cheaper; you never know when a battery might need to be replaced...
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|It was hard to stay awake. Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring.
B002KVZBGA|1.0|This is a lame movie. Don't waste your time, you will be sorry and wish you could have that time back to do something worth while.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It seems to have a lot hidden object puzzles.  I guess I need to just buy the game in order to give an accurate review.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I'm a fan of the franchise, so it was looking forward to watching this movie.  The action sequences were quite good, and the humor in the script was a good counterpoint to the drama of the plot.  I don't think they gave Jeremy Renner or the other cast members enough action.  Tom Cruise pretty much had all of the good action scenes.  Another point in its favor is the lack of foul language.  Most action movies are so peppered with bad language that I find it off-putting.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and if the ending is any indication, I would probably watch the next movie when it is made.
B0002VFXFE|1.0|I can't believe I dropped eight bucks on this tiny tube of thermal paste!  It is literally only enough to do one, maybe two jobs.  Next time, I will just get it from a big box store.  You can get a lot more product for a lot less money.  Don't waste your time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. I especially love how you can create your own mix with up to ten different sounds. Perfect for relaxation.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Really enjoyed this show! Watched the whole season in a weekend...just got hooked right from the begining!  Recommended highly for sure!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best books ever. I wish everyone would take the time to read it. Thanks for your sacrafice Chief Kyle. He was a true American!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|IAng Lee is amazing and I am happy he got an Oscar for Directing it.  The whole film was amazing from the very lovely shots of the gardens and the animals at the beginning of the film, to the disaster of the ship wreck, to the survival of the tiger and the young man.  I loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I live pinterest. I'm a grafter and I love new ideas and creative ideas. this is the best place to find craft ideas, fashion ideas, design ideas, food and drink ideas etc. it has everything!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I always wanted to watch this series when it originally aired, just never could get it in my schedule.  Josh Heddon is brilliant, and the actors are phenominal.  The drama and humor are blended perfectly.  Browncoats UNITE
B005C0DHIK|1.0|Amusing, but completely flawed movie. Josh fox throws statistics into the movie that are incorrect, just to gain more support. And when proven wrong (not in this movie), he shows no response and runs away like a coward
B007NVIB5U|1.0|To be blunt:  this may simply be a cultural difference.  But, the American Showtime version of QAF was truly cutting edge. Most everyone who watched the American version immediately believed that Justin and Brian were (could be) deeply in love.  The characters were more richly portrayed - and the producers were honestly willing (able) to make a more adult version:  topics and nudity.  The British version inspired the American but I never connected with a single character on that show.  I found myself hitting fast forward out of boredom.  I would highly recommend that everyone watch all 5 seasons of the US version before watching the British series.  There has never been a series since that was so honest and willing to talk about the issues - even if many in the community felt that it was over sexualized.  The truth is that you can remove sexuality from the gay community.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Well written interwoven story lines with interesting interplay among characters. Held my interest from first to last page. Really enjoyed book, although it cost me some sleep as I often read too late into the night!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|The screw/wingnut design makes it a little cumbersome to adjust, but it works just as advertised.  I made some great-looking drinking glasses out of old beer bottles and the edges were nice and smooth.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Though Season 1 is a little cheesey, Season 2 improves on an otherwise great start. The Next Generation is a fantastic medium for examining social, political and moral conundrums. Worth watching!
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|I saw a few of his movies and decided to order several kindle books.  I always expect more of books than movies.  There was more.  More repetition.  Truly, I spent most of my time reading this book wondering if it was time to put it down unfinished rather than continue to waste my time.  I wish I hadn't ordered a bunch of his books all at once and don't know how many more I will even bother with.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|West Wing was one of my favorite programs and I was surprised when I discovered that it was available in a collection.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love love this book.  It was the best book I have read in a long time. The ending was my perfect!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First chapter or two were a little hard to read, but once I got into the story line, I, too, fell in love with Christian Grey.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|The author combines facts with &#34;people&#34;. He makes history human. His writing puts you in the story where you can relate.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|No more spandex jumpsuits and Dr. Crusher's back. The Next Generation is a fantastic medium for examining social, political and moral conundrums. Worth watching!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|after it loads it quits and exits out of the game never got to play the game to find out if it is any good please fix the glitches so kindle fire can play
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Such a great movie! It was very intense but had a few funnies also. I loved the soundtrack also.  .
1451695195|5.0|I have also ready Journey of Souls which is an amazing book.  There were some similarities in experiences.  It promotes thought for sure.
0470503696|5.0|This book was just what I was looking for.  It is giving me a great refresher of knowledge I haven't used in 10 years.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I love this book! Even though I may disagree with some of it, I still find this book as a great buy and is fun to read!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I originally read this book because I really like Jennifer Lawrence and saw she was in the movie. I like to read the books before I saw the movie and I was glad I did. The books is different from the movie in a lot of ways and It was much more detailed. I really like the story of Tiffany and Pat. It was inspiring and hopeful. You couldn't help but love Pat inspite of all his misfunctions and you liked Tiffany for not sugar coating anything. I would recommend this book to anyone. Especially if you liked the movie.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you love sy-fy, this show is for you.  LOVE it!  It is intriguing and the different characters are well developed and intertwined in to a story you can't get enough of.
B00846REIS|5.0|From the beginning Gideon has a possessive stake over Eva. Their relationship is very complicated and they both have a lot of baggage that they carry. The love that they have for each other is as powerful as their relationship itself.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was a fast paced & suspenseful film.  Very interesting insight into this true-life drama from a pivotal point in history.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I ordered the CD becaue of the new song Girl on Fire, but the version on the CD is a duet with Nicki Minaj and not what I wanted.  Too much banging and rap for my taste and not the version played on the radio.  The other songs are fine, but I am disappointed in the one song I wanted.  If I was rating the one song, it would get 1 star.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun. Have fun challenging  family to beat your timed score. Addicting. Good game to play while waiting for your appointment to come up.
034580404X|5.0|Heard this was an excellent book, and was it ever!<br />I hated to put it down I was so drawn to it, wishing I was in Anastasia's place!<br />I broke down crying at the end of the first book. Seemed like one of my friends<br />having problems and me comforting her. I started the second book and think it will<br />be as good. Anyway it is so far....gotta get back to it....
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Own many of Pink Floyd's albums -- both early and later compositions.  Each album has a reference piece to another album which makes it neat to find!  Meddle has a song called Seamus (which is about a hound dog)--ties into the Animal album.  I've also found specific notes/sounds that tie in to every album I own.  Meddle has a lot of sound and instrument experimentation - most come out soft and soothing.  Very unique!  Hear something different with every listen.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Infrared does not work properly. Cant see in night time in babes room. It does not worth the value ask for.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|If you're a lover of 007, you'll find Skyfall to be one of the best! Action packed, of course, and with typical beautiful people found in James Bond films. Surprise ending, as well.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|What else can you expect from Tarantino?  He is a masterful storyteller and knows how to pick a cast.  It was gory, funny, tragic, suspenseful and silly, but what a delight.  Tarantino may have a future in films yet.
B0027MJU00|5.0|There are so many twists to this book. One minute you think you know and the next minute your completely shocked!!! I  could not put this book down from start to finish!
B000SZK41M|5.0|It really was a great movie. Bruce Willis is excellent in it. I've also seen Live Free and Die Hard. I can't wait to see the rest of them.
B004RLPTT0|4.0|I really like more than half of the songs on this album so I bought the whole thing. Overall, great listening. A couple of the songs are just OK but decent enough to get through. Good work-out music.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Awesome tv series.  I cant wait until next season.  This is the real deal.  Amazon Prime has a great connection too.
0547848412|5.0|After seeing the movie, I had to read this book.  Mr. Martel provides a soulful and thoughtful read.  I love it.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Very original album. It always impresses me to see raw talent. In this day and age of reality television and selling out it's a nice change of pace. Job well done.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this so. I manage to get my wife hooked on it.This game is a lot of fun
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Totally enjoyed reading Shutter Island.  I thought Mystic River was great, too.  Dennis LeHane knows how to keep readers involved.  Love the twist at the end.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|First time I used this app I was relly surprised at how easy it was to use. I'm in love with it and will alwasy get my music here.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I bought this for my son's birthday.  Valentines Day!  He loves this movie.  I received it promptly and he loves it.  I would recommend this movie, and seller.  Thank You.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works great!  Can't believe other pay so much more!  Connection lights work as expected and connection status immediately recognized.  You can't miss with this.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|American Runion is much better then their last effort, American Wedding. From the very beggining the movie starts off with a bang. For me it was a little depressing having seen how the cast has aged and times have changed. It was very true to life. Being in that age group brought back a lot of memories of the first installment back in 1999. I remember seeing that with my friend and thinking how original it was. That being said this movie delivers and you should own it.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Up until this game I was seriously considering getting rid of my vita. Not now. This game has a fun story and interesting characters.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Best season of Castle yet! Two parter Taken and  Hunt were exceptionally well done.  Order it. You won't be disappointed.
B00940XIGU|4.0|Love most of the songs in the album. One or two songs are OK but overall, great. I listen to it while working or cleaning up around the house or while I'm driving and I can't sit still!
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|This movie, like all the Bourne movies, is great.  It is full action, suspense and thrills.  It keeps you captivated and very alert.  Love this show.  I recommend this to action lovers and to those who like to really think and pay attention to what is going on.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was such a charming story except for the cruelties the young orphans suffered under the Catholic church.  More people should be aware of this disgusting time in our history.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very much a page turner.  Can't wait to read the third.  All the mumbling about the book, I thought its just going to be about kinky sex but after you read, It's very much more,  a really good story.  Why he's the way he is, her new awareness of a new world,  and how they combine and compromise.
B00BHMF578|1.0|paid to watch. power glitch at around 50min mark? now the video is gone along with my money. Do not risk 24 hour rental with amazon
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Charming book.  Simplistic treatment of adult themes.  Read it and think about it.  I am reading another of his books now, and look forward to enjoying it as much as Stardust.
B003XDZN8A|5.0|I ordered these for my 13 yr old daughter.  They are easy to slip on and comfortable and look nice too!<br />Not to mention, they got here quick, within 5 days!
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Bought this for my son.  He has no complaints.  Great movie, if you haven't watched this.  It is totally captivating from beginning to the end.  Lots of action and suspense.  I love it because you really have to do some thinking and listening to understand all that is going on.  It's not a movie that you can walk away from without missing something.  It is Great. I highly recommend it.
B003Y059EK|1.0|Whenever my husband's nephew comes to visit, we always watch a bad movie. This was his pick and we hated it. There was no point to the story - just a mishmash of the other Oz books by Baum.
0470424656|5.0|If you want a good understanding of what drives the value of companies buy this book. To be a front runner in the world of corporate finance textbooks as a fifth edition means something is working for you!! BUY

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's novel \\"Gone Girl\\" is a masterpiece.  The main characters of Nick and Amy are fully developed.  Amy is the \\"rich\\" girl who marries Nick , the \\"average\\" guy from the South.  Amy's money comes from her parent's success as writers of the Amazing Amy series.  All is well in the beginning of the novel.  Amy plays the role of the cool girl to keep Nick's undivided attention.  Cool girls never complain and ask nothing of their mate.  Amy is unable to keep up this façade once she and Nick lose their jobs as writers.  The two return to Nick's home town to take care of Nick's mom and dad.  They invest the last of Amy's money into a bar that Nick runs with his sister Go.<br />Amy's diary is filled with sheer misery about her marriage to Nick, as well as her knowledge about his infidelities. This diary as well as other clues leads the reader to believe in his culpability in Amy's disappearance.  The police, Amy's parents, and the public in general believe in Nick's guilt.  It is only in the second part of the novel a new Amy appears.  She is no longer presented as the victim.  And in the final chapters the couple tells their stories side by side, but Amy gets the last word.<br />I read this book in two sittings.  Once you start reading, you can't put it down.  Flynn keeps you formulating and reformulating the truth.  The final truth is startling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my grown up best friend and my 3 year old son are additcted to this game!!!!!! They play it for hours!!!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I was so excited to be able to order these batteries on line.  I do 99% of my shopping on line.  I have needed batteries for my bose remotes.  The price of these can't be beat.  I ordered immediately when I saw the price of these and also read reviews.  I would recommend this seller to anyone.  I will let you know how the life of the product last.  I put my batteries in after they warmed up from the cold, and bingo...my remotes finally work, again.  Thank you.  Good price and good seller, and also good product.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I mean it's Star Wars and it's a fun, silly game.  That's a great mix of amusing and relaxing in my book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I look forward to watching the Avengers repeatedly.  The special effects, story, interplay between the characters and passion for justice are appealing.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Really enjoyed Season 1 and I am looking forward to the next session. Video quality was very good. Enjoyed watching via Amazon.
B00821OX98|3.0|Surprised that so many hollywood actors will playact as assault weapon welding saviors of the planet from alien<br /> attack,yet they make videos bad mouthing the very guns their alter egos use. Beyond that it reminds me of  the<br /> series Jericho. Lots of gun play  not enough why we fight except gotta save the teens.
0525478817|4.0|I read this book in less than 6 hours last night (paused for dinner and bathroom breaks only) because I was captivated from the first page.<br /><br />A support group for kids living with cancer? Depressing, but intriguing.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. I was forever curious what was going to happen to these characters, I was deeply invested in their well-being (my favorite character by far being Issac. I wish Green would have developed him a little bit more). I haven't read a book dealing with such heavy subject matter that revolved around teenagers (except maybe some of Jodi Picoult's novels), and I think Green did a fantastic job of creating a story around a painful reality for a lot of families.<br /><br />I read this book on a recommendation from a blogger and based on her review, I already knew it was intense. I went into the book knowing it was going to be sad, and I braced myself the entire way.<br /><br />I'm not huge on romance novels and would never categorize this book as such, but I was a huge fan of the romance between Augustus and Hazel. Normally these teenage-y, puppy-love stories make me cringe, but I think the uncertainty of their future (both romantically and physically) made their relationship all the more intriguing.<br /><br />But perhaps I didn't find the romance aspect of the book to be cringe-worthy because these teenagers did not talk and act like teenagers. Seriously, what teenagers quote poetry to one another? I don't care how refined and intelligent you are, that's not how teenagers act. I don't know if living with cancer gave them a different perspective on or appreciation for literature, but regardless, it didn't seem authentic. When I was 16, I could probably quote you a Backstreet Boys' lyric.<br /><br />But really, the overwhelmingly maturity of the supposed teenagers is my only major beef with the book. It didn't make it or break it for me. The story was just too unique and too compelling to let that small fact overshadow the impact of the book. My heart was positively broken at the end. The unfairness of it all. The tragedy. This is only the second novel to ever make me cry while reading and it was so beautifully sad, I had to watch a few episodes of Family Guy to lift my spirits enough to fall asleep.<br /><br />And did anyone else think that the book was going to end right in the middle of a sentence?ow the impact of the book. My heart was positively broken at the end. The unfairness of it all. The tragedy. This is only the second novel to ever make me cry while reading and it was so beautifully sad, I had to watch a few episodes of Family Guy to lift my spirits enough to fall asleep.<br /><br />And did anyone else think that the book was going to end right in the middle of a sentence?
B000SEI230|5.0|This story had me laughing and crying at the same time. It told of a love so deep that not even death could end it.  Wonderful read.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Downloaded this app but I could never get it to open on my Kindle Fire. It was uninstalled the same day it was installed.
B00498YZH8|4.0|The fairly slow-moving movie keeps your interest and draws you into Jennifer Lawrence's character, which she plays brilliantly. It is amazing that the story was true.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It's not unusual for my mind to wander during a movie, and therefore I sometimes miss something important (but usually not).  But Argo kept my full attention from start to finish.  The acting was excellent.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I heard good things about this series and it is true. Great acting and a fast moving engaging story line. I will be purchasing the series
B004SDSSFY|4.0|It loaded/installed just fine.<br />  It does what it says it does.<br />  Has yet to hang/freeze.<br />  It is readable for my old eyeballs.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Wanted to read before the video comes out.  The stories are loosely tied together. Not sure what the unifying theme was.
B003CRM6QO|2.0|This movie was one of my favorites when i was a child, and i thought it would be awesome watch it again in Blu -Ray. But I was wrong. The acting is so bad that you can't watch all the movie without expressing a laugh for how bad that it is. I believe that some old movies are better to be remind as part of a nice childhood  and not as a bad adult experience.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Something anyone can relate to and you feel like you are right with Charlie the whole way and truly understand everything he goes through.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Thought it was a good movie. It should have done better in theaters. It had a few Avatar like scenes too.
B0052GACNM|5.0|So smooth ..easy listening ... What's not ot like.... No matter who he sings with it's so natural .. Great album I bought Duet One also<br /><br />great listening....
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It's a good game, like Minecraft. The demo is a bit short but you can just keep creating new saved games until you buy the full. My recommendation is to buy this instead of Minecraft pocket edition, it's $3.99 instead of $6.99 and just as good, I even saw a review that said that it was better than the MinecraftP.E.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I got hooked on Merlin when the first six episodes appeared on NBC several years ago.  Then it disappered - - what a disappointment!  I finally found all the seasons available on Amazon (what don't they have?) and I couldn't be happier.  I'm waiting for season five to be released next year sometime.  It's worth the wait.
B00000JNNY|5.0|They don't make music like this anymore.  What a great album with a classic sound.  And don't forget &#34;At Last,&#34; the best version of this song ever recorded.  No one can touch it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I am 46 years old and read this book for the very first time!!!!  So charming! I felt like a kid again!!!!!
3866078161|5.0|There's a reason most Comic book geeks RAVE about it. A couple things though: this is not light reading. You're supposed to study every single panel of every single page. And read every single page. They're all there for a very good reason. I've read it at least 20 times and I've literally seen something I hadn't noticed before... Every time.<br /><br />The story is less important than the emotional contrast between the characters. The only &#34;superhuman&#34; is the Blue Guy from the movie. He's a changed character from an expired comics property that the publisher allowed Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons to interpret literally.<br /><br />-What would happen if a guy lived in the continental US, and he was literally a god in the form of a glowing blue man. (Ex: He can take a Tank about into every single nut and bolt, just by thinking about it.) And, he was decidedly American. For starters, we beat the Russians into Space, and most of the NVA that aren't killed outright instead choose to surrender to Dr. Manhattan personally. Basically: everyone is very, Very, VERY scared of the USA... (That's a good lead in.)<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Suggestion: this is a 18-19 year old reading level. I read it in college. IE: don't give it to your 12 year old son. It has sexually explicit content, exceptional violence levels, and the Blue Guy is 100% naked for most of the book.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />If you're an older fan, you have no excuses left. Read the book. It's like the flag that nerds wave to prove that Comic books are literary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. I cant stop playing its awesome. I like that I can change the deck face and the background. I really like the undo button it comes in handy.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|t's really  good!. Excellent music selection, excellent voice, I really enjoyed it. It was a very good choice. It's not only for lovers, is for everyone who likes the best on international music.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|No dips in the interest factor. Kept me awaiting for the upcoming events. Great editing job. Would watch again and again
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Cute movie for all ages.  Everyone in our family enjoyed the story. Well made.  Good wholesome family movie. Highly recommend.
1401307450|5.0|I am such a huge fan of RHCP and I really loved the book. This is a must read if you are a fan.
B007RTAR64|5.0|my daughter bought this for herself for a late christmas present.  The package was in great condition and the doll was everything she expected.  She is not a collector but wanted it to actually play with but she is taking great care with it.  She really likes the fact that the doll can hold the bow, can be posed in many different positions due to the different joints in the arms and legs, and has an upright stand that she puts it back on everyday after she plays with it.  She really enjoyed being able to watch the video from the designer telling about how they designed the doll and the fact that they were able to make the clothes from the doll by borrowing the actual costume Jennifer Lawrence wore in the movie.  We looked at many other sites and our local Toys R Us before we bought this doll and Amazon had the best price and thanks to Prime we received it in 2 days which she was very excited about.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Riveting/ sobering ( no pun intended) when thinking of who could be flying that big ole plane. Denzel nailed it...as always!!
B002DQLGHU|5.0|They stuck very well to the book this was my first time seeing it and it was very fun to see all the book stuff come to life
B003GYEGNO|2.0|I didn't particularly enjoy the book because none of the characters were likeable and the whole thing was depressing.  It is written well, however.
B003NB8KE6|5.0|After a hard day of training these tights really help.  I wear them to sleep and feel much better the next day.  I lift at night and can feel so wound up that I have a hard time going to sleep.  The tights help me sleep which was an added benefit.  I think they are worth it.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|What more could you want? Magic? Broderick? Eighties hair and music that is clearly inconsistent with the medieval backdrop. Love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|An amazing sequel to the first Temple Run, and absolutely addicting!  I wonder if Imangi Studios will make a third Temple Run...
B00BHMF578|5.0|I have a new respect for Ben...his performance rocked!  His oscar acceptance speech nailed it! THe academy made an error in snubbing him.
B0002HZHXG|5.0|This thing is cool!  It makes U.S. and European siren sounds.  Its just a pain to switch between the two.  Other than that, I think that it was worth the money.
B0046ECFRM|2.0|young adult fiction. i'd rate it much higher if i'd read it when I was 14, but the tropes don't extend to people in their twenties.
1435114949|5.0|This book was for an anniversary present and he loved it! He never says much about things he wants but watching the show Elementary triged his intersts in reading the orginal Sherlock Holmes. It was the perfect anniversary present. Thank you!
B00466HN6S|3.0|My little ones liked it. Content was right up their alley. Bring on the Easter basket and put this in instead of candy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is like temple run. But you don't have to rely your device. It is also addictive because when you lose you want to keep going like temple run
B00821PCJS|5.0|Very Spielberg-ish but I enjoy it and it doesn't pull punches that much which is refreshing. It's not as desolate or depressing as the walking dead but that allows it to appeal to a wider audience.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fantastic game,but you need nerves of steel,is a fast paced game for someone who is determined to conquer
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i bought this for myself for my 25th birthday. i could not have asked for a more humbling, soulful, and honest experience. this is a book that stays with you and keeps you human.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|For just killing time without stress, this game app is ok.  It is just matching identical symbols in color and on a 3D cube you can rotate easily with fingers on Kindle Fire HD.
B000P0J09M|5.0|Of course this movie is wonderful. Joe Pesci, Robert DeNero, and Ray Liotta. Enough said. Excellent acting, great story, lots of action.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a very well written book that will get the wheels in your brain turning! Dan Brown is an amazing writer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Just love the show. Cant wait for season 4!  Please don't stop making the show. The actors are all fabulous.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a lot faster pace game than the first ,If you liked Temple Run , you will definately like this one
B006M7JCC2|1.0|1 star only for the wasted paper & ink-This book was frightening, shallow & self centered! From coming up with her own new egocentric \\"religion\\" after her NDE I wanted to be supportive of her treatment, being ill & facing racial & cultural obstacles. However reading her arrogant bashing of medical professionals who were trying to help, speaking of there being no judgement for unrepentant rapists & murderers, condemning & dismissing religious affiliations, and her trashing caring about anything but what \\"feels good in the moment\\" as center of \\"her\\" universe got difficult to read! She had no backing for her elaborate made up sounding details & no evidence or concerning our universe or its origin-I realized a world full of this author would be tragic, painful & hopeless! She essentially calls herself the creator of all knowledge. We can only be One part of her Whole if we aren't rightfully uncaring towards others, are flawless, or conceded & excited to be that way really?  All children have fears & insecurities that we learn to manage & grow in spite of! That's the real world!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|I love this take on the classic Cinderella story.  It provides a basis for connecting fantasy with reality and is one of the few movies in which Drew Barrymore plays her character without appearing as awkward as a toddler trying to wear her dad's army boots.  I love this twist on the classic fairy tale & thoroughly enjoyed Anjelica Houston's portrayal of the wicked stepmother as well as the slightly different perspective offered for the stepsisters.
0553801473|5.0|I became interested in this series of books because of the HBO series Game of Thrones. The books are well written and quite interesting. I'm not usually interested in medieval fantasy, but I'm hooked on these.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is so simple and a very quick read but it can change your life. I would recommend it.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|My wife & I enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining and had some great performances, especially Alan Arkin and John Goodman. It is a nice white hat/black hat movie about a significant actual even., I feel the movie was nor really deserving of the Oscar. Lincoln was a far better film.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Good game to pass the time ,keeps the kids occupied while traveling ,or at anytime you need them to settle down
B00ADYYY50|5.0|You have to hear the CD a couple of times to really feel the vibe. After a while you will it. The beats of course are the best.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|The underlying theme of this movie deals with mortality, how it affects our conscious decisions, as well as the subconscious choices we make as a result of the way it makes us feel.  It is a dry comedy in which Will Ferrell wonderfully represents a more serious character than he typically portrays.  The obvious lack of life & vivacity in Harold Crick's life is contrasted beautifully with the boldness & passion of Maggie Gyllenhall's character and creates an amazing example of opposites attracting and in symbiosis, growing together as they find what they never expected in each other.  This can seem like a bit of a 'debbie-downer' but in truth is an inspiring piece that leaves you fulfilled.
0345529057|5.0|I became hooked on HBO's Game of Thrones series, and then discovered that it was based on a series of books. I've read all of them now, and they did not disappoint. They are well written with rich detail and vivid descriptions that allow you to see what the author does. Fabulous.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Really a nice story and the books are amazing saw the movie and ,I didn't like it that much I'm sticking with the books.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I think horrible book bad book it is going to be the worst book ever invented it is a horrible book
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This makes no sence at all , the kids did not like it, would not play it and did not leave it installed
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Once again another great Ice Age movie that has a lot to offer on family life and how it can some times be hard holding on to the one you love. I think it has a lot of things to teach if we are willing to listen and understand without judgement. I will make you laugh and show what love and friendship can do for you, if only we are will to fight for it. Not in so much a physical way, but emotional, within our own selves. I own it as well as all the Ice Age editions.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excellent Movie !<br />I have always loved the part one of the series. The intensity is amazing.<br />Hope you all have a similar experience
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I enjoyed the Shrek movies, and loved this character in them. When I saw that he'd gotten his own movie, I just had to have it. It really is adorable. I've watched it several times.
B00B2G4O2G|3.0|It is taking me a while to get totally hooked on this...  I'm not sure how much is me and how much is the show -- time will tell!
1616550414|5.0|This was amazing! I have wanted to see something like this for YEARS!<br />We finally get to see a lot of the ideas and concepts that the creators have<br />and it's amazing. The only bad thing was that the book ended.<br />I wanted it to go on forever. =D
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so much fun! Don't listen to the people who gave this 1 star. You can do pretty much anything to the people on the game. They also make weird sounds when you do something to them! I won't tell you any more. You just gotta buy it to see for yourself :) :) :)
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Another great movie packed with some of the biggest stars of today and yesterday. I am from yesterday, so I have seen these guys really excelle in the acting career's. Lots of action, violence and light hearted comedy, if you like Ecpendables 1, you love 2.
B00003OSSL|4.0|I would highly recommend this movie, as it has action, a good message, and even a love story, mixed in.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|It was an OK movie; had some funny parts. Love Helen Mira and Morgan Freeman. Light, entertaining. My grandson likes it because of the explosions and shooting.
B008220DIC|1.0|I rented this movie because of all the praise surrounding it and was eager to see it.  I was open minded going in because of the mix reviews but mostly good reviews with fair warnings of the content and I have to say I was very dissapointed in the movie, in the weirdness, and there was no point.  The movie just jumped all over the place, I couldn't tell if Phoenix's character supported or belived in the Master, while he would jump on someone's case if they critized the master, he never fully embraced his teaching and then while the master seemed to want to help him, he mostly tried to make him look like a fool or as a test dummy to his human psychology.  People talk about the master's character, his wife seemed more weird and more of a believer in his methods than he did.  The relationships just don't make sense, 1 minute the master's daughter is flirting w/ Phoenix, the next she's complaining about his flirtation, 1 minute the son of the master is making fun of his father and his teaching, the next his working at the school.  No consistency to the movie at all.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was really helpful book! It helped me where ever I was! I recommend this book for anyone from ages 8-76!You can literally use it for anything from homework to writing a hit book!Thank you for listening!!!!!!!!!!LOVE ASHLEY<3 <:3--
B00000ICN5|5.0|I love this guy.  Too bad he crashed so early on.  He is one fine blues guitarist -- not laborious like many.  Lots of finesse and his voice and lyrics are a perfect fit.  \\"Love Struck Baby\\", \\"Pride and Joy\\" will have you toe tapping.  Good play for in your car travelin' on.  Blistering, passionate as the notes say.<br />Good stuff!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie with a lot of true history, it is worth seeing. We have to remember that those were different times and though they may of been harsh, it is because of those days we are where we are today. Understand and learn, there is action, drama, family love and discord at times. Wonderful ending.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love this movie so much that I saw it three times in theaters and bought it the day it became available on Amazon. It is deep, full of intrigue and I love David8. It is my ardent wish to purchase a David8.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I'm hooked on HBO's Game of Thrones series, just as I am on the books that it's based on. The acting is top-notch, the stories are interesting, the scenes are rich with detail. It's funny, sad, serious, and a little bizarre. Definitely one to watch.
B004UIOUHC|2.0|I've used Opera Mobile (Android tablet) for its sync capabilities with Opera for Windows (desktop). The tablet crashed and needed to be factory reset, requiring downloads of programs anew. It installed fine but refused to sync. A search for a solution revealed that it is a common situation without a published remedy, a message &#34;Unable to connect to network.&#34;<br /><br />There are always compromises, and I had been reconciled to Opera's many flaws. Oddly, the chronic problem of frequent crashes upon encountering a PDF seemed to have subsided. Well, when it could no longer sync, it was time to move on.<br /><br />With an older Android 2.2 tablet, new versions of Chrome and Firefox for Android are for newer OS tablets. Dolphin is nice but doesn't have a Windows desktop model or sync. I'm trying Maxthon and so far more pleased with Maxthon than with Opera. It's early in my use experience, so we'll see how it goes. Syncing was really easy.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved Crossed!!! The only part I didn't like about Crossed was that it went back and forth with the two main characters Caddie and Ky too much. It sometimes got confusing. But other than that it was an awesome book and a great read.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This guy is inexpensive, and great at extracting the heat straight up into the stack of aluminum heat sink fins and cool down the beast of a processor in a jiff.  If you're all about the air cooling system and want to save yourself some money on the liquid cooling route, you'll be wanting this big block of a heat-sink & fan kit.  This just barely fits into a standard case but with possibly a 1cm - 3cm max left before the tips of the copper piping hits the case.  Though, with little room, you're not going to be needing that extra case fan to exist anyway do to your sweet air cooling upgrade for your top notch machine.
B000UYJR7I|5.0|A great movie showing how we can all have fears that can be overcome with love, patience and understanding. No not all can be saved perhaps, but who makes that decision to leave one behind. Great blues music, drama and truth of the world around us. 5 stars!
B009X2CVXA|5.0|I enjoyed the style of this book. The director of a film - wanting to find out<br />if the film was true to the actual events of the era in which the film was set
B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston is one of my favorite actresses. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie. The acting was superb, but the story line was kind of odd. It's an OK movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Such a great book. Full pictures, nice type and neat writing. I would definitely recommend this book to all of you diary of a wimpy kid fans! :)
B001NHNG64|5.0|Fast paced and interesting characters.  Jack Reacher is in great form...within a great plot...another great story from Lee Childs! Wow!
B001FXCE46|4.0|This is sort of a darker album for them and I really liked it but after the first 3 tracks the quality of the songs really drops off a little in my opinion.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|Easy to read, rich story about a horse that survives the World War despite the turbulent time. Different from the movie.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I like Liam Neeson very much, and the previews were quite enticing. This was a suspenseful, well-done movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is fabulous . The cast, the story lines are so real a d descriptive of the era. Love it more than any show on TV.
B007TML4EI|5.0|love this for teaching my 9 year-old son principles of engineering without him even knowing it! He gets frustrated but keeps trying until he figures it out.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I like this app because it is exercising my brain yet is very relaxing.  The music is nice,too.  Very soothing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this cast of characters.  The scripts are well written and the story flows well.  Once I finish one episode, I can't wait to start the next.  It's like a soap opera only for a more sophisticated audience.  Can't wait to catch up on Season 3.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this series. Well written, excellent acting and directing, interesting story lines, lots of action. Great show. Can't wait for season 3.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Great book ! an easy read for anyone wanting an inside look into what made the stones such a great band! Keith tells it like it is as only he can!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game for all ages I enjoy it very much! Nothing needs to be fix everything is great! I SAY GET SUBWAY SURFERS NOW U WILL LUV IT! ITS A AWESOME GAME 2 PLAY GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B000001ES9|5.0|This is a great CD from start to finish. Rush's first, 3 guys, basic loud hard rock & roll. Had this LP in the beginning, forgot through the years how great it was.Rush are an amazing band still, more technical perhaps, but if you like straight to the point, in your face rock, check this out. You WILL NOT be let down, every track is a winner, too bad radio stations only play &#34;working man&#34; from this LP...  Enjoy! Vinylman/Sandy Hook Entertainment
B00514HDNW|5.0|A great book. An apocalypse story that's different than most. I saw the movie and really liked it. The book is surprisingly different and better than the movie...but isn't that always the case! I highly recommend this book if you liked the movie and end of the world books!
B000092T6M|5.0|I adore Alan Rickman, and he's hysterical and completely insane as the Sheriff of Nottingham. I also adore Morgan Freeman, and he is wonderful as Azim. Kevin Costner acted well, but his complete lack of a British accent, or any accent for that matter, really detracted from the performance. However, this is still one of my favorite movies and I watch it all the time.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|This book kept me reading well into the early hours of the morning. Hard to put down. The concept was brilliant.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is perfect for any type of age. If u never got Temple Run the fist 1 well, u have miss at some great fun! Temple Run was awesome but this 1 is mega awesome epic!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have added in many more details (like the zip line, the cart, the gems, saving libellous, and also just a little more harder) It's a mega awesome epic game play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. WATCH OUT ITS ADDICTING (ONLY U CAN STOP IS IF HE BATTERY DIES)
0765325950|5.0|loved the final installment very good read, couldn't put it down. a little disappointed how did matt get Moraine out of the tower, how did he lose his eye?
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's works great and its a classic! I feel like it's defiantly a basic app people should have on their devices
B00003CXWV|5.0|It amazes me that someone could actually do all this stuff and survive. I hadn't realized it was based on the life of an actual person. It is intense, violent, and touching. Johnny Depp is wonderful.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I was unsure that I wanted to read this book.  I am glad I decided to try it.  This book kept me entralled and I was sorry when it ended. Lucky there was two more to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game.  it so much fun go play and it is so easy to use.  I would recommend it
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very good read, kept me coming back for more. I highly recommend this for young adult readers and will be sharing with my 12 year old son.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Although Charlie hung out with an older crowd, I had to keep reminding myself that the letters were being written from a fifteen/sixteen year old perspective.  The character of Charlie seemed younger and cried a lot more than any teenager I know.
B000NHG7BG|5.0|Al Pacino and Johnny Depp. Undercover in the Italian mafia in New York in the 1970s. Very intense, honest depiction of the life of a mobster. Intense, violent, funny.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Although this was the slowest of the trilogy it was still  a great read. Could not put it down. Will read anything else EL James writes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a great book, and I would love to read more books by the amazingly talented author Suzan Collins.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|The best show ever!  Action Adventure Time/Parallel Universe Travel and all!  The best show to arrive after Lost!  Recommend to all young and adults!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I got this app just wanting an alarm clock, but it is that and more. It has the weather, the time, an alarm, and even the moon phase. I recommend this clock. That is something that I never really pictured myself saying. :) Enjoy!!
B002VWNICC|4.0|I'd heard stories about the Hollywood police department in the early to mid-1900s, so when this movie came out I wanted to see it. The acting is good and the story line is interesting. Overall, a pretty good movie.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I absolutely couldn't put down this book. It was a very nice follow up from the first book and I'm so excited to get the next book!
B005K01VZS|4.0|This is a very touching story about faith, love, and generosity.  The reader is left reflecting on his or her own faith and what it truly means.

B005G5PPGS|4.0|True story about true people and true events and a lot of baseball! Inspiring to think differently and to not be afraid to stand out.
0783229526|1.0|One of the most bizarre, disjointed, crazed, psychadelic movies I've ever seen. The individual that Johnny Depp's character is based on was one disturbed human being. The movie made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever.
B00280LYHS|5.0|A great ending for a great book series I am amazed at how Riordan was able to pull this off 10 out of 5
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|IN THIS BOND MOVIE, YOU GET WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO LEARN TO EXPECT FROM A BOND MOVIE:A LOT OF ACTION- THAT EDGE OF YOUR SEAT ADRENALINE RUSH. HOWEVER, WITH THE PROMISED THRILLS OF BREAKNECK ACTION, YOU ALSO GET  A PRETTY SIMPLISTIC PLOT AND NO NEED TO REALLY USE YOUR BRAIN WHILE VIEWING.<br /><br />IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF SOME GREAT ESCAPISM FROM REALITY- THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.<br /><br />I have seen varied Bond movies with varied men playing Bond over the years.<br /><br />I do like Craig as Bond even if he is a more rough around the edges, type of Bond. (<br /><br />Craig does a decent job with the material he is given.  But in truth, like most Bond movies, this is about action.<br /><br /> Craig just has to show up.<br /><br />In fact, it often bears out that the movie is only about action, with a flimsy plot surrounding it, just to give the action a basis to happen.<br /><br />You  simply don't watch a Bond movie if you want something cerebral.<br /><br />With the progression of Bond movies over the years, it seems there is nothing super sophisticated about spy equipment anymore- it is getting harder to find more interesting or scary bad guys that want to accomplish some evil mission we haven't heard of already-  even the required Bond Girl seemed to be a FAIL in this movie.<br /><br /> Actually, I can't really say we have a true Bond girl for Skyfall.<br /><br />Watch it, to see what I mean.<br /><br /> It seems that 50 yrs of the same Agent doing much of the same things, is starting to show wear.<br /><br />It is not surprising that even the biggest Bond fans have become kind of unimpressed with any spy gadgetry as opposed to 50 yrs ago where viewers were really *wowed* by such.<br /><br />Villains used to be freaky, scary, insane, etc and their desire to accomplish something sinister was once chilling, where now, it has kind of left us numb to it all.<br /><br />Our own world's reality of bad guys across the globe, often ruling nations, tends to make any Bond villain these days seem quite lackluster.<br /><br />The changing times are definitely reflected in this film not just by what isn't impressive any more, but also by our major use and reliance of the internet.<br /><br />The villain and the Secret Service are fighting via computers.<br /><br />The theme of how just about anything can be accomplished by computers is made clear in this movie.<br /><br />(Watch what damage can be done with just keying in a computer command.)<br /><br />Some things in the movie proved interesting, while seeming just as unbelievable at the same time.<br /><br /> But that is the nature of a Bond movie- you suspend all reason and logic the minute the story starts because we all know Bond should have never made it out of the first movie, 50 yrs ago.<br /><br />To his credit, Bardem takes a different kind of quirky, bad guy and manages to both repulse and intrigue us at the same time.<br /><br />The  drab, blonde hair he sports, allows Bardem to morph deeper into his very emotionally deranged character.<br /><br /> Judith Dench. Her main point in this film, is to cover the theme of *loyalty*.<br /><br />SKYFALL and what it all means, will become clearer as the movie moves into the last 3rd.<br /><br />We get an important, revelatory glimpse into Bond's personal life of long ago, but I don't want to offer any spoilers so that is all I will say.<br /><br />Because it is an action packed movie- the storyline goes at a rapid pace.<br /><br /> In the end, however, I felt a sense of, \\" That's it?\\"<br /><br />  Yes, that was it and there was a feeling of hoping for something more from this movie that just wasn't there or just never happened.<br /><br />Can any future Bond movies be kept fresh?

B0090EHVMC|4.0|It's great and funny and all it's just that I totally wasted my money! I think. Cause Netflix is free app but it cost about like $8 a month and there's the lorax on there so ya I pretty much blew my m
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Although I was a little concerned about Rob Pattinson's acting ability, based on previous work, I decided to give this movie a try because of the amazing cast. I was pleasantly surprised. Rob gave an outstanding performance, as did the rest of the wonderful cast. The movie was directed and produced well, and I enjoyed this very much. This shows that if Rob Pattinson has the proper director, he really can act well. Great movie.

B00005N9CV|5.0|Those who wrote negative comments about Diana Krall (or this particular CD) seemed to be either  hearing impaired or perhaps listening to someone else singing.<br /><br />The only other possibility is they are music snobs. I never cared for music snobs.<br /><br />This has to be one of Diana's Krall's best mellow & romantic jazz albums.<br /><br />Frankly, I was very surprised to see the stars and reviews DON'T reflect that.<br /><br />That being said,in the world of jazz, there are many wonderful female jazz singers( living and deceased) and they vary from good to downright incredible.<br /><br />Diana Krall is very good.<br /><br /> Is she among the absolute phenomenal of female jazz singers?<br /><br />Maybe not- but she is still a very good jazz singer in her own right, with her own style.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Krall's voice, you tend to know what songs she pulls off beautifully vs what songs are just average.<br /><br />Personally, I think she is at her best when doing slow romantic numbers or  mellow ,pensive, reflective songs.<br /><br />Not everyone has the capacity to excel in all vocal ranges.<br /><br />There are only so many Whitney Houstons- Celine Dions- Jennifer Hudson- Charice- Carrie Underwood,etc in existence and some of them to not cover this genre of music.<br /><br />Does every female singer have to have the above mentioned ladies' range to still be enjoyed by music lovers? No.<br /><br />Case in point: Mama Cass Elliot - formerly of the MAMAS AND PAPAS went out on her own and did some songs that fit her voice range.<br /><br />Was she technically an extraordinary vocalist?<br /><br /> No- in my opinion she was not; but I still loved many of the songs she put out.<br /><br /> ( I was just a kid when I got to know her music but the same songs still appeal to me)<br /><br />The following songs are just a few examples of songs suited to her voice that she did really well: DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME- NEW WORLD COMING- MAKE YOUR OWN KIND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />I have never been a music snob- if I like it, I like it and that is all that matters.<br /><br />If you listen to the music samples on AMAZON for this Diana Krall cd, you will have a good enough idea if Diana Krall is an artist you can appreciate or if this is a cd you will enjoy.<br /><br />She is married to Elvis Costello and I am sure not everyone is a Costello fan. There is a world of difference between not caring for some one's voice vs deeming them totally untalented.<br /><br />Diana Krall may not be to everyone's taste and I can accept that.<br /><br /> But to call her talentless as a singer is both unfair and  totally untrue.  Just look at the ratings on her other cds here on Amazon- much of her other cds' refute such a notion.D OF MUSIC.<br /><br />I have never been a music snob- if I like it, I like it and that is all that matters.<br /><br />If you listen to the music samples on AMAZON for this Diana Krall cd, you will have a good enough idea if Diana Krall is an artist you can appreciate or if this is a cd you will enjoy.<br /><br />She is married to Elvis Costello and I am sure not everyone is a Costello fan.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I play everyday I enjoy it very much. It is challenging and it exercises my mind.  I especially like to play with med difficultly when the easy level doesn't test me hard enough
B0046B1KHG|5.0|5 star cause, it's funny, funny, funny!!! It's a awesome movie for kids teens and adults so that makes it a great movie for families! The movie is about a despicable villain who is about to have to quit being a villain then he adopts 3 little girls ( you'll see why if you watch it!) who changed his heart and made him a hero. A good guy.
B00513DGIO|5.0|I read a few books on history of the world. This book is another way to look at human history and very relevant about it. Strongly recommended reading.<br /><br />Robert Jean
B000A0K2JO|5.0|I am a programmer and systems engineer and I dance back and forth between two workstations using a IOGEAR KVM switch. This StarTech USB to PS/2 adapter is being used with an Azio LED illumination tri-color back lit keyboard (and this keyboard was bought here on Amazon also and it is friggin' awesome) so I am a happy camper.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's a most watch show. But make sure you start at the first season and go thru all three seasons in order. My wife and watched the whole first season in one night on Amazon vidieo. Which is also a great product. Now we have to wait until next year for sseason 4.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I love the game.  I find it very addicting.  I find myself playing whenever I have time to kill.  If you like mahjong or matching game, I would definately download the game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I can not wait for book four house of Hades finally we are not talking about the Roman gods
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Good sound, picture and overall quality was high.I would definitely recommend Amazon video and will watch more on Amazon video.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I heard a review of this on NPR and couldn't resist giving it to a friend who had read all of the books.  She laughed and loved it!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun and addicting, I could use more games like this on my kindle! I love horses and any horse lover that can't afford or get the real thing will love this game
B0015AARJI|5.0|Exactly what I expected, the price is good even better than buying at the mall and product is the same
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These have a little ridge in the handle that serves as a spoon rest to keep them off the counter.  Bought them for my Cottage in the country.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is by far the best on the market. the graphics are good and it never lags or glitches. there is an extreme amount of things you can do so you never get bored. this version is SO much better than the Pc version. more missions more towers more special agents more everything. this game is relatively cheap and you should 100% get this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played spider solitaire on my computer for years. I am also enjoying it on the smaller format that I can carry with me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow!!! What a good book!  The Rackteer keeps you guessing.  Malcom Bannister is smart, and a shrewd lawyer.  Even though he is in prison he found a way to be freed. John Grisham is a great writer. Love his books
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is an excellent show. Great stories and actors. if you enjoy SciFi it won't disappoint. You have watch the complete series.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|A worthy expense of time.  This series just gets better and better.  You'd think it would get dull after the fall of civilization.  Most zombie films just focus on the drama of the outbreak and subsequent chaos.  This deals with the savage world that emerges in the months after.  Zombie herds?  who knew?
B000EHSVOG|5.0|One of those movies which will always hold it's interest. A top cast with creditable story line & great visual effects for the era in which it was made. Technology may age it but the story concept will always hold it's fear to us all.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I am finding this game to be quite challenging. It keeps me busy trying to match the colors before they pile up too high. I am getting a little better at it each time I play.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My Grandchildren got ahold of my Kindle and guess what I now have on it... I haven't used this app but if their eagerness to nab my Kindle and play on it to battery dry out is any indication...they love it. The survival part for me is how to find my Kindle when I want to use it and to make sure my charger and an electrical outlet is available when I do find it.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it, I wished it would go on - it brings back memories of days gone by, less complicated times when we actually sat together and exchanged stories......just beautiful and comforting - like eating a bowl of hot soup on a cold winter's day<br /><br />Debra Walker
B0049VZ222|5.0|Very good writing.  The zombies are only a plot device upon which to build the characters.  It's more about how people go about surviving and rebuilding relationships in the wake of intolerable stress.  Savage is a word that comes to mind
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game.I play it all the time. The missions keep you interested. Highly recommend this game for all ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and y I chose this book was cause I watched the movie before and people said the book is better than the movie and I agree

B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is hella addictive!  I can't stop playing it!  At first I had no idea how to play it, but I figured it out real quick.  Just touch two boxes in order that match to make them disappear...it's that simple.  Go fast and try to beat your time.  I guarantee you'll have a hard time quitting!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Good book it was an action packed book that as fantastic and<br /><br />Really gets to you at some points I bought the sequel
1612680011|5.0|My brother recommended this book. I'm so glad I read it. I'm recommending it to all my friends. The candid truth laid out in the book helped me see where in life I was and where I want to be. I now havr clear focus, strong determination rise up and out of the middle class. I've contacted an accountant, enrolled in a Stock Market course, signed up with Avon (direct sales) & am looking at a MLM. I'm 40 yrs old but there's a lot of fight left in me. Excellent book. I'll be reading the rest to my famine and kids.
B0081336FO|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes ever since I was a kid, discovering the books. From Basil to Jeremy to now Ben, I thought how are they going to top Season 1? Don't cheat, watch it in sequence the last episode will blow you away!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|It's O.K. for the very young, not a good read for mature audience.  I would say it is not very realistic in this high tec world.
0547391005|5.0|My son loves bed-time stories so when I saw this book I had to get it for him and as soon as 8:00 PM hits he's so ready to go to bed to listen to a Curious George adventure, the book is pretty big and it comes with an audio CD. As for the seller I got it a bit earlier than promised and that's always good!!!
B008D37J6O|5.0|I THINK THIS IS A GREAT APP FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WATCH THEIR VIDEOS WITHOUT HAVING TO SEARCH ALL THEIR VIDEO FILES BECAUSE IT'S ALL IN ONE PLACE.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game rocks! Also, it is the original! After playing it you'll realize that there are a whole bunch of knock-offs, but this one is legitimate. I totally suggest it.
B008220DIC|1.0|I have seen all of Anderson's films and loved every one, but this one is a navel-gazing, self-important hot mess.  Terrible, meandering pointless script, every scene dragged out until you want to scream; this is Razzie Award winning self-indulgence.  This is someone who is convinced he is god's gift to film. Awful.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I got this to keep up with friends and to play FV2. FM2 will not load. I am having problems with this app. Always telling me to updat my flash player. What?
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have always wanted to see this when growing up but I was told that it was too sad and that i probably wouldn't like it. Well I love it.. and even if I never get the chance to see it in person on stage I can still enjoy it with this!
B001S86J0I|5.0|This is a good movie with a star packed cast. With many twists and turns you never know what is going to happen next. Love It
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle App is the best thing since white bread.  I have it on my kindle (of course), my phone, home computer and work computer.  Very easy to download books. I LOVE that I start a book on one kindle app. and continue reading it on all my others kindles.  Lend and borrow books from friends also.  Reading has never been easier.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My 5 year old loves this movie.  It was one of his favorite Christmas gifts and he still watches is all the time.
1616550414|5.0|This book is essentially everything a Zelda fan could look for in a book. It has amazing art, an incredible timeline (FINALLY), a full history of Hyrule, and a Skyward Sword MANGA! What more could a Zelda fan ask for? And, for the price, this book is certainly a must-buy. I would have paid $50 instead of $20 if I saw the beautiful quality this book was printed with. A must-have for fans of the series.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This is a great app. The game play is good and the graphics are fantastic. However, there is a problem. After playing the game over serveral days I recieved continuing notices that my kindle was trying the connect the kindle app store to buy more pic packs for the app. This continued at an increasing rate so that the game became unplayable. At this point I removed the app from my device to the cloud.  The software publishers need to fix this problem ASAP.  Therefore I give this app a 1 out of five. Why  would I purchase the full version now??????  GOOD LUCK TO ALL WITH THE APP.......
B00003CXXS|5.0|To me this was the best one out of the series. Loved the story line and the cast. The action of it was perfectly proportioned. LOVED IT
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say I was truly shocked by some of what I was reading. But all in all it was a good book.
B005IX1SLY|5.0|I love this album and it has become a regular on my iPod playlists. Great beats, good variety of songs and really catchy choruses. I highly recommend this album.
B006WTINSY|5.0|*sigh* the 20th century paganini.  What could be worse than listening to this and realising that he dies at 28.  Think about wht Miles Davis achieved after 28..... and what Hendrix might have.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So many good parts.  From fat Amy to Aca-awesome and to the commentators who seem to be talking to no one.  I strongly recommend it.
6305428271|5.0|This is a great movie. besides batman returns and dark shadows this is my favorite michelle phiffer movie. it can be a very relatable movie. Love It.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|This is such a wonderful movie.  Downloaded it to watch with my almost 3 year old grandson.  I had seen it many times before, but still love it.  Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory!
B00821OX98|4.0|Overall definitely enjoyed season one. What you would expect from a movie about post apocalyptic world.  But with some surprises and good character development.  Reminds me a little of walking with the dead but still different enough to justify a separate show.  i really like that Harley riding chef guy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very exciting and fast moving.  I like the Jack Ryan characters...strong and decisive.  One of my favorite all time books is Hunt For the Red October. This book is almost as good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie deserved to win best picture.  I recommend this movie to history buffs and anyone who likes gripping drama.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Although not my favorite, it has all of the needed elements of an excellent novel.  Plenty of romance with lots of intrigue.  Fans will not be disappointed.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It says chess and there is chess. It's hard to mess up chess. It is also free. I like free chess.
B0060CXN2O|2.0|This is the first movie I have bought through instant watch and it will probably be my last.  I love the movie and the sound and picture were good but I am VERY unhappy that it is not wide screen!  I would never buy a full screen movie as it distorts the picture and you loose so much of it.  If I can find out how to get a refund I certainly will.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I found this to be a delightful read- it was so much fun to read.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who does not want a serious read
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love Whedon and this show was great.  It is too bad it ended after one season and one movie.  I have seen it before and probably will view again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The ending reminds me of true love, of why our hearts can be deceived but also helps me understand life from a new perspective
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It's supernatural! I love anything to do with the paranormal/supernatural. Particularly anything with ghosts but demons, demi gods, angels, pergatory, etc etc rules too
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun and exciting good game for the road or s rainy day<br />fun to unlock characters<br />could be more interesting<br />mystery boxes are my favotite
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Every episode is as funny or even funnier than the one before. The material is always fresh and current. I don't know how these characters can keep telling new hilarious stories.
B002APU580|4.0|Just a pleasure from beginning to end. My only complaint: Keira Knightley is too pretty for the character of Elizabeth Bennett. Otherwise, wonderful.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I really loved this story. It relects a time when women were responsible for whatever men did to them. The ending was sad but I'll remember this story for a long time to come.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|This app is great. I can download all of my PDF files for school and highlight, underline, write notes etc. It even reads to you if you have it on the kindle. The only thing that is a little annoying is organizing. You can't just drag a file into a folder and I still cant figure out how to open a new folder. When you save it you click on the three vertical boxes at the top right. Click file and then save as. You can click the file folder to choose which to save it under, but I can't figure out how to open up new folders to save them under. Anyway other than that this app was a good investment.
B008KEQMDC|3.0|Not the best 3 stars is plenty. Very chick flicky .... overly much wit it on dat I b sayin
B0081336FO|5.0|Great show!  Fast moving and well written.  Nice to see Sherlock and Watson in the 21st century.  Looking forward to the next season.
B006O6FK2W|4.0|this toy is fun. I got it for my little brother and he loved it. batman does shoot out. it doesn't go that far. it goes approx. 7-8 feet. but for a little batman fan it is awesome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i really love how much you can do with your horse!i especially love many choices of horses and places for your horse.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I enjoyed this more than about any other game on my phone. While not difficult, it is soothing and relaxing. Not many games can say that.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I have problems &#34;loving&#34; a television show or any entertainment event, otherwise Downton would be a five star.  Great, yes, it's a great series.<br /><br />A great cast partially filmed in an historic great English &#34;house&#34;. It's worth the watching just to see the marvelous Maggie Smith posing as a Victorian/Edwardian grand dame, &#34;wise cracking&#34; her way through scenes with looks that could kill all on their own.<br /><br />In the reality of the day did Isis Lord Grantham's dog actually have the &#34;run of the house&#34;, tagging along beside him in scene after scene?  Did they really have four legged house pets in a place like &#34;Downton Abbey?  Wouldn't the dog have been confined to the stable, and the grounds when a hunt was on?  I mean after all for less than 20 Old English Pounds Sterling a year Grantham's seemingly beloved dog could have had a valet of his own to look after him!  (about $80.00 in early 1920's US money!)
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My son and daughter and I have had so much fun using this set with the other ones that we have and building the stuff on the cards. My kids are learning to build the patterns and figure out how hard/far the birds need to go. My only complaint is one of the catapults (could be this set or one of others- we have three of them) was pretty weak. Otherwise, it's been really fun. Now we have alternate catapults too- hard and weak ones.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Spellbinding to the last page! In the tradition of P.D.James, Ruth Rendell, Peter Robinson and other masters of the craft, Mays melds intelligence, character and beautiful language to create a haunting mystery that keeps you guessing!
3640246993|1.0|I was searching for the full books of Les Miserables (3 tomes) and thought this was the first of the tomes.  However, this is only several chapters from the middle of the first tome.  It is not a simplified version - just a small part of the original.<br /><br />As far as the theme of the book itself - amazing!  If you can find the complete edition I highly recommend Victor Hugo's works.  They are long, but interesting.  I am a French student and there are lots of vocabulary styles of writing that are unfamiliar to me, but it is worth the effort.  As far as the publisher, the book itself was in good shape, no problems with binding or other issues.
0316077046|5.0|great book great series. must read keeps you so into the story. all four books are a must have. looks just like the on line photo.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather in BluRay is awesome. Haven't seen it in many years. The clarity and of course no commercial interruptions made it a must have. 5 Stars
B007REV4T8|5.0|Quick shipping and best price made it worth a few days wait from initial release date.  The story line took a different approach than any earlier James Bond flick and was most enjoyable because of it.  A keeper to be sure!
0887081770|1.0|My son fell in love with this book at a friend's house so I went to the mobile app and ordered it. Wish I had thought to check out why the reviews were so poor - this is NOT the original version. It measures 6&#34;x4&#34; and is way too small to be enjoyable. Returned.

B002RI9UBS|4.0|Beautifully written! A treat for the senses as well as the soul. The twist at the end genuinely caught me. Read it!!
B00A0A6F7C|3.0|Liked it, but didn't love it as much as her debut album. I didn't care for the songs featuring duets.

B002FQOI0A|5.0|Well written and a big page turner book. You couldn't stop reading no matter what. Breath taking. I recommend this book to any who will sit down a wouldn't want to stand back up.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Ok to start off i just want to say bravo Rick Riordan! He's done it again. It's easy to read and understand and leaves you waiting in suspense for the next book. I like how you see several of the demigods perspectives.They are all so diffrent so it helps put it in perspective. Percy is still the same unforgettable &#34;Seaweed brain&#34;,Jason is cool and mysterious,and Leo is simply wondnerful. He is so funny.The whole idea of going to Rome was great. My only complaint is the Percy/Annabeth romance is not the greatest.  guess its fine but personally i thought it takes your mind off who Annabeth really is. shes a tough and smart girl not a &#34;giggly oh i've got a heart full of love&#34; person. other than that it's a great read. well done Mr. Riordan!
0385536828|3.0|Perhaps it was a little too subtle for me,couldn't really cuddle up to it in bed! I found it too literary,Pun intended.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show out right now. If you love zombie hunting, blood and guts, and once and awhile a heartwarming moment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun this game show you everything. and since I don't have a real horse its entertaining.I love it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Ok Percy Jackson fans..this is it! That wonderfully awesome dude who radiates awesomeness is back. To explain my title i have to say there is another camp called camp jupiter with the kids of the same gods only under diffrent aspects. Yea their a little more old fashion and well you get the jist.......This insanly awesome blonde dude wakes up on a bus with a BFF and a girlfriend he never knew he had.To be exact he has not the least idea who they are or even who he is. He has no memory. Then after a unnatural storm blows his Girlfriend Piper away and finds out he can Fly and busts some heads with a sword/spear he gets taken away along with Piper and Leo his bff(oh btw the guys name is jason) to a camp where demi gods are trained known as camp half blood. For some reason he feels out of place. Leo finds out hes the son of Hephastus and Piper is the daughter of Aphrodite. Jason finds out that he's the son of Jupiter(or zeus whatever) and that his memory was stolen by Hera and that this dude named percy is missing. finally he teams to go save the world world with Piper and Leo. They also have to find her most annoyingness Hera. Hey i know this is a spoiler but Jason is Thalia's little brother. Yes the totally awesome goth huntress is his big sissy. Well do Jason/Piper/Leo team ever find Hera? well i have already spoiled enough so get moving and buy the book! believe me it's worth it. Well done Mr. Riordan! Keep it up!  Sincerly,A Jackson fan
030758836X|5.0|The format was unusual,very intriguing,truly a book I could hardly put down.I have never read anything by Gillian Flynn before but I will in the future.
B00B2QA9TI|4.0|loved it, wasn't sure if I would at first but got into it by the middle and was really loving it by the end.
1426308469|5.0|My grandson already had this book so I returned the purchase.  However when visiting him I read the book and it is excellent.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Well i do like the book.It's cute and all that but it lacks something. i do not know what. The movie was cute as well but if it's better.....I think this is a very easy read and that it's worth the time but it's not all it's reaved up to be.  The other 13 books are worth the time as well. Enjoy
0307960471|5.0|And I didn't like Jo Nesbo killing him off!!!!Hope he comes up with a new interesting detective and we get a translation soon.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|This album is slightly less &#34;house&#34; than some of his previous releases and more techno and dubstep-influenced.  I liked it a lot, other than the song with too many male vocals.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Been hearing about this show for a while now. Finally had the opportunity to watch the first season and I am hooked!
B002WN35DC|5.0|This book speaks about the humanity of friendship, the universal need of companionship and of the real necessity to be loved.
B008745B32|3.0|I saw the TV miniseries starring Anthony Andrews years ago--it didn't make that great an impression on me except for the settings--but I&#34;d never read the book. When Amazon offered it for a reasonable price, I got it.<br /><br />The story starts in World War II, when the hero is stationed at one of England's manor homes. It happens to be one he's very familiar with, and thus the recollections of events between the two world wars are jarred. He was at school with the younger son of the manor's family and despite a relative's warning, took up with him. Visits to the manor bring him in contact with the dysfunctional family. Mother is wedded to her Catholic religion, father lives abroad with his mistress, older brother is pompous, the sister... Our hero falls in love with the sister. Not surprising since he's been so taken with her brother from the start. But the romance is eventually doomed.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful, the descriptions lyrical, but the story's kind of blah. In the end, religion wins out and leaves everyone pretty unhappy. I was relieved to be done with it.
B000FC10MU|4.0|The plot is fresh and original.  I enjoyed the characters.  Looking forward to how the stories are expanded for the HBO project.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a great story teller.  Love the Mitch Rapp series and &#34;The Last Man&#34; didn't disappoint!  Can't<br />wait for the next book.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|I encourage anyone who likes watching things on TV to get this. You do not have to be an avid snowboarder to enjoy the sights and sounds (not to mention the Travis show) This Blu-Ray will show you what your home entertainment center can do. The visuals are astoundingly beautiful and awe inspiring. Taking you though breath taking mountain ranges and wilderness you will see every flake of snow and ray of sunlight. The sound track is second to none and they sow it together in such a way that your 5.1 or 7.1 setup will absolutely scream from every direction.<br /><br />Purchase this set to test your system and show it off to friends/family and you will find yourself sitting in your chair wishing you could go back and grow up a snowboarder... remember you can still push your kids into it and live vicariously through them.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|With Quentin Tarantino's name attached to the film, The Man With the Iron Fists quickly became a must see for me. Tarantino isn't the producer or director but his name is attached to the film as a presenter. Anything with Tarantino's name attached in any capacity deserves a watch in my book.<br /><br />The Man With the Iron Fists (2012, Universal Pictures)is a spoof of classic kung fu movies. The plot centers around a blacksmith (RZA) whose is working so he can earn enough money to leave his dangerous village. He gets wrapped up in a feud over gold between clans in the village. That's about all there is for the plot. It's pretty thin but does just enough to provide a vehicle for some great action.<br /><br />And that action is what really shines in this movie. The pacing is swift, leaving very little time between action sequences. The action sequences themselves are some of the most satisfying I have seen in some time. RZA takes us back to the classic Kung Fu days with over the top, very stylized, floaty fight scenes. These scenes are enhanced by the unique weapons that various characters posses. It almost reminded me of Mortal Kombat with each character truly having different skill sets and weapons. Add in the wonderfully score also done by RZA and you get some very entertaining action scenes.<br /><br />With that said, the time between action set pieces is where this movie suffered. We were left to sit through uninspiring dialogue which really took away from the experience. That is the one place I think RZA really needs to put in the work and where his friend Tarantino shines through. We also had to deal with sub par acting (particularly from RZA). I think he may have been better off just sticking to writing, directing, and scoring the movie.<br /><br />Over all, the plusses far outweigh the negatives. I didn't go in expecting Oscar performances from RZA or Crowe, I came for the action and action we got. With practically non stop over the top gory action, set to hip hop music, there was definitely a lot to enjoy in this one. I highly recommend this to fans of classic kung fu as well as fans of Tarantino's.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was expecting it to be a raunchy film but it wasn't too bad.  It had a pretty good story, had a lot of good laughs, and I would watch it again.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is a good read!  Love the way Tom Clancy has continued the Jack Ryan series. I'm invested in the<br />characters and feel like it's a smooth transition from book to the next.  I always look forward to his next release!
1439130833|5.0|From  my purchase of THE SECRET (and the workbook )  I have personally come to know the dictionary's meaning of satisfaction.<br /><br />I wouldn't have purchased this book through any other source. I am very pleased with my selection of books and the place where I purchased them
6305692572|4.0|I never remembered the little girl who would grow up to be \\"Deb\\" in \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" turned in one of the finest performances from any child actor ever.  The adults are usually subtle and effective as well.  Minus one star for the somewhat contrived separation (would a caring man like this abandon his daughters at the most fragile moment of their lives?) and the slightly cliched speeches each makes at al-anon, but the basic structure is extremely lifelike.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|This is no disappointment.  I was transported into the world almost immediately.  All I can say is that Terry is definately a master.  Thank you!
B0086HGW42|4.0|OK, so I took my 15 year old daughter and her friends to see Ed Sheeran live.  He was excellent, very talented and creative so I broke down and bought the album digitally.  Not disappointed, think he could be one that is around awhile vs the other pop stars out there.  And if you can see him in concert, go...
B000025Y9I|4.0|This is a classic CD. One of his best. I highly recommend this CD. Finer guitar work you would be hard pressed to find.
0060507772|5.0|i usualy buy books when they get under 5$, this one has never been that low so i famaly gave in and just got it. it is worth every penny. the story of five old heros going to go out with a bang and tell the gods what they thought of getting old at the same time is priceless. the whole joke on the space program of the &#34;heros&#34; from anakmorpork is so funny that i almost forgot to stop and look at the gorgeouse pictures! i think my fave is the full page of swamp dragon breeds. it reminds me of the posters of dog and cat breeds put out by the show assoations.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Hopeless is a pretty easy read, but had good teenage characters.  The main character, Skye, was a likeable, as was her love interest, Holder.  The two meet unexpectedly and realize they have a mysterious connection.  The writer uses flashbacks, which was a good way to bring in more of the background.<br /><br />Very predictable (at times overly obvious)...this is not a book you'll read a second time, but it is a great book for afternoons by the pool or on a rainy day.
B002MY9NF0|4.0|This was a well produced movie attempting to tell the Frank Herbert Dune saga.  It failed to completely please die-hard Dune fans, but was a credible retelling of the story.  I come back every couple of years and view the film.  I always enjoy it.
B000I5X80G|4.0|It is about what I expected, sound quality not so good but it was a live show there are many Neil Young albums to choose from.
0060872675|5.0|it is a realy short book (i breezed throught it in about ten mintutes if i only read the story) but for a young reader or even for those still learning (and being read to) this book is fun. the idea is that a book is being read to a child about a farm, one the child is never likely to ever see, and the reader (dad) decides to change it up a bit to make it more likely to be of use. where's my cow? becomes (breifly) where's my daddy? and the result is a good lauph.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|I've read may biographies and autobiographies, and Woz is perhaps the only person I still admire after finishing their story. He writes in a very genuine style, and seems to have found a true happiness in life in spite of all the pressures that fame and Apple threw at him. As an engineer and computer geek, I related to a lot of his passion for the life's work he has done.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I love puzzles so I guess this has potential but I have no idea how to use it. It would be so helpful if puzzles came with a short description.
0312427646|5.0|Alan Bennett in this short novella imagines the Queen of England as an incipient bookworm.  If you love to read this will become one of your favorites.<br /><br />Douglas Schmidt
B00AU15HPC|3.0|After three of four listens I can't say I'm overly wrapped in this release. It does have some nice moments, but there's nothing to get that excited about. \\"It's cold outside of your heart\\" was never that great a song the first time 'round, and to me, this version doesn't improve on it. And as for the remixes of \\"I know your out there somewhere\\" well, the less said the better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just don't buy much stuff when there is so much out there to watch and read for free - but I find myself clicking on that &#34;pay&#34; button every time for this show.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I like this game the only thing that I dislike is how many times rate this game pop's up but I like the challenge of trying to get money.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great cast. Good quirky interaction mixed with technology and scfi. Cross between x-files and lost. Five more words required. One more word required. (Stop forcing extra words. Some People want short reviews)
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Great movie - obviously, even if it has been embellished for Hollywood drama.  The interviews at the end with Tony Mendez and the real embassy staffers add great context.
1426209584|5.0|Gorgeous photos, and interesting text about the birds themselves, plus the difficulties of photographing them. See some of these critters in real life is definitely on my bucket list.
B000I9YLUI|4.0|Pride and Prejudice has been done in film and stage to death.  I know this topic is not new, but Knightly gives us a fresh look at Elizabeth Bennet in this presentation.  Mostly faithful to the book, I think all audiences will enjoy this tale that still lives because of the genius of Jane Austen more than 200 years ago.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I never tried the free version, just went straight for the paid one, I never had any problem with not having all the sounds as peoplenl have stated in the low reviews. All ive experienced is wonderful, rich sounds. The binaural tones really seem to work, I was somewhat skeptically that they couldnmake me dream, but they did, even just turned down low. I would recommend this app to all my friends. I really feel I got more than my money's worth!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great stories, great writing, great acting, great actors yours and the best make up and effects of any television show ever produced. The walking dead is easily the greatest program ever produced for television. If you're a horror film fan You won't be disappointed by the blood guts and gore and scare. If you're not a horror film fan then you will be impressed by the writing the acting and quite simply the story lines of this show make it five stars all the way!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My friend had it and I wanted it too.  When I found it, I got it right away and played it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Found a wonderful program my wife and I can watch together...sometimes that can be hard to do :-) We look forward to the next one as soon as we finish an episode.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|If your a fiction writer, this book will give you a system that produced results that you can copy and apply to your own situation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I usually play in the &#34;car line&#34; while I am waiting to pick up my grandchildren from school.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is good for developing your brain for almost any age.  My Mom loves to play it too.  I am only 9 and my Mom is 42.
B008NEVP1S|3.0|first of all, the CD is on the short side, not quite 40 minutes.  also the first few songs are a little bland.  i love aimee mann and i'll still buy everything she makes, but i was a little disappointed with Charmer.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Ben Affleck did a poor job for the roll he played.<br /><br />didn't think it deserved an oscar for best picture there were far better movies than Argo.  Politics is alive in Hollywood.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|very well made movie, i enjoyed it . simply put: it's a movie for grown ups and i mean that in a very complimentary way. i have never been a fan of affleck, but he might be one of the better director out there. i totally recomend this movie.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I think its better then skyfall 007 in my opinion I love all the gadget use in the movie down to action very good watch
0307712508|5.0|The story touched my heart. I'm thankful for her cell's being used for research in fighting cancer.  Maybe because of her cells my cancer is gone.  The glory goes to God and I thank God for Henrietta.  The audiobook was read beautifully by the two women.  The author Rebecca Skloot explain cell research in a way I could understand.  Henrietta Lacks I'm glad to know whom you were. I loved the story.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Stupid and extremely dumb very hard movie to follow.  Expected more from Bruce Willis, was totally disappointed in his preformance.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As the end of the Hunger Games, it was a good read.  I enjoyed it, but was a little down hearted at the end. I would recommend it even with the ending.
B000URWYTS|4.0|This book explores the life of an American Icon.  What many people don't know about this brilliant man is that he experienced a horrific life event.  Loving Frank is a fictional account based on this time in Frank Lloyd Wright's life as seen through the eyes of his long time lover.  The book is well written and at times riveting as it explores what it meant to go against societal norms at the first part of the last century.  A few areas of the book are a little slow and rambling, especially the time in their lives where they lived in Europe.  However, by the end I felt that I had lost a friend.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to play! I wish you could pick your own horse. Even that is a minor thing. If you're a fan of horses its highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|THIS is an awesome book.much better than his other books. Much better than the movie. I can't wait to read it again.
B00064X282|5.0|Provides hours of listening pleasure. SACD much better than standard CD, if you have the right equipment. Would hope more releases will follow.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game and I'm not much of a gamer. it really makes you think. I upgraded to the other levels because I loved it so much!! the first set of levels are nice and easy for kids so its all around great game!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Pretty much an enjoyable easy read.  A nice change of pace from the Husserl, Heidegger and others I have to read in grad school.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Watched it with the family, was a pretty decent movie.  Would recommend it to a friend.  Seemed to apply to ages teen and avbove.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I do enjoy this game, once I got the hang of it, its a good way to kill time!  And it helps keep your reflexes sharp.<br /><br />I enjoy these little games because they do help you keep your wits about you!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I just cant believe this game is so much fun. It is very easy to play. I can play with it non stop at times.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I've seen a lot of 3D movies.  Probably too many.  And I don't think the Top Gun 3D-bashing is warranted.  Maybe it's just that next to modern movies, Top Gun really isn't all that mind-blowing and visually impressive, and there aren't tooo many scenes to really &#34;wow&#34; you with 3D and depth..?  The flying looks great, but most of the movies is just a lot of people standing around, sitting around, singing, etc..  But, hey, we all know the movie already!  And even all those &#34;plot&#34; scenes have very good 3D.  It's really not all that &#34;actiony&#34; of a movie for them to over-the-top 3D it..<br /><br />Personally, I think it's a pretty excellent 3D conversion.  Very natural, and it definitely added to the movie.  I'll tell you, though, small screens don't do 3D the justice it deserves..  The smaller the screen, the less noticeable the 3D effect generally is.  Unless you're reeeally close to the screen.  And when you have a movie with natural 3D, there isn't much of the over-exaggerated &#34;popping out of the screen&#34; effect.  Top Gun has none of that.  All the 3D is depth &#34;into&#34; the screen.  Perhaps that's why people aren't as impressed with the 3D at home, but it was good in the theater?  I have a 3D projector setup, and it was great, if you ask me..  The flying looked great.  The planes were definitely in 3D..  It felt like I was looking at them in the distance, as they were chasing each other.  And some of the flying shots were just awesome, when they were doing spins, and chasing down the migs, etc..  But again, it's definitely not an extreme-3D experience, like a lot of the IMAX documentaries, which are filmed to show some particularly extreme foreground to background shots to really &#34;wow&#34; you with depth.  This is a bit more subtle, but it's still very obvious, and looks great.  It looks very natural, really.  Thumbs up!<br /><br />One other thing I'd like to mention, is the movie was not at all &#34;dark&#34; in terms of 3D.I don't think there were any scenes where it felt too dark.  Nice and comfortable the whole way through.<br /><br />As for the grain, I would say it was definitely obvious and you'll definitely notice it at points (it's not grainy the whole time)..  but what can you do?  Grain happens..  It's not a bad transfer so much as it just comes with the territory of older films..  If you want to see a bad digital transfer and a horrible blu-ray conversion, watch the original Total Recall on blu-ray.  THAT is bad.  Top Gun just suffers from its filming limitations..  It comes from the ISO of the film used...  You tend to see grain more in DARK scenes, because there's less light, so they need to use higher-ISO film, which introduces more grain..<br /><br />There's some grain in some of the cockpit shots, but by the end of the movie I didn't notice it in those shots anymore..  Either it was only in some of the earlier cockpit shots, or I just got used to it..  I think it was most obvious right at the beginning when they cut to the control room on the aircraft carrier..  It's dark in there, and there's a lot of grain...  That's probably the worst of it.  Most of the flying is pretty much grain-free, since they're filming in nice bright skies..  The grain was noticeable, sure, and kinda annoying at first, but it's worth it and you get used to it.  And keeping it in is definitely better than removing it and leaving us with poor over-processed images.  I'm sure they would have removed it if it wouldn't have made things worse.<br /><br />It's probably so noticeable since a lot of the movie is NOT grainy, and then you cut to a really grainy scene.  I got so used to it, though, that I really only remember making note of it in the first third or so..  after that, I can't think of a particularly grainy scene.  By the end of the movie, I was more annoyed by re-use of misfired missile footage, personally (spoiler alert?)...  Anyway, if you can't stand grain in movies, then you'll definitely have a problem..  otherwise it'll just be a minor set back..
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I don't feel the need to explain myself... I recommend checking out Tessellate and Breezeblocks on youtube. Watch the breezeblocks music video in reverse to get the full experience.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|This has been one of my favorites since I was a kid. Now that my son has started playing the guitar, I thought it would be cool if he watched this cult classic. He thought it was great and borrowed it to watch with his grandma. Mom, Victory :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although it seems slow at the beginning, Mockingjay has a lot of twists, turns, and surprises (in particular one vote that all the remaining living tributes make that shocks me).
B005BGBPBG|3.0|There was great chemistry between all the characters.  It was wasn't I want to tell all my friends about this movie.  However, it was good entertainment.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|known for &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; but it's chocked full of awesomeness. The deluxe addition has 3 extra songs. Favorite songs include: Thin Line, Same Love, Jimmy Lovine, Ten Thousand Hours, A Wake.... oh sorry, I'm just listing the entire album at this point...
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I have a tendency to yell at the television when the show doesn't follow all the details I read in the book, but it's still a fantastic series. I'm really glad I bought it.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I have seen this movie several times, and enjoyed it so much i wanted my own copy.  I have a collection of old war movies and this is one of my favorites.  It arrived when it was suppose to and in great condition.  I will do business with you again!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|It's a great app, that unfortunately does not sync with my Google on my kindle, but I have the same app for my galaxy tab and my phone and here it works great. I love it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I are totally hooked on this series.  It's outstanding!  Season one was great, and season two was even better.  Can't wait to start season three!!
B0067R0APK|3.0|Only the paid version works. Before I bought it the free version would never work. I hope this don't happento thisone.
B000HSKUBE|3.0|I think Netflix watched the British version and said lets add some sex and vulgar language and the American's will love it.  It was interesting watching how the British screw each other over as compared to the Americans.  I gave it three stars because I liked it better than the Netflix version, but overall I don't particularly like to watch shows where the main thing is how well we can screw somebody else over.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Really enjoy this app. It is much like the one I have on my phone, reliable and dependable.  Enjoy the multiple alarm sounds as well.
B007HOOAH6|5.0|Story is really helping ease the scary stigma of using the potty cor my two year old boy. Plus we get to have fun make bathroom noises together during the read.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|As with any new cd it takes some time to appreciate the new music. Everything he sings is very good, or excellent.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|I love Gamesoft so I try to get a lot of their games and out of all the ones I have this is actually my favorite one. I love the story and the battle system. reminds me of playing Devil May Cry the difference is your not a demon and your in Armor. I love the music and the Multiplayer is totally amazing! a must get!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Has to be one of the slowest start books that I have ever read. I fell asleep ready it several times. It took to 53% before the book good. At the ending it felt like even the author got tired of the book & just wanted to end it. Hence, the extremely abrupt ending. I felt cheated. After painfully trudging through the book and then getting an anti-climatic ending, I wanted to scream. Too many loose strings. The only bright side of the whole experience is I didn't waste money on it. I got it from my local library.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is a fast pace, 3D concentration-like, Mahjonng-ish entertainment. Addictive, brain exercise! I recommend it for all. My 7yo grand daughter loves it too!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show because it constantly keeps me guessing. Whenver I think I know whats going on they surprise me. LOVE THE CAST, Love the story!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I think this movie might well scare the clothes off of people who have a fear of flying for any reason. The main character is such a hopeless alcoholic and drugger, we are forced to root against him. He is similar to many of our everyday meets, only they are not responsible for an aircraft full of people.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|My knitting friends recommended this series as my introduction into steampunk literature!  So glad they did.  Fun story, great writing, and (for a voracious reader like me) a quick read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The great story continues.  Maggie Smith's one-lingers are hilarious. It's amazing how the writers are able to show everyday life and also incorporate historical events.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Nice story, humble fellow.  how can the music industry not catch this talent .. oh, maybe cuz he doesn't lip-synch :-).  Worth watch, feel good documentary.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|I really really wanted to love Cloud Atlas, because I love the premise of it, and the trailer looks excellent. The book isn't bad as such, but it is just so slow moving, and I was half-way through it before I really started caring about any of the characters - and just as you start caring about one character you move on to the next.<br />The layout is interesting, and from a theoretical standpoint I really liked it, but in praxis it just didn't work for me.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Good movie, a little darker than the animated series, but good none the less.  The ultimate battle between Batman and the man of steel.  And guess who comes out on top!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|God o love this book so much at the end I had to cry this was so beautifully written written and so amazingly touching. I don't cry at many books but I got to say It was full of so much emotion.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|As Victoria grows up in this novel, you will find yourself cheering for her to succeed. The chapters that alternate between Victoria's childhood and the present keep the story moving along rapidly while adding important clues to her personality. The relationships are complicated and multifaceted, just like in real life. I loved learning about the flowers and the messages they could send! This novel left me wanting more.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Over the past couple of weeks I've been reading Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. I wanted to read it before the movie came out (11th of January 2013 in Ireland), and just managed to do it. (I read the free Kindle edition).<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that the story of Les Miserables is timeless, and I think everyone should get to know it one way or another.<br /><br />When that is said however, I probably wouldn't recommend the book to most people. I can't speak for the French, I'm sure the original is more beautiful than the translation. However, the style or writing is very old-fashioned, and incredibly drawn out. To be honest, I skimmed through about a quarter of the book - chapter upon chapter about the battle at Waterloo - almost completely unrelated to the story at hand- was just too much for me.<br /><br />There is a lot of beauty in the book though, and the story is as relevant today as ever.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Gift<br />As a gift for a co-worker. She really love the case and how it met her needs. I purchase 2 and her 12 year old son loved his.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|Slow start. Ok story. I know he was playing Dracula but he sounded like Gru from \\"Despicable Me\\". The funniest parts are in the trailer
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I can't finish the game because in 8-8 Lep won't stick to the left wall! Grrrr there is no other way to get through this level. HELP Frustrated
1936608898|5.0|This book is a GREAT way to learn more about how are bodies work. It breaks everything down and explains the science in an uncomplicated, easy way to understand. Anyone can read this book and get it. If you follow the meal plan they map out in this book, there is NO doubt it will change your life in one way or the other. It changed mine in countless ways, and I can't stop talking about this book and the Whole30!! I'd recommend this to everyone thinking of making a lifestyle change with their diet!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I have not been able to watch Episode 6...even though I ended up purchasin it in stead of using my Prime account.  I still own it though, so maybe there is still a chance.  I am away from my country...in case that matters.  I will try again when I get home.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was everything I'd hope it would be.  I couldn't wait to see the next episode.  I am on episode 5.  Trying to watch them slowly so I won't finish the Season.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome! If you liked the lost heroes you'll love these!! I am 26 and love these books, great fun for all ages!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|This is one of the best seasons of Lost. Many secrets are revealed. but at the same time there are many others that appear through the episodes.Very interesting and intriguin season... I love it!
B000IYU9IG|1.0|I was able to get sound but was not able to get any image.  I was not a happy camper.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a bible app that I would recommend any one use. Our has everything you need for a great experience with the Lord. You will not regret this app at all.
B000O59AFW|5.0|I now have all the mission impossibles. They are great movies with great storys and beautiful women.Sorry to say very little sex but thats ok. The action is great.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Though I have read many books about World War II, this book shed light on the good people that had to endure much to help others. It helped me have more faith in humanity. It reminded me that there must have been many, many people that did not believe in the Nazi's idiocy.
0545265355|3.0|These books were very good. This would be a five star review, except the way the series ended is lack luster at best. Toward the end of the third book the tone changed and it just felt like the author was rushed to finish the book or didn't know how to end it. The ending was that bad that I'm giving this three stars.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I had trouble and now I can prove any thing my friend's say and I will prove it to them
B006L1TT8G|5.0|Love this cd. It has a great variety of music styles and the girls have great vocals. Very fun to listen to.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Whitney is a legend and it's really nice to have a copy of all her favorite hits in one CD.
0316069884|5.0|This book is the most meaningful book I've ever read. It is so well written, a page turner, and a pleasure to read, while dealing brilliantly with a difficult and important topic.<br />This is the first time I ever write a review- I would like to recommend this book to everyone I know and everyone that I don't know.<br />Read it, you will not regret it!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A very well done story, but more melancholy than sinister. Daniel Craig is quite good- quite angry- then quite sad- all very convincingly.<br />The villain is quite good as well, &#34;Mommy was very, very bad.&#34; I enjoyed Jardin, but his character is not near as sinister as others have been. His villain is almost humorous.<br />&#34;M&#34; plays a huge role in the movie and Dame Dench is certainly equal to the task.<br /><br />I recommend the movie, but for the first time ever- bring a hankie to this James Bond movie.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Excellent movie...great plot, good acting. It will keep you in edge of your seat during the fight scenes. Heart warming ending
0307165485|4.0|This book was purchased as a gift for our grandnephew. My children enjoyed this book 40 years ago and our grandnephew loves it now.
145210655X|5.0|I gave this to all the guys on my list this year.  They all loved it.  It is just plain fun.  Very entertaining.
B001XUPF2O|3.0|The second movie of the new set of Batman flicks (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises), The Dark Knight is not quite as good as the first, but is very cool nonetheless. It does have a few places and subplots that could have been left on the cutting room floor, because it feels extra long and drawn out by the time he catches the Joker.
1271839601|2.0|The quality of this book is not the greatest. They didn't even look to see if all the text of the title fit on the cover. There are several words cut off on the end. The print looks like a bad photocopying job. Some of the letters blend together and make it difficult to read. There are also some large black ink blotches on some of the pages. I would definitely not waste your money on this copy. I'm very unsatisfied in it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm a big reader and I like reading a variety of books.  At first this book dragged and dragged on some more.  I was just about half way and truely wanted to be done with it.  But at halfway there is an interesting twist that made the rest very enjoyable.
0143118706|3.0|good book with interesting information on marraige etc. but not anywhere as inspirational as her eat,pray, love. good book on its own just different,dont expect the same tone in this book.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|Judy Garland at her best with wonderful music. Who can forget ,Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas , And the Boy next door. Everyone did a wonderful job .... Just  A+ all around
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This is the best Deftones album/cd/ recording...whatever! I have been fan since first album but have forgotten about them. After stumbling upon this recording I have listened to it repeatedly nonstop and been quite surprised with its great great sounds.Every song on the CD is great. Not a typical recording that has about 3 good songs, this entire cd is great.  Even purchased ticket to see in concert next  month! Will not disappoint
B00BESNKB8|1.0|I can't believe so many well known artists associated themselves with this film.  What's his face from the Wu-Tang clan must have paid a pretty penny to get this thing out.  It really is a terrible movie.  Sure it has some classic archetypes and a few good moments, but that's it.  It took me a little while to turn the movie off because I was so shocked at how bad it was.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|A well told story about a seemingly impossible project.  Romance and humour carried out in  a very  enjoyable manner.  A must not miss.
B000059GEI|5.0|The very best of MM , I good buy. I love this movie. This Movie all of Berline's best works
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I loved the story and special effects. The tiger was my favorite character; the other were good too. My parents also loved the movie!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I just finished reading the book and took a look at some of the reviews and Im surprised to see a lot of people were dissapointed, although I understand some of the frustration on some minor issues I just dont see how this was 1000 pgs of filler as some put it. Ive even read where some were even bored. I can see that this book was not as action packed as some of the others but to take the journey through all the previous books one has to see that this is an immense world that GRRM has created and yes the actual 'moving forward' of the story line slows down at some points in A Dance with Dragons but so what its all part of the journey.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Compelling story about a guy who decides to go all out natural and leave everything behind in the modern world just for that taste of real nature
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time is involving, romantic and always exciting.  There are so many characters I have a hard time deciding who is my favorite! (But Rumplestiltskin wins every time!)  Truly engaging entertainment!  I can't wait for the next episode.
1419707671|5.0|I purchased this set of books for my Grandson in California for Valentine's Day and he was tickled to receive them.  He loves reading these books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, I will say that after hearing all the media response to this series I was expecing something deeper into the world of bondage than what this book offered.  I actually thought is offered little more than the erotica I normally read.  It was a wonderful love story.  If you've not given in and purchased it you should.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I love this movie because it is funny and<br /> special. I think this movie is perfect for<br /> a nice, joyful family. kids will like it. My<br /> favorite part is when it's Mavis's 118th<br /> birthday.It starts like this, a little vampire<br /> baby girl is born,(thats Mavis)in a small<br /> house. But then Mavis's vampire mom<br />dies, because of humans. Then Mavis's<br /> dad takes Mavis to another house where<br /> Mavis grows up.<br /> Then Mavis's dad builds a hotel. That's why<br /> the movie's name is Hotel Transylvania. My<br /> favorite character  is Mavis.this is a<br /> laugh-out-loud kind of  movie. You should watch Hotel Transylvania some time.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Can't wait for them to finally send the sequel out.  Please let me know when they do because I want it.  Glad a friend turned me on to it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This collection is awesome! Two of the best movies ever made. The third is what it is, not the best but I don't think it is as bad as people say. Blu Ray quality is great for a movie made in the '70's. Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful read.  This is a love story, not a book of porn as many people (mostly men) refer to it.  You will fall in love with Anna and Christian.  It is every bit as good as the media has made it out to be.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading Kitchen House. The characters are developed fabulously and you get pulled into the life of the slaves in the Main House. It kept me coming back for more at every chance I could get.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|How this won an oscar over wreck it ralph is beyond me. Animation wise its alright but the story is stupid. Do not even rent it.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Very comprehensive look at the evolution of the man and his music. well-paced and informative. A great movie for both those looking for an introduction to Marley and reggae music and those that have been long time fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This love story is wonderful.  It is every bit as good as the media has made it sound.  if you've not read the 50 shades trilogy you are missing out.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I LOVE THE WIRELESS CONTROLLER AND COULD HAVE NOT GOTTEN A BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is wonderful and fun app that teaches children to do for what you Wang or beileive in
B007NG93CK|5.0|As usual it is a vey good topic and very well written. I always find it hard to put Kathys' books down.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Still a great show after 4 seasons. Very entertaining! The new group is meshing well with the veterans. I can't wait to see what happens with Blaine and Kurt (but please, prostate cancer? Kurt's dad has been through enough!). Rachel's new beau at NYADA is a tall step up from Finn, and Rachel is having the time of her life (except that dance instructor from h#!!).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like this show and I'm very sad that is going to end... I hope that the comic writer star to get some new ideas about the comic...we want the show come back... excuse my English. ;)
B008133MDK|4.0|We still haven't quite figured out why we like this show so much.<br /><br />Overall, 'Sherlock' is a great detective series, even without the conceit of reinterpreting such a well worn character (the anticipation of seeing the familiar cases adapted to a contemporary context is a bonus; Season 2's 'Baskerville' episode, for example, though a little farfetched, twists the old classic effectively).  But no one individual element really stands out...<br /><br />The writing is good (but not great), the acting is great (though it gets a bit predictable into Season 2), the direction and dialogue can get annoying.  But it's still a REALLY entertaining program, and better than a lot of other broadcast offerings.  The fast pace, plot twists, and fresh take on this favorite character are addictive.  My wife and I regret that there are only six episodes between the two seasons (a new 2013 season's production has been scheduled).<br /><br />Truth be told, we have a good idea why the series is a winner: the casting of the principals is perfect (though Rupert Graves' Lestrade doesn't get much good writing in Season 2).  There are only two real missteps: 1) after the first episode of Season 1, we're never really reminded why Martin Freeman's Watson puts up with Holmes' abuse, and 2) Moriarty is badly cast, badly written, or both; he comes off as a childish, temperamental dandy rather than the criminal reflection of Cumberbatch's Holmes.<br /><br />While some of Holmes' 'deductions' are a little stretched, the concept is a great new twist (Holmes as an emotionally stunted, hyperactive virgin), and the contemporary interpretation is really well executed.  There are other elements that induce eye-rolling--the text overlays that show Holmes' thoughts get aggravating--but are acceptable as a vehicle for illuminating the character's quirks.<br /><br />The first episode of Season 2 is great.  The [re]introduction of the Irene Adler character (as a manipulative dominatrix to the wealthyand powerful) and the final 10 minutes (except for the final, postscript scene) are tightly written, nicely directed, and just plain unsettling.<br /><br />Looking forward to new episodes.  Highly recommended.
B0083Z614S|3.0|The book is an easy read and so innocent with its' main characters! It was good enough to want to finish it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Captiving with twists and turns.  I won't give it away but the author keeps it unpredicable to the point that you won't put it down.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|We wanted to watch something lighthearted, read great reviews, and that's why we decided to watch it. Unfortunately, the characters were never fully developed and the plot was slow.  Very little in the movie to cause even a slight chuckle. Disappointing.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|After several chapters I got tired of John Corey sarcastic humor and wanted to get on with the story.  It was a great story, but a bit too much in-depth repetition and definitely more sarcastic humor than needed.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I have ordered the sequel already which will only be available in March - can hardly wait for it to arrive on my Kindle.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I enjoyed reading but it was not like Grisham's earlier novels.  This one was predictable and kind of preachy with a good and bad comparison of legal practices.
B004L9WGX0|5.0|Excellent quality, packaged well, and arrived very quickly. I've really been enjoying this album. I don't remember seeing it listed in the product description when I ordered it but this came with a code to get a free digital copy of the album. Solid move.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I watched on the plane, am so glad I brought it with me. Absolutely fantastic movie!!! I read the books and found them difficult to read nd very dark as a child. The movie to me was better than the book, it kept true to Tolstoy's work while enhancing the love and characters to a more loving and believable level. Highly recommend!
B0090SI460|5.0|I received this DVD in just a couple days of placing the order! I'm pleased 100% with the speed of delivery and the way the product was sent out by Amazon... I was made aware of every step of the way!
B004L3AR0K|4.0|I'm learning not to depend upon trailers. Nothing about the trailer made me want to see this movie other than I like Anne Hathaway. I was surprised to find more to the story than the two jumping in and out of bed.  While their relationship started out as a &#34;booty call&#34; one, it had to evolve and force each to deal with their own issues. I was surprised by Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. I have only seen him in 2 other movies, but he seems to be a good actor.  Some things may seem predictable, but I still think it's a good movie.
B001AX9DSQ|4.0|Excellent quality, packaged well, and arrived very quickly. I've really been enjoying this album. I only wish it came with a cd/digital version for on the go listening.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Where to begin.<br />Things that are better then this movie. An ice storm, the Dallas Cowboys winning the Super Bowl, Hitler being found alive, \\"Batman & Robin,\\"  a dog licking itself.<br /><br />Clearly Rza (is that short for something?) used this film as a vehicle to showcase his talents as both a director and actor. He may want to find a new career, I hear there's good money being a mime. I've seen better acting at a 3rd grade recital. Rza, it's called emotion and everytime you're on screen you seem to lack that. He does however convey a great sense of being stoned, which is what you might need to be in order to enjoy this film. I'll give him credit, he did get the most out out Batista a former WWE wrestler who's acting lit up the screen like a light bright from 1988. The greatest achiement would be that the makers of this film somehow managed to get Russel Crowe to agreee to do this film. A very FAT Russel Crowe, but the man non-the-less. Hopefully he was paid a heroes ransom to do this piece of steamy, stinky, dirty, and down right aweful piece of cinema waste. The studio who made this should give us our money back. If you want to watch this film may I suggest other ways to pass the time: playing in traffic, doing laundry, wrestling a cobra, sticking your hand down the garbage disposal, or even painting a house are all better ways to pass the time then watching this film. The sad part is that someone green lit this film to be made. Why?
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|This stripped down version of Believe is amazing. You can truly see the talent he has! It's a nice chill relaxing album :) Go get one and you'll believe! lol
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love romantic movies, and this one has many layers and twists to it.  I believe it is worthy of being dubbed a classic.  I could watch it over and over again. Good acting and story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a show stopper. You cannot predict the way things are going to inravel in this book-could not put it down!!!!!!
B009YBU8CQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! The story was brilliantly crafted allowing you to feel the pain and beauty of the familial relationships.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The last book of the MIllennium Trilogy.  Wow!  The writing remained absolutely brilliant and mesmerizing through to the end of this book.<br /><br />These three books were written so well, I'm afraid they've spoiled me.  Are there any more out there that are of this calibre?
B003Y5H574|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first out on DVD. I enjoyed it mainly because it wasn't exactly what I expected.  The trailer didn't do it justice.  It is more than a  funny movie about love.  It's about relationships and how people are interconnected.  All the characters were interesting, including the children. It  makes you laugh, smile, cry, and think.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|While at times the plot strains credulity, by and large it walks that fine line well. I'm a big Bacon fan so that is a big factor for me.
B0046H95RM|5.0|I found this Agatha Christie to be slightly creepy. The suspense went on throughout the entire book. There were no clues as to who it could possibly have been.... Brilliantly crafted.
B0063FQLTK|1.0|The DVD will not boot up at all on my Pioneer BlueRay,even though the small print assures me that \\"Code Regional: Toutes Zones\\" so I guess other buyers got lucky and mine gets returned.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|wonderful, fantastic, great, I just ran out of synonyms and have to keep typing untill i can submit this review.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Yes, if you have been to the circus it can be magical but where does reality end and magic begin?  As you move through the lives of two young lovers is their fate destined through a preplanned agenda or are they really in control? As you sometimes lie awake at midnight worrying about an issue ,do you sometimes wonder why it was so real at 1:00 a.m. but in the light of day  you feel foolish for all your wasted energy.  Erin Morgenstern has used our human fralities to weave this tale of love, mystery,and our abilities to shape our own reality.  It is almost impossible to discern the truth from the imagined as the mysterious circus moves from city to city.  These young lovers struggle to break from their pre -planned fate and take control of their own lives but is this control based on  the reality of 1:00 a.m. or the light of day.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very fun to play. Challenging but not impossible. Funny too. Graphics are really good. Never played the first one but I want too after playing this game. I'm a fan.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I watched Season 3 before ordering Seasons 1 & 2 DVDs.  Wish I had started with the initial episode so I would have had a better understanding of the personalities and situations at DA. Regardless, I enjoyed every moment of DA and can't wait until Season 4 starts.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great backpack for photographers. I am able to store everything plus more! I have a Nikon D5100, 18-55 mm kit lens, 35 mm, and 55-200 mm lens in there and it fits perfect. I have a speedlite and pocket wizards on the way and I know they will fit. Overall, great bag for the price.
1439152802|5.0|I gave Kate Morton's first book four stars, the next one five and now I wish I could give this one six. What an entertaining writer!<br /><br />This is a wonderful tale of a contemporary woman in London trying to uncover the mystery of her dying mother's past. The story takes us back and forth from 2011 to 1941 where two very intriguing young women are living the complicated lives that many people lived while trying to earn a living and do volunteer work to help the war effort all while bombs are dropping. Add in their two love interests and the story goes deeper.  Add in damaged psyches and an evil plot and it goes deeper still.<br /><br />I was constantly surprised by the intricate, yet completely believable, plot and the faster I turned the pages the more twists and turns I ran into until I felt like I was going to fly off the road. Great read!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I think that this book is amazing!If I could change any thing I would have made it more specific so a reader can understand it more. But other than that it was not bad.
B003C1SPX8|4.0|This is a fantastic concert. I had no idea Mark Knopfler was such an amazing guitarist. This concert exceeded my expectations. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because of the quality of the video, and that is only because it's so old. No ones fault really. I you like Dire Straits, this is a must have DVD!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My wife and I watched this after catching up on the other Marvel movies leading up to it. Great movie, HIGHLY recommend it!
B0098VXE50|5.0|I didn't think I would like this version of the snow white nursery rhyme, but I did..definately another movie I will watch over and over..
B002RSDW80|4.0|As a crusty old bachelor and terrible cook who desperately wants learn to make hard-boiled eggs correctly, and one who always passes by &#34;chick-flicks,&#34; even if they do feature Eastwood, Wayne or Willis, I had grown up while watching that odd cooking lady, Julia Child, with my grandmother. So, as both a wanna-be cook and childhood admirer of Child, I was merely curious about how Streep would portray Julia . . . and was very pleasantly surprised, all around.  Not only does Streep do an outstanding job as the grand old dame, but the entire film turns out to be something even us Red River/Fort Apache addicts enjoyed.  It is both a dual documentary and pleasing love story even I could follow without dozing or wandering off . . . it wasn't some gooey, girly, kissy-face slop . . . it was . . . enjoyable!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Impressive and really enjoyed it. Good movie and recommend to anyone... Wow, do I need to type more - seriously, just watch it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was one of the best novels yet.  Keep them coming.  Not until almost the end did I realize the ending of the story.  Thanks again for another great read.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I've enjoyed all the Bond movies, they excite the imagination, have great action, and not insulting to this female viewer..this movie does not quite measure up to the above your imagination action of its other episodes
B000054OTY|4.0|I last saw this film when it was first out in theaters . . . I enjoyed it then and am very pleased I've included this Marlon Brando western as part of my collection.  Other Brando westerns on my list are Appaloosa and a somewhat disturbing Missouri Breaks.  Even if you're not a great Brando fan, his western endeavors are worth the price.
B009WHLR9K|4.0|What a great choice of &#34;voice&#34; for presenting the life and game of a superb, still --young tennis player.  The chapters switch from Nadal's voice, or narrative, to the co-author's, back to Nadal's, back to co-author's.  Difficult to pull off, but these two have done it!  A reader gets both the perspective, perceptions, and personality (as well as game analysis) of Rafael Nadal, who, it turns out, is articulate and thoughtful about himself and about tennis, and the factual, chronological, and objective narrative of the 'outside' sports writer.  One comes away with a better understanding of match play, the game that is professional tennis, the balance between talent and commitment, and what goes on inside the mind of a top player who really thinks about the levels of the game. Not a star-studded, story of pain, glory, failed relationships, and overcoming depression and substance-abuse, a la Agassiz's also great recent autobiography, this one in a strange way, though less personal (or about a life less noisy), gives you more of the game itself, but still in a compelling and often spellbinding story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was quite the page turner. I read it in two days. I loved it and I suggest this book to everyone. Can't wait to see the movie!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|so glad I have the complete set, awsome to view the whole story at one time..highly recommend it for all adult movie lovers
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I loved this show when I watched it in the '90's, and now seeing it again is reminding me of how good it was. It's my favorite ST spin-off. I only wish the DVDs were not so expensive, or at least re-mastered so the quality would be better. That would justify the high price. Guess I'll just have to be satisfied with streaming.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|LITTLE AND HANDY. WILL BUT A GOOD EDGE ON A KNIFE BIG OR SMALL IN A BIND ON IN THE FIELD!!! WOULD RECOMMEND AND BUY AGAIN.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This was my first book bought through the kindle store, and I loved all the additional content you get when you use the x-ray and other features. Now regarding the story, I love when a writer takes the time to tell a good story without the need to rush things. By reading this book, I got a similar sensation like when I was watching The Hobbit movie, where I enjoyed every detail and didn't matter if the movie was too long or not. Here is the same thing, if you're expecting solutions and closing to some plots, you will not find that in this book; on the opposite you will find new twists, and more grays than blacks and whites.<br /><br />My advice: sit back and enjoy the ride, and don't care yet about how it's going to end. Savour every detail,and let Martin do his job while he's on the driving seat. So far, it's worth it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|what action, and beyond imagination story..great actors, super story line..and I will watch this one over and over too..even my grqand children like this one...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is a lot like temple run but a cool variation. i like this game very much and i recomend it to all gamers
B003A9SYTW|5.0|I love the whole album but the first track is my favorite.  It is very raw and bluesy.  If you like recent blues rock like the Black Keys you might also like it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful, I am enjoying this season as much as Season 1, which I watched last week.  This is a got to watch show!
B005LAII0S|5.0|a great movie, actors are fantastic, not to close to the snow white nursery rhyme.. his is definatly one of my colection of movies that I will watch asgain and again...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It jumps across families and countries so quickly, you never get bored. Some of the parts were extremely cliched and cheesy. Apart from that, the other stories are very authentic, and gives you a good image of that time.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book, I wonder if it is going to be set in the Cold War.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|Great Album!  I love the tone.  Love the voice.  It really gets an emotional reaction out of me as does Editors &#34;An End has a Start&#34; but completely different sound.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I like this drama very much. The plots keeps coming. You will concern each character fate. I am glad the drama is not near over. I cannot wait to see what happen next.
B008JFUTT0|4.0|Its a very good story and told well, but too many questions remain. For example, why does this lifelong laborer seem so frail? Why always the dark glasses a la Jose Feliciano? Why is his Australian stint given no mention?<br />Aside from that,  this is a truly remarkable artist. Good music gets by the masses all the time so its not all that unbelievable  he didnt make it here. People are catching on now and Rodriguez is alive to see it. Not a bad song here.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This is a great movie.  The story line is great.  This is a must see for all ages.  Even my husband liked it.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|Great Album!  I love this band.  A New favorite.  If you like Bruce Springstein, Tom Petty, and appreciate Punk but don't love Punk you will love this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|And not devour the whole series in one sitting!  I didn't think I'd like this, but fell prey to peer pressure and am so delighted.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|The item came on time and came as described. Very satisfied. DVD package was sealed, brand new and no scratches.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Well My girlfriend loves angry birds and this game was a way to make her favorite characters come to life.<br /><br />The game it self takes a while to understand but is fun.
B008KTA64S|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands now.  If you like Tom Petty, Bruce Springstein, and have an appreciation for Punk but like it lighter than punk then this is your band.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I like it for use in spread sheets for my Excel spread sheets.  It would be a little easier to use with a small demo preceding at the beginning of the programs.  It is easy to work with. Perhaps a troubleshooting section could be incorporated.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|This is perhaps my greatest 3d purchase-fail ever. Top gun is one of my favorite movies of all time but this 3d is terrible. There is grain all over the screen and as far as the 3d goes , it's more like 2d than 3d. I'm not going to add anymore to this review. The aforementioned statement sums it up.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|If you open a picture...there is no button to go back to news feed...have to push the kindle arrow button MANY times. News feed does not show all the post and notifications aren't updating properly.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|This movie was fun for me to watch. Especially back in the day if you were a comic book fan. I would recommend this movie to those who are Comic Book buffs or just plain want to be well entertained. Liked it.
0679805273|5.0|My boys love this book!  They insist they can't move mountains though...  The also love the Spanish version as well... Beautiful translation!
