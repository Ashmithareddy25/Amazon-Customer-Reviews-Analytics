B006R1T40I|5.0|Thank God for artists like Bonnie Raitt. This great American blues singer songwriter who can turn her hand to just about any musical genre has been treading the musical boards for probably more years then she cares to remember. Like vintage wine she improves with age and on \\"Slipstream\\", her first solo album since Souls Alike in 2005, Raitt has turned out her best album in ages. Her recent past has been troubled not least the sad loss of most of her close family and her best friend. This mordant sadness does infuse some of the tracks here particularly the gorgeous piano lament \\"God only knows\\" (not a Beach Boys cover) which is heartbreaking in its simplicity and honesty. Seek it out and try not to thank your reviewer since it will be one of those those tracks that will accompany you to the end of your days. On the opposite end of the scale the wonderfully funky blues opener \\"Used to rule the world\\" is one of those songs which would have the American music industry frothing at the mouth were it to be performed by great new blues/gospel bands such as the Alabama Shakes (look out for their new album in the next couple of weeks). Raitt's singing here is effortless and as ever her bottleneck guitar playing must have old Lowell George beaming down from the heavens.<br /><br />Raitt has been no stranger over the years to the work of Robert Zimmerman and two of \\"His Bobness's\\" from the brilliant \\"Time out of mind\\" are included her for your listening pleasure. The take on \\"Standing in the doorway\\" in particular deserves to be recognised as one of the great Dylan covers with the quiet restraint of Raitt's emotional vocal bringing a new dimension to the song and when she sings of the \\"blues wrapped around my head' you know she means it. Her blues version of \\"Million Miles\\" whilst perhaps lacking the raw rasp of Dylan's original is well executed and ticks along beautifully, not least since it is infused with a belter of a guitar solo. The reggae cover of Gerry Rafferty's soft rock standard \\"Right down the line\\" could have been a misstep but Raitt is a class act and she handles it with a care and sure-footedness which deserves a very large tick in the box. It is the ballads on the album however which impress most and alongside the already mentioned \\"God only knows\\" her take on Loudon Wainwrights III \\"You can't fail me now\\" will not leave a dry eye in the house, ditto the achingly beautiful \\"Not cause I wanted to\\" . Finally a mention should go to the soft rock ballad \\"Take my love with you\\". Some may complain that it is all a bit safe and secure but frankly who cares about such churlish carping. Raitt is a master musician who has perhaps never quite got the kudos and success in the UK that her music deserves and in \\"Slipstream\\" she demonstrates once more the consumate songwriting skills which made her watershed album 1990's \\"Nick of time\\" such a huge hit in the US. So there you have it possibly the the best investment of 57 minutes and 54 seconds that you will expend in a very long time.ock standard \\"Right down the line\\" could have been a misstep but Raitt is a class act and she handles it with a care and sure-footedness which deserves a very large tick in the box.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|very entertaining an simple. you will be entertainded for months!! hardly put it down. I really enjoy the layout how you must play games to unlock new ones.
B000001EUR|5.0|Excellent drive, good performance, good product, good seller. Scorpions are one of the best classic heavy metal bands, this disc is escencial for a true fan of this band, I recommend to all who enjoy this artist and who also want to know a perfect traditional metal band 80 years with several excellent albums.<br /> Congratulations Scorpions.
B0055SWM08|2.0|It is the daily free app but it is not the full app. What a bunch of malarky. It was already free.
B003UDP99G|5.0|So I hear so much complaining about the packaging and blah blah blah! No one talks about the sound! This import is so worth it. I love the packaging cause I take care of my stuff, not like some heathen. The sound on these things are unreal, I mean you can hear the instruments separately. You can hear the actual picking on the strings. Best of all you can hear Cliff Burton's bass lines. Buy this if you love Metallica and great music.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really fun! Reminds me of old school Mario. Easy lots of fun and addicting. Really fun app and its free!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a fun game! I have played it on facebook &amp; back in the day on the computer--just like I remember it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|free apps almost always have some major flaw. this game is super fun with no major issues ive noticed.  app truly deserves all the 5star ratings it has.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its lots of fun. always something to do and its extremly exciting. very very good! keep comin back for more.<br />i love it!
B001PA0FF4|2.0|After all the praise this movie received I was surprised how much I disliked it. If you havent seen it, let me save you some time. (Spoiler alert)<br /><br />Nun: \\"I think you touched a boy\\"<br />Priest: \\"I didnt touch a boy\\"<br />Nun: \\"I still think you touched a boy\\"<br />Priest: \\"I'm leaving this church\\"<br />Nun: \\"I'm not sure he touched a boy, boo hoo hoo...\\"<br /><br />The End.<br /><br />I've read the other reviews about how you need to re-watch it to see all of the subtle hints about whats REALLY going on(like the ballpoint pin on the floor?), but I paid attention during the movie and it all just seems to be lame attempts by the director to create an ominous mood; high winds, a storm, open windows, light bulbs going out, etc. Maybe I missed something, but I really did not like this movie. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is not about the destination and all about the journey.  Amazing how the author was able to make this book so interesting by only using black and white.  Really enjoyed it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Game can be challenging for those who want to tackle all of the levels without using the in game hints while at the same time allowing those who get stuck on a level the ability to make it easy. Therefore the game is really fun for any time of phone gamer. Also the music is quite amazing as well. The composer of the music has also made it available to all of us at no cost. Check out his other stuff as well because he did us a solid.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is app is awesome because I can have the noble anywhere. I just wish that you could download Niv84. oh well lots of places have wifi anyways
B001AW156U|5.0|These dual triggers are very good for racing-type games, like GT5. But they aren't the best for FPS games since it actually slows down fire-rate (how fast I can press the button).  At first they are very awkward to use since it makes the controller bulky, but its you get used to it.  It is easy to clip-on and clip-off.  It is made pretty durable and snug, so it doesn't snap off when dropped on carpet (and similar materials).
B00340ESIS|5.0|On the one hand, I thought this was one of the most brilliant books I've read for writers of all types. It explained exactly what I've been struggling to achieve in some of my manuscripts. On the other--I feel like not only have I now seen the man behind the curtain but the curtain no longer exists. It's hard to watch a film without analyzing since I read this book. I can't just enjoy it for entertainment's sake. No! While watching a movie, I actually said in my mind, \\"Oh, we've reached the fun and games part! Hijinks ensue!\\" DOH! This is the answer key--to everything--to every good story ever told.<br /><br />It'll make you a better writer for certain, but it very well ruin watching movies--especially those with poorly done scripts. Consider yourself warned.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It brings back my school days. This is one of favorite games on my kindle fire. It stays in my carousal.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|:D an amazing game.. an Irish version of Super Mario.. its very fun and addictive. best app ive found so far..
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun puzzle game with a smooth finish. Would highly recommend to both kids and adults alike! Awesome free app, Amazon!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Una serie magistral, con interpretaciones magistrales, ambientación magistral, adaptación del primer libro magistral, no tiene una sola pega. No he visto la versión en \\"castellano\\" sino la original en inglés.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|It is so hard to believe this collection of standards and torch songs is being sung - interpreted - by someone who was only 19 years old when she recorded them. Olstead has the vocal chops of a woman who has been doing this kinda stuff all her life. And in fact, that might be a pretty true assessment, since she's been making records since she was only 12 or so. But this disc, SKYLARK, is simply the best. The title tune rendition is equal to what some of the really great female singers have done, and I'm talking greats like Billy Holiday and Rosemary Clooney. And there's a new facet to this CD too. Olstead has co-written a few of the tracks, and one of them, \\"Hold Me Now,\\" is simply stunningly, heartbreakingly beautiful! I kept playing this one over and over. Simply put, there's not a single musical misstep in sight here. Producer Foster and his young protege, Renee Olstead, are a great team. I hope this young woman continues to make music. She is GOOD!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game. My only gripe is that it keeps the screen awake. I want my phone to sleep if idle.
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I've never had the chance to see POTO live on stage, and until now my only exposure to the show was random Youtube clips, and also the 2004 Hollywood version (which was...disappointing, to say the least). If you can't make it to the live show, get this version. Ramin Karimloo's performance alone is worth the price-- he blows me away! The rest of the cast is good as well, particularly Sierra Boggess, whom I think is even better than Sarah Brightman.<br /><br />The staging isn't perfect, but at least it IS staged. I'm not too sure how I feel about the screens in the background-- I don't think that was an ideal choice --but most of the time I didn't notice them because I was too wrapped up in the music.<br /><br />Also, I'm a big Les Mis fan, so seeing Colm Wilkinson, John Owen-Jones, and Anthony Warlow during the encore was a really great moment.
0345803485|5.0|I've never really been into \\"erotica\\" books but the way this one was written with an actual story line- I was hooked.  I read this one, and had to read the others.  I think its pretty well written, although the \\"my inner goddess\\" does become a bit redundant.  Despite that, its still a good, guilty-pleasure read!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Im not really crazy about puzzle games but this one really raised the bar! Love the actiony theme and im hoping for the Quell Reflect to be the free app of the day!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very addicting. try it! you'll want to play all night. I did and I love this game for it is superb.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this for free for the app of the day and I'm now addicted to it. I will finish all the levels probably pretty quickly.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This a great game. Sometimes the levels are hard but I guess that's what makes it fun. I usually have a hard toke putting it down. A good excuse I use when I get yelled at is: But I'm using my brain? Isn't that good? Have fun with it and don't give up just cause you think it's. &quot;oh-so hard&quot;!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME. It kEEPS YOU THINKING THE WHOLE TIME._IT IS  VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND A WHOLE LOT OF FUN TOO.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very addicting I cant stop playing it..wish we got more energy...other than that its very fun and it reminds me of the original Oregon trail
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have seen, used and studied several Bible.apps. This one is by far the best I have seen.<br />I especially like the variety of translations available.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very well done and fun app. Clever puzzles and a clean interface. Good music as well. Definitely try this one.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I enjoyed this game, it was definitely worth the price. I did get stuck a couple of times, probably because I wasn't paying attention, or because I came back to it after several days. Thanks for those hints! Don't assume you should be able to do much at first, just wander and observe.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|is fun for the grandkids when they come to visit... gives them something to do when we run out of baking cookies.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun. i like the old western front that you get to create your own little town on.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Good puzzle game.  Easy to pull out when you only have five minutes to kill and knock out a few levels.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the Oregon trail :) it reminds me of the original but it kind of blows that you don't make in game cash
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like it is anfun game to play on. you can go up to high levels. it is a FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0316789720|5.0|When my 6-year-old grandson who loves to draw was visiting recently, I asked him if he'd like to see the drawing book his dad used when he was little. He spent the next hour or so covering blank papers with his Ed Emberly masterpieces. I asked him if he'd like a book of his own, and we got on line to order it. \\"It'll come to your house in 2 days,\\" I told him. He's spent many happy hours with it since its arrival. It's a great book for little artists because it helps them see how things are put together so they can draw anything on their own.
0307266303|5.0|Bought this book for a runner friend for Christmas.  I starting reading a few pages before I wrapped it and ended up buying the e-version for myself.  Its a remarkable story with characters you get attached to, great information and facts that my analytical mind loves. I am not an avid reader and usually read non-fiction informative books when I do read but this is a great combination of feeling like you are reading a great story and also learning something. It had been several years since I had been a good runner and really ran more than a couple miles.  This book really rekindled my love for running and made me remember how much love I had for it, and the improvements it made in my life.  I had forgotten how I feel.  I'm back to running now and training for greater distances.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game rocks trust me I love it I love to cook at home and any chance I get so this is the next best this.  love get it its worth it
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is outrageously talented.  ADELE 21 has all of her current well known hit songs that are great.  The other, more unknown songs, are also great.  Not to be missed.
1933633867|5.0|It's a large heavy book, prepare to be daunted, but then, one commences to read and is amazed, can't put it down but must to rest arms. Scholarly books are rarely elegant (nice way of saying barely readable) and vice-versa; moral books are rarely coherent and vice-versa. This book is scholarly, elegant, and moral. One reads so many books to find the few that must be read cover to cover.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome and addicting I loved it and I can't get it out of my head :) great game it was quick to load and there are a bunch of different levels
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very relaxing yet challenging game. I love the graphics and surprisingly I like the music and I'm one who is always annoyed by game music and turn it off.  Thank you for making this free today in the app store.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've been enjoying this game.  The graghics are beautiful, the music is relaxing, and there have been no glitches on my Fire. Just my speed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I can not stop playing it. It is a blast! it is a keeper. I would recommend it to friends.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i really enjoy the game. no ads. just plain and simple gaming that is calming and challenging at the same time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|addicting. games can never hold my attention but I love this one!  reminds me of playing Mario back in the day.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game works great on my Droid 2. If you like puzzle games, you'll love this. The music is calming and the game is simple yet challenging. The graphics are stunning and it runs smoothly on my phone. I highly recommend this game to those that like puzzle games. It's great.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Thank you Amazon for promoting a quality app! I found this very refreshing, creative, fun and stable. I'll have check out Fallen Tree's other apps now.
B0072GPPNC|2.0|I bought this movie because several people I know said it was a very good movie.  I was not impressed with it. In my opinion, this is a movie to be rented, not purchased.  Secondly, it took several days before amazon shipped my order out (it seems they only ship things out quickly during the Christmas holiday season).
B006IGZX0C|5.0|This is the BEST drama I've seen in a long time. Seriousness. Laughter. Tears. It truly deserves all the buzz! Great acting performances.
B006E2W24U|5.0|Note: I saw the PG-13 version with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This latest film from the writers of Takenand the writer of The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II and The Karate Kid Part III is one slam-bang action thriller that never lets up for a moment. Zoe Saldana (Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl) stars as Cataleya, a young woman hell-bent on avenging the murder of her parents 15 years earlier. From ominious beginning to the heart-pounding finale, the suspense never lets up. Ms. Saldana is an excellent actress, apart from being incredibly sexy and you know this is one woman you don't ever want to cross. There is some infrequent moderate cursing, and only late in the movie, two strong profanities (for me, the last strong one is unfortunate, as God's name is paired with a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity). Aside from the strong profanity I just detailed, I really enjoyed the movie, and recommend it. More plot and character development would have been nice, too.<br /><br />I read that there are III versions of the movie. Which one is longer, and is the International Unrated Cut available in the U.S.?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read a review about 50 Shades on a website but it was no where detailed enough to prepare me for this book. It seemed interesting enough so I downloaded the sample and about 4 days later I finished the last book. I thought it was great! Slow start but once it got going, I found it very hard to put down. I've suggested it to most of the women I know & those who have read it, love it too!!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|As a fan of the Terminator series, I found this release to be exceedingly full of special features and materials that made the viewing experience the best so far for T2.  I loved the high definition transfer, the clarity really holds up well even the special effects while dated by today's standards held up well especially in high definition.  The biggest reason I picked this up was due to the pricing, for a blu-ray with all of these features and at a low price, especially for a movie I'd consider to be a classic, it's hard to resist.  One note to warn some people, older blu-ray players without much internal memory may prevent you from loading all of the features, and some features do require internet connection, but there is enough content on the blu-ray that you won't feel as though you are missing too much.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* High Definition<br />* Low Price<br />* Great features, behind-the-scenes, and very well done menus with great animation<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Some content requires internet connection and/or internal memory on your blu-ray player.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After resisting The Hunger Game phenomenon for some time - I gave in and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought they were great books and they appeal to more than the young adult reader.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really enjoying this game. I usually get bored of apps quickly but I keep coming back to this one. Got it free but I would pay for it!
B003NX75B8|5.0|A friend of mine that is a high school English teacher recommended this book to me and I'm glad she did. It is an easy read and relates to today's youth without being cheesy or boring.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The most beautiful game I have ever played. Challenging without frustration. So happy I got it as a FAOTD, but would willingly pay more than they are asking for it if I had to.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not usually a huge fan of Stephen King but a friend suggested this book and it was really very good. Its a long book but it reads pretty fast and can keep your attention.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game really caught my attention and helps if I'm bored. A concern is that it takes 3 minutes to load energy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best books ever!! I could not put the books down and I think I may read them all again.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|if i could give this game zero stars i would it sucks it haz hints but not really good ones do not spend your hard earned money on this crappy game youll be making  a HUGE mistake
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app its pretty addicting and is very fun with the squirrel trying to get nuts!! Get this app its very worth 99 cents.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Incredible. Spectacular.  This game seriously blew my mind. I was hooked from the start. Before I got this game I looked at it and hesitated. Should I get this? Do not be fooled by anything. This game is definitely worth the price, if not more. I recommend this to anyone, and give this game five full stars!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just wish I could download the whole thing to my kindle when wifi isn't available. It is fast and doesn't crash.
B00785P2QC|4.0|awesome and addictive for sure. wont put it down at alll. I love it so much. you should get it immediately<br />very fun!!
030788743X|5.0|I was pleasantly (very) surprised by this read.  Took me back to my own childhood in the 80s and my love for computers (the TRS-80 Color Computer II... sweet), arcade games and role-playing games.  What books are supposed to be -- fun!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just got this game and it is great but you can buy stuff to make it easier and that's a rip off but its still a good game
B007BLCGNU|1.0|There wasn't much of anything interesting or exciting in this movie. Quite boring, so save your money for something better.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|if your looking for ok graphics and a way to kill time then this Irish Mario is for you. kids love it controls arnt to bad and it don't cost you money.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Rocky was my favorite movie of all time. This will probably go down as my second. Wonderfully inspiring cast of 2 fighters with 2 drastically different motives defying the odds in a tournament against some of the toughest UFC fighters in the world. The movie beautifully weaves its way to an ending scene that while expected, still delivers an emotionally charged finish.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|works great.  Fun time building own settlement.  Lots of options for those who don't want to spend real money.  But having to wait for the character to regain energy to move on can be irksome.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Yes. I like it. Nice graphics. Nice music. Challenging puzzles that you work at your own pace. Relaxing and engaging. Good job.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|...beds more lvls... can't wait... gravity physics are quite nice... you know, for a portable game... I like the new skins for the birds... kinda looks like the Xmen... in space
B00785P2QC|4.0|It something I can sit and do while relaxing even with the kids running around and screaming at the top of their lungs. I enjoy it very much.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The animations are beautiful and the music adds a special something. Its not the most innovative game you'll play but you'll have a blast until you beat it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is awesome it is just like Mario fun and clasic just like me from Scott see ya later yall
B007Q476KU|1.0|I could not finish this movie.  I knew going in that it was long at two and a half hours, but I got 30 minutes in and nothing had really happened.  Cut about 45 minutes out of this and speed it up and bit and it might have been decent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Omnibus collects the five 'Wool' stories into one great book. The book is a dystopia, science fiction, thriller. It succeeds as all three. The story is compelling. The characters are interesting, even the minor characters. The strength of the book are its characters, there are science fiction elements to the story but they simply provide a backdrop to the people populating this tightly knit world.<br />The book was hard to put down, and very easy to pick up again. Odd title, it either refers to the wood pads that are used to clean the sensors, or the wool pulled over everyone's eyes.<br />I highly recommend this book to fans of thrillers and the golden age of Science Fiction. This book was self-published by Howey. It bodes well for the future of e-publishing and we may be witnessing a new golden age of Science Fiction.
B0052U59F4|3.0|Well there is a lot of intimacy going on this book and some pages the author just repeats every so often.<br />The book is overall very good but mostly adult female pornography in my opinion. If you like that kind of stuff, this book is for you.
B006X9EUUS|4.0|Sinead has definitely had her ups and downs over the course of her long career, but this new album is definitely one of the ups.  She lets loose and in the process creates some stunningly beautiful songs.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|very well written book. sad story but a somewhat positive ending. The book is depressing at the end though. The first book the series was the best. I could not put the book down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is pne of my favorite games even my nies is like &quot; auntie auntie let me play oregon settler please.&quot;
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I love this album. The best of 2012 by far. The vocal arrangements are spot on, some of the best vocals on an album. The music is impeccable. The writing and arranging is amazing. I like how it is a fusion of all there different influence, and the differences in each song. There is not a weak track on the album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is awesome its like Mario brothers cool to play and entertain your self my God daughter loves to play it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great fun for all simple old time tradition everyone should get this game.  try it you will be very pleased
B00753MBHA|5.0|I Feel It's Just more Diverse In Both Song And Music. Each Song Is it's Very Own Powerhouse Of Metal.Which Means, It's All Aces From The Beginning To The End. This Record Has To Be One The Top 5 Metal Records Of The Year. Learn To ACCEPT You'll Be Glad You Did.
1451627289|1.0|The last Stephen King book that I will waste time reading. Cheesy,redundant to the point of mind numbness,written in a style for the 1970's.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Anytime I go visit another town the game does a forced close, very annoying when you're trying to complete tasks....it also takes FOREVER to get energy and you use it up so quickly!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was a great book! I read it in no time at all and immediately bought the two following books!
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game for creative thinkers. music is soothing and complimentary to the game. I would recommend to crossword or soduku players
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|takes me back to the original Oregon trail  this game has good graphics and a few surprises. my only problem with all these games is that your success is dependent on making friends with strangers and paying real money in order to get the &quot;bonus&quot;  cash/stars/ whatever.  fun free game
B0055SWM08|4.0|enjoying this game. loving the hints. very very good. lets u know when u made a wrong move also. I would give five but I don't do perfect
B002D0L0R2|5.0|This is a really great movie as well as laugh out loud funny, and John Travolta at his best. A must have for Musical lovers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|keeps me entertained while at the bus stop. i like the music, it is very peaceful. definitely worth the price.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This is  excellent dvd of the concert. Almost as good as watching it in person except you can watch it as much as you want. A very great buy. A must have for any Celtic Woman fan.
B0055SWM08|5.0|While the music for this app is soothing to the ear, the puzzles are challenging. It's a great way to pass the time. Awesome app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is so much fun! I love it a lot! Its a game you can get addicted to real quick. I love these kind of games!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good fun for a few hours. Kept me busy when i was bored at work or in class. I'd recommend.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|simply could not put this down. not only was it surprisingly hot, it had a very interestimg storyline. the only part that got old was james' Â«inner godessÂ» was way too over used amd i foumd myself rollimg my eyes at each mention by the third book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a great game it has everything you could want from an Android game but like it got asked on several reviews please remove the like us rate us you have 2272 as from now and after free app of the day you will get even more so I think that you don't need to promote your game annoying the one that got it
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|or at least i have and i can count on one hamd the books i reread. tina fey is brilliant!
B004J88SGC|5.0|Great DVD, great show, its fantastic.  I'm watching it again and again.  The atmosphere of this show is amazing. I recommend it for lovers of good music.
B000JQU4TW|1.0|I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it had<br />escaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to do<br />with their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,<br />is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.<br />The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.<br />Dorian is very pretty..<br />Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and pretty<br />and men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.<br />Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.<br />We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.<br />What happened in that time span is not told.<br />Dorian is pretty.<br /><br />There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.<br />Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of the<br />third main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.<br /><br />*****************<br />  Spoiler Alert<br />*****************<br />I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting instead<br />of stabbing it.<br />*****************<br />End Spoiler Alert<br />*****************<br /><br />I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guess<br />it would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.<br /><br />So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could save<br />this travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.<br /><br />I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book. However, if a tree was cut for your book rest assured, the tree would be happy because Dorian is very pretty!etty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.<br /><br />So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could save<br />this travesty of words.

B0055SWM08|5.0|so glad this is free so I can have it on my kindle. I beat it on my phone a few weeks ago, replay value is huge
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|you run out of energy then they try to make you pay for it I'm not spending up to $20 in a week for one game. but its kinda fun I guess!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a very fun game but hate waiting for energy &deg;_&deg; but all in all its a really good way to pass time whenever your bored.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book was an utter disappointment!!!!  It seems the author got tired and just stopped using her imagination!  We follow the plight of Gail all through the trilogy and form an emotional bond with him only to have him land in a foreign district with a really good job - gone without saying goodbye. Everyone who was anyone in the book ends up gone from her life without any fanfare!  I wish I had saved both my time and money with this book!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a challenging and entertaining puzzle game! Its a lot like the cave puzzles in the pokemon games so I picked it up pretty quick.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy puzzle games, and this is a good one. I have not had any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned.  The game lives up to its press.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a good one if you want the iphone inside feel to be visbile. The quality of the case is very good and it comes with a great value.<br /><br />Need to get this one for sure. It is as good as the apple iphone bumper.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I have the paid version o. my iphone- no ads. I hate playing on my Kindle Fire because there is NO option to pay to make the ads go away. I hate almost all &quot;free&quot; software for the same reason. where is the pay option? 1 star reviews until I'm offered a paid version for kf/android.
B007HJ84WS|3.0|The movie did not follow any recognized mythology, instead it delved into pure Hollywood creativity. It could have been a winner, instead it is relegated to the dustbin of Hollywood flops. The scenery was great, the storyline was abysmal. The acting talent was wasted on a lousy scrip. Too bad, better luck next time.
B002E2M5J6|3.0|l like jamiroquai, but the in my sony hometheater system 5.1, it doesn´t work ok, the show is great, but the sound is just ok.l have another blu ray like u2 or steve wonder that sound is much better. why is it happen, anybody knows?
B0052UZIFA|4.0|UPDATE: I previously rated this app at 1 star (zero if I could) because of lockups made the game pretty much unusable, but they issued a fix and now it works great!<br />A very fun game. I have gone through the campaign several times and it is still fun and challenging each time.<br />Only detractor now for this game is it doesn't have all of the secondary stuff like the zombie garden like the game does on the PC or IOS, but still a recommended buy.
0345803485|2.0|This book was suggested to me by a few people and I read about the growing buzz.  Picked one up over the weekend and was looking forward to a good read.  Big disappointment.  No plot, no character development, just yuck.  I can't for the life of me figure out what woman would really want a man like the character in this book: cold, controlling, and unavailable.  This is a misogynistic anti-romance.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i expected a crappy game... was i wrong. very simple yet addictive game, very impressed with this game. if i knew it was this good i wouldve paid
B0058WFO06|5.0|Okay...this is a really great one, from the compositions, to the high fidelity recording, to the musicians -- all are first rate.  Fantastic release for die-hard fans of high quality INTENSE compositions that blend a myriad of styles and instrumentation that will keep you entertained and wanting for more.  I pre-ordered the blue book limited edition and have been spinning both discs for months. After many listens I am finding that I like the material more and more, and gasp, as much (or more in some cases) than Porcupine Tree, though the material here is really nothing like PT. And its really nothing like SW's Insurgentes, his first solo release(also highly recommended).<br /><br />Kudos to Steven and the tremendous lineup of musicians who made this eclectic release come alive.  Its got quiet sections with a classical bent(Belle de jour), powerful building songs like Sectarian, beautiful harmony vocals in several parts, eclectic jazz sections, loud rock guitars, and sections reminiscent of Pink Floyd and King Crimson. It all flows nicely from one tune to the next.  The music is intense throughout and is VERY unique -- make no mistake, this is one of the best CDs I have heard in decades.  The instrumentation includes guitars, piano, flute, sax, stick, clarinet, flute, a choir, among others, and features beautiful keys by Jordan Rudess.<br /><br />I saw the final show of the GFD tour in Chicago (fall 2011 / Park West) and the show was fantastic (oh, and Marco on drums was unbelievable). Catch the 2nd leg if you can!<br /><br />And a shout out to Steven.  I met you at NAMM Jan 2012 as you were departing the D'Addario booth.  Thanks very much for taking a moment of your time to stop for a photo -- I greatly appreciated it!
B00753MBHA|4.0|Being an avid Accept fan since the mid-eighties, I was pleased that they came out with another chapter.  I enjoyed Blood Of The Nations a couple years ago with their new singer, but this one is even better!  My particular favorites are \\"Against The World\\" and \\"Twist Of Fate\\", but their years of musicianship and production standards show on every track here.  It's not a top-100 of all time, but it's nothing short of impressive to any Accept fan!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best Klondyke Solitaire for KindleFire that I've found-  pleasing graphics &amp; great card movement. It ROCKS :-)<br />I would be willing to purchase an ad free app.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I love this app .. no more working out with a DVD! This app is great way to start your day with exercise. It's up to date and the graphics are great. This is one app you want to keep on your device.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I usually stay away from playing games that take too much concentration but I am so happy that I gave this one a try....it is the most relaxing mind game I have ever played!!!! U won't be sorry to have this game to waste extra time or to just play!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I just can't stop playing this! It is very addictive! The puzzles are hard enough to be interesting but easy enough to be relaxing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a lot of fun. I get frustrated because some of he games are really hard and seem impossible butbafter awhile I get them. I recamend this app if you like to play a variety of games.
0553801473|3.0|*This review contains mild spoilers*<br /><br />I started reading this book right after its release and was extremely excited. I expected it to address some of the shortcomings of AFFC and make me fall in love with ASOIAF again. Sadly I couldn't have been more wrong: I made it up until the middle, but had to lay it down, because I just couldn't take the meandering anymore. I think it was during one of the Meeren chapters with an angsty Dany, when my spirit was broken and I gave up on the story. At this point I knew that my expectations were crushed.<br /><br />It took me 3/4 of a year to start again with severely lowered expectations, which allowed me to appreciate the detail while not expecting anything to happen story-wise.<br /><br />Now, to be honest: I'm happy that I picked it up again (there are *some* interesting plotlines) and I'm going to read any other books in the series after this one, but ADWD is still a huge disappointment. There are no resolutions to anything and very, very few notable events happen. Doesn't GRRM have Editors? Were they in a coma? Apparently chapters with resolutions in them got pushed into the next book? Is this some sick joke?<br /><br />I'm certain that the book could have been cut by 50% without losing anything significant. The Quentyn chapters were entirely pointless and so were most of Tyrions. Vicarion embarks on the longest sea ride ever and Asha seemed more like an observer or even a puppet than any kind of independent entity. About 50% of Danys chapters may have been left out without missing anything or by just doing some minor rewrites. There's so much food, scenery and voyages but so little plot advancement. Has GRRM forgotten that sometimes less is more? That things can be implied and the reader will deduce what might have happened? In ADWD we get everything explained in excruciating detail and follow every fart that one of the POV characters produces.<br /><br />The prospect of one thought makes me afraid: GRRM may be surrounded by yes-men and people who don't dare to criticize the man. I'm worried about the future of the series - if GRRM will even be able to finish it in his lifetime (which is a huge if).
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are not the best. but it is something my kids can do. and yes you can download it on a kindle fire.
B004UID2LC|3.0|okay, the app used to be my fav app....I downloaded like 40 videos onto my kindle...now it searches for a song or video or whatever but it wont download. it says &quot;searching&quot; and then just stops like I never did anything. so I guess I cant download any more videos. so what happens if I download it as a MP3 or an AAC? where would it go? I'm too afraid to try it myself, considering I just bought my kindle fire. so my question is... what's the AAC and MP3 do? What's an AAC anyway? o_O
B007PTJOV0|2.0|um could it get any more like super Mario bros. really? Think of your own ideas.but other than big copycats the object of the game is o.k. but it really upset me when it is exactly like super Mario bros. so just go get super Mario bros. but if u want A COPYCAT then get this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have read about half of this book and am thinking I will not finish.  It is a poorly written Romance Novel with intense and kinky sex.  I guess if that is your thing you might like it.  I personally have found some kids books better written than this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm afraid that I am going to get through all the puzzles too fast.  It is great fun! I am officially addicted.
0802714544|5.0|\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is a Cold War espionage story.  Unlike many popular spy stories, this one spends more time on character development and the ambiguous morality of the intelligence business, and less on action.  The plot was well-paced and featured plenty of twists, and I found the writing style to be very easy.
0439023513|2.0|I first saw the Hunger Games movie and my prediction was that it would eclipse Twilight (no pun) in popularity--so I became curious enough to read the first book, and then more interested in seeing where the series would go next in the sequels.<br /><br />While lacking in character development, I loved the dystopian theme of the first book and thought it had great potential. I forced myself through the second, becoming aware that the series was beginning to go in a whole new direction that I didn't like. The connections were becoming illogical and unconvincing (Katniss's idea of taking the poisonous berries really sparked a revolution?)  The narcisstic theme revolving around Katniss as being the savior/most important being on the planet was becoming painful,  and more characters were introduced with so little development that it was nearly impossible to keep track of them all.<br /><br />In the final book, the original theme becomes so lost and blown out of proportion, that it bore little (if any) resemblance the first book. The one aspect that I could not let go of was the propoganda campaigns. While Katniss was forced to play it up for the cameras in the first book, this continues throughout the revolution with make-up/stylist team in tow. Why would a rebel group need to dispel propoganda? The characters were so poorly developed that I felt no attachment to them. Gale and Peeta seemed like virtually the same person. Katniss's mom and sister were just hollow characters. When characters died, there was so little emotional attachment to them that I felt unconcerned. Even *spoiler alert* the death of Katniss's sister, whom Katniss loved so much that she volunteered to die for--the very reason Katniss was placed into the games in the first place, the premise the book was based on, and the reason Katniss gained the respect and love of the capital and the sympathy of her readers, and still that loss was unmoving...<br /><br />Katniss's quick dismissal of Peeta (whom shehad whole-heartedly planned to die for by the second book) was just unexpected and inconsistent with her character throughout the previous books, and surely put her out favor with readers. Katniss saving the world was not realistic for me. And I felt sad that such a great story had to go to waste. I was also very bothered by the eludment of prostitution...and felt that was strongly out of place in a novel meant for kids! I just didn't see where Collins was going with that one or why she felt it necessary to add.<br /><br />I still believe the Hunger Games trilogy will be a huge success as Twilight falls by the wayside. But the themes of the two are virtually the same... love triangles, long drawn out non-sensical plots, and an overly important main character for teenage girls to fantasize about being. However, the material itself rings pretty empty.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Game is great! Just like Ravenwood fair and the other facebook game. only problem is getting friends. I don't seem to be able to find any. random player doesn't seem to do anything.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|One thing i liked about other games is that they had a community section where if you had their storm id you could add them. I cant figure out how to add people on here. ive tried typing in someones id that they posted in a review but it just brought me to their profile. My ID is soflpnclvr if you can figure out how to add. It gives you a place to go to a random persons but that doesnt work either. love the game but need friends
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This is hands down the best movie ever made. And if anyone wants to disagree ill do you like topdollar did gideon. I can say that with confidence because it has something for everyone, love, action, darkness, and mystery. Brandon Lee is by far my favorite actor of all time, and this movie should have a lot of people agreement. I believe in destiny and I think ot was Lees destiny to not see the fruition of this film, and that added to the noir and success of the movie.They just don't make movies like this anymore! Are they really trying to remake this classic masterpiece? What the hell!? As a fan of the crow mythology, I would be the first to say yes keep telling the story of the crow, but dont retell the story that worked the best. But needless to say I will be right there in the front row on opening night with my popcorn, watching the greatest movie adaption of a comic book ever made. So what if the next 3 movies sucked? They were still better than captain america and thor combined.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing Spider Solitaire. Its a great non thinking game to play if you want to distract youself for a bit. It has different levels of difficulty.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game! takes me back to old school Mario bros. I downloaded it as a free app but gladly would have paid for it :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is great.  The music and graphics really set a calming mood so that one can successfully complete the puzzle.  I really recommend it.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This albulm is just awesome!  It's got a crazy name and even better music!  If you like coldplay this albulm will not let you down!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I have absolutely fell in love with this series,  and I think if you love anything Zombie, you will too!  From the very first episode,  to the last one of Season 2....  it has everything you would want!  The last few episodes of this season is insane!  It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat begging for more!  And this Limited Edition set is spectacular! I can't wait to get it!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Many people are saying this is not a reskinned Mario. That is only partly true. The controls are similiar but unlike Mario you don't get small, and as long as you have the ammo, you can fire pine cones. Nice port lie adaptation for the android OS, have really enjoyed it. Only thing that bothers me is the one sound it makes when you get a life is almost if not exactly the same sound as it is in Mario when you hit a question mark box. Other then a free Irish themed knock-off Mario, it's a great game. I give it 4 out 5 for the fun.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great way to pass time in airport - just challenging enough to pass the time intelligently but not so detailed that you have to delay boarding with saves - I like it
0345803485|5.0|I absoutely love this book, I could not put it down. After reading the first few chapters, I immediately bought the other two books on my nook and read them all three in four days, I cannot say enough good things about these books, they are dark, heartbreaking, wonderful!!! Cannot wait to see what the author writes next, hope I won't be disappointed!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great puzzle game which requires a lot of thought to get perfect scores but can be completed a variety of ways.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Pleased to hear that Bruce has shaken some off the dust of his past several albums as Wrecking Ball leaves no doubt that he can tell the same stories with his good old rocking style.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, as a woman for women's rights I was blown away by this book and the the 2 sequeals.  I was confused and confliced but completely enthralled and could not put it down. I have never read about this particular dark lifestyle and it took some getting used to.  Keep reading people it gets lighter. Esspecially if you like an erotic read. If not forget about it.  It still makes my breathe a little quicker.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The soundtrack is really relaxing. This is a great way to unwind after a crazy day at work. I recommend.
B0055SWM08|5.0|They really made this a nice game. Nice interface and great music. Simple gameplay with nice graphics. I will pay for the follow up game easy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books could be the future. It was very sad how these kids grew up. Not having a life. Im glad how it ended she picked the right one. The story made me fell like I was in the nightmare with them felling every pain they went threw. Cant wait for the next new books.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this is a good game for wasting time. puzzles are a little simple, but an overall enjoying game. two words
B0055SWM08|5.0|great fun. i definitely recommend this game. very challenging and entertaining. i got it for free but i would definitely pay for it.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game runs well and is easy to control, but bores rather quickly. I only played three levels, but had gotten the picture. The enemies all seem like re-skins of each other without any unique characteristics. Very little sense of accomplishment after beating any given level.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a really addicting game I love and cant stop playing. this is worth your time to download it<br />the controls can be difficult but it doesn't crash you just have to put your fingers in the right spot. I love this app
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a really good app to pass the time.  The puzzles get progressively harder with new twists.  I also like the ability to get hints when stuck.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very nice. I definitely enjoy being able to create my own unique lil town and expand it at my own pace :)
B0007KS7D0|5.0|I highly recommend this item for taking wonderful macro shots. It works great with my Canon DSLR. Great service and thanks.
B00164EAC8|4.0|Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 2.4:1<br />Sound: DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio<br />Length: 2 hours 10 minutes (not counting the credits)<br /><br />The video quality was very good.  Not perfect, but very good to great.  I saw no grain in the movie.  I give it a 8.8 to 9.0 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />The surround sound was excellent.  So was the sub-woofer bass. There aren't many movies that have as much surround sound as this movie, and it all sounded excellent.<br /><br />I don't usually review the actual movie, but there was so many fake parts of this movie (and I'm not talking about the Godzilla monster), I have to comment on it.  The director or writer just didn't exercise common sense.  You have a very large lizard leaving footprints 5 feet deep in the ground, and clawing through the thick steel side of a ship.  You have people who are confronted with the danger of the approaching monster, and they just stand there, not reacting.  You have the monster out-running jet powered helicopters, but not able to outrun a taxi cab.  And the army firing so many weapons that all miss their target.  You have fish that have been out of water for hours moving their tails.  You have all the eggs hatching at the same time, when the monster couldn't have laid them at the same time.  So many parts of the movie weren't realistic.  But, the surround sound makes the movie worth watching.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't GREAT but the story was compelling. I read the NEGATIVE [1] star reviews before buying it and discounted them because of their LACK OF CONTENT!<br /><br />Instead of the [2-1/2] average stars published on the webpage, My rating is between [3-1/2] and [4] stars.<br /><<The webpage won't allow [1/2] star ratings.>><br /><br />I probably won't watch it for another [5+] years because of the ending. So I would suggest RENTING IT FIRST and then decide for yourself if you want to get it for your library.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|pretty great for a free app I'm pretty sure my 4 year old will enjoy it a lot more than my self but overall its ok but I am only on level 3
B007PTJOV0|4.0|a copy of super mario brothers. it is a simple game and fun but kind of hard too. this happened a few times that i couldn't control where ibwalk and keep going forward so all i can do is jump over/on things.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game!  It is a good thing you run out of energy or else I would never put it down. The only thing I don't like is the constant wanting. you to use real money.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I liked this game. It was a simple puzzle but very addictive. The only thing I didn't like was the music.I mean it was SERIOUSLY depressing. It lowered my self esteem for the whole day.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great live build a town game you should defently get awesome get it get lumber build your own boom town
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun and interactive game. having fun with it only problem like other games is waiting for energy to replenish

B006S08RLU|5.0|This film is just great. The lovely cinematography is why I went with blue ray instead of DVD. Amelie is a beautiful story you won't ever get sick of watching.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I was hooked after the first minute of play! I'm a casual player when it comes to these games, so this suits me well.
0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed (a fitting surname she assumed after her divorce) was only 26 when she decided to start over.  Her life was a mess, and Strayed, recognizing just how dangerous and destructive that life had become, decided to make some drastic changes.  Her mother, a 45-year-old cancer victim who had been the glue holding the family together, was gone.  Her brother and sister, whom she had not been close to in recent years, drifted out of her life after their mother died.  Then Strayed cut the last close tie she had by divorcing her husband, a man she still professed to love very much.<br /><br />Strayed, an avowed risk-taker, is also impetuous - not a safe combination.  This would, in fact, lead her into serious drug experimentation, promiscuousness, and the keeping of some rather dubious company.  But it was that same impetuousness that placed her on the Pacific Crest Trail to begin the 1,100 mile personal journey that would turn her life in a new direction.  That is the good news; the bad news is that she was totally unprepared for what was ahead as she began her walk through California and Oregon.<br /><br />Thus begins one of the most grueling solo treks imaginable for a young woman as unready as Cheryl Strayed was when she took her first steps on the PCT.  She began by making two critical mistakes that would combine to make her miserable for weeks: wearing shoes that were probably a full size too small (a decision that would cost her more than half her toenails) and carrying a pack that weighed more than fifty percent of her own body weight.  Less painful perhaps, but much more dangerous, was her neglect to research the terrain and weather conditions she would face as her elevation rose and the temperature dropped.  All of this makes her accomplishment even more remarkable.<br /><br />Reading Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail is almost like walking along side Strayed and listening to her think out loud.  This is a very personal book, less about hiking the actual PCT than it is about what placed Strayed on the trail in the first place.  Strayed recounts enough incidents of stress and personal danger to enthrall even the most experienced hiker (many of which, I suspect, will be particularly meaningful to women who must cringe at the thought of being as personally vulnerable as she made herself on this hike) but even her periods of methodical, downtime-walking are not wasted.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed has written one of the more compelling and honest memoirs of recent years.  She holds nothing back, making it a real pleasure to read (and difficult not to cheer aloud, in the process) the final few pages of Wild.hiking the actual PCT than it is about what placed Strayed on the trail in the first place.

She holds nothing back, making it a real pleasure to read (and difficult not to cheer aloud, in the process) the final few pages of Wild.
B003NX75B8|4.0|As other reviewers have said, John Green's Will is very well written, pretty witty and entertaining, the other one no so much, or not as much as John Green's, I think I would have like it better if he had written all. But all in all I really enjoyed it, and Tiny is a really good character.<br />I like how it shows that, after all, when you are a teenager everything is about you, even when you think that you are mostly thinking about everybody else, like in Tiny's case.<br />I liked Jane too, and Gidgeon too, Maura, I think her name was, wasn't my favorite, but I got what she was trying to do.<br />I almost cried at the end, yes I was a little cheesy if you want, but it moved me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|one of the best faotd ever! especially on tablet. very calming to play with the amazing soundtrack.  more like this please amazon.
B000I9X53W|5.0|Tootsie was one of the great movie gems of the 1980's.  Hoffman was great but I really like Bill Murray's role as his roommate.  It wasn't a big role but it was an excellent part.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not like the original Oregon trail at all..but more like a facebook game (farmville) . fun none the less. definitely worth trying out since its freee
006197806X|4.0|Note: This is a review for the middle book in a trilogy; as such, it may contain spoilers for the first book. Proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />It was different reading this one than it was listening to the audiobook for Delirium. I don't know if the format difference is the reason, but I thought Pandemonium was better than the first one. It was a different story; it was a deeper story. In this book, Lena grew as a person and she grew into the strength she didn't know she had in Delirium.<br /><br />At first, the two timelines threw me off a bit, but as the story progressed, I found I liked the way it was written. We were able to see the new, stronger Lena - but at the same time we got to see how she got there.<br /><br />I was apprehensive about a new love interest for Lena - but I also knew it was inevitable. I'm of two minds, however, when it comes to the character of Julian. He seems like a perfectly fine boy, but I feel like I didn't see enough of him or his personality to truly feel the relationship grow; it actually seemed a bit forced and happened way too fast for me. His acceptance of who Lena was was just too tidy and convenient. People don't change their whole ideologies overnight - even Lena wasn't quite capable of that. And while I don't fault Lena for trying to find happiness again, I was fully expecting the end of this book - which may have also driven my more negative feelings for Julian.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you enjoyed Delirium, you'll adore Pandemonium.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smooth and simple. Reminds me of angry birds with out the random factor. Pure logic. Glad it was the free app today.
B0000DAOHN|5.0|I gotta say I am so hooked on Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series!  I started by reading book 12, but before the movie came out for \\"One for the Money\\" with Kathryn Heigel, I read that book.  Since then I've purchased all the others and am currently waiting for book 9.  These are amazingly funny, brazen, romantic, lusty and intriguing.  I have a really difficult time putting them down once I've begun reading!  The prices on Amazon are unbelievable!  If you've never read this series, you have missed a LOL (truly) moment!  Thank you Janet Evanovich for Stephanie Plum!  Please tell me there will be another movie too!
B0060Q962Q|1.0|This app sucks 'cause it need a whole wifi connection and it doent even say so till u try and download it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book took my breath away. I read it in one day (didn't get much sleep!).I couldn't wait to read the next...
B006C5FWH8|3.0|This game is average. Controls are clunky, graphics are reminiscent of old IBM 286 machines or NES. There are worse apps out there, but there are a lot better too. I wish I had tried the free version 1st would not have wasted my money.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The art and graphics are stunning and the music is just great. Very relaxing. Puzzles are great and gameplay is simple and extremely fun. I've been looking for a good puzzle game. This is it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is a great time killer. the only thing is that you can only expand so far without friends playing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game keeps me occupied for hours.  I like the fact that its challenging yet so easy once you figure it out!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|not quite as fun as infinite rufio bros but it handles the Mario fix well enough for a free app it rules
B005XOPEOU|5.0|This album is full of good music! Thanks to Amazon, I also got a great deal on it. Listen to it often.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|All I can is WOW. Charles Duhigg has done excellent research and his narration style is outstanding. This book (the case studies, the stories of various real life events) is so valuable. I couldn't leave this book till I reached the appendix. I realize that understanding habits of people who matter to you- your wife, friends, parents, yourself (your customers etc) is so vital, it can make a HUGE difference in the way we treat people, treat ourselves (and change things and habits) to create this world a better place. Life would have been incomplete without reading this book! The best part is you can apply the Cue, Routine, Reward loop for almost anything in life- the way we do business (for our consumers), explicitly being conscious of what habits our kids pick up and consolidate why we live the way we live (our lifestyle).
B005IF5H2S|5.0|This album is full of great music! Got a great deal on it, thanks to Amazon. Listen to it all of the time.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Oh I really love this movie so much!!! SO great to find it over here at amazon!!! If u love roald dahl book -Matilda, you ought to get this movie!!! If u like movies like charlie and the chocolate factory etc...This movie is definitely a great buy for u. I remember watching this movie again n again during my childhood days, now that I can show it to my kid soon!!! I hope he will love it too!!! Oh my!! I am watching it now!!!
140846988X|5.0|This is an exceptional, beautifully written and read book. I have been listening to these tapes daily, and it is impossible for me to turn off my CD player in my car. Occasionally, the information is so fascinating, that I stay in my car to listen, instead of going inside to my destination. Truly an amazing work of art!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good graphics. fun game. has no problems with kindle fire. would recommend to anyone that likes old NES like super Mario bros.
B004SBX112|1.0|The software does not work on my tablet will not download on my tablet. So I do not have it did not get result on trying to solving the problem gave up.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Since I use this Mobee product until now, never remembered about charging batteries.  It reliably charges my mouse time after time with the simplicity of just putting it over the Magic charger.  Additionally adds some beauty to the workspace with its design.
B005OHSD3A|4.0|This book is informative as to why their method works for most people. As a diabetic it did not work for me, infact made me sick. I would definitely check with your doctor before using this radical weight loss method
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I'm very please I bought this bag. It has very good build and material. If you're looking to store your prosumer equipment with a small backpack, look no more. The padding is good, and it's got tons of compartments and pockets to store your gear while traveling. Here's what I have inside the bag:<br /><br />- 2 Nikon D90 bodies<br />- Sigma 17-70mm f2.8<br />- Nikon 35mm AF-S f1.8<br />- Nikon 50mm AF-S f1.8<br />- Nikon 70-200mm VR2<br />- Nikon SB600<br />- Batteries, straps, hoods, caps,, memory cards, etc.<br /><br />I like that the shoulder straps are padded, and the bag has straps around to make sure it doesn't swing around when you move quickly. I can't think of any negative thing to say about this bag.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|the game is fun takes sometime to level up. only downside is finding neighbors but aside from that pretty goood.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Im getting ready to watch this a second time since coming out n DVD. I'll likely watch it until the discs are thin as paper it's so good. Complete range of emotional levels
B0073XORLU|5.0|Everyone knows it is very hard to match the music of the original \\"Thick as a brick\\" from 1972, almost impossible, with it's delightful music and dense lyrics, however just giving a shot to try and recreate it-makes this album a great one too. Few artists can match Ian Anderson, fewer can even make such great music. heck, who needs to be in the hall of fame museum, just creating music like this works for me fine. Congrats Ian on another masterpiece, yet again proving Jethro Tull's music is the greatest ever.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great.  It's like Mario but in Irish mode.  It's also free and I like it more.  There is kind of a Peach getting captured like theme because he loses his gold like Mario losing Peach
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a fun game but the energy is a real killer. wish energy wasnt so important in order to play the game
B0055SWM08|5.0|very relaxing and thought provoking game. also the music is very calming . very addicting when you get into the game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|on the road kids have selection of games to keep them entertained. I even enjoy it! so far no problems
1400069289|3.0|Readers who like science written for lay people are those most likely to enjoy Charles Duhigg's new book, The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business. Duhigg explains the science in enough detail to inform and in a writing style that entertains because of great examples and stories. The loop we all engage in is that some cue causes us to behave in a certain way to achieve a desired reward. Some readers are likely to become more self-reflective after reading this book, and may recognize the patterns that we follow without much thought.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|HBO is not a television channel I watch. I was excited to have the opportunity to view the 1st season series of a novel I had just completed, having accidentally<br />stumbled upon the novel itself. The TV program was as advertised and provided a unique perspective of the story I had spent a great deal of effort trying to understand with the varied characters of peculiar name and commonly revised story lines. Dollar for dollar, I found the DVD series to be of good value and helpful in better understanding the direction of the story.
B007R41E8O|1.0|It downloaded fine but when I started to play the game it took forever (hours) to download &quot;resources &quot;. when it finally finished, it started over! I gave up and haven't been able to play yet. I hope they send a fix soon. it looks like a fun game.
B007QXWV1U|4.0|I'm not positive I would buy it again but there are some pretty cool picture frames,  it was a little slow processing the pictures but other than that it was great :)
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it is an okay game but is not my fab game because u always need 2 be on ur device
B003Y5HWMW|3.0|The shows were wonderful, and the viewing quailty is fantastic - but we had several issues with the DVDs working correctly.  They would take forever to load up, and occasionally not load.  Sometimes they said there was a copyright issue.  Also you can sometimes \\"choose\\" the next episode, but you'd have to switch discs.  Because they take so long to load, that was a 10 minutes process.  So glad we got to watch the 1st season, but getting it to run was a hassel.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you loved playing Mario brothers as a kid you will love this game. very easy to play. best part is its free. so get it!!!!
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|This melodic jazzy album with wonderful catchy tunes sang by an incredible natural vocal and sensible instrumentation and production is a chocolate to the ear of a music lover. Very rare jewel that one cannot get tired of.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this game but there are to many problems . they want money to play the game at a good speed and if you don't the game takes forever and that leads to #2 after two days the game starts to change how long it takes to get food from some animals or 24hr to waite for a bussines so for that I give three stars
B0055SWM08|3.0|I like the game but after 1939 it gets ridiculously hard and I have to spend coins that I work hard to get to solve it. If it gets a little easier to get coins I would absolutely give it 5 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun an d addicting game.  Makes you think things out before you move.  Good  for those whom like problem solving games.
0307352145|5.0|Things I like about this book:<br /><br />1. Susan Cain has a nice mix of anecdote and data. Not everyone likes hard science as much as I do, and a well-chosen story can help somebody new get into the book. The stories create a solid emotional hook that makes the science palatable. But narratives only illustrate deeper concepts, which Cain recognizes, and backs her stories with solid data from reputable sources. So this book should speak to a diverse audience where they happen to live.<br /><br />2. Cain deals with the issue of introversion and extroversion not from the attitude that one is better than the other, but that both represent valid ways of being. Because our society rewards chatty, demonstrative personalities (a topic Cain examines at some length), it would be easy to respond by tauting introversion's putative superiority. Instead, Cain acknowledges that each way of being has its benefits and its costs, and considers both fairly.<br /><br />3. Despite the myth of journalistic objectivity, Cain doesn't pretend to stand aloof from the questions she considers. She admits that she cares deeply about the topic of introversion, that she has doubted her own positions over the years, and that she has examined her topic from both sides. Her doubts, joys, fears, and passions come through in her writing, making her book feel as intimate as a good friend sharing her hard-won discoveries at the dining table.<br /><br />4. Cain makes concrete suggestions. This is no high-flown manifesto; she specifically considers how introverts can externalize and join extroverted society, as well as how (and why!) extroverts can practice introverted tendencies at the right time. She discusses how bosses, teachers, leaders, and parents can reach a diverse population composed of both introverts and extroverts. And she bases her advice on real experience, both her own and others'.<br /><br />5. Though a scholar herself, Cain does not assume any prior scholarship on her audience's part.She utilizes rigorous sources with a solid scientific background, yet she translates her points into vernacular English. That does not mean she dumbs her points down or treats us like idiots; she expects a curious and intellectually ambitious audience. But she also does not assume we know terminology, and takes time to interpret opaque language for lay readers.<br /><br />What I dislike about this book:<br /><br />....nothing comes to mind. Can I get back to you?<br /><br />Highly recommended for introverts, friends and family of introverts, and extroverts who want to understand those of us who prefer the company of our own thoughts. Though many pointy-headed authors have written many scholarly tomes about this topic, Cain does an admirable job speaking to a mass audience. She's fun, enlightening, and thoughtful. And her book never lags.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2HLM0BDZG18ZW]]Good packaging status when I received it.  I like how the parts snap into place and how all the disks are in the rotating wheels to keep all the disks in the actual case and separate from one another.  This is a classic so if your willing to pay the price then go for it :)<br />BTW DO NOT BUT THE Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]<br />It was horrible!
B006UG90RM|2.0|I've been a fan of VH since their inception, own nearly all their albums/CD's with both Diamond Dave and Sammy.  But this disc?  Ugh.  It took 4 or 5 attempts just to get through it.  It's nowhere near as lame as the one with the lead singer from Extreme, but I don't consider that one a \\"true\\" VH album anyway.  If it were 1978 this disc would be listenable but it's 30+ years later.  Times as well as I have changed.  If you're looking for or like to flash back to the day, you may like this one.  Or if you hated the Hagar years and never missed an opportunity to tell anyone that David Lee Roth was the only \\"true\\" VH frontman, you'll love this disc.  As for musical artistry, it's pretty weak.  Creativity is nearly non-existent.  It's your basic rock format album.  They had a format and they stuck to it, I'll give them that.  Eddie's guitar playing while of course, good, it lacks any excitement of days gone by.  There's almost no creativity, it's almost as if Eddie mailed in the tapes and let the guys mix it into the album.  Roth's lyrics are shallow and uninviting.  Nothing grabbed me at all.  He tries to belt out some lyrics and makes you think he has something to say until you actually hear the words and realize, nah, he's empty.  I got this CD for free.  I gave it back.  Just can't even give it anything positive other than if you miss the '70's and want to return to that for a few minutes with some new lyrics, here you go.  This will take you there but remember \\"you can never go home again\\".  I can't remember who that quote is from, but it seems applicable here.<br /><br />VH is on tour now.  I'm anxious to hear how the ticket sales are.  With their selection of Kool & the Gang as tour mates, that should be quite the dichotomy of demograhics.  Who was it that made that call anyway?  The State Fair organizers?  Needless to say, I'm not planning to see the resurected VH Golden Oldies Tour but if a free ticket fell into my hands and I wasn't doing anything else remotely interesting, I might go just to reevaluate my opinion.  Roth is more a showman than a vocalist or artist anyway, and it would be interesting to see if Eddie shows up sober or hammered.  The show must go on you know!<br /><br />12/15/2012 update: And where are they now???  Haha!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this games makes me so happy and so when I grow up I want be a cheif and good bye thank you and my brother also says thanck you.'
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This is hands down the best production back country video ever.  No one can come up with budgets like travis rice and for good reason. His team comes up with a awesome geographical take on snowboarding, using great music and creative boarding.<br /><br />Bottom line.. EPIC
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Have this game on my phone and no problems so figured I'd download it for my kindle fire. The coins you collect from your animals is less on the fire and the add friends through facebook feature doesn't work. That is one of the quests so would like to see that fixed. I'm not wasting acorns to skip it. Overall a pretty nice game.
B00000AF98|5.0|This is a solid album. I love Crazy, Crazy Nights, Hell or High Water, the power ballad Reason to Live, and Turn on the Night. I personally like all the different sounds that KISS has done throughout the years.  I truly believe it when Gene Simmons says that KISS makes music for the fans to enjoy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Some puzzles are simple, and some will have you scratching your head. Very entertaining piece of puzzling. I like that it can be moved to SD card.
B000001FKY|5.0|This album is awesome! I purchased it the day it came out on cassette tape back in 1987 and purchased the CD in 1990. I wore the CD out after 20 years and had to get a replacement. I love every single song on this album. To call this \\"commercial\\" is ridiculous. This album with Pour Some Sugar on Me, Armageddon It, Rocket, Love Bites, Don't Shoot Shotgun, Hysteria, and Excitable is one that you will listen to for a long time to come. After 25 years, I still enjoy putting it on in my truck and blasting each and every track!  This album rocks!  God bless Steve Clark!
B006ZT47O0|4.0|Epica is one of the few bands who continue to impress with each new album.  And despite my particular attachment to The Phantom Agony, I find that each album generally seems to be more refined and more mature than the last.  While I'm a little disappointed to say that the same is not necessarily true of Requiem for the Indifferent, that does not by any stretch of the imagination make this release a bad album.  Another reviewer mentioned that they felt like it was Epica on auto-pilot.  Depending on how you look at it, there is some truth to this statement.  While most of their albums have had some thematic similarities, the band has generally adopted rather different stylistic approaches to each title(or atleast it has sounded that way to my untrained ear).  Requiem of the Indifferent, on the other hand, sounds almost like a musical extension of Design Your Universe.  This could easily be construed as \\"auto pilot\\", but Simone very recently stated in an interview that Requiem for the Indifferent (unlike most past titles) is not a concept album.  The subjects discussed here thematically have a great deal in common with Design Your Universe (social awareness and responsibility, political responsibility) even if the specifics (financial crisis, the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, etc) differ.  The overarching idea that there are \\"people who nowadays don't care about what's happening in the world. [Who] keep their eyes shut [... and] need to open up their eyes, wake up, and try to unite with the rest of the world to make it a better place,\\" pretty much picks up where the last album left off.  A such, I wonder if the similarities in sound are less about being on auto-pilot and more about finally acquiring a sound Epica is comfortable with.  After seven years, that is not outside the realm of possibility.  While it would have been nice to see another concept album with a slightly newer/different musical approach, resting at a place where the band feels musically \\"right\\" isnot a bad thing.  Overall, Requiem for the Indifferent is a solid album with the quality of music that we have come to expect from Epica. I cannot say that it is my favorite release of theirs, but it most certainly does not disappoint either.<br />-----------------------------------<br />January 2013 Update<br /><br />While I still stand by my initial impressions in this review, I would like to mention that this CD has been pretty much on constant replay since I purchased it.  Not only has the album grown on me, but I would not place it within my top three favorite Epica albums to date.  The more you listen to it, the more you notice about it.  If I were to star this title now, it would probably get somewhere between a 4.5 and a 5.
B000002GBB|5.0|First off I am not a huge STYX fan but I did originaly buy this album when I was  12 years old when it came out and what a great album, I dont like every song on it but most of them I absolutely love.. \\"I\\"m OK\\" and \\"Queen of Spades\\" are my fav 2 songs by STYX ever..and I love \\"Great White Hope\\" and what a great opening that song has to start the album!! I have owned a few other STYX albums  \\"Cornerstone\\" \\"Grand Illusion\\" \\"Paradise Theatre\\" and none of them came close to \\"Pieces of Eight\\" to me.
B004USRKR4|4.0|I would guess that a lot of people are complaining about how short this soundtrack is, yet it costs more than $10. I could buy a Bob Dylan album for less than that (and you might want to if you enjoyed this small acoustic collection). However, this isn't Alex Turner's fault.<br /><br />These songs are worth your time if you enjoy acoustic music, 60's Beatles-ish ballads, or Alex Turner's non Arctic Monkeys work. Let's be clear: these are some of the best acoustic ballads I've heard in this generation. They are worth your listen. Alex Turner has legit songwriting talent, and it's a shame that its been hiding behind his more wild rock group.<br /><br />Hiding Tonight, Glass In The Park, and It's Hard To Get Around The Wind are beautiful. The album opens with a small lyrical foreshadowing of Stuck On A Puzzle \\"I'm not the kind of fool who's gonna sit and sing to you about stars girl...\\" almost as if he's sick of his Beatles comparisons, yet Stuck On A Puzzle is one of the most Beatles sounding songs I've heard in a while. They have Turner's hit or miss lyrics. Never cliche, and many times they work well, then other times they're kinda banal. Still, I appreciate the effort.<br /><br />Overall, this soundtrack is worth your time. I liked it so much I watched the kind of pretentious/boring movie. Maybe you will too, eh?
B0017R5UA0|5.0|If you're a Fleet Foxes fan you'll understand why this record is a must on vinyl. It sounds absolutely amazing and perfect during every song, although I won't go into detail about every song, some other reviewers explained it perfectly. This is probably by far my favorite record of theirs. Everything about the album is so natural and real and you can tell the group put a lot of love and effort into it. And I was also going to purchase their album Sun Giant yet couldn't find it on here. And guess what? When I opened up this record there was a second slot for a record, and it was Sun Giant! So that just made this purchase all the more exciting. If you're an old fan of theirs or new I implore you to get this record, you won't regret it.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Coldplay have moved from an alternative band into a more full-on pop sound, and that's fine. However, I feel like this album can't quite figure out what it wants to be. There are songs that seem as though they would fit on another of their albums, but as a whole it is just not a cohesive work.<br /><br />That said, there are some great songs on this album (Major Minus, Charlie Brown, and others) that are classic Coldplay and will be stuck in your head for days, guaranteed. If you're a Coldplay fan, you can't go wrong here.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really, really enjoy this game. Super fun and addictive!! I played this back in first grade. (: I give it five stars!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app far exceeded my expectations.  I was expecting some boring puzzle game but Quell delivers. I'm sure tomorrow will be some kiddie painting app but today was great.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun game on the kindle fire. I've been looking for a game like Mario brothers for a while. This game is just what I've been looking for!
0517543052|5.0|This was a fun book to read- very user friendly!  It was interesting to learn how traditional psychology seems to miss the REAL meaning of life, and that being objective, doesn't exist.  Beauty, fulfillment, contentment, honesty and wisdom are what's needed in this world.  I liked the analogy saying that \\"Emotions are like waves.  Watch them disappear in the distance on the vast calm ocean\\"  and that life is like a drama which We can watch from a distance with calm compassion.  Also, We can confront, and even disagree with existing institutions, knowing and trusting that inside place that says it's alright.  Another thing said that I liked was that, especially in Your Spiritual life, it does no good to remember the bad- just the things that help You!  It's alright to be happy!  We are to return to innocence!  What life seemed to be reduced to in this book, was eating, sleeping and singing!  I also liked the admonition to see how We are similar to each other, rather than different, because We are all one, and everyone's a part of everyone else!  It's good for Us to be aware of Our vibrational energy and to find Our unique vehicle for sharing Our wisdom with others.
1577314808|5.0|To be honest I'm not sure I can say this book changed my life, but I'm very sure it's one of thebest books I read so far. Tolle is one of the most intelligent people I read.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|Dr. John at his funkalicious best! He's gettin' back to his gris-gris roots here. Would have loved more of his amazing piano jams, but still an excellent listen!
B005OZ4E3A|3.0|It's a pleasure always hear Laura Pausini in English or in Spanish. Particulary, I love her first work but this one it's not bad at all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very addictive game! so simple, but you cant stop playing! I got it for free but it would definitely be worth the price.
B00466HN72|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun for my 9 year old son and my 3 year old daughter. We watched it the day before easter. The Blu-Ray quality was beautiful. It really does let the kids experience the \\"Easter Bunny\\" world and makes it a lot of fun for them. I felt the story line was as good as any other movie. I don't think it was as funny as some movies but my son did love the humor. There were a few parts in it that they could have left out so that it could have been G rated which would be much more appealing to be able to show it at school for a movie night. One example of inappropriate which would go over kids heads anyway and has nothing to do with the story line is that the Bunny tries to live at the Playboy mansion. The only thing you see is him outside the gate with the \\"bunny tux logo\\" and he does not get it. I take it the humor was for the adults, but it really didn't need to be in there. Other than that the movie is adorable and fun for the family :)
0312323867|5.0|I didn't think this book would live up to Something Borrowed, especially because it was from Darcy's point of view. I must say, I was completely wrong!  It was great to see things from another perspective. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Something Blue and highly reccommend it to any fans of Something Borrowed!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't seen the movie, because I was waiting to finish reading the book. The book from the first chapter captivates your attention, and it is not easy to put down.<br /><br />The story is very well written, and the characters are described perfectly.  It gives you a feeling of being in the place, you get to know what the primary characters feel, and think about the whole situation.<br /><br />Has some strong descriptions that maybe are not made for a younger audience, but with all the vampire stories out there is refreshing to have a story that is captivating enough that makes you want to keep on reading until the end. I Already bought the kindle version of the second book, I only can hope that it is as good as this one.<br /><br />Reynaldo
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this app for the Holy Bible.  It is easy to follow and easy to look up scriptures. I also like the fact that I can listen to the bible, and follow along with another Bible.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Good brain teaser. Seems short, hope there will be expansions forthcoming. Definitely recommend as a good time waster. Artwork is a nice feature.
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun time killer<br />its a simple game that works well on the kindle fire. played it for a whole hour before I noticed the time went by.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game. Good time waster. Down load it now. you are missing out. do it now. what are you waiting for.
B0055SWM08|5.0|excellent game, well designed and fun.  I think all you whiners need to realize a developer may not have enough paying customers to remove the &quot;annoyances&quot;.  if you enjoy the game and only paid 99 cents there is nothing to complain about .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cant stop playing it its a really nice game reminds me of the Sims in a way but not with the depand
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Knowing Jared Leto as an actor made me skeptical when I heard he was in a band but this band is talented.  I was surprised by how much I loved the album.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|Eh, this is one of the few horse movies that I truly didn't like very much.  I don't expect everything done by Hollywood to be 100% correct, so I've learned to just accept little technical discrepancies in movies...but war horse was a big joke to me.<br /><br />I can deal with a bit of the fluffy majikal crap just because it comes with the territory, but, let me put it this way, the existence of the unicorns in the movie \\"Legend\\" was more believable than a good portion of War Horse.  If I hadn't paid good money to watch it in the theater, I would have walked out.  I wish now I would have waited to watch it on HBO; at least then I would have been able to just change the channel.<br /><br />I like the book, it's a bit touchy-feely-majikal, but it's a children's book, it's supposed to be that way.  I guess I expected more from the movie (especially coming from Spielberg) and it was nothing but a massive fail.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Decent little game.  got it from the free app of the day. it's mostly easy but there is help when I need it
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a very fun game. lots of levels and just overall majorly recommended. would definitely buy again. get it you won't regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|this book was pretty good .it want as bad as people sayit was.i mean sure it wasnt as good as the first2 but it was still good. and besides suzanne couldnt win any other way.if it was lollipops and rainbows people would be mad.since its not people are mad.she couldnt win .but i thought it was still a pretty good book.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I've ordered FIVE of these:<br /><br /> - The first three came (all at different times) and were great. All with mono jacks.<br /> - Never looked at the 4th one until out in the field I was wiring up to people to be interviewed and needed to feed each person to a separate track to be sure I could balance their volume in post. The 4th one had a STEREO plug and didn't work with my splitter into the camera.<br /> - Raced back to my office, ordered ANOTHER one to replace the 4th one, double checked all the images on Amazon (all showed MONO and NONE said anything about a stereo plug) and damned if the 5th one didn't arrive with a stereo plug. ALL were the same number: 3350.<br /><br />VERY disconcerting.<br /><br />The little things work great (except for not knowing when the battery will run out - it's useless without a battery, so we meter them separately before each use) and the sound is clean.<br /><br />Let's see if Electronics Expo (who filled the order for Amazon) can get me one with a MONO jack.<br /><br />Charlie Seymour Jr<br />CreateYourOwnLegendNow(dot)com
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I loved it! This is the best game ever! I played it for 2 hours straight. It is even challenging in the early levels. You should get it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love puzzle games, the more unique the better! I do like Quell's uniqueness, but there is not enough variety. I got it free, so was worth the price, but I'd be upset if i bought it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is not to hard but not to easy so it keeps u entertained for awhile. makes time fly by.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|This is my second Debbie Macomber series and I love it as much as the first.  She has a way of writing that makes you feel like you are there and can see every expression.  I love the way she brings together unlikely people who become friends and help each other through their various life circumstances.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This was an action pack great movie that made you side with the apes and feel sorry for them. Also what animals may go through so we can possibly find a cure for our deseases. Would recommend it for others to see. Thought provacative.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Yes the books are erotic and hard to put down because I wanted to know what this helpless skank could get her 21-year old butt into next. I found much of the 3 books tiresome, the characters too thin, rich, pretty and overall perfect to take seriously. I read all the books during a week-long beach vacation, with many fruity drinks by the pool... so I guess they were okay in that context (ie, drunk). Obviously if I bought all 3 books they must have some redeeming quality (ie, explicit sex). But I really don't get the 5 and even *6* star reviews?! Give me a break - this is not thought-provoking mind blowing prose the likes of which have not been seen since Hemingway or Fitzgerald! This is simply a guide book to exotic sex toys/positions with cute/rich main characters. I agree with the reviews that said they just wanted it to END already - I agree totally. The sex got old after a while and thank goodness the author started cutting those scenes short in book 3. I laughed out loud about 10 times during the 3 books - most notably when the heroine becomes editor-in-chief after one week on the job at 21 years old after getting a Bachelors Degree. At least make it a Graduate degree and that  makes it a little more believable. I found myself over and over again asking out loud why the author had to make these characters so agonizingly unrealistic. A gray pencil skirt, jacket, high heels and a BB do not make someone a professional editor. The story has redeeming qualities but falls short with the ALWAYS perfect characters. Anyway, buy for the erotic diversions, as I've stated but do not look for soulful insights into modern life- unless you are the new Prostitute Barbie and need a guidebook ;D
B0055SWM08|5.0|Game was fun and taught me to,<br /> think outside the box! Now I want to play the  other one! I spent all night playing this game and I had to go to school the next morning! When my 1st period teacher asked me why I was tired I yelled &quot;Quell!&quot;
0749942169|4.0|In Rosamund Lupton's \\"Afterwards,\\" thirty-nine year old Grace Covey and her seventeen-year-old daughter, Jenny, are hospitalized after an arson fire engulfs London's Sidley House Preparatory School.  Grace lies in a coma and Jenny is in intensive care, suffering from severe burns and inhalation injuries.  Grace is the first person narrator, since she and Jenny can (unbeknownst to those around them)  leave their bodies, accompany people to places both in and outside of the hospital, and eavesdrop on conversations.  Grace and Jenny, who have had their differences in the past, are now on the same side.  They both want the arsonist identified and would like someone to clear the name of Grace's son and Jenny's brother, eight-year-old Adam, who has been accused of starting the fire.<br /><br />This is an emotional and, at times, overwrought family drama and psychological thriller, in which Lupton peels away the masks behind which troubled individuals hide their jealousy, greed, and rage.  Grace communicates with her distraught husband, Michael, who cannot hear her; watches in admiration as her sister-in-law, Detective Sergeant Sarah McBride, jeopardizes  her career to find the perpetrator; and optimistically makes plans for the future.  The book's central  theme is the infinite love of a devoted mother.  Grace insists that \\"motherhood isn't soft and cozy and sweet; it's selfish ferocity, red in tooth and claw.\\"  Grace's top priority is not her own recovery; she is more concerned with Jenny's survival and Adam's emotional well-being. Although she once felt guilty about her lack of professional ambition, Grace now realizes how blessed she  is to have a caring spouse and two good-hearted children.<br /><br />The novel is marred by an overabundance of subplots involving a vicious stalker, a disgraced teacher, and a battered woman in denial, as well as by a melodramatic conclusion with myriad twists and turns.  Still, \\"Afterwards\\" is engrossing and suspenseful enough to keep us invested in the outcome. It is an intense and moving story about physically and/or emotionally damaged people struggling to make sense of their lives.s invested in the outcome.

0307341550|5.0|If I had to sum up 'Sharp Objects' in a single word, that word would be \\"unexpected.\\" Other words apply - harsh, witty, dark, violent, sad, edgy, brutal. But \\"unexpected\\" somehow wraps all of these up and ties them together.<br /><br />It's rare to find a mystery that surprises in both its characters and its plotline, but 'Sharp Objects' does both. Gillian Flynn finds new dimension in familiar territory, as she explores the murder of two young girls in a small Missouri town. The dynamics of the town become just as important as the facts in the case, the two are twisted around each other like blackberry vines, dense and impenetrable. The story unfolds through the eyes and words of scarred and reluctant reporter Camille Preaker, who returns to the town of Wind Gap at the urging of her boss, after many years away. She walks into a personal nightmare with open eyes.<br /><br />The unexpected also comes in Gillian Flynn's prose, words like electricity from a downed power line - snapping, sparking, sometimes dangerous. Subtle sideways descriptions that hit just the right note, like describing a man who never seems to sweat as being \\"the opposite of moist.\\" Again and again, from the first pages to the last, Flynn haunts us with words that don't mean what they seem like they should, but they're the right words to use.<br /><br />'Sharp Objects,' as a novel, is the opposite of comfortable. As a mystery, it's the opposite of cozy. As a story, it's the opposite of dull. But perhaps the most unexpected thing in the whole book is that underneath the violence and the sadness and the loneliness of this story beats real heart - complex and damaged perhaps, but beating true nonetheless, and with the strength only the best stories can convey.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i think this game is the best game you can get on amazon but it takes for ever to get energy back up they should have put it to 2:00 instesd of 3:00
B0055SWM08|5.0|i love this game! its so relaxing i almost fell asleep playing it  i even listen to the music sometimes when i am trying to fall asleep!!! :-))))))
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I lover this I can play it with my son...it is easy ans colorful! plus I can some him the great animals we had back then.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like it and its fun but you have an energy limit and I run out fast but you gain some more every 3 minutes.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is definitely what the cliche says about a page turner.  It was great! I immediately bought the other 2 parts of the trilogy.  It is a shame that the author Stieg Larsson died.  We are now deprived of his great story telling.  I hope they make films of the whole trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing games and this has got them all!!!!<br />they have fishing games and soccer games and parashoot games and about 115 more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|like the game wish it was easier to get new games but I really enjoy playing most of the games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fast read and the only disappointing thing was that it was not longer. I would recommend this book for any age.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game and for the free app of the day its worth it to give this game a try. It might seem difficult but I got the hang of it after a couple of tries. The hints can help you out if you ever get stuck also.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book with an exciting twist around every corner. I could not wait to read the final book; Mockingjay.
0446547654|1.0|I've read every book Nicholas Sparks has written, and I am a fan of his work. This book, however, was the worst I've read by him. In fact, it was depressing. I found the main female character to be whiny, indecisive, and spoiled. It was very hard to care about her. The storyline was so predicitble that I really didn't have to read more than the first few chapters. I stuck it out, but I wish I hadn't. NOT recommended at all. Very disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book has the same great details as the first two books; however, the ending is disappointing. I feel that there could have been a fourth book but overall it was good.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|was fine the first day now...it will never let buildings or crop mature! it is always restoreing the time to 48 hrs
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Very addicting! You will find yourself sitting for hours figuring out the puzzles. Definitely with the .99 ¢ purchase price.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|30 years ago this would have been a revolutionary game. Today, not so much. Platformers nowadays are much more complex than this game is, and that is the majority of my discontent with this game.<br /><br />To each his own.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Made my new pocket knife MORE dull. Let me say that again. This knife \\"SHARPENER\\" dulled my new pocket knife and barely sharpened an old knife. Now I have to go get the knifes resurfaced to get the edges back to the original.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I did not have a problem with this product except next time I will order the larger size. The size I received worked well for one chip.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|would recommend this game for anyone very fun little game love this kind of game myself and younger age groups should also enjoy it
B005HP2J66|5.0|This is a Phenomenal film for anyone who LOVES Art, History, Mankind, Womankind, Animals.<br />the drawings are gorgeous, some of the BEST ever done in the world.<br />And the actual locating and exploration of this cave is Amazing!<br />Warm Regards,<br /><br />Alice F<br />Art and Nature Lover
B0055SWM08|2.0|I was playing this game for about 20 minutes when I got bored with it. The problem is that this is really a game of snake with obstactles in the way. Nothing special about it unlike angry birds space. Needless to say I uninstalled Quell within less than an hour.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for the books that I read. However this series affected me on such a deep level I had to add my thoughts. I have been reading my entire life. I was not aware a book, or series could be this intense. I was sucked in from book one and couldn't get enough. I fell in love with the characters and didn't want it to end. I am very happy with how the author closed the series out, she left nothing unanswered and gave the readers what they wanted. I feel like my eyes have been opened to a new world of reading entertainment that I didn't know existed. I have read many good books, but nothing of this talent and level. This series is a must read for both men and women!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love it. Relaxing to my brain and music calms me after hard day at work. Great graphics and smooth to play.
B0052U59F4|5.0|very well written book which develops fascinating character studies.  I had trouble putting the kindle down while on my recent vacation.  Thank G-- I was able to read my kindle on the sunny beaches I was visiting--or else I would have had to stay inside.  I really could NOT put it down, and then I had to get started on volume two, and of course volume three.  I sure hope a volume four is in the works!!!
0345803485|1.0|So I bought the book, intrigued by all the hype, and I'm sorry to say it was quite a let down. To begin I feel this book is sadly misrepresented. BDSM? Where? When? It's a poor representation of anything even remotely relating to a BDSM story/relationship/idea. Every time I thought the story was going to head in that direction, it just went right back to Ana whining about how it was all \\"too dark for her\\". Seriously? Too dark? NOTHING ACTUALLY HAPPENED!<br /><br />This book is nothing more than a romance novel. Plain and simple. It isn't \\"out there\\". It isn't a glimpse of some dark and kinky relationship. It is a romance novel. It is two people simply falling in love and having a very normal relationship (even if Christian isn't the most \\"normal\\" guy).<br /><br />To add to the frustration, the author lacks any ability to properly describe anything and the writing becomes increasingly annoying as the book progresses. The same words are used to describe the same situations over and over again. There is no variation in word choice or scenario.<br /><br />Of course, this book is a quick read without much substance and that is oddly it's redeeming quality. Perfect for laying on a beach and idly flicking through it's pages. I only wish it had been more of what it claimed to be, and had actually shone some light into the BDSM, Dom/sub lifestyle.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is a lot of fun and keeps your mind active with all the quests you have to do
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun app, have not stopped playing it since I bought it except to write this review. Levels are getting harder.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun game that is. very addicting. there are many levels. you can jkeep playing and playing. have fun for hours and hours.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is so relaxing and fun. easily takes up my time and has increasingly difficult levels, making for a fun game that is fairly relaxing
B004W2UBYW|4.0|A compulsive read - a real page-turner, and very accessible. After reading this book and the (in)famous Fortune article about Jobs, I now look at my iPod differently.<br /><br />I love, love, love my iPod. But then I think of the little things recounted in this book: That older lady he was berating as she didn't make his smoothie \\"right\\" could have been someone's mother. Those engineers and ad copy people he mercilessly humiliated in front of others, in front of their colleagues, could have been someone's dad or son. Call me naive about people in power who \\"get things done\\" and are \\"brutally honest\\" - but I do NOT believe it has to be that way; I don't believe that kind of behavior is a necessary by-product of a genius-fueled drive. It can indeed be a damaging management style. You can be fiercely single-minded but still have empathy.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It will make you appreciate the philosophy (indeed, the aesthetic) behind Apple products' design and engineering, and has some very engaging sections depicting the relationship between Jobs and Gates. I found it to be a balanced book - it presents Jobs the Unpleasant as well as Jobs the Innovator (and indefatigable businessman).  It could have stood some editing out of repetition; but that is a quibble.  And I did not see any mention of his death at the end of the book.<br /><br />It does cheer me to have read in this book that the other, very gifted people Jobs surrounded himself with (yes, his ability to assemble very talented teams was key to his companies' successes) were decent human beings who also helped create my beloved iPod.<br /><br />I'll hand it to Jobs that he was a pretty amazing person - but the awful narcissism was difficult sometimes for me to read about. I guess I'll hand it to him, too, though, that he agreed to have this \\"warts and all\\" bio written - he must have known that not all of what would come out would be flattering.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun easy games with a great variety. Games are short enough to be able to play a quick game in between doing other things.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really love playng this game as do my children also.  reminds me of an old school Mario game.  love it!
1401307450|4.0|Loved it, this book made me an even bigger RHCP fan.  A must read! I couldn't put it down, I never knew anything about Anthony and now I feel like I know him. I cried when Hillel died.  John and Anthony's relationship is amazing how it blossoms.
B0058VW36U|5.0|love it!!!! best game ever. I love everything about it especially the cute little monster thing. I recamend it to anyone who likes fun
B0055SWM08|5.0|i woulld sugest this game to anyone who likes puzzle games and strives for perfection on them. hut its also very fun for the casual gamer
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very good<br />great graphics<br />great quality<br />just like mario<br />works great on. kindle fire<br />the controls take a little time gettinguse to because u cant just double tap but nonetheless its a great game for all ages
B000M4RG42|5.0|This is an excellent book. Well written, you almost feel as if you're actually in the story. And the story itself is amazing. The characters in this book (including all those who fought on Iwo Jima) are true heroes. A truly inspirational story filled with action, patriotism, war, and friendship. A great insight into life during WW II. I liked the book so much I bought the movie (the book is better!)
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a okay book. It isn't as good as the first book but it wasn't bad. THe thing is i would say don't buy this one because it isn't good but since it is part of a series you should.
B00076Q024|4.0|Uriah Heep  \\"Abominog\\"  #56  (1982).<br /><br />14th studio album by The Heep.  This brought back again some strong material.  The first album without founding member and keyboardist Ken hensley.  New members include keyboardist Jon Sinclair (Heavy Metal Kids and The Buggles), new bass player Bob Daisley who was in Ozzy's \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" and ex-Widowmaker bassist in the mid 70's. They also brought in vocalist Peter Goalby from Trapeze and brought back drummer Lee Kerslake.  This album got Uriah Heep back in a big way, this was their biggest seller in 8 years.  The album photo is as ugly as could be.  MTV played their video for \\"That's The Way That It Is\\" #25 MSR,  a lot in '82, a very fine Paul Bliss rocker.  \\"Too Scared To Run\\", is also a great rocker, good crunch.  The synth driven \\"Chasing Shadows\\", the Russ Ballard tune \\"On The Rebound\\", great cover.  \\"Hot Night In A Cold town\\", a song that got played a little bit in 1980 for John Mellencamp on his album \\"Nothin' Matters And What If It Did\\", here Uriah Heep does a very good job also.  Other good tunes are, \\"Sell Your Soul\\" and the Trevor Bolder John Sloman written song \\"Think It Over\\".  Of The bonus material \\"Tin Soldier\\", the old Small Faces number is pretty good, and the live stuff is great also.  They would release \\"Head First\\", in 1983.
0439023521|5.0|It is a very fun book and i really enjoyed reading it. I finished the whole book in one day because once you start reading it you won't be able to let go. They have really cool characters like Haymitch, Cinna, Seneca, and Cesar. It is very cool to read and if you love reading a romance action book with an amazing characters you should read it. If not watch the movie and see if you like it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Did I enjoy this book: I did but not as much the second time around. That surprised me...a lot. I loved this series - all three books - the first time I read The Hunger Games series. But this time around, I didn't quite feel as enamored with Mockingjay. Don't get me wrong...this is a great book and a fitting end to the series. But parts of it settled differently with me this time.<br /><br />STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK OR THE PREVIOUS TWO BOOKS IN THE SERIES...THERE WILL BE SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Anyway...I didn't like that Katniss was the face of the rebellion at 17 years old. I can understand that she was the face of hope and determination, but of war and fighting and unrest...not so much. She was so independent in the first two books, then she practically bows to District 13. (I know this doesn't last too long and she does kind of get her way quite a few times. But it just seemed like she was going along with it all...not with what she wanted...at least until the end.)<br /><br />I thought District 13 was just as bad, if not worse, than the Capitol. I understand why they are so strict but come on! You would think they would treat their citizens a bit better considering they want to fight the Capitol and get the other districts on their side.<br /><br />Again, Ms. Collins had some really great visuals in Mockingjay. I could see the propos, the tv feeds, the layout of District 13. I could envision Katniss's mockingjay outfit that was designed by the late, great Cinna. The warring districts and the \\"76th Annual Hunger Games.\\" All things were described with great detail and images...I could see it all play out in my mind's eye.<br /><br />I felt bad for most of the characters in this book. Finnick seemed so lost. Peeta was used. Johanna had it really bad. Gale seemed to be taken over by the thoughts of rebellion and payback. Even President Snow...he was evil but somewhat sad as well. And poor Prim...I don't even want to discuss that. That was not necessary at all! Katniss deserved some happiness. All that did was  make her lose the rest of her family because even her mother abandoned her after that incident. And the facts surrounding Gale and that incident is just inexcusable!!! (I know this is the way the series had to end...I can see that and understand that not all stories can have super happy endings...but come on!!!)<br /><br />Would I recommend it: I would...especially if you have read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Like I said above, it was a fitting end to this fantastic series.<br /><br />Will I read it again: I will. This is a series that I will likely read once a year...especially when the subsequent movies are released. I'm anxious to see what they do with an adaption of this book.<br /><br />[...]appiness.

B000LB7G00|2.0|Well, I certainly don't find this input device very usable. Even after a short time of playing with various programs like Google Earth and SecondLife my hand starts hurting. The problem is mainly that software designers like those at Google demand that in order to use the thing to fly very slowly over a city, your hand needs to constantly press the knob in the lateral direction, where there is the most resistance. It's really hard on the tendons of the hand to sustain that pressure constantly over the course of several minutes.<br /><br />The device is much more usable in the 3d animation suite \\"Blender.\\" There, you turn the object around only intermittently as you're working... so there's not nearly as much stress on the hands.<br /><br />Another concern is that Linux support is dismal. The drivers which are available on the company's website do not install under Ubuntu Ocelot (11.10)... and I had equally little luck in following all the advice from hobbyists out there who posted on the internet about their attempts to get the thing working with Ubuntu. Linux is fast becoming my main operating system, and so this is a major problem. It does work fine under XP and Win7.<br /><br />All that said, the build quality on the device is exquisite. No complaints there. It has a brushed metal base, the hard rubber knob, and a lot of weight to keep the thing in one place as you press the knob this way and that (it feels like it's made of lead). The knob only moves 1/2 a centimeter to a centimeter in any given direction. It does not twist in circles like you might expect from looking at its design.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds you of an old nintendo game. I love it. it is awesome that it is free especially given the quality compared to other apps that aren't free.
B0055SWM08|4.0|great game,  but a little boring after a while. I really liked it because its do different from other puzzle games I've played. Worth the money.
0062011847|4.0|I certainly enjoyed Snuff. It seems as though the Discworld series has gone from being a series of jokes to an exploration of characters and consequences; I find the characters engaging and the situations interesting, so I enjoyed it. Snuff seems to have less tension and lower stakes than some of the other books; my all-time favorite is Feet of Clay, of course, and I'm also thinking of The Fifth Elephant and Thud!. Those are books with really tightly-wound stories, and Snuff isn't so much in that vein, but it's engaging.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm a fan of simple complex games. this 1 is perfect in my opinion. the levels get progressively harder yet, I am still able to solve them.
1568363931|5.0|I'm just getting started making bento lunches for myself and I picked up this cookbook because Amazon suggested it. I'm so glad I got it.<br /><br />I tend to be a picky eater, but every recipe except maybe two are things I want to try. There's a photograph for every meal (and the recipes and meals are set up to go together in the box) and there are substitutions if one part of the meal is something that you don't like.<br /><br />There's a timeline for what order to make things to have it all ready at the same time. There are safety tips.<br /><br />This is exactly the book that I needed. I plan to start going through it from the start and cooking every single meal in order!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a very easy, enjoyable read.  The characters came alive, the environment the characters lived in  could be visualized.  It deserves the hype!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is a really cool app and is perfect with hd, especially on a bigger screen. it runs well on an ipod touch, kindle fire, or ipad. the gravity fields make it easier in some levels and harder in others, but all of the birds are really cute.
0307959856|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book because I LOVE Jane Austen and I LOVE mysteries, but was thoroughly disappointed with this attempt.<br />From an Austen standpoint, it was mediocre. Yes, she takes descriptions of characters and situations directly from Austen, but she does not go into Elizabeth's and Darcy's inner thoughts like Austen does, so there is absolutely nothing satisfying about their relationship or interactions. This is not a continuation of their love story.<br />From a mystery standpoint, this book was quite dull. There was much talk about how the situations described were traumatic or distressing, but not once did I feel these emotions when I was reading. I did not care who \\"dun\\" it, and the unraveling of \\"what really happened\\" at the end had almost nothing to do with the rest of the story.<br />If you are looking to read this book for love of mystery or Austen, look elsewhere.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its awesome cool and nice I loved the game now it is close to my bed and I can use it for the morning when I get up
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|One of the best patriotic movies today.  Our Seals aren't actors but made all patriots proud -- back to the original brave men pre 1776.  Protect America; our troops put it all on the line.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Game is fun to pass the time but you have to pay extra when you run out of energy or wait for it to restore.  You can use energy real fast!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|What more is there to say. Great movie (even from a film perspective and not from I am a fan perspective...but that too) and the movie shipped in the allotted amount of time. My only complaint is that I didn't get it on Blueray...but that's my own fault.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game I think its cool because it is like Mario. I will reccomed this to a friend if you ask me
B0055SWM08|5.0|good free game as amazons free app of the day has totally caused me to lose track of the last several hours.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This app is not at all fun. After trying to win a level for so long, I got frustrated and decided to delete this off my kindle. This app is just a meme. People think its fun due to commercials and Tv. But in reality, just about any Java programmer can make a terrible game like this. this is a game that is cheaply made with many levels.
B0055SWM08|5.0|its a great game I play it every day I eat a ham and cheese sandwich but if you like games like this you will like this one
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great job for a game,let alone a free one. very reminicent of mario except it's a leprechaun instead of a plumber. me likee!
B00746O3X8|5.0|If it's too good to be true - it usually is.  NOT HERE.  I read the reviews before purchasing this camera carrier as I had been looking at Cotton Carrier for over 6 months.  Cotton Carrier cost approx $185.00 and how on earth can something as cheap as the Opteka MCH-25 be worth a dime.  One review said it was junk and a couple more said it was incredible.  What to believe?  For the price, I thought I would purchase the Opteka knowing that would be \\"junk\\" and send it back or just put it on a shelf. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE QUALITY.  I got it early this morning and I can't take it off.  Allows my Canon 5d Mark II, with Battery Grip and a 70-100 lens to rest comfortably on my chest.  NO pressure on my neck.  Heck, I may sleep with it on tonight.  I am a semi-profession photographer and know quality when I find it.  THIS IS IT.  If you purchase you will ENJOY.
B00413QB5A|3.0|Interesting plot, as always, strong characterizations, as always, just not as grand a theme as Pillars of the Earth, World without End, or Fall of Giants.  And great insights into the business of the art world.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing this game Cu's there's more then just one to play. j play Everett where I go. there's hugging better to do then okay this game.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Very fun and entertaining app.  Very addicting. could use more frequent updates though.  Overall worth my time.  need to add more please.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great app for the kindle fire. no need to play other apps. better than getting on facebook and waiting for apps to load.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|first, to the person who gave this 1 star - this is NOT a reskinned Mario brothers. The game is a standard platformer. The game has great graphics, original levels, and plays well, I just found that it got boring fast. But its not bad for a free game. Someone put a lot of time into this one.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Is To Watch a movies for Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol how to relase. Or only.<br />I Have To Is watch now. Enjoy Relax but not to excited.
B005TD4GTO|5.0|This is a damn good and solid album.  I am a moderate Oasis fan and haven't bought their recent stuff at all.  But this album blows me away.  Noel sounds great and his melodies are infectious snakes that wriggle in my brain.  I have been playing this album on repeat for weeks now.  It's that good.<br /><br />If you are a singer-songwriter or guitarist - TAKE NOTE and GET THIS ALBUM.  This is how it's done, you're going back to school with Noel.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|While I can say that Rebuild is definitely not a waste of your time if you are an Eva fan, this particular installment will probably not leave you particularly satisfied. Whereas the next movie in the Rebuild continuity effortlessly goes into new territory that at times surpasses the original series, Rebuild of Evangelion: You Are (Not) Alone will mostly feel like feature length recap of the first six episodes of the series, from when Shinji Ikari first fights the Angel Sachiel to the climactic Yashima Operation.<br /><br />The main problem is the fact that the six episodes were written to be episodic, obviously,  which doesn't exactly translate well to being stitched together into a two hour movie. Some content has also been cut, as well - notably, the scene after the battle with Sachiel when Eva 01's headpiece falls off to reveal its true nature has been cut out, though, unless you are new to the Evangelion universe, you probably already know all about what the Evas really are. Ultimately, both those that are new to Evangelion as well as the existing fanbase will probably feel as if this is simply setup for what is to come.<br /><br />It isn't all for nothing, though, especially if you are new to Evangelion and weren't able to make it through the TV series' laborious, monster-of-the-week first ten episodes. There is some new content, as well - towards the climax of the movie, we are shown the reason why the angels are attacking NERV (spoiler: NERV has a giant alien monster in their basement),and there's a scene at the end involving the mysterious Kaworu Nagisa that brings with it some unexpected twists.<br /><br />Overall, this may be a good starting point for those new to the series, and I can guarantee you that sitting through this is worth it for the second Rebuild movie. Those who have seen the original series, however, should probably best just skip right to 2.0, unless, like myself, you are a diehard Eva fan.
1451627289|5.0|I gave King's 11/22/63:A Novel to my husband, as part of his birthday gift, and he could not put it down! He enjoyed every minute of it, and found it to be absolutely amazing. And he is someone who never reads fiction. King is back!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This games has beautiful graphics and very calming music for hours of playing and perfecting the quell.<br />Very smooth game play too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I did not think I would like it but it is sort of addicting. I am glad I found it.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|We enjoy most of Nichlos Cage's movies.  Loved Ghost rider 1 and expected this one to be at least as good.  I based this on the fact that the previews showed a lot of action, and heck it was Nick Cage.<br /><br />1) They completly disregarded all the \\"facts\\" from the first movie.  i.e.  they changed how he signed the contract and even created a scar from a self inflicted bottle smash that did not happen.  Ok I thought ignore this it must be a good movie.<br /><br />2) As the movie proceeded, it was proven to me that my expectations where falase and this was a horrible movie.  What is it with the \\"Im hungry\\"  OH MY that is not what the Ghost Rider is about ... did you people forget about the penance stare????<br /><br />3) Then the Ghost rider would just stare at people and nothing would happen.<br /><br />4) what is it with the peeing fire?<br /><br />5) One corney shot after another, THEN to cheap it out beyond all belief, what was it with all the still shots... ????<br /><br />Instead of being on hte edge of my seat or tottaly engulfed in the characters challenges, I found myself complaining about spending the money and was often laughing at the horrible acting and humorous lines and acting...<br /><br />I mean I laughed at the movie......  I want my money back,,,,,,  IF THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME I WOULD NEVER WATCH IT!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was having a terrible day.  This game's music and design made me happy and softly put me to sleep.  thank you!  It was exactly what I needed!  Game design and transitions are superb!  &lt;3 highly recommendable!  Beautiful!  I also like how the entire game ties together around a theme.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am and always have been an avid reader.  I usually stick to the Suspense, Thriller, or Horror.  I very rarely read any type of romance at all.  UNTIL....Fifty Shades of Grey.  I ordered it one day after hearing all the hype about it for the past several months.  I read the whole trilogy in 3 days!!! I could not put it down, my family ate mac and cheese and pizza, the laundry piled up, and the house was wrecked.  Worst of all...my poor husband has to endure \\"the looks\\".  \\"The Look\\" happened everytime Christian did something that melted my insides, then I would look over at my husband, sigh, and shake my head then promptly go back to reading.<br /><br />I have never written any type of review before, but I felt so stongly about these books upon finishing them that I just had to let everyone know how intense these books are.  I have been done with them for 3 days and I can't stop thinking about them.  I feel like I'm 16 years old with a crush....It's pretty depressing to be done.  I fell in love with the story line and the characters, and to leave them breaks my heart.<br /><br />I really would like to read the story over again but only this time from Christian's point of view.  But until I can get my hands on something good enough to take my mind of Mr. Grey and Miss Steele, I may just have to read them again (just to get it out of my system...hey a girl can dream, right?)<br /><br />Laters, Baby!!
0465011047|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this gripping, personal account of survival and escape from DPRK- a regime whose continued existence is a stain on the worlds conscience. As refugees continue to flee this pitiful land, there are bound to  be several more such books in the pipeline. This is one of the first of a niche, and is very readable and nicely written.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is well worth viewing again and again.  We purchased both the first and second seasons to share with family and friends. Excellent, historical drama!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a really good game it tests your brain its fun to its weird that quell is a raindrops though
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game it's fun but have to say it's much better using a stylus stick it's better for shotting...I'm not going to say how old I am for this game but for my age I can't stop playing it but if I were younger Im sure I would have completed the stages by now...so if you want fun on your fire kindle I would go for it or if you can find it some other way then do it (AWESOME GAME)
0634023020|5.0|This could provide you with months of instruction. Simply attempting to learn \\"Blue In Green\\" was a real finger stretcher and learning experience for this advanced guitarist. Very helpful to have the tab and the CD to help. Keep in mind that you can choose to learn the changes and how he chooses to phrase the thematic sections, but that his improv is his, and you can feel free to adapt as you see fit, reducing the tedious hours of learning someone else's improvisations. That said, so worth the labor to get it down. Once done, there's a new world of chords and melody that I learned, and I've been playing 25 years. Highly recommended. Very cool to break out \\"Blue In Green\\" acoustic solo instead of some folk tune.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book. It had me cheering for Cheryl and fearing for her. Her descriptive writing had me hikeing along side her.<br />Like her, when it was over I was longing for more. I want to thank her for her honesty and openness in sharing her life struggles.<br />This book is much more than a hike in the woods. It is one of those stories that shows the triumph of the human spirit. The ability to overcome adversity and the bad things that life throws at you.<br />Thank you Cheryl for sharing.
B0057UA486|5.0|I'm surprised by the number of people here who seem to be down on this film. I've noticed a number of reviews of Kubrick films in general that are displaying both a low opinion of his work, and a complete misunderstanding of it's nature. I suspect a lot of this is simply fallout from the videogame-action-film-influenced crop of people that do the bulk of movie consumption these days, who simply don't appreciate the meticulous and carefully considered film making that Kubrick did. Many films today are about 20% set acting and 80% special effects\post production, in Kubrick's time it was the opposite. That being said, this is one of those films often described as a \\"flawed masterpiece\\", but there's really nothing flawed about it. Kubrick was a director who put tremendous effort into creating what he thought a film should be, so there are few flaws in his films, unless you consider his vision itself to be flawed. I think Barry Lyndon is one of his most interesting efforts, and probably the most meticulously accurate period film made at the time. The lighting effects are amazing, as is the recreation of not only period settings, costumes, uniforms, but period language and attitudes, something a lot of films get very wrong. This disc will join 2001 and A Clockwork Orange in my collection as not only three of the best (in my opinion) films of all time, but three of the most significant.
B007R0X76K|5.0|every episode is exciting....<br />when it ends I cant wait until the following episode plays.  Good Drama-it gives you a little bit of everything when it comes to how people are.
B00127RAJY|5.0|jillian is a tough cookie! This video is a full workout with strength, cardio and abs. Make sure you have hand weights so you can do this video completely. I am currently on level 2 and have been for a few weeks. I still don't feel ready to move up because this is intense! Get ready to get into shape!
B00322PKBW|4.0|I love this swatch. I have it in red and white too, I wear the Red and White the most. If you like matching your shirts with your watch for work or just for fun, Id buy the swatch color code collection. The red and with fit best. The blue one has a bit of a rubbery smell. Getting ready to buy the purple one to replace a purple one I do have because I thought it was mens but its ladies. If you are lady and dont like a mid size watch dont buy it. If you dont mine a mid size Id but it. I one night was feeling real strange I thought Id forgotten a watch and it drove me crazy that night not having a watch on SO I THOUGHT. I was ending my nite a friend went along and ask what time is it. I said I forgot my watch She says I but it on you remember, well we faughht a bit and she said just look well I looked and I had on the blue swatch (color Code collection). Cant wait to get the purple one to see what it wears like. I swell up a bit too and I can count on my swatchs to fit me. Id buy a swatch from the color codes time and time again. I wont buy the orange, Yellow or green I hate those colors.<br /><br />J.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am still working out all the uses for this application.  It appears my imagination is the limit.  It has organized all those articles I once tore out of magazines (I just scan in and toss), I have 'to do' app backing up from my iphone to Evernote, I have Evernotebon my Kindle Fire, Mac, work PC, and iPhone which all sync;  I use it for home PROJECTS, work Notes, Bible Study, shopping comparisons with photos Attached, and retirement articles.  Such a wonderful tool.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|and am still not tired of this CD. Different voices, different rhythms, not one track I don't love! I thought I'd be using it for yoga on the mat, but not having been able to preview the songs on Amazon, I popped it into my computer CD player. One week later the CD is still in my computer, because work I'd been putting off for weeks is finally getting done. This music allows me focus to an extent that is unbelievable. Please let me know if it works that way for you too!
B004J8HX5E|5.0|I was extremely happy to find just how many color combinations and examples this book provided. This book will definitely help you if you are in a rut and can't find the right colors for whatever your need!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lovely graphics, fun and engrossing game. The music and sound effects are perfect,  as well. Glad I gave this game a try.
006197806X|5.0|Couldnt wait to start reading this book! Very quick read, ( I finished in a day) and just as good as the first book in this series.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I relied upon the many favorable reviews of these recordings and was not disappointed. Excellent and well worth the modest investment. I highly recommend it.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|I had my husband translate the words for me since I don't speak French at all.  And he ended up loving the CD just as much as I did.  Carla has a beautiful raspy voice and even though I don't speak or understand French I really enjoy listening to it over and over again.  Totally recommend it!  Love it ... Love it...  LOVE IT!
B0078Q2HAA|4.0|After seeing all the comments, here and in the press, about this being a mean and disturbing portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, I found it to be quite the opposite. This was a moving and warm mini-biography that really only touched skippingly on the Thatcherite philosphy, its effects and lasting consequences for the UK. Those who agree with the boldly stated Conservative mantra will, presumably, be upset that Margaret Thatcher was portrayed as an ambitious woman who had failings but achieved highest office though finally, after 11 fairly successful years, was a failed politician due to being unable to see the reality of going too far.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I do have to admit. this was a much better game than I thought it might have been, just looking at it. there is more challenge to some of these puzzles than you see at first.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson has produced a tome that feels worthy of the man that it chronicles. Whatever your preconceived notions are of the man or the products and businesses he represented, after reading the book there is no doubt that Steve Jobs' work had substantial impact upon several industries (computer/personal electronics: Apple, music: iTunes, animated movies: Pixar).<br /><br />The story of Steve Jobs proves to be interesting as both a study of the man and the businesses/products which he represented. Detailed accounts provide the reader with a sense of being an insider, seeing how Steve's  personality drove his work and affected those around him. The narration of Steve's life also feels very honest; both good and bad facets his life are explored from the perspectives of many different people.<br /><br />If there was one critique it is that I wish there was more. Until then I will be patiently waiting and hoping for Steve Jobs volume II.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|its like a facebook game don't get it<br />its really really really bad also its a waste of time you will delete really soon after you get itand it tales up a lot of space on your device more than the avrage game
B00005JM02|2.0|This DVD was delivered.  It had some skipping in the beginning, but they kept them anyway.  It could still be shown to the grand-kids.  I also enjoyed seeing the DVD.

B007R41E8O|5.0|Very excellent, entertaining little finding-things game. So far.  Then again,  I have to admit I am pretty easily entertained. Pretty good boredom-remedy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a free game and a good way to spend your free time. plus you do not have to play long it is a short and easy game. lol get it got it good
B0055SWM08|5.0|An intuitive little puzzle game. I am enjoying playing it. The increase in the difficulty of the puzzles is nice. Definitely a five star app.
B00792EGES|4.0|I own the Amsterdam DVD, and this Blu-ray blows it away visually. Everything is crisp and detailed.  The camera angles change too often for my taste, but that's totally subjective to the viewer.  I haven't even gotten through the entire Blu-ray yet, but wanted to comment on the pace of the concert. As with the Live in Amsterdam DVD, some if not all of the songs appear to be played at a quicker pace than their stuido albums.  I agree with other commenters that it makes Miles appear rushed in his vocals which is a shame, and it can make the overall sound just seem a little sloppy.  Once again the audio seems to fall a little flat sonically compared to the studio albums. It's not that the band is doing anything wrong, its that the mix just doesn't have the lows of the kick drum and the bass that a real live show encompasses.  I don't have a dedicated subwoofer on my system which may help, but I have two very capable stereo speakers which sound great with other live concerts, so I know it is the mix, and not my system causing this shortfall.<br /><br />Despite these negative comments, I know that if you're an AB fan, you will enjoy this Blu-ray.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|After reading quite a few reviews of this book, I expected it to be a long hard read. Most people stated that they thought the mid section of the book was way to drawn out and really not necessary to the story line. From my reading experience this book was thoroughly enjoyable start to finish, and I think that all parts were relevant and went to making the story more believable.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun to play but need to be able to get dollars easier and without paying for them. then it would be great.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game that keeps the kids quiet for 10 minutes AND it was free! I'll take it!<br /><br />Samsung Epic 4g
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I am a marine and learn a lot better about history by watching movie on historical events this movie was an alwsome movie. i would recommend this movie as a educational movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good to burn up some time.except energy gone too quick. fun fun fun need more energy. needs. more. energy. runs out too quick
B0055SWM08|5.0|very smooth game mechanic, challenging puzzles. music is decent, and fits the art style well. easy to pick up and play but also appealing to completionists with the option of a perfect score.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game its just like frontierville on facebook but better because the Oregon trail has little videos when ever something bad happens
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|Based on a true story, the 1978 film \\"Midnight Express\\" stars Brad Davis as Billy Hayes, a young American who is apprehended while attempting to smuggle two kilos of hashish out of Turkey in the early 1970s.<br /><br />Despite his hopes of an early release, Billy is convicted and spends years in a hellish Turkish prison.  When they realize their sentences will stretch on for many more years, Billy and fellow inmates Jimmy (Randy Quaid) and Max (John Hurt) plot escape when they face sadistic guards and an environment so brutal that the law of the jungle prevails and many of the prisoners are driven insane.  A couple of the scenes are absolutely not for the faint of heart, and I can now understand why I was not allowed to watch the film on cable when I was nine years old.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Express\\" is a Seventies classic--it was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two, and its soundtrack produced a Top 40 hit, Giorgio Moroder's \\"Chase.\\"  The DVD set for this unforgettable film comes with a booklet that discusses the production of the movie, and the DVD itself contains the original preview of the film.  \\"Midnight Express\\" is a searing examination of the depths to which man can fall but also of the tremendous inner resources that some possess in the face of extremity.
B006LL0UZW|4.0|I already have the printed version, and now i'm buying the e book.  that's how much i love this!  As we say in the Marines, Dustin Diaz really \\"breaks it down Barny style\\"  If you already know the fundamentals of photography, this book is going to take you up 2 or 3 levels!  Your photos probably still won't look just like his but the mechanics are no secret, and learning to light a subject will be almost as easy as pointing the camera and pressing the shutter.  There are plenty of lighting diagrams, very detailed camera and flash settings, and behind-the-scenes shots so that you can see what the where the lights actually are and what exactly they are doing.  This book is HIGHLY recommended.
0316098329|5.0|Having just re-read this book for my book group I thought I would put my thoughts down as this is a book that I feel should be read by everyone.<br /><br />This is not a book that you can say you 'liked' as the subject matter is so unimaginable personally that, if there were not many recent real-life cases like this,  you would almost say that it was not a realistic subject matter.  As the saying goes there is \\"nowt as queer as folks\\" or \\"fact is stranger than fiction\\".<br /><br />It would have been so easy for the author to go for the dramatic, easy win by detailing some horrific scenes in this book but, instead, she went for the simple story and left the detail to the readers imagination.  This is the reason the book works so well.  Having the story told from the eyes and in the voice of the five year old child, Jack, makes the reader think about the basic facts of the story rather than dwelling on particular graphic scenes.<br /><br />The first time I read it was in February 2011 when my own child was 4 months old and while I thought it was a brilliant book then, I did not truly appreciate how well the author had written the language of the child.  Now that my child is 19 months old, when I re-read the book I realised just how well she had captured Jacks' voice.<br /><br />There are days when I get frustrated with having to occupy my child or think of what to feed her next and even times when I just want a moments peace and some time alone but having read this book it really does put it all into perspective.  How would I feel having to do all of the above within an 11 foot square room with no help or people to talk to, apart from the child.  I have heard the opinion that it would have actually been easier for Ma to raise Jack as there were less dangers and she had complete control over the external stimuli but that just does not sit right with me.<br /><br />This book is well researched and hits just the right tone for me.  It goes for the well written story rather than the graphic shock factor.  It includes just the right amount of detail that I, personally, just would not have thought about, for example, giving Jack a cold when he was outside because he had never been exposed to any of those germs before - this just did not occur to me until it happened and I then had a \\"D'oh\\" moment!<br /><br />So please give this book a read, it is a quick read anyway, and form your own opinion.  On another note I did not like her other book \\"Slammerkin\\" as I felt it was a poor mans version of a Sarah Waters novel.  I will give her another chance as I have \\"The Sealed Letters\\" on my tbr.<br /><br />Happy (if one can use this word for this book) Reading.er than the graphic shock factor.

B004EJUMT2|2.0|This band has gotten a lot of hype in the last few months,<br />They were on the cover of Metal Hammer and looked scary as hell!<br />Also they have rock star fans like James Hetfield of Metallica!!<br />So I thought I'd buy this CD and see what all the hype was about,<br />I'm \\"old school\\" and I don't listen to bands online I buy their CD's<br />and wait to be surprised... Well this band was a real surprise I must<br />say!!<br /><br />The music was very generic 70's style metal, nothing really special about<br />it and the vocals are so wimpy I could'nt stop laughing!!<br />This guy dresses like a demon pope but sounds like Boy George singing<br />about the Devil, I don't know how anyone could take this band serious?<br />They should change their name from Ghost to Joke!!<br />Even the Evil Horned One himself must be laughing at this band, Devil Worship<br />has never been this stupid or funny!!<br />After listening to this crap I now know why the band members don't want anyone<br />to know who they really are!!<br /><br />The best thing about this CD is the cover art which I like and is why I gave<br />it 2 stars but the disk I will use for a beer coaster!!<br />Save your money on this one and buy another Motorhead CD!!

B001LQQJ3E|4.0|This DVD set arrives in a large plastic case with about 20 or so DVDs inside, each inside a paper slipcase.  Each is labeled on the slipcase.  I would rate this DVD set as good; there could have been more comedy included though.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|pretty cool time waster specially since its free. no complaints here its obviously taken some inspiration from Mario but that's not a bad thing
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game. My biggest issue other than running out of energy too quickly is: HOW TO ADD NEIGHBORS. I created a Gameloft Live account but still can't add anyone. My id is jessepko1313. if anyone can add me that would be great! the more the merrier!
B004LROUNG|2.0|John Grisham is my favorite author. However, this book was a little slow and disappointing.  I normally cannot put his books down, but this one took me a while to get through.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining book.  Once I started it I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to see the movie. My 11 year old grandson loved it as well.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is my favorote type of game and this one is especially nice. Great graphics &amp; works fine on the K-Fire. So glad to get it for free but would have paid for it if I'd known how good it was. Freebie is almost over so grab it while you can!
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my son who is having a hard time navigating the changing world of middle school.  Because this tale is told through narration from several characters in the book, it brings depth to tricky world of adolescent relationships.  If he takes nothing away but one of the precepts from the Engligh class or the characters, I'll consider it to be a worthwhile endeavor.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Anyone who can't see the similarities between this game and Mario must be blind. Frankly I'm surprised the dev have gotten away without a lawsuit. (Maybe they're friends). Anyway I only give it 3 stars b/c I don't like the control or maybe I should say lack of it. At least on the K-Fire \\"Lep\\" kind of keeps sliding along when you let go of the arrow. Then I got stuck in world 1-2 there's a wall I can't jump over&hellip;he just doesn't go that high. If that's all the farther I can go I'd be pretty angry if I had paid for this game. I'm really disappointed! If I find a solution I'll edit my review.

1451648537|5.0|This book was an easy read, every page revealed something interesting, hard to put down, and food for thought long afterwards. It was, in a word, inspiring. I'm mostly writing this review to give the book another five-stars.
B006ISJQ1W|2.0|I suppose it had to be done, given Depp's affinity for anything that has to do with Gonzo, but this was arguably one of Hunter S. Thompson's [[ASIN:0684856476 weakest works]], published some 30 years after it was penned, and in large part due to the fact he wasn't writing much new anymore.  The premise seems funny enough, but the end result is kind of a Fear and Loathing in San Juan in the late 50s, with revolution brewing in the Caribbean.  The only problem is that Thompson was very much a novice at the time and it painfully shows.  What we end up with is little more than a Men's Adventure Story set in Puerto Rico, not the \\"Great Puerto Rican Novel\\" that he imagined.<br /><br />Locals are either wild-eyed natives or smarmy real estate developers with a variety of expats hanging out at posh resorts and bowling alleys.  Real estate is gold, we are told by Sanderson, who for some odd reason befriends young Paul Kemp, who manages to snag a reporting job at a struggling English-language fish wrapper.  Sala and Moberg provide the requisite odd balls for Kemp to play off.  Of course, we have to have a lady in red in the sultry Chenault, who ultimately gets thrown to the natives like some sacrificial offering.  Kemp tries to make sense of it all, quoting the occasional line or two from [[ASIN:0486272664 The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]] when the mood suits him, while lamenting that he has yet to find his voice like young Coleridge.  This is a pretty weak rum punch, despite the sumptuous colors.  Don't be fooled by the trailers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I loved it no glitches or anything! the graphics are good the music is calming and the quality os excellent! if you like puzzles this is the game to get! #winning
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is a great movie that does justice to the Edgar Rice Burroughs books. Its a shame that we won't see more movies since Disney killed any chance of that with the worst botched advertising campaign ever. They have already written it off as a 200 million loss even though worldwide it's total take is not bad and there's a possibility that it will make its money back when all is said and done with its box  office journey. I can't wait for the Blu Ray!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Tons of fun.  It will keep you busy for hours.  It really makes you use your brain to figure out what moves to make.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A great puzzle game that challenges you to think outside the box. Music and sounds are adjustable which is nice. I really like it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love it, its so much fun. Great stress reliever. I can play for hours especially when I have to wait in lines. You must try the other ones.

This book as well as the 2nd and 3rd consumed me its all I did for a week. Not only is this trilogy a GREAT romance its also a great suspense. I would recommend these books to anyone! I am now a huge fan of E.L James!!!
0060853972|5.0|The end of the world was not typically treated as a laughing matter. But since Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman took a crack at the Crack of Doom, it hasn't been the same. \\"Good Omens\\" is an often laugh-out-loud telling of the 11 years following the birth of the feared Antichrist, in inauspicious Lower Tadfield, England. The book's laughs come from standing accepted wisdom on its head as well as the thwarting of ancient and well-laid plans.<br /><br />The story centers around a demon and an angel - the unlikeliest pair since Cain and Abel. Crowley, the original serpent of Genesis, is a sunshaded, devilishly sharp dresser. Azirafael, his adversary, is the hapless keeper of the flaming sword from the same book. They have been at sword's points since the beginning. But after 6000 years of being posted to Earth together, they are more friends than foes - even covering for each other with their respective management chains. Worse, from the perspective of the coming cosmic conflict, they have become accustomed to the good things of the Earth, and can hardly be considered advocates of a world-wide destruction. Crowley, ever the tempter,  reminds Aziraphael that except for Elgar and Liszt, all the decent musicians are in Hell, and besides, there are no sushi bars in Heaven. Crowley, for his part, is anxious to stay out of the clutches of his more evil-minded brethren. Both demon and angel wish to continue their nice escape on Earth, and so conspire to put off the end of the world for another 11 years while Hell grooms another Antichrist.<br /><br />Pratchett and Gaiman fill the book with fascinating and lovable characters, ludicrous situations and enough memorable imagery to fill gigabytes of your imagination. The idea that London's M25 orbital motorway was a hellish rune, fogging the countryside with low grade evil was hilarious. As was the idea of a hound of hell transforming itself into a boy-friendly yippy dog. The Antichrist, brought up in the \\"wrong\\" home, is an 11-year-old rascal who adores of the English countryside and is as yet ignorant of his tremendous potential. The Chattering Order of St Beryl, a satanic order of scatterbrained, voluble nuns, was priceless. And the antics of Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell - who pads his expense account with fictitious witchfinder colonels and privates - is softheaded buffoon unwittingly played by both sides. Finally, the 4 riders of the Apocalypse - War, Famine, Death and Pollution (he took over from Pestilence in '38) - are reimagined as motorbike riders who are nonetheless truly scary for all the humor and irony the authors pack into them. Finding them on the side of the country road, lost on the way to Armageddon, and directed by a pompous local, is just precious.<br /><br />Possible plot spoilers ahead.<br /><br />As a student of theology, I was bowled over by Pratchett/Gaiman's attempt to infuse Armageddon with basic decency and humanity. The Christian apocalypse is a decidedly un-nice affair, with warfare, blood, damnation, pain, judgment and horror abounding. Crowley and Aziraphael are the unlikely conscience of the book, who in spite of their job descriptions, will do about anything (except directly disobey their respective masters) to keep The End from happening. While the forces of Heaven and Hell stand wingtip to wingtip, awaiting the order for the final, devastating battle, C and A (and a few others) do their damnedest to foil the Ineffable Plan. Their eventual solution is a piece of genius that preserves the ability of God to rule over the universe. But it also give \\"a pox on both your houses\\" judgment on the mutually mad  and headlong rush to destruction that is represented by the war between good and evil.<br /><br />Pratchett and Gaiman belong to the higher order of being who see no earthly good in the high-stakes antics of most of the world's religious people. They hope-against-hope that there can be a minuscule amount of self-interested good in humanity that will halt itslemming-like plunge into self-righteous annihilation.<br /><br />I don't know anything about the supposed clever references that are said to dot \\"Good Omens,\\" nor of all of its allusions to movies and books. I just know it as a book stocked with lovable and memorable characters, and it urges readers to imagine a world in which the end of the world can be laughed off for the absurd and childish nightmare that it is.lemming-like plunge into self-righteous annihilation.<br /><br />I don't know anything about the supposed clever references that are said to dot \\"Good Omens,\\" nor of all of its allusions to movies and books.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|Take a dash of Theseus and the Minotaur, stir in a smidgen of gladiator epics and a dash of Winter's Bone and you have the Hunger Games. The story, in which 12 formerly rebellious districts must cede a girl and boy to an annual battle to the death, is set in an America at least 74 years in the future. The districts, kept in penurious poverty by the people of the Capitol, prepare in dread for the coming games. Catness (the amazing Jennifer Lawrence) is picked for the games and is whisked away to the Capitol for a few days of wining, dining and martial training, before being set loose against 23 other 12- to 18-year-olds in a lethal game of death tag. She truly *does* have \\"catness\\" - aside from being lithe and lethal, she is wily, cunning and inscrutable. The games are set in what looks like a pristine forest, but which has been salted with television cameras, all for the viewing pleasure of the gaudy, bedizened decadent Capitolites as well as the folks back home. The ensuing mayhem makes for terrific television, and sends a political message to the former rebels - redemption is possible, but only in small amounts and only at the behest of the Capitol.<br /><br />The movie's targets were fairly obvious - think reality shows like \\"Survivor,\\" extended to their logical extreme. And what greater stakes (or an affluent society) than pitting the poor against each other in a death match? But the film also hints at targeting the political and social forces behind the games - the politicians (like Donald Sutherland as the President) who benefit by giving the poor just enough hope to keep them docile; the rich (mascaraed and wildly coiffed) who have no conception of the suffering of the \\"stars\\"; and the media, which never turns down the chance to wring profits out of misery.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" can be predictable, but it is moving and thoroughly entertaining. It will be a fine film if the sequels delve more deeply into the hidden motives of the characters -- and maybe even say something about the society that molds them.e even say something about the society that molds them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all 3 books! Couldn't put these down. The love/lust in the book is mouth watering good but the story that unfolds is breath taking!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just what I said. You will not be disappointed. Peaceful music and setting. Smart puzzles that challenge and satisfy the mind.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is fun and entertaining. I love playing it every day. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I have a kindle fire and this idiotic game said we are sorry your divice is not compateable really amazon ur spool stupid to put this game up
B001F0WXY0|1.0|There is nothing whatsoever to justify the high price.  It is a book with no extras, unless you count the excessive errors.  It has the feel of something which was scanned by an eighth grader with a short attention span.  Missing and extra spaces, incorrect spellings which appear to be a result of scanning with fifteen year old OCR software, and improper formatting.<br /><br />I actually like the story more than I did thirty years ago, though that old paperback had fewer errors.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its an okay free app really like the levels. b ut they are tooo long it takes 5 minets just to finish one level
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game has a lot of levels about 200. you should get it,it is not a waste of money!!!!!!! get it I hope you do please.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|Great game if it didn't cheat!  Tab was holding 4 tiles when I went out.... 0 point to me.  Seems there is only one 0-0 tile.<br /><br />Be nice if the tile total was displayed... game would move quicker cuz I could avoid recalculating total after every play.
B002BWP49C|4.0|So I've really enjoyed all the books & the movies up til this one. The first half of this movie was a bit boring. But since I've invested so much time with the series & the prior movies I wasn't going to give up. I continued to watch & it did eventually pick up speed. CANNOT wait for part 2.<br />Sidenote:  If you haven't read any of the books or watched any of the earlier movies, you would probably be bored out of your skull.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This light weight cover is the perfect cover for my Kindle Fire. It protects the kindle from dust and has the option to stand it on its side for hands free reading. I liked the fact that there were so many color choices. I found one perfect for me.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I miss this show soooo much! Would love a movie, or even a spin-off!<br />So this show was so freakin confusing. There was all these different characters with all their back stories. The show was constantly flashing back to past, then forward, & then sideways. It was chaotic! But I loved the intrigue. The writers were constantly throwing new info at us each episode & it just seemed like we were getting more & more confused. But I wanted to keep watching cause I knew we'd eventually get all the answers.<br />And so I thought when the finale came all my questions would be answered. But I wasn't satisfied with their reasoning for the characters stories & two of the cast members who should've been there weren't, & there was no explanation as to why they were absent. That bugged me.<br />Kinda felt like the writers were in a hurry to end the show.<br /><br />But it was still a GOOD show!!!<br />If you haven't watched. Should definitely give it a watch & start from the very beginning.
B0076NAWWA|1.0|I love Steve Morse. Steve and Mike are great. Bass is great. Keyboards are cheesy and the vocals are just plain terrible. 100% disappointment. Flying Colors sounds like every 80s hard rock album that should have never been made.<br />Ever hear of a band called Mr. Big? Flying Colors is the same idea drums, guitar and bass wise except the keyboards in Flying Colors add NOTHING and the vocals have no range at all. Put Don Airey, or Ken Hensley on the keyboards and you would gain something. Find a vocalist that could actually sing a couple of octaves (Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson) and Flying Colors would conquer the world.<br />As much as it pains me to say it, avoid this CD like it were the plague. So disappointed I actually threw my copy away.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the challenge of how to best solve each level.  Easy to learn.  Great game.  Check it out yourself.
0345349571|5.0|After reading George R.R. Martin's series of fantasy novels [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]], I was interested in how much the excessive violence and inhumanity in those books, for which Martin has been criticized, departed from the record we have of the middle ages. I followed Martin's sources to Tuchman's wonderful account of 14th century Europe, A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century. To better establish which is more outrageous, fact or fiction, I have endeavored to make a comparison of various ills (in alphabetic order) that are present in both works.<br /><br />Where 1 '*' indicates much less prevalence in Tuchman, 10 '*'s indicates much greater prevalence, and 5 '*'s indicates equal prevalence.<br /><br />Beheading:  *****  (see also hanging, burning at the stake)<br /><br />Gluttony:  ******<br /><br />Incest:  *<br /><br />Madness:  ******<br /><br />Murder:  *****<br /><br />Pestilence:  ********<br /><br />Rape:  ***<br /><br />Simony:  **********<br /><br />Sorcery:  **  (real and alleged)<br /><br />Treason:  ****<br /><br />Vainglory:  *****<br /><br />Warmongering: *******<br /><br />Whoring:  **<br /><br />In conclusion, the average star value is 4.77 indicating that fiction may be somewhat more outrageous than fact. If you have a preference for simony and pestilence I would recommend A Distant Mirror, while if your tastes lean towards incest, whoring, and treason I would recommend the novels of George R.R. Martin. However, both works should equally satisfy the seeker of vainglory, gluttony, and beheading.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Can't help myself. I love this game. I sit there and wait for my energy to go back up. It's so addicting.
0756407125|5.0|This 2nd novel was as engaging as the first. I couldn't put either down and I find myself always looking for the next arrival. He has excellent characters and is an excellent story teller. I can't wait to find out where the old journey went and where the new journey will take me!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a wonderfully simple game that has a deceiving complexity. It is very fun ame challenging at the same time.
B005DOKK7Q|3.0|The zip cover really protects my Kfire. I love all of the great colors offered.  The price was a little high though.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very addictive.  makes you think ahead and plan your moves but so far not too difficult.  enjoying the free game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OK.  I did not want to like this book, but ended up loving it.  Enough to buy the 2nd & 3rd books.  It was both emotionally heavy and lighthearted.  Most of the time books that get a lot of hype don't seem to be my cuppa tea, but I liked all 3 of the Fifty Shades books.  If you are a prudish personality type, don't waste your money.  If you are a bit more open minded, give it a try.  These have been added to my \\"keep\\" collection.  Christian in his f'dupness was both disturbing and entertaining.  Ana, well she is an innocent trying to understand a man whose past is very dark, disturbing and emotionally debilitating.  I don't write many reviews but had to put my two cents worth in here.  I'm a Stephen King, Dean Koontz and Hunger Games, Harry Potter fan but I'm adding Ms. James to that list.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game reminds me of some of the levels of Heaven &amp; Earth from the early '90s. It is lots of fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a really fun yet addictive game.  I'm always playing it on my ipod so I was very happy to see their was an app. for the kindle fire as well.
B005KELW26|5.0|I had checked many places locately unable to find anything, worth prices being asked.  Was well pleased with cover for my Kindel Fire.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great way to pass time.  very peaseful and fun. makes you think but not too hard at the same time
B0057VDGNK|5.0|I generally don't really even bother with movie soundtracks HOWEVER this soundtrack is outstanding in every imaginable way. Truly captures the 80's aesthetic while being catchy and unique. LOVE it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Finally! Non-intrusive (dare I say enjoyable?) music, an idiot-proof menu, great tutorial and gameplay that makes me really think. Definitely worthy of a maximum rating.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|to my shock this a very fun game! always seen it but didn't think I would like it. haven't been able to quit playing!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|interesting and fun to play. lots of missions and different things to do. great game. def recommend for anyone. interesting graphics and ideas.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I thought it would be really hard...but its not!  its really fun.  its so cute how its a raindrop.  its kinda zen-like.  I love how when u get it perfect it gives you a hint to get through another level.  very user friendly.  I would definitely recommend it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|First time in quite awhile that Amazon has given us a really good free game. I may have gotten it for free, but I'd say it is easily worth its $0.99 price.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!!!!! it reminds me of a lot of the different tap zoo games, but, with better graphics
B004MC8CA2|5.0|absolutely love it. its such a blessing. reminds me, reads to me, its wonderful. highlights, notes, its perfection. with so many versions.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a good game. it reminds me of cutting fruit just fast. it is the same as the others so this one is a better deal. You should get its AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|all around good app. very good for grocery shopping. I would reccomend. I use it for the cool attachment system.
B0050XFY4O|1.0|I couldn't get through this incredibly boring film. Not worth watching. Most of it is just showing 2 children playing. Worst movie ever made
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Good game for kids and adults who like the Ice Age movies. Will continue to play and let kids play.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me first start by saying that I am not a fan of erotica to begin with. However, reading the buzz about this book, and the fact that it was in the Top 5 Kindle books, and on the NY Times Bestseller List made me curious. I went into this book with an open mind and really wanted to enjoy it...I was in need of a change from my usual genre. Unfortunately, things did not work out as planned. This book is horrible. The writing is juvenile, the plot is ridiculous, and the sex scenes are laughable. Once I read the line \\"It's so big and growing\\", I knew I was done. I could go on no longer. I was losing brain cells. At 25% done I gave up and returned the book. I don't mean to sound nasty, but I just need something with a little more substance to read.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It is a very fun game to play, but it freezes for a few seconds once every couple levels. It hasn't crashed or anything yet just freezes up then continues like nothing happened. ATRIX 2 should be able to handle it fine.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|There is no doubt this is the album of the year for 2011. It is April 2012 and I am still listening to the full album while watching sunsets on the beach in Maui. Can not wait till their next album comes out. Great stuff. New Zealand should be extremely proud.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead is without a doubt, my favorite show on television. I will admit that I was a little skeptical when I heard it was going to be made into a show but I am glad to say that it has far exceeded my expectations. The transition from graphic novel to show has been seamless. I'm delighted to own the first season. My ONLY complaint would be about the casing. Under the insert, there isn't much plastic so the disk is sort of exposed and prone to being scratched but not a deal breaker.
B0055SWM08|4.0|So far, a really, really, really good game. I'm glad I downloaded. I may give it more stars later on.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is really neat. I'm not much of a puzzle person, but Quell has an atmosphere to it that few games can achieve ( such as Angry Birds). It is very addictive and relaxing, and it's very hard for this game to pizzicato you off.
0385512058|5.0|This book has been very influential for me and my business. I am NOT a networker. I hate networking but I do like working with talented people and meeting those people can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />I learned one technique in this book that has helped me climb the ladder faster and meet people that are often not approachable. Years after reading I use it on a weekly basis. I can't even measure the returns but they are massive!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I followed all the instructions that came with the product. The computer screen showed sound going into my computer when I hit the record button. When the tape finished playing,I was surprised to find nothing was recorded to my hard drive. Either the product is worthless or the instructions are wrong. Either way,it was a waste of time and money.
B001QFZADA|5.0|This is a very interesting book. I was having a hard time communicating with certain people in my life & was becoming frustrated. The book helped me understand how to talk to them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game has good music and a mind bending puzzle scheme. that will entertain. for hours without getting too frustrating. very low key and fun over 2 thousand people. cant be wrong
B0055SWM08|5.0|I loved this game and for once the ratings justify the true worth of an app/game. simple, elwgent and very addictive
B006ON41FC|5.0|Its a great game because its fun and it kind looks 3D! its a really fun great game. All you have to do is collect all the nuts- its righteous!
B005MLP71Y|5.0|I love this movie!  Sure there is no major moral to the story, but it is a fun movie to watch.  Just clean, funny entertainment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Haha great time passer. I started playing this and got totally into it. looked dumb, fun game.and free? sweet! sign me up!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is done well. Congrats to the NER Bros. Both my wife and I like this easy to play side scroller.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun game check it out it is fun and good for younger kids so pass it on x x xxx
B0055SWM08|2.0|Would have rated higher if they hadn't nagged me.  Puzzles get more interesting smoothly.  I would rather be playing than writing a bad review so I can get back to playing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome,  addictive game. I just wish there were hints that did not show the entire solution.  Graphics and soundtrack are great!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I beilive this games is what you call fun any body who gets this game will enjoy it like I do
B007PTJOV0|3.0|its to simple and needs to be more of a challenge. I think if it was harder/ a challenge it would b so much better. it reminds me of basicly Mario
B00756GKBA|5.0|this album is just everything madonna has been about all of these years! best madonna album ever! great tunes! pop - dance - electronica - amazing ballads... everything is on this album! don't miss it! she still reminds us that she is on top of her game and still the queen of pop!
1594481717|5.0|[[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]<br /><br />Timely delivery and a must read book!!! Plan to order more of Daniel Pink's amazing books, this was my starter book of his and is certainly a good one to read.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|The first Star Wars is still the best. The story is timeless and the production design holds up after 30 years. I watched it with my seven year old son, Maximus, whom has now seen all six Star Wars and is a walking encyclopaedia of the Star Wars galaxy! I was having difficulty finding a copy and so went online and quickly found one. I swallowed the purchase price but found the steep delivery charge hard to take. I was quite put out when, only after I committed to the purchase, that delivery was close to 3 months. I could drive to Mos Eisely in less time! This needs to be addressed. It's a DVD not a tanker of coal! In any event, watching it and watching my boy watching it ( we had a light sabre duel when Darth and Obi did on the launch deck!) Was well worth it. May the Force be with you!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|There've been other actress. Others who were better looking. More talented. Certainly there have been plenty more stable actresses. But there has never, in the history of film or TV, been any other actress who was more magnetic; who was more \\"made\\" for the medium than Marylin Monroe. Even in the earliest role I've seen her in, \\"All About Eve\\", she manages to capture and hold the audience like no one before or since. She really was the physical embodiment of the term \\"star power\\". She was also, according to most people who worked with her, somewhat challenging at times, and it's both aspects of her that come to play in this movie.<br /><br />The movie stars Michelle Williams who channels Marylin expertly, playing her as she comes to England to film a movie with Lawrence Olivier, played by noted actor/director Kenneth Branagh. She's somewhat difficult to work with, which is like saying light moves a little speedily. Eventually she acquires/chooses a handler in the form of young third assistant director, Colin, played by Eddie Redmayne. The two bond and start to become close. Very close.<br /><br />This was a really excellent movie. Williams embodied Marylin in all respects, right down to being so blinding on screen that her mere presence almost washed-out every other person in the frame. Everyone else does well with their roles, too, including Redmayne, who has a very daunting task playing against Williams.<br /><br />The only complaint I can really level about the film is that the pacing felt a bit off. It dragged in places. Not severely so, but enough that I was checking the clock a few times.<br /><br />That aside, this is a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend viewing it and reading Tony Curtis' book, \\"The Making of Some Like it Hot,\\" which also details much about Marylin and her life and personality.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The books get better and better with each one you read. I just believe they played out all the sex. I got to a point where I just skipped over the pages.
0307352145|4.0|This book should be required reading for all of corporate America and/or anyone who manages other people. It helped me to see that it is OK to be an introvert, that we are not \\"odd\\" or \\"antisocial\\", and that we have good things to offer, which sometimes goes unrecognized in a loud, overly expressive world.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game all around.  Music, graphics, and playability all included.  Wicked easy to get caught up in, would def recommend!
B002RVEIAI|5.0|Didn't even know about this addition to the series until I was looking at them on Amazon.  Will enjoy watching it with the rest of the series
B0055SWM08|5.0|addictive gameplay with beautiful design and music, without ridiculous permissions. This is what puzzle games should be like for this platform.
B00004CZN7|5.0|Have loved the two sister act movies for a long time, and finally decided it was time to get my own copies.  Thank you Amazon for selling them at such a good price.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|My wife loves horse movies - and if they are well done, so do I.  Black Stallion is one of our favorites, and we enjoy Secretariat (but then we had actually seen Big Red as his owners used to call him).  This movie was, well, okay.  The first third of the movie featuring the landscape where the story starts is exceptional (from a scenic point of view), and Joey the horse is a magnificent looking animal.  The story takes a number of improbable twists that strain credibility until it gets to the expected happy ending.  We looked at each other and said, simultaneously, \\"Well, it was okay.\\"  My wife went on to add, \\"Not great, just okay.\\"  It's a decent rent for family viewing, that's the best I can give it.  Better acting, and probably directing as well, could have made it a great movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Had a great time learning the rules and dynamics of the game. Can provide hours of diversion from real life,  like finishing this year's tax return.
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish. Read it in just a few short days. If you're looking for other good reads about the PCT, check out \\"The Cactus Eaters\\", by Dan White.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Totally got me hooked.  Ended up watching the whole season in two days.  Can't wait for season 2. Haven't read the books, but definitely going to check them out as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Since I read this book for it's arousing content and not it's literary quality, I loved the book!  I am not a book critic, nor do I care to be one, but I do want to escape in a fascinating book about things that are relatively foreign to me (although I certainly picked up a few ideas...).  If you are seeking a sexy, interesting page turner, then you should read this book.  If you are a prude and/or a literature major who only enjoys high-brow books with impeccable literary quality, then this may not be the book for you.<br /><br />I am a middle-aged, professional male who loved this book and immediately purchased the next two for my Kindle.  Two thumbs up!  I've always wanted to say that in a review. Sorry Siskel and Ebert...
B00640UICA|5.0|This game is difficult but fun!! I played it for the first time on my friends Ipad and was addicted within 1 game.
1451673442|5.0|A further book of inspiring words to enhance our lives .<br />Rhonda is a clear and simple writer who we can all relate to .Her message is simple and easliy encorporated into daily lives .If we all follow these ideas ....how wonderful would our planet become ???
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I didn't see the reviews for this book until after I read it since a good reader-friend recommended it.  AND IT IS A GREAT READ!  I have never been so disturbed as I was reading this book but I couldn't put it down.  I had a very hard time relating to the relationship between mother and son and yet I couldn't put it down.  I kept trying to think if I knew anyone who remotely may have felt the way this mother did during her pregnancy and while raising her son and I really couldn't (thank goodness) but I still couldn't put it down! I still found it very believable. I was thoroughly engrossed in this story, the way it was written (very different which I really appreciated), the twists and turns and the somewhat surprising ending.  I thought it was brilliant! I highly recommend this book to adults.<br /><br />I just took a glance at the less flattering reviews and obviously I disagree but I suppose that's why there are millions of book choices out there.  I found one review that beat up on the author for the word choices (\\"people don't talk like that\\").  As I reflect on that review having recently finished this book I actually found the vocabulary refreshing.  I ocassionally used my Kindle dictionary and had the opportunity to expand my own vocabulary.  So what?  I don't talk like that but I found the vocabulary consistent by character throughout and therefore found it believable that the mother DID talk like that.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint at heart.  If you're looking for something different, thought provoking with a lot of drama you'll be happy with this read. I doubt anyone is looking for a \\"disturbing\\" read but it was and like I said I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />While the story line is totally different from the movie the Omen I found myself thinking about the Omen often as I read this because it evoked the same feelings.  Perhaps that comment will help some of you decide if it's the kind of \\"disturbing\\" you could read and still enjoy.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|(Revised)<br />- Compared with the original TV movie version with Alec Guinness, this version (with Gary Oldman as Smiley) is more slick, shorter, more visceral and less spiritual. It is entertaining in its own right, even though it departs from the  book (and from the original BBC version) in some noticeable ways.<br />- As a Le Carre fan, I recommend this version --it is an interesting, well crafted movie.<br />- Le Carre purists may not be satisfied, but anyone seeking an engaging movie will be.livered or expressed without explanation; so if you haven't read the book, you may feel bit frustrated with deciphering the intent or messages being conveyed in this version.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|It was good to read the classic book, WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  It was interesting and intriging.  I always looked forward to picking it up again when I had to stop.  The book was well written with a good plot.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun mind boggling game.  It has many levels and keeps me and my kids entertained for a long time. We try to beat each other's scores.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book!  I was a little worried going into it, because I heard that there was a lot of violence and killing which I typically don't like too much in a book.  The way that the book is written made me want to keep reading and not even care that the violence was there.  I just had to keep reading and couldn't put it down.
0205606288|1.0|No table of contents.  No way to figure out what play you are reading without going back to start of the play. No indication of how far you have progressed in the play.  None of the nice features described in reviews of the hardcover version - just straight text with no annotations or introductory essays.  An absolutely poor execution of conveting what likely a great book into a less than substandard kindle edition.  AMAZON, PLEASE PULL THIS TITLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE KINDLE LIBRARY.  .
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love the fact I can finally get this on my fire. Lots of fun. Would not recommend for a child. Its to easy to spend real money.
0439813786|4.0|Amazing illustrations! So nice to see a book for older readers win a Caldecott award for its art.  I was familiar with the book but hadn't gotten around to getting a copy for my middle school library until two students specifically requested that I buy it for our library because the book was one of their favorites.  I'm sorry it took me so long to add this to our collection.  Initially, I was a bit surprised at how thick the book was, but once I started reading it I was greatly entertained by the story which is kind of an adventure as well as a reminder of how resilient and resourceful people (yes, even kids) can be when they rise to the occasion.  The ending of the story wraps everything together in a sweetly surprising way and I found myself smiling as I turned the last pages.  There is an audio version of this book which is also very good...but really it's only half of what the story is meant to be so if at all possible read the book.  My grown son tells me the movie made from this book was great, but cautioned that it wasn't a movie for young kids.  Apparently, my school-aged grandson walked away from watching the movie to go play--I'll read him the story first.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|This film unfortunately is so dumb that it is unwatchable. I tried to sit back, relax and enjoy it but about half way through I gave up.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like another game I know of.....same worlds and levels as mario. its free at least try it out if you don't like it delete it.
0439023513|1.0|i didnt get my book and now its saying that it has been shipped whats going on what can i do?
B00321SMHW|5.0|Awesome is the best adjective to use watching the amazing footage their photographers are able to obtain.  The spectacular filming of the snow leopard is jaw dropping.  I keep it on my Kindle Fire and still look at it when I need a lift. I recommend it to everyone, regardless of age.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Yes, Adele is a phenomenon, but she has NO reason not to publicly thank her musicians. The pianist and her guitarist are primo on the Artists Den show in Santa Monica were a big reason she sounded so great.--yet she bothers not to thank them publicly or list their names--not very nice!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is a very good puzzle game.(don't really like the music though.) I will rate it five stars because the other games on the kindle aren't that good
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game to play. I really enjoy it. love the hunting games on here when the stuff pops out of the trees.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game but not sure how to get neighbors and it forces closed a lot. will give it a little time to get fixed if not ill delete it.
B003UYUP58|4.0|For anyone interested in learning about cancer origins and treatment development this is a great book.  The book gives hope to those that continued and better treatments are around the corner.
1584721782|5.0|The story of Pride and Prejudice is beautifully narrated by Kate Redding.  She narrates male characters just as well as female characters.  She doesn't leave you wondering which character is speaking in the narrative, either.  I really enjoy listening to any book Kate Redding narrates because she really puts personality into the voices of every character in the story.  This audio-book is a must-have for Jane Austen fans and audio-book listeners alike!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great to kill time, some games are very simple and others more challenging. super addicting which makes it easy to gain points and unlock more games
B004VMUS9G|1.0|i had it and it didnt even wake me up u shud get the pne with th red clock and dont waste any time with this one
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Omgosh this was sooo funny and well done!  The actors did a wonderful job!  I just loved it!  \\"He should have told us he was a Christian!\\"  HA HA HA HA.  Really really good.  Really really cute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book &lt;3 .I think it's a really good book and I really recommend it!!!<br />IT DESERVES 5 STARS!!!!<br />p.s. I'm really looking forward to watching the movie. xP
B005IZNM0W|5.0|Not finding this item in the local stores, we thought to order at Amazon. The look on our grandson's face was worth it. Thanks for stocking the item.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think this book deserves a 4 star rate. I liked it but not as much as the first one.<br />But I still liked it. :)
0345803485|4.0|Okay one thing is clear about `50 shades of grey', you either love it or hate it. I read the book on impulse after a friend recommended it as `similar to twilight', so mind you I had no idea the book dealt with BDSM. My first reaction was `what the hell?!', I have to say it was clearly a surprise and not one I was entirely content with but 50-75 pages in why not continue?<br /><br />So here it is, I gave the book a change and found myself mesmerized by the relationship between Ana and Chris. I found potential in their relationship and the idea that Grey was a haunted soul. What women can resist the subliminal need to nurture a tortured soul? I tried to look beyond the BDSM and found myself getting more and more comfortable with their relationship. The chemistry between the characters is clear and charged with electricity, the explicit scenes often times made me blush.<br /><br />The story continues to grow throughout the next two books which I already read as well, because quite frankly it's a fun read. If your reading the book its not for its literacy accuracy (for those who want literature read the Bronte or Austen novels) but for the sheer of reading something different that is romantic, erotic and funny all in one.  Do I recommend the book? Yes, if your open minded about sex, relationships and willing to read it as fan fiction which is exactly what it was meant to be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had a lot of suspense. I would not stop reading it. I really liked it so I think it deserves 5 star. :3
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app to remember everything. The trick is you need to figure out your own system and have the discipline to keep up with it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is like Mario but better it is worth your time. You could pay 30 dollers for some Mario game or you could get this game for free
B0072OFM28|4.0|I hope that most of you that are writing reviews etc... do realize that the writers and directors are this awesome show is playing history and quiet well actually.The show is awesome and do have to agree with most Andy did a wonderful job acting as Spatacus and Liam is doin well concidering the shoes he had to fill. I just hope this show continues till the end as to where Spatacus actually did die.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like games like this. I've been playing all the story apps here lately and I actually enjoy this one just as much. I just wish it was easier to get energy quickly.
B0055SWM08|5.0|please get this app and see how amazing it is! rate it as 5 stars because it is worth it! if the creater is reader this, then a thumbs up to you because your app is awesome!!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I didn't want a backpack that would showcase brand names on the outside making it look obvious what's in the bag. This backpack is perfect. no complaints. Backpack has enough padding and very comfortable to carry around. Should straps are nice and well padded. You can customize the inside which makes it easy for you to carry your camera and lenses. Excellent product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is just right. It's like mario but not. Next to mario and sonic this is one of my most favorite platformers of all time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a great game. Much like Mario brothers. but you have to rate it five stars to keep playing after so long so that's probley why peaple are doing it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a fun game to play and I hope I beet it. I hope they make other games similar games that come out soon
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really fun. Just like Mario Bros. I actually like it better than Mario Bros. I love the graphics &amp; illustrations too. And of course, Lep, the adorable leprachaun ( sorry if misspelled ) you get to play.<br />Overall, I give it 5 stars. Great job, NER Brothers!
0142413860|4.0|There are lots of funny, fun, frantic, colorful, silly books out there to tickle your young reader's fancy. But a calm, sepia toned, gentle tale also has its place on the shelf. And this one works without strain or any false notes. It's a nice change of pace, and sort of a mood piece, but for the right kid at the right time it could make a strong positive impression.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the best free app that Ive purchased so far for my kindle fire. very entertaining and fun. I highly recommend it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have downloaded quite a few apps since I decided to buy a kindle fire.. but I really enjoy this one..I'd liketo see the old Oregon trail though
B0055SWM08|4.0|Enjoyable puzzle game with pleasant visuals and pleasing mechanics. The achievements are fun as well. The only negative I have is that it is a bit easy for a puzzle game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very nice game. I love how you earn your hints and it gets more of a challenge as you go along. I love how I got this game free (free paid app of the day). I enjoy this game. It is unique, not like other games trying to copy other famous games, for example, angry birds.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is fun and challenging as well as social and creative all together it is just wonderful lfor all ages no matter how old it will surely bring a smile to your face.
0345803485|1.0|I am seriously baffled as to how this book has gotten such rave reviews.  It is written with the eloquence of a 6th grader and the sexual proficiency of an inexperienced, horny church mom.  I am equally astounded that anyone could consider this book to be literary porn...how can a 21 year old female who never refers to her vagina as anything more graphic than \\"down there\\" elicit any naughty feelings??  Most of the sexual narrative would read more naturally from a sex ed textbook than an erotic novel.  Aside from the disappointing and cringe worthy content, the writing itself is just so painfully terrible it's hard to believe it could've gotten past any publisher.  There were occasions where the lexicon was so repetitive, I would have to stop to make sure I wasn't accidentally rereading the previous sentence.  Basically 30% of the writing is devoted to letting you know when Ana is blushing, gasping, or \\"unnerved\\" every time Christian \\"smiles wryly\\" or \\"grins devilishly\\" always looking \\"slightly amused\\" by her naïvet&eacute;.  I wish I would've known this spawned from Twilight fanfic before I'd bought it.  Don't waste the $9.99.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Ive read some complaints that this book was marketed wrong and that the book was not what people expected. I can see how that might bother some people but in the end all I care about is that its a John Grisham book. Some of his books havent been the greatest but the moajority of the time they are SO GOOD. This book is no exception.<br /><br />I loved the small town intimate story and enjoyed reading about all the different subtleties in all the characters. I totally believe that this sort of situation could happen in the small town in the deep south. I love stories that invlove a character that gets caught up in something larger than themselves and cant turn their back on what's right. Willie is just that kind of character. LOVED THIS BOOK!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is great for daily devotions but drags a little if trying to use during live bible study where you need to swap from one book to another quickly.  I love being able to change between different translations. It makes for a deeper understanding of the verse.
B004EN8KE2|2.0|I completely agree with the other reviewers about the reader.  Her voice is much too old for the character.  I want to add that my biggest problem with her is that she gives every single sentence a ton of weight.  Even sentences that should be lighthearted or quick get drawn... out... with dramatic... emphasis.  I want to listen to the book on my walks so I can use my actual reading time for other things, but I might need to give up.<br /><br />I'm enjoying the actual story, though.  I'll probably pick up the book to finish it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have purchased these before in the stores, but they are getting harder and harder to find.  For some reason people prefer those uncomfortable ear buds that always seem to fall out, are too big, and just annoying.  These headphones are not big and silly looking like standard head phones.  They are pretty discrete (can wear them at work), dont hurt, and work wonderfully when you are active like jogging, doing house work, and yard work.<br />love them.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I tryed uploading my photo but it wouldn't let me -_- and I basically just wasted my money on ot
B007SSDDWE|3.0|If you want to just sit down & watch a movie without thinking or missing anything, this is the movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you are looking for a mindless game that is fun, then this is the game for you to play and enjoy.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.<br /><br />The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant \\"X\\" gene.

B0059XTUVI|4.0|That THE IRON LADY ultimately fails as a great movie is puzzling.  Despite the great performance by Meryl Streep portraying the larger than life Margaret Thatcher, one of the most important political players of the 20th century, the story remains spotty and unsatisfying despite evidence that it is trying so very hard. Abi Morgan is responsible for the screenplay that does indeed offer individual scenes with touch moments but lets the overall sweep of the film in tatters.  Phyllida Law directs.<br /><br />For reference, `Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, PC, FRS, n&eacute;e Roberts (born 13 October 1925) is a British politician and the longest-serving (1979-1990) British prime minister of the 20th century, and the only woman ever to have held the post. A Soviet journalist nicknamed her the \\"Iron Lady\\", which later became associated with her uncompromising policies. As prime minister, she implemented conservative policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.'  Where the film take us is to view Thatcher (Meryl Streep) as elderly and a virtual prisoner in her own home due to her concerned staff and daughter Carol (Olivia Colman). She looks back on her life as she clears out her late husband Denis's (Jim Broadbent) clothes for the Oxfam shop. Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premeireship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margaret's life forever.<br /><br />Streep's ability to convey the mental deterioration of this lady is a triumph of moderation: she never imitates Alzheimer's disease but instead allows us to view senility in a new way. The cast is large and there are some good performances by some of England's finest actors.  But somehow the events during Thatcher's rise to the role as England's first woman Prime Minister and all the events (Falkland war, fall of the Berlin wall, etc) just seem like addenda.  Even the usual fine music composer Thomas Newman fails in his task to create a memorable score (except for the inclusion of Maria Callas singing `Casta diva' from Bellini's `Norma' and excerpts of Bach from the Well Tempered Clavier). It is a showcase for Meryl Streep and she handles her end of the project well indeed.

B007549W62|2.0|I confess I did not like this story. It is marketed as a horror story, but I think a drama would be a better description.<br /><br />What it is, is an unrelated small group of people manage to get in time into an atomic bomb shelter during a nuclear blast. The original plan is to wait out the nuclear blast. However, they get locked in by some scavengers and more importantly a few start to go crazy. I hope it is not a real image of people as I like to think in times of extreme danger people come together and do not go crazy like, for example, miners trapped in a mine or inmates in German Death camps. Overall, I think the story starts off very good, half way I was really enjoying it, but then it drifted off into pointlessness.<br /><br />The characterizations itself are reasonable. The acting is good.<br /><br />The filming and special effects are reasonable for such a movie.<br /><br />I would, however, not see it again nor do I recommend it, mainly because I do not like the story.

Watership Down is intellectually engaging and enjoyable for any age. I believe that is a remarkable achievement. Read this book!

015670160X|3.0|Orlando is a charming and endearing book. it is certainly a beautiful love letter. However, it may mean more to the person it is written about than to us. Personally, I found the plot to be a constraint. Virginia Woolf's earlier books are also constrained by plot and she is at her best when she discards it or uses it only loosely enough to allow her sprawling style to make sense. Orlando, for me, is too caught up in the gender and time changes. Perhaps the book can be read while subtly ignoring these aspects and experiencing the book sentence by sentence (like in The Waves say). However, that might not be doing this book justice either. Perhaps I simply did not understand or buy into the premise of the book or some of the plot details. But I would recommend any other Woolf book I have read over this one.

I guess what happens at the T.T. stays at the T.T.. That posh coating of circa \\"the tweens\\" on the original classic aside, this version is rather fun, full of great special effects and even has some reasonably good acting for a few frames, minus Toni. \\"Oh Muriel, you're horrible\\". Kudos to David Tennant that makes an excellent Peter Vincent. Also surprising is young Anton Yelchin pulling off a decent, but not great, Chuck Brewster. But comparing any performance in this to those by William Ragsdale, Stephen Geoffreys, and Roddy McDowall in the original is like comparing fine wine to Thunderbird.

0307719219|3.0|The ideas presented by the authors are important, and need to be taken to heart. However, I found the book to be poorly written, and I had lost patience with it by the half-way point, although I persevered all the way through.<br /><br />The book reads as if the authors had collated a number of previously published papers, with a light attempt at integration. However, the attempt is very light. The result is lots of repetition, as previous reviewers have noted. More annoying is that the authors give plenty of examples to support their arguments. Even though some of the examples are repeated over and over (e.g. Britaqin's take-off was strongly influenced by the Glorious Revolution of 1688) the authors hardly ever go into any detail (we are not told the details of the Glorious Revolution or why it mattered until a half-hearted attempt near the end of the book). The examples are typically one or two throw-away sentences.<br /><br />Even worse is the lack of \\"pin-point\\" references.Instead of the usual references, the authors furnish a bibliographic essay. Thus, for support of a given argument they might cite a three-hunder-page book. If I am puzzled by something they say, because it runs against what I had previously believed, I have to rummage through a three-hunderd-page book to see what supporting evidence they are using. I'm sure this was meant to be less intimidating for th general reader, but it sure frustrated me.<br /><br />Finally, while the ideas here are imprtant, they aren't all that new. For example, the idea that political institutions have a big impact on economic growth was very forcefully expressed a decade ago by Hernando de Soto in The Mystery of Capital, a book that I find better executed, although perhaps not as wide-ranging.
0307592731|3.0|This is a memoir written by a person in her late thirties about events which occurred in her mid-twenties.  The conceit of writing a memoir so young cannot fail but to present problems for the sophisticated reader.  Cheryl Strayed's latest, \\"Wild,\\" suffers from this fundamental problem.  Ms. Strayed has a beautiful, lyrical voice.  Her use of language is occasionally breathtaking, and almost always evocative.  There is no question:  she has a gift.  But at about midway through the book, I found myself irritated and bored.  I think the events of her life would more appropriately be the subject of a series of short stories.    Like the Pacific Crest Trail at the supposed heart of this tale, the plot was long, bumpy, repetitive, and exhausting.  It seemed to go on forever, revisiting the same themes relentlessly. No real insight, no awakening, no enlightment was forthcoming.    And so we arrive at the basic difficulty:  at thirty something, one attains a modicum of experience, a bit of wisdom.  Nothing more.  And that story can be told quickly.  The very best memoirs, those which have changed my life, have all been written by men and women in their fifties and beyond.  Not only have they taken a few laps around the track, but they have insight, and a long view of the events of their lives.    Everything about \\"Wild\\" suffers from a failure of perspective.  From beginning to end, Ms. Strayed (who gave herself that last name after her divorce at 24, further illustrating the point) never takes a long view, and never teaches us anything, except that one should not overpack or buy one's boots too small for a solo, months-long hike.  If she'd waited to write this until she was in her fifties, I bet it would be a hell of a tale about more than just a long walk.    Read the first half, though.  There are gorgeous bits to savor.  And keep your eye on Cheryl, who may one day have the chops to change her last name to Wise.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I really fell in love with this one. With the advent of instant global communication and the wealth of information that's available at the speed of thought today, the focus of our collective interest in sports has shifted and deepened. While the contests will always be the main focus, rightly, there's also a sweeping undercurrent of interest in the games behind the games. Player swaps, contract negotiations, deep statistical analysis; these are as formidable an arsenal for the modern team as a bat and glove, and it's about time Hollywood made the effort to examine that fundamental shift. Moneyball does it exceptionally well, delving into the theories and risks behind this new way of thinking without going too far into the realm of obsessive over-explanation. As the team's roster and strategies begin to change shape and coalesce, the film shifts into something larger than a mere underdog sports story, interpersonal drama or heady mathematical essay. It's all of those things and more, with an ambitiously large toolbox and the confident knowledge of how to most efficiently use each implement: an evolution of sports-themed material on film. It's the rare film that non-fans can enjoy just as much as season ticket holders, and a justified candidate for the Oscars' top honor.

The authors Nic Madge, a circuit judge and founder member of the Housing Law Practitioners' Association has, together with his colleague Claire Sephton, refer to it as `hard law' and, for most practitioners it certainly is, and for a number of reasons explained in the book's excellent introduction.<br /><br />It's also hard law, explain the authors, `because of the effect that housing cases can have on people', from economic deprivation to personal bitterness to the agony of homelessness and its attendant problems.<br /><br />For barristers, solicitors as well as housing managers, housing advisers and students, here is a casebook from the admirable Legal Action Group which provides valuable guidance in this fraught area.  Completely updated for 2012, this new fifth edition, presents within its more than 1,200 pages, a comprehensive statement of what is happening with housing law today in the courts.<br /><br />As these are real cases that are related therein, one needn't be reminded that the book deals not with the theoretical, but the demonstrably practical applications of the law in housing matters which are very useful in court.<br /><br />Yes, the book confronts you with grim realities.  This is a common law book of housing, revealing real issues, real people, real confrontations and conflict and of course the judicial decisions resulting from each case. Conveniently for the practitioner, each case is introduced with a short sentence summary followed by a succinct narrative of the essential facts.  This practical, factual approach is from the point of view of the practitioner, the key value of the book.<br /><br />Speaking of convenience, the books offers a number of features designed to make life easier for experienced and inexperienced  practitioners alike, each equally hard pressed for time.  Logically divided into twenty chapters, the book deals with the full spectrum of housing issues, from human rights and housing, to tenancies to possession procedure, to harassment and illegal eviction to mortgage possession proceedings and homelessness... and, of course, much more.  It's fair to say that the book provides, in one place, virtually all the cases you might need to refer to, which means you as an adviser have direct access to any number of useful examples of the ways in which the law is interpreted and disputes resolved in practice.<br /><br />This useful and easily navigable -- as well as affordable -- book  also provides extensive resources for your further research, including tables of complaints and investigations, cases, statutes and statutory instruments, as well as a table of European legislation, plus a detailed index of almost 100 pages at the back.<br /><br />If you're a lawyer, or say, a voluntary adviser, or employed in a relevant area by a local authority, you would do well to acquire this book, which is also available in electronic format.

If you don't like this album, then you really can't call yourself a music fan.<br /><br />Here's what this album represents for me: imagine taking a day trip on a bus with friends for some sightseeing.  It's a nice, sunny, cool afternoon.  You stop off at a small pub in an out-of-the-way town for a late, leisurely lunch.

You've never heard the songs before, but they immediately sound good and even catchy.  At least one, \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\", you swear must have been a hit song that somehow escaped your notice.  The songs aren't \\"polished\\" in the usual sense, and sound almost improvised; the lyrics are vague and abstract; and the singer has a nontraditional but very passionate way of singing.  But the sum of all these things combines to be greater than the parts, and make it the most powerful performance you think you ever heard.  \\"Sweet Thing\\" and \\"Madame George\\" especially.  Lunch over, you climb back on the bus and head home.  The playing is over and the effect is fading, and you can't even remember precisely how the songs went, but you are left with an ethereal, warm memory and a happy glow from the beautiful moment in time and space you've just witnessed.<br /><br />And the best thing?  This is a recorded album, and you can feel that feeling over and over again whenever you want.<br /><br />Breaking down the album further, there's basically 4 categories of songs, listed from least good to best:<br /><br />1.  The Fillers: \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" and \\"Ballerina\\" - I feel somewhat bad describing these as fillers, but what I mean is they are the songs that stand out least.  That said, they definitely have the same \\"feel\\" as the rest of the album, which makes them more than pleasant to listen to.  But that's sort of all they have.  \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" is really nothing but a standard blues structure: repeat a lyric twice, then alter it the third time.  Nothing new there.  And the lyrics themselves aren't all that great - basically just a \\"I'm hanging out on the street hoping to get laid\\" kind of thing.  Van's singing isn't all that memorable, either.  The only good thing is the musicians playing around the edges, which is great but not enough to make the song truly stand out.  \\"Ballerina\\" is a little better, since it's got an original verse/chorus structure.  But the lyrics aren't that impressive either - basically \\"hey pretty baby keep on being so pretty\\".  The musicians do a better job making this stick in your head, so it's the better of the two songs.  But the combo of unimpressive structure, lyrics, and singing makes them the least good of the album.<br /><br />2.  The Love Songs: \\"Sweet Thing\\" and \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\" - It says a lot about this amazing album that the catchiest track isn't even in the top tier of its songs.  Chances are new listeners will like \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\" best, which is good since it's beautiful.  It's \\"mainstream\\" in the sense it has a standard verse/chorus/bridge arrangement, and as I said it's just beautiful.  It's about young passionate lovers and it's a tribute to any true love affair.  \\"Sweet Thing\\" is more Astral Weeks-y, in that it had a vague structure and lyrics, but it also is beautiful and the lyrics will stand out in your brain long afterwards - \\"I'll never grow so old again\\".  Van Morrison shows how true musicians write love songs.  And there's nothing I've ever heard that's as touching as the Astral Weeks way of doing love songs.  Just so wonderful and moving and lovely.  You'll just let out a sigh in appreciation.<br /><br />3.  The Bookends: \\"Astral Weeks\\" and \\"Slim Slow Slider\\" - The first and last songs on an album have important roles to play.  The opener has to set the mood and entice the listener, and the closer has to leave them wanting more, or at least leave them with a memorable impression.  These two songs succeed on both counts.  \\"Astral Weeks\\" starts off the album with a great mid-tempo beat, and the first words (\\"If I venture into the slipstream\\") have that awesome rock bravado quality to them.  It tells you you're listening to someone who has deep and urgent emotions to express.  So deep and urgent they need to keep uttering vague phrases like \\"In another time/in another place\\" and hope you'll understand.  But you will understand what he means, on a subconscious level if nothing else.  \\"Slim Slow Slider\\" is in many ways the precise opposite of \\"Cyprus Avenue\\".  It too has a blues structure, but it uses it effectively by being short and having stark, arresting lyrics that make you sit up and listen.  \\"I know you're dying baby/and I know you know it too\\" - wow.  The dissonant soprano sax way off in the background, and the closing flourish of percussion, makes this a powerful and striking end piece that will make you pause and think.<br /><br />4.  The Showpieces: \\"Beside You\\" and \\"Madame George\\" - Most every review of this album zeroes in on \\"Madame George\\" as a truly great track in the history of rock, and they aren't wrong.  But I think \\"Beside You\\" is even better.  The song is sad and haunting, and although they are vague, the lyrics make you FEEL, that's for sure.  Maybe they make you feel more because they seem so obscure.  I don't know, but they are true poetry anyway.  Van's singing is the most incredible part - try reading the words and imagining how to sing this; it's hard to even picture it.  But Van makes it sound easy.  \\"Madame George\\" is really the perfect blend of all elements of this great album.  Memorable lyrics, catchy song arrangement, excellent singing by Van, and the musicians adding on to make it have that extra something.  Everything is burning equally well on all cylinders, which is really saying something for these collection of words and music.  It all comes together perfectly, and that's probably why this song stands out as the favorite of so many.<br /><br />Wow, what an amazing album.  So sad that something this good can fly virtually under the radar.  Why this can't sell millions instead of some pop idol manufactured by record executives is beyond me.  But the makers of Astral Weeks were singing about deeper truths, so maybe it's all fitting, when you think about it.  But you will think, and that's maybe what's so amazing about this.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome game, very simple, and addictive gameplay and I love playing the game and trying to get a perfect score
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun challenge, but not too hard. Good graphics and music. Once of my favorite puzzle games. Hope they make more.
B0010T0JC4|5.0|I am very pleased with these shoes.  They are light and comfortable.  I am a size 8 1/2 and went by what I read somewhere in the description or a review by ordering an 8.  That was a mistake.  I had to re-order and get a 9.  I have been wearing them for 3 week now, 40 hours a weeks and love them.  My only concern is how well they will hold up.  But so far no complaints!
B0055SWM08|5.0|You can try to play quickly, but I enjoy visualizing the solutions. Nice and pleasant time with increasing difficulty. Great free game.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love this book... it truly has you captivated from the very beginning. You do not want to put it down. I read it and then went right back and started it all over again. I find it is the first book I go to when I want to re-read a book. I just cannot get enough of this book. I love this author... and all of her books. They never disappoint!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love it! Built in alerted that help you remember your crops. Runs smoothly on mingle fire. I would definately download it again!
0399536108|5.0|While I don't agree with his pushing of the \\"positive-thinking\\" idealism that is exposed for what it is in [[ASIN:0312658850 Bright-Sided: How Positive Thinking Is Undermining America]], this book has some really good things to say concerning personal choices, goals and how to live a life that is uniquely yours. It encourages you to be the best you that you can be and I think that this book has a very Thelemic message at it's underpinnings, even if the author is a Christian. Yes, I would definitely say that this book can truly help you \\"Manifest thy Glory\\".
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome, addictive puzzle game. Easy to get through the levels, but requires a lot more thinking to get them all perfect.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing &amp; simple puzzle game. Wonderfully designed. I love it...perfect for kindle fire...for five minute stretches that turn into hours.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Is a nice time killer, but there are some things I think would make it better. It would be nice to not automatically go to the next stage as soon as its unlocked. Also, using two hints solves the puzzle, which is great, but maybe having an option to use 1 hint and just be shown the next move would be nice.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. It's beautiful, serene and calming, while being horribly addictive. The gameplay is original (at least to me) and the soundtrack is wonderful.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this book, it was very well written and she made you feel as if you were there with her, going through some of the things she went through. It was never bogged down with to much detail and the story had a good flow to it. Thank you for sharing your story with us!
B0055SWM08|5.0|at first the puzzles seem very simple, but they are actually teaching you how to play. it soon gets very challenging and makes you think the puzzles in different ways so you can get that perfect score.
1907590137|4.0|Simple, short \\"how to\\" info - knew what I was getting since I previously owned the booklet. The advice works. Have used the techniques for years - from memory. Didn't want to test my recall any more. Which brings me to Amazon's(?) shipping policies.  I ordered 2 booklets (which weighed approx. 3ozs and measured 5\\"x8\\"x1/4\\"thick - combined); and they were sent usps in a single mailing envelope. The shipping cost to me was based on 2 shipments, when it was sent as one - at a distance of less than 200 miles (which took 11 days to arrive). If I had sent them anywhere in the USA under the same cover it would have cost me less than half the single shipment charge. When the seller/shipper was confronted with these facts, I was told that the overcharges were to pay for any shipping losses they might accrue in other book sales. As a small businessman, I never realized 'ripoffs' were so easily explained.
B007G5GYHA|4.0|You know what to expect and you know why you are watching this movie, so you won't be disappointed.  Very entertaining, good story line, and great new charactors. But nearly as good as the very Original Shrek.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has an exemplary soundtrack, it is also extremely addictive. Who knew rolling a raindrop around could be so fun
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a good time user upper. you slice threw fruits and can change themes by compleeting tasks. it makes me feel good when i get a higher score than my freinds, so that proves it is good for competitions.

0316044695|5.0|Amazing. Mr. Luttrell is a hero - enough said. But I do want to say The Lone Survivor was a very impressive book. I both laughed out loud and sobbed while reading (and after)... But I was left with true admiration for he and all of those involved in Operation Redwing. A true great that I'll read over and over again.

044042321X|3.0|I am a big fan of the books and the previous graphic novels (Hedge Knight, Hedge Knight II), so I was very excited to hear about about this effort.<br /><br />What I like about it:<br />They are going through the books, chapter by chapter, in a way that the TV series does not. Fans of the books will enjoy how closely the graphic novel follows Martin's wonderful books. Moreover, it is clear that the creative team behind this graphic novel series is trying to be faithful to the look and feel of the books. The rendering of the Iron Throne is quite good.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />I don't care for the artist. His characters look alike and it is sometimes difficult to tell who is who. It looks like he drew quite a bit of this in quick order...as the artwork is not polished and his characters to not maintain a consistent look. Again, as a fan of the earlier graphic novels, I was expecting a level of artwork that exceeds what can be found here. Mike S. Miller did some of the cover art for this graphic novel series, but he wasn't chosen as the primary artist. G.R.R. Martin writes an intro for this graphic novel and basically says that they went with a cheaper artist. Sad. Miller had a good feel for Westeros and it is his artwork that I often think of when I read the books. Here's hoping they spend the extra coin to get Miller for the rest of the series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are a very good read with many plot twists and turns. I am 85% thru them and still can't see how the plot will end. Supposed to be teen reading, but I am 75 years of age and cannot put the books down. My Amazon Kindle is an amazing device.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|After reading the reviews regarding this app, I decided to delete it right after D/L it. I shoulda read reviews first. The privacy concerns alone made up my mind for me. Sad, ' cause i've been looking foward<br />to using it.
0385534639|1.0|Opinions about this book fall into two camps - adverse and glowing. I'm in the first group. I disliked this self-indulgent story, with its lack of narrative drive and its too-frequent chopping and changing of the timeline. The shortness of many of the chapters - flashing back and forth in time - contributed to the broken impression. The love story is utterly predictable and there is overuse of flowery language. Many chapters and scenes added nothing to the narrative. In the end - actually, before the end - I gave it up. The best thing about the book is the cover design and the binding (I bought the hardback version, which I'll give away). The novel has benefited from marketing spin: but unfortunately this spin has been used to promote a book that does not warrant the attention. One star is a generous evaluation.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun, low key logic game.  I love the relaxing music.  The concepts are simple yet the levels still offer challenge.

B005NQ94LM|3.0|Promoted as a romantic comedy, there's little humor in this attempt at adding a twist to the age old story of two people \\"meant for each other.\\" The film opens in current time showing a young woman on a bicycle navigating through traffic but quickly cuts back to 1988.  Dex (Jim Sturgess) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are college classmates in England who barely know each other but go drinking the night of their graduation.  Em is a bit dorky with her giant horn-rimmed glasses and equally giant underwear.  Dex is a campus stud who is still interested.  Both have been drinking.  Their attempt at copulation is unfulfilled for a variety of reasons, but mostly Emma's shyness and uncertainty.  Eventually they agree to cuddle but no sex and remain friends.<br /><br />Each year they get together on July 15, so the film takes us to each of those year where we get to experience their current life's situation.  Dex becomes a TV host of a dance club show and cavorts with numerous bimbos.  Emma's career of writing never takes off so she is stuck at a Mexican restaurant for years before becoming a teacher.  At some point, Dex becomes less attractive and relies on booze to get him through.  Emma of course becomes quite the looker.<br /><br />Most audiences will know where this movie is going before even turning on the TV.  None of this is new.  Frankly it's just aggravating.  Eventually what we know will happen does, but when we check the DVD player's clock and remember that opening sequence we know that the show isn't over.  Hathaway always gives a fine performance and does so here.  Sturgess is excellent as well, but this move is so maudlin and predictable I just wanted to get on with it and cut out about 5 of those yearly reunions.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film looks very good.  Transferred in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film contrast and black levels are excellent.  No complaints.  The audio is in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Surround activity is pretty good but rare.  Expect some action coming from crowd scenes, restaurants and bars.  Dialog is clear and concise.  Again, no complaints.t rare.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a very entertaining puzzle game that is also calming due to the Zen music playing in the background.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised w/ this game. The music, graphics &amp; overall experience of this game is awesome! easily one of my favorites, even over angry birds!
B0036D7Y20|5.0|This is a great recording of Lohengrin. All the singers are top notch, and though it is an older recording, it definitely is worth purchasing.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Bonnie Raitt is hands down one of the greatest living legends of all time.  She proves once again with this incredible album that she gets even better with age and experience.  After being in the public eye for over forty years she is showing no sign of quitting or slowing down.  And are we not all fortunate for this?  Every track here is a master piece, and definitely worth more than a few listens, for those who are new to her music, do yourselves a favor, and listen to the way it is supposed to be done. Thanks Miss Raitt for being as great as you are.
0385342063|3.0|I've Got Your Number<br />By Sophie Kinsella<br /><br />Poppy Wyatt is on cloud nine her life seems perfect, perfect fianc&eacute;, perfect job, perfect engagement ring, until Poppy loses her ring then everything starts to fall apart. As Poppy is frantically searching for the missing ring someone steals her cell phone but luck is on her side when she continues the hunt and comes across a perfectly good cell phone that someone has tossed the trash. This unexpected surprise leads to changing her life forever when she comes in contact with the phones owner Sam Roxton.<br />Though this was a funny and well written book, I couldn't truly enjoy it. Poppy comes off as vapid and flakey constantly changing her mind about who and what she wants and even whether or not she should stand up for herself. I think if the main character had been a bit more self-reliant the book may have gone over better with me. Then there were the footnotes, I know they were meant to be comical and actually had a point in the story but they began to be a bit tedious and annoying in the end. It wasn't a terrible book like I said there were funny moments that gave me a chuckle it was just not my cup of tea.
B0055SWM08|5.0|my brain hurts from all the possibilities. it never gets old and its just all around fun. i encourage others to play it.
0738727326|4.0|Very cool deck, i didnt expect such an accuracy in images and such decor and elegance. The illustrations are very magical, animals are the main subject in this deck. Women will like this especially ;)
072325804X|5.0|An heirloom quality treasure, with a beautifully illustrated slipcase. This collection of Beatrix Potter is marvelous, and complete. The illustrations, from the originals, are absolutely magnificent. They will make you, and your young readers, smile. Even the paper quality is heavier, as in children's books of years ago.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is actually pretty good. I grew up on playing the origonal mario game my dad would cheat and get the 99 lives for me and I'd stillnget a game over ahh good times. so I recommend this game as aneally fun time spender
B0053KWDES|5.0|if u own a pair of headphones worth anything then u need a headphone amp. i never realized what i was missing until i plugged this inbetween my ipod touch and my audio technica ath-pro700mk2. it was a mindbending thing. how this device can change the personality of my headphones soo immensely. theres an urgency in the way my headphones perform now. it lasts me several hours, i hate having to charge it because its soo slow to charge but oh well.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This is actually a fun game kinda like farmville was but takes too long 4 energy to generate. On top of that today it froze up on me n items that I was waiting four minutes for turned into 104hrs!!!! Uninstalling...
B0072PUC7W|5.0|really enjoying it. a couple really really good tracks. i love how most of armin van buren's stuff comes in multi discs. u get alot of music for a very acceptable price. i appreciate the discs as opposed to mp4's simply because i like the tangibility, a hardcopy disc, so if ur ipod and comp crashes its always here, plus the album artwork and stuff is kinda cool to have
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I never rate a game 5 stars!!! This game is awesome!!!!! Its EXCACTLY like Super Mario Bros!!! My older cousin is addicted to Mario so when I showed it to him he went all Mario on me and beat me. He got it 4 his dads iPad and plays it like 24/7!!! I LUV this game!!!<br /><br />HAHA MADE U SCROLL!!
B000ERU5EK|4.0|i wish it was a double disc. because its a GREAT disc, very good. like it better than anjuna beats. simply wish there was another in the same packaging. kuz it wasnt as cost effective as anjuna beats for instance of any other double disc.  but still worth it and im glad i picked it up
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I don't know what else to say except I LOVED this book.  Two days after finishing and I'm still thinking about it and I implore the author to pleaaaasseee hurry with book two! I can't stand the suspense.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva....what can I say?  These two are hot! Off the charts hot! Gideon, you are definitely in my top 5 favourite male characters that's for sure! You are one serious hot man! Eva...wow, she sizzles and helloooo, a fc with a backbone, who's fiesty and doesn't play the victim.  IT was a pleasure to spend time with these two!<br /><br />They do have a lot of baggage from their past that needs to be worked through.  The question is asked \\"can two dysfunctional people have a functional relationship\\".  Geez, for their sake you hope so because these two are soul mates - damn hot, sexy soulmates at that!<br /><br />I loved the secondary characters and the whole past creeping up on them had me riveted.<br /><br />I was up till the wee small hours of the morning glued to this book.  Even though I had to get up at 4am...by 2am I was cursing the fact I needed to sleep - sure fire sign of a great read for me.<br /><br />Sure, there will be Fifty comparisons. It seems that every book these days post Fifty that has anythine remotely similar is being hit unfairly with the \\"copy of Fifty\\" tag.  Whilst yes, I can see where people would draw that comparison, this book is in NO WAY a Fifty rip off and I can't emphasise that enough.  This book stands alone as a fantastic, gritty, sexy, hot and emotional read that had me consumed.<br /><br />Can't recommend this book enough.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I understand this isn't a \\"collectors item box set\\", but for someone who's obsessive about Harry Potter [whether it be only book based, or movie based, OR BOTH] I would recommend purchasing this set. My only conflict with the set is that the fourth movie [Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire] was damaged and I was unable to watch it. It's terribly sad, considering that The Goblet of Fire is my favorite movie out of all eight, but it's 100% okay because my friend went to Walmart and purchased a new one for me [for only 2$!]. But for the price of this set, you can't honestly assume something like that is completely unlikely. Either way, purchase this set for all fans! No matter what age!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was as entertaining and easy to read as everyone else has said. Hard to put it down... a real page turner (err... 'next' button clicker for us Kindle folk). I did feel the ending was a bit quick compared to the rest of the book. Looking forward to reading the others in this series as well as seeing the movie now.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game does what it looks like it does- it's a puzzle game. I'm not too good at puzzle games but I don't doc it for that. It's got smooth graphics and  simple but effective game mechanics and is overall pretty good. The soundtrack is good and such but somehow I found it depressing and it's put me in an existential mood as I look at the dates of the various stages and consider humanity. Ah oh well...<br /><br />It's a great game. Just play it casually.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this apposite great. I use it every morning on my kindle fire. it is very useful. the one thing I would changeis the ring tones some ofnthem seem not to work. but I the thong I amazes me ia that the volume increases volume!!:)
B002RZCQCQ|4.0|This is a highly underrated movie.  I rented it to watch with my nephew, and we both enjoyed it very much. However, the sound quality was terrible for some reason.  I saw the movie in theaters years ago, and I don't recall missing half of the dialogue because it was too low to hear.  Without that nuisance, the movie was great and altogether enjoyable.  I'm not sure if the audio was a problem with Amazon or not, so I hesitate to jump to that conlcusion.  But it sure would have been better to hear more of the film!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I will admit when I first started reading this book it made me think of an episode of the tv show life unexpected, it was only a two season show but the scenerio in which much of the book was based around was almost identical. I wont give it away but I was really hooked on that show. This book was that and so much more. I am not trashing the author (I gave it 5 stars) This booked totally sucked me in from the first page. Yea, to self publishing for being able to make so many of these wonderful books available.<br />I will also mention I had never heard of the Avett brothers band but now I am a huge fan! Read the book,download the music get into the whole experience, it will take you places usually found only in your fondest dreams of first love.<br /><br />Judy Fraley azell54@gmail.com
1609611543|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that scared me badly enough to do someting about my lifestyle, but \\"Wheat Belly\\" certainly did that.  Before I had even finished reading, I was going through my pantry and removing everything with wheat and wheat derivatives in it.  The food pantry in town is very happy to receive such donations, and believe me, it was a nice big pile.<br /><br />Anybody who has \\"mysterious\\" maladies that simply don't respond to conventional care should read this book and take heart.  This knowledge is a great source of hope for individuals who have tried EVERYTHING with nil results.  Dr. Davis should be a research scientist. The book is very thoroughly researched, and the references are voluminous, to say the least.  There should be no doubt in anybody's mind by the time they finish this volume that the author knows what he's talking about.

031617615X|5.0|I had to read this book after reading the others. I couldn't help myself. I've loved them all so much but didn't want it to end. Still I enjoyed this book immensely. I loved the insight into Jacob's thoughts and while I understand why many don't like Jacob, I actually like him. I now understand why he was so attached to Bella and the \\"supernatural\\" issues surrounding it.<br /><br />As always, I loved Alice. There was a moment when I was stunned beyond belief and seriously thought she's left the story but I should have known that Alice is always awesome.<br /><br />I loved the interaction with Charlie in this book. It was great to see his reaction to things. Also loved the new character Nessie as she was adorable. I also enjoyed all the witnesses that came into their lives especially Garrett.<br /><br />The plot twists in this book could really make for cheesiness and I'm thinking that might be why my friends were so hard on the book but I loved every second. It felt like the happily ever after Bella and Edward deserved and because this is a unknown world of things that go bump in the night, there is no telling what can happen.<br /><br />I enjoyed Rosalie's involvement in everything and Emmett's excitement with arm wrestling and teaching fighting. I liked that Carlisle seemed to have more of a roll and you actually got to see him as the head of the family because with all the character interaction you start thinking that Alice and Edward are the most important and influential in the family. As for the wolves, like I said I like Jacob and I love Seth but I started to feel for Leah. I almost thought there would be a imprinting thing with her and Jacob but in that I was surprised.<br /><br />I really think this book was great and I'm telling you it is so worth it along with the rest of the series!!!

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have just downloaded this game it was boring at first but then it turned out to be vary good after while.<br /><br />best game ever!
030788743X|5.0|I loved it!  Wow!  This is a fun, no-stop-thrills adventure that kept me glued to my iPod!  Here's the setup:  The story unfolds in a dystopian future in which the majority of the population is poor, homeless, and miserable.  Most therefore choose to escape from their daily lives by immersing themselves as avatars in a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), known as `The Oasis'.  The eccentric deceased creator of the game has willed his entire fortune (in excess of $200 billion dollars) to whomever is able to solve a certain subset of puzzles within the game.<br /><br />What a brilliant setup!  Consider the implications:  a prize worth $200 billion would tempt not only the usual suspects (teenage geeks), but everybody else as well (including nefarious multi-national corporations).  Thus, with one stroke, Cline sets up a world in which a believable \\"Samson vs. Goliath\\" story can unfold within the context of a \\"Matrix-like\\" society that has come to be dominated by virtual-reality.  Add to this the fact that the game features 80s pop-culture, and you have a winner-of-a-book.<br /><br />A word about that:  80s pop-culture features very prominently in Ready Player One.  In particular, the video games, movies, music, and books of the 80s (in that order of importance) play a pivotal role in the plot.  The more one knows of the decade, the more one will enjoy the book.  If you know absolutely nothing about the 80s, it probably won't be your cup of tea.  But you don't need to know everything.  I probably caught about 50% of the references, and I still thought it was cool.<br /><br />To be sure, this is not highbrow literature.  As other reviewers have noted, the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, the dialogue is cheesy and often juvenile, and the writing is straightforward.  But in my opinion, it *works* because the protagonists are geeky teenagers, and most teenagers (geeks or not) are one-dimensional, cheesy, often juvenile, and straightforward.The \\"trash-talking\\" that goes on when geeks get together to play role-playing games; the passionate melodrama teen love; the desire to see 100-meter-tall robots shoot laser beams out of their eyes to vaporize the bad guys...that's not bad writing...that's an accurate portrayal of a subculture!<br /><br />I normally listen to my audiobooks in the car on the way to and from work.  I have a long commute, so I get two-hours of listening time each day...not enough for this book!  Fortunately, last weekend, I had to power-wash my deck, so I popped on my headphones and got an additional four hours of listening time.  Still not enough!  Only with great restraint was I able to save the final few chapters for the car rides on Monday and Tuesday.  Now I'm sad that it's over.  Definitely the best sci-fi I've read in a long time.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I really like this album. In some places it does in fact sound much like TAAB One. In those places, Anderson somehow infuses a 70's Tull sound into the work. In other places, it's a bit more like an Ian A. solo (the artist is listed as \\"Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson\\"), but the group backing him is quite strong, so in effect it really does sound like Tull overall. Martin Barre is missed, but not to the degree that the album suffers greatly. I'm not clear if the artist is listed as such due to some possible rift with Barre, or if the split is amicable and Anderson just feels it can't be listed as Tull as the Tull name means that Barre is there. Many here have felt Ian A.'s voice is sub-par, but I don't hear that at all. Possibly a little bit less of a range, but the writing works with this. It's a softer voice, but not significantly more nasally than Dot-Com. It's fine. The lyrics address the various possible futures that Gerald Bostock might have lived in the 40 intervening years since TAAB 1. As such, the lyrics in some ways are more mature than on One, and there are certainly more places where I personally identified more with the lyrics than on the first one (which was brilliantly a send-up of British society and a commentary on the times in general  - but as such had little personal/emotional content). \\"What-ifs, maybes and might-have-beens\\" as Ian A. so eloquently puts it. This album to my ears is the strongest Tull album since 1981's \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\". It sounds more like the \\"genuine Tull\\" of old than the many albums since 81. I highly recommend it, and if you like Tull at all this is a must-have.
B0030U1TA2|5.0|Gentle Giant's sixth studio album The Power And The Glory, released in 1974, finds the band delivering a new dimension of their trademark chaotic Progressive Rock style. For some the style may be an acquired taste (the band even named an album in reference to that fact) but anyone interested in Prog Rock should give them at least a chance, and will probably find themselves hooked.<br /><br />The trademark Gentle Giant style is a mixture of complex time signatures, multiple musical changes and interweaving vocal patterns, coupled with excellent drum work that holds the songs together and prevents them from sounding too bizarre. There are all sorts of stringed instruments and tuned percussion mixed in with the rock line up. The msot definitive feature of the band's sound however is a spirit of exploration and variety.<br /><br />The Power And The Glory features some of the band's most interesting lyrics, as it is a concept album telling the story of a leader's rise to power and how it affects them and their people. As with all Gentle Giant music, singer Derek Shulman has an astounding voice (in fact all the members do) and the superb Hendrix influenced wah-solos from guitarist Gary Green lend a great rock flavour to the multifaceted and explorative music.<br /><br />On this album tracks such as 'Cogs In Cogs' and 'So Sincere' push the band's formula into more noisy and dissonant territories than ever before, creating a harsh and heavy listen in places that is refreshing and a little challenging. Luckily however, on tracks such as the stand out opener 'Proclamation' and the haunting ballad 'Aspirations' the band also balance things out with more instantly enjoyable material too, creating a best of both world situation overall.<br /><br />In summary, Gentle Giant are on top form here and deliver a mixture of the hard rocking, the funky, the beautiful and even the down right weird aspects of their sound on occasion. The production is crisp, the lyrics are memorable and the vocals are great. This is a very strong album from one of the genre's finest ever bands in their creative prime. If you like the band this album is an absolute must own.he vocals are great. This is a very strong album from one of the genre's finest ever bands in their creative prime. If you like the band this album is an absolute must own.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of fun.  Addictive.  Lovely graphics and smooth game play.  Excellent tutorial gets you right into the game.  Goes from simple to challenging quickly, but there are hints to help you along the way.
B0032700PS|5.0|Often hailed as Gentle Giant's last good album, or hated for being their first bad album Interview sure does sit uneasily in the Gentle Giant catalogue. Released after the popular Free Hand album in 1976 the concept album based around band interviews is wonderfully produced and the level of skill and musicianship contained within is nothing short of great.<br /><br />I like the album a lot and would recommend giving it a few listens with an open mind before making any judgements. For me, the best songs are the rocking 'I Lost My Head,' and the great 'Empty City.'<br /><br />Throughout the whole album Derek's voice is awesome and the songs are creative and interesting. Where the album sometimes draws criticism however is for being too similar to its aforementioned predecessor Free Hand. Every Gentle Giant album before this had been wildly different from what came before it and so some fans were disappointed that this was comparatively safe.<br /><br />While this may seem true on first listen however, it soon becomes apparent that Interview is an original and well written album. In fact if you haven't heard Free Hand there's really nothing to complain about at all. Gentle Giant's overall aesthetic is there to be enjoyed, that the common link of excellence that can be between all their albums. Furthermore the music is still a lot more diverse, spirited and complex than the majority of other bands and Derek's fantastic voice is still holding up strong eight albums into their career.<br /><br />Overall, Interview is a wonderful album that is often overlooked and if you like Gentle Giant, its worth at least a test listen as you sure could find yourself loving it. If you're new to Gentle Giant perhaps try albums like Free Hand or Octopus before moving on to the likes of Interview but if you are into the band already it is a worthy addition to your collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this entire book in one day I was captivated by this storyline. As I said in my past review of book one for ME the crux is Christian not the sex. I fear so many people will bypass this book because they may be close minded, she touches lightly on the aspects of BDSM a little heavy on the sex which is fine with me but I wanted more Christian dark, damaged, sexy Christian, love the turn of events it takes its almost believable!! Sometimes I lose interest in trilogies because for me they become predictable I thought I had it all figured out until.........I will not spoil things by putting it in the review read it with an open mind and you will fall in love just as I have!!
B0032700Q2|5.0|The Missing Piece was the British Progressive Rock band Gentle Giant's ninth studio album, it was released in 1977 to mixed reviews.<br /><br />For almost a year before I got around to giving this album a fair try I was already a huge Gentle Giant fan, but had been put off buying The Missing Piece because of the preconception that it was the first bad Gentle Giant Album. Compared to all the Gentle Giant albums before it, including the also controversial Interview album, Missing Piece was the one for which I had heard the most negative things about.<br /><br />I was finally convinced after hearing Missing Material played live on their incredible GG At The GG DVD and decided this simply couldn't be as bad an album as the negative reputation it had may have suggested. After a few listens, acclimatising to all the various styles of music on offer it really grew on me. I can understand why people who love the band's most complex and progressive work would dislike it, but I personally enjoy it a lot and would recommend new fans to at least give it a fair try.<br /><br />In my own opinion I would not only go as far as to call it a good album; its pretty much a great album. Highlights include the powerful `For Nobody' and the haunting `Memories of Old Days,' but the whole album is of high quality; with great vocals, funky drumming and great musicianship all around.<br /><br />It may be off-putting at first hearing Gentle Giant playing a punk song or adding a bit of pop into their sound, but firstly it can grow on you and secondly the band always tried new things so I don't view it as anything more than a continuation of that same spirit of exploration that made their earlier work so enjoyable in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, as Prog albums go its a decent one, although perhaps not as progressive as you may expect from this band in particular. As accessible albums by Prog bands go however, it is first class. If you are new to the band maybe try out a few more critically acclaimed albums first, but if you like Gentle Giant I recommend that you don't be put off and consider adding The Missing Piece to your Gentle Giant Collection.ly acclaimed albums first, but if you like Gentle Giant I recommend that you don't be put off and consider adding The Missing Piece to your Gentle Giant Collection.

B007NCT36U|5.0|I listened to this album a couple days before it was officially released, and to be honest at first I was somewhat confused with what was going on in this album. After I listened to the whole album I completely fell in love with what she was doing on here, it also helped that she explained it in an interview, shes basically giving all of her fans what they want!. I don't understand why people are hating on her! shes giving us a little taste of all the multiple sides to her, we have the hardcore rap Nicki (as showed in songs like Champion), The Pop Nicki(Songs like Pound The Alarm), the more sensitive Nicki, with songs like \\"Fire Burns\\", This album is amazing and it basically fits any type of mood that you are in. If you don't like this album then you are crazy and there is something really wrong with you, this is coming from a person that likes artist such as, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, 2pac, Biggie,Lady Gaga, Twista, Taylor Swift, many more.<br /><br />OPEN your ears and minds. and enjoy this album for what it really is, a gift to all the diverse fans that she has, because now a days she doesn't only have hardcore rap fans, she has pop fans, R&B fans and so on.

B004JHYRDQ|5.0|This book is worth all the money you've got. This story basically revolves around the murder of a young man on the planet Solaria to wher a plainclothes detective of e5 level is sent to investigate accompanied by a robot whom he hates so much. This story has much resemblence to the near future, human greed, etc. But anyway a person need not be a scifi lover to read this.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|Teens/kids movie for sure. We the adults were pretty bored with boring dialogues and story lines. It was long and we were waiting and hoping for some interesting twists or fabulous action scenes but it never happened.

B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill have released another great album. If you're looking for a thrash metal band that has crisp production, blistering sharp tongued vocals - loaded with plenty of energy and character (and some gang vocals sprinkled here and there), clearly audible bass (a rarity in many thrash bands), good quality guitar riffs and solos and precision drumming that makes the music gallop along at different speeds of fast and faster, then you could do well to check out \\"The Electric Age\\" by Overkill.<br /><br />Recommended Songs: They're all good, but \\"Come and Get It\\" and \\"Electric Rattlesnake\\" are great tracks to get started on here. \\"21st Century Man\\" showcases some great singing by Bobby Blitz. \\"Good Night\\" starts of with  a slow guitar intro, ... then takes off into a thrashing number with a fantastic solo - which leaves me wondering if Overkill plan to use this song to close out the odd live gig.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Overkill's prior release, [[ASIN:B0033I5MOU Ironbound]],there could be a very good chance that you will enjoy this release as well.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I remember Oregon Trail as a learning game I played as a child in school.  I thought I'd look at this and see if it was something I'd recommend to my elementary students.  There is no way I'd tell them to play this game.  There is very minimal educational value, and there are constant invitations to purchase game items such as energy or lumber with actual money.  I'd heard of games that prey on children's lack of undrestanding of real currency to get them to spend huge amounts while playing, but this is the first I've seen.  Kind of shocking.  Say no thanks!
B007R41E8O|5.0|I've played many hidden object games &amp; this is a great one. Very easy to play &amp; items are very visible.  Interesting story &amp; good graphics. Works great on kindle fire. Thanks Alawar - I can't wait for your next game! Well worth $0.99 everyone!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, wow, wow! I really enjoyed this book and I thought is was very captivating. There is so much to say about it and so many feelings I have about it. It is difficult to put those feelings into words. There is humor in this story as well as many other things. I love the characters and the email exchanges between them are wonderful. I know some people did not like this book and that is okay but I feel like there is so much to learn from it and to understand the nature of some people and yes, I am referring to the BDSM.  If you can look deep into the underlying story that the author is trying to tell you, you may like it.  Yes, there is drama but it is fiction:)  I do think that if you have read this book and stopped to possibly consider continuing the trilogy, unless you abolutely hated it. I will continue this trilogy and I know that I will enjoy it immensely!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Pretty good puzzling app considering the others that are out there and its pretty fun though I find it very addicting and, though I've only had it for a short time, I'm already worried I may lose sleep playing this game :)

B005JABSB6|5.0|I own two Sharp flat screens in my home, the LC-70LE735U downstairs and the LC-46LE835U upstairs.  Both offer 3D functions which I enjoy with the latest blu rays, Vudu 3D movie titles, Nvidia TV Play (for 3D computer games and simulations) and certain PS3 games, and could view with the previous Sharp AN3DG10S active shutter glasses. Those worked very well but were a tiny bit heavy, used a watch battery for 75 hours of viewing time per battery and were slightly small for larger heads.<br /><br />Now Sharp has released this 2nd generation model, the AN3DG20B, which is both lighter, wider, and more stylish than the last model (at least IMHO). The main difference is that this model uses a rechargeable built in lithium ion battery (and each pair of glasses comes with a charging cable), and when it is depleted, you must plug the glasses into a powered usb port on, say, your PS3 or your receiver.  It takes about 90 min to fully charge a depleted battery and one full charge is good for about ~ 10 to 11 hours of 3D viewing.  Just as with the previous model, these glasses offer a 2D setting for small children, or those who suffer from epilepsy or have medical conditions which preclude 3D viewing.  The price has also come down from $73 per pair for the previous G10 model to around $45 for the G20 model. As to viewing difficulties, I cannot notice any.  When used in 3D mode, everything from Lion King 3D to Avatar on 3D blu ray looks crisp and well done, with no ghosting or tearing.  For longer sessions, I have tried them for 5-6 hours at a time playing Uncharted 3 on the PS3 or enjoying FSX from my PC, and have not suffered eyewear, nose fatigue, headaches or any other problems.  These glasses are lighter than the previous G10 model by perhaps 50 to 70 grams and fit larger heads better as well.<br /><br />My only complaint, the ear rims are cheap plastic (likely used to reduce weight even further) and remind me of a child's cheap dime store beach glasses. Other than that, these active shutter glasses rock.  All around equal to or better than the previous model in most regards. For folks who own Sharp 3D TVs, these are awesome. 4.8 stars out of five.active shutter glasses rock.  All around equal to or better than the previous model in most regards.

1609611543|2.0|It seems that the lines were crossed in several sections of the book concerning wheat, gluten and carbs. I thought this was a book about wheat and gluten and its relatives, but the author seems to be against anything carbohydrate in general.  It smells awfully like Atkins diet, only packaged slightly different under the hype of wheat and gluten as the enemy. His 1 week diet regiment is high fat, low carb (50-100gm) - hello, Atkins.  I'm vegetarian and rely heavily on the legumes and grains and was looking for some guidance around the selection of grains in my diet. If I wanted a book that talks about low carb, low glycemic foods, I would have read Atkins.

It sounded like a great app, exactly what a music junkie like me would want....OR NOT. i installed it, found a vid i wanted to watch, and then...ERROR.

B005HSL626|1.0|This game is a complete waste of time.  Doesn't make any sense at all!<br />I had no idea how to play nor what the object of the game is.  Stupid!!
1591396190|4.0|This is a great book, it's very relevant to the times, I love the vision and the idea. The problem is that the authors really don't tell you how to actually do anything. So, I'd definintely recommend the book for an easy read, but if you're looking for advice on implementation - you'll be disappointed.

B0053KWDES|4.0|These were paired with various headphones and earphones. The amp itself it small I guess when compared to other portable amps. So far it improves all the sets I have used with the amp and I'm pretty satisfied with the amp. I guess I don't like to use it often since it is sorta bulky when paired with my droid x. It comes with a rechargeable battery that takes a while to charge, but the charge also lasts for a long time if you remember to turn off your amp when not in use. I recommend this amp if you are looking for more juice for your set and not just louder sound.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Its so cool because you can download songs/videos on your kindle fire (: its just like the real youtube except its format is different you can watch a lot of videos over and over (: really cool app

B00622BF40|5.0|I love this movie.  It's a bit hokey and the cinematography isn't state-of-the art, but the dancing is elegant - not pure athletics as it has become on Dancing With the Stars -  and the plot is definitely feel-good.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this was an outstanding finish to the series. Yes many did not like it since it was a brutal ending and some feel that Katniss should have grown more, but that is where the epilogue comes in. The epilogue is truly the redemption (of sorts) of Katniss and I think many folks are really missing that in the reviews that they posted.<br /><br />I thought the only downside was that the first half of the book may have spent a little too much time in 13, but other then that, this is an outstanding finish to the series.

Jennifer Grey still rocks (should've never \\"fixed\\" her nose, it was perfect to begin with), Patrick Swayze is still a hunk (R.I.P.), the music is great, and nobody puts Baby in the corner. Love this flick and its message that true lover conquers all, but only if you're willing to fight for it.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I'd never even heard of this game until I saw it as the FAOTD today, but when I saw all the 5 star reviews I had a good feeling about it.  So far I'm not disappointed.  It looks great on the kindle, the graphics and music are outstanding, and it's simple to play yet challenging. A definite winner.
0553801473|4.0|I enjoyed the book greatly. A fine addition to the story collection. High drama and intruige with strong storycraft. I hope we do not need to wait six(6) years for the next chapter.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy is a highly cerebral, intensive British spy thriller. This film will have you guessing 'who done it' to the end.  I saw this film in the Indie Cinema last winter and the audience was sitting on the floor.  Yes...that is what I said. The theater management overbooked. It was jammed packed - wall-to-wall sardines.  It is better than the UK version of the same film.  The cast was well-thought out and deliberate.  The cinemotography will capture you so much - you'll feel like you are sitting on the set.  Violence is expected in this thriller, so if you don't like fatal aggression, it might not be for the faint hearted.  But if you like spy thrillers - you might find this a film good enough for your spy collection.  Don't rent this - BUY IT.  You'll keep watching this over and over.
0385535139|5.0|Have I said \\"I love John Grisham\\" in the past? That hasn't changed! Just finished \\"The Litigators\\" and LOVED it! The characters were so realistic, and gave me a different view of the opinion that all lawyers must be rich! Very believable........ and an enjoyable read. Not surprised with the ending (a little disappointing for me), but that did not stop me from reading it through to the last word. If you are a John Grisham fan, put this on your \\"to read\\" list!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|George Clooney is more than just a pretty face.<br /><br />Just in case you didn't already know that, see The Descendants. In my opinion, this is the best film he's made to date. Clooney is a movie star who can still morph into a character, unlike some movie stars who come across on screen as movie stars just playing someone else (Tom Cruise, I'm talking about you). In this film, he's a lawyer named Matt King whose risk-taking wife is on life support, having been critically injured in a water skiing accident. He's also dealing with two daughters, both having trouble coping with their mother's absence.<br /><br />Then he finds out his wife had been having an affair and was planning to leave him. As he searches for answers, he struggles to hold his family together, spearhead the sale of his family's ancestral land, and eventually make a decision as to whether or not to keep his wife on life support. When he sets out to find and confront the real estate broker his wife was seeing, with his daughters and eldest daughter Alex's dopey friend Sid in two, the family begins to bond.<br /><br />Clooney, a confirmed bachelor in real life, is spot-on as a husband and father here. As his daughters, Alex and Scottie, Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also wonderful. I especially liked Nick Krause as Alex's always inappropriate friend Sid. This guy was a genius when it came to ticking people off. Beau Bridges is good, as always, as one of Matt's cousins, Hugh, a long-haired, Hawaiian-shirted land baron.<br /><br />But the real star of this movie is Hawaii, and never has it looked more beautiful. The cinematography shows off the lush paradise to the max, providing such a stunning backdrop for the family's turmoil that you'll run, not walk, to your nearest travel agent.<br /><br />I confess: I've been a fan of George Clooney's ever since he played Sela Ward's love interest in the late '80s TV series Sisters...but this actor isn't getting older, he's getting better. Much better.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My wife had wanted this \\"original\\" Euro-game for a while so I got it as a Valentine's Day present. It's been quite a bit of fun actually. One of the most interesting things is the variation in the board. The instructions suggest a board setup for beginners (to create a pretty well balanced game), but once you're experienced the board can be reconfigured in a great number of different ways due to the nature of the hexagonal land tiles the board is built out of, and the chits that determine when you earn different resources. One downside is it's a 3-4 player game so we need to change the rules, or use a variant, to play most of the time because there are only two of us. Also, as several have noted, the present edition of the game (fourth) needs a little light \\"breaking in\\" straight out of the box, i.e. the border is a bit too small for all of the land tiles. I have read that you may call Mayfair games and they'll send a border that fits, but I haven't done so as the game has settled in well after several plays (NB I'm not saying that I have modified the tiles or bent or worn down any, it's just that after a few plays the cardboard tags that are left after punching out the tiles from the die-cut sheet of cardboard wear down creating an easy fit. These could probably be lightly sanded...).<br /><br />Positives:<br />Many board configurations<br />Lots of replay potential<br />Possible (perhaps probable) come from behind wins<br />Components are sturdy and built to last (cardboard is sturdy)<br />Classic game (expansion allows for up to six players, and other expansions are also available)<br />Box insert is well designed<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Difficult to play with 2 players<br />The tiles require a little \\"breaking in\\"<br /><br />Overall a fun game, we're more likely to play when a third or fourth is around.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it so much I can play all day if I have to even if my kindle dies love it
B0055SWM08|5.0|great app for killing time. will definitely make you think on some higher levels. a + game. well worth the .99
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game. I play and get out of it so my energy can refill and it refilled even when I'm out of the game. I just hats the bug it has where crops animals or materials take about 180 hours to be done.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This was a great book, and an easy read.  I was captivated after the first chapter, and fell in love with the characters right away.  It's very provocative, but I think it just shows how much passion and love the main characters have for each other.  I would recommend this book (along with the two sequels).  I've already read all three books twice; I love them!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is super awesome fun and challenging. CAREFUL! Its addicting. super fun too. even better I got it for FREE!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First time reading this type of book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  In fact, purchased all three and have read them twice.  Would I recommend this book - absolutely yes.  I loved Christine Grey and Anastasia Steele.  They were well suited for each other.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun for being a free game. my daughter loves it.  don't like that you can only play for a short time but its still fun considering its free.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is great. really entertaining.  just wish I didn't need to make an account to get nieghbors and also wish the energy went further.
B005T87QCI|5.0|best game ever. better than any game. even though no Zeus or atom it is still crazy good . you should by it. very good deal
B007MNV5WU|5.0|like I said you have to buy this game. super cool. you MUST get this game. angry birds is the best game!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME. MAKES YOU THINK AND TAKE HOURS OUT OF BORDEM. UNLOCK NEW LEVELS AND STAGES. AND HAVE LOTS OF FUN.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|I loved reading this book and learning about Rafa Nadal.<br /><br />You learn that he is superstitious, hard working and a pretty normal guy.<br />The main themes are family insulation, team loyalty, Mallorca loyalty, and how important the mind is in the game of tennis.<br />I loved the insight to his home town, to how  physically demanding tennis is.<br />I found Rafa's relationship with his Uncle Toni very insightful. And was happy to see that Rafa was slightly moving away from Toni's control and becoming his own person in the last few chapters of the book.<br /><br />The style of writing was a little repetitive - it felt like the writer wrote chapters without looking over what was previously written, so there was a lot of repetition. This over all didn't take a way from the honest nature of the book.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's a faithful, colorful, responsive clone of Super Mario. Open Feint is included for those who care about that. I disabled it right away. Well done.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm reviewing this cause they said it would help them make more games. so I must like it cause I don't really like writing reviews...
1609611543|5.0|This book talks about taking wheat out of your diet, so you can lose wheight easier. It also has recipies without wheat in them! This writer knows what she is talking about.
B005LAIH54|3.0|** SPOILER ALERT **<br /><br />Being a fan of the first Clash of the Titans movie starring Sam Worthington, I had high hopes for this installment.  It's full of hate and betrayal, which you get immediately.  Zeus, Neptune and Aries try to meet with Hades in the Underworld, and he betrays them and makes a deal with his father, Kronos.  After that, the movie becomes very depressing.  The only thing I can say about the rest of the movie is that almost everybody dies except for Perseus and Andromeda.  If you want to be depressed, this is the movie for you!<br /><br />The acting is very good, but is hampered by a weak and disjointed storyline.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great as a time killer. I have been playing everyday since download. The graphics are also good yet simple.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My son got this game for the PC and played it all the way thru all levels. I started playing and liked it so much that when I got my Tablet, I just had to have it on it as well. When my husband saw how many times my son and I where playing the game, he started playing and loves it also. We recommend it to all who like to play games, it's fun and you won't want to get off - the game is very addicting.  Have fun !.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this game would be fun on a computer but you cant jump and move at the same time on the kindle fire... I was kinda sad about this because the game looks like it could be a lot of fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to learn but challenging enough to keep you interested. Addicting! I want to play it all the time. Great graphics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Classy game that anyone would enjoy if you like puzzle games. Lots of levels that are challenge but not frustrating.
B004GYY714|5.0|The only problem I have with this app is when I stop playing the radio station a short time later it comes back on. I don't touch the app or shake it to find a new station so I am a little confused. Other than that this app is perfect for listening to your local radio stations.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|best antivirus on any platform.  and now its mobile... bravo. it has tons of features and its FREE.  clean simple interface
0345803485|5.0|5 stars aren't near enough for what I would like to rate this book, and the trilogy.. but it will have to do.<br /><br />I've never written a review before, but felt the need to after reading all the bad reviews for this trilogy. First off.. no, these books won't win any literary awards. They aren't what would be considered 'fine literature'. You take it for what it is.. entertainment. When I read the book description and heard about all the hype surrounding these books, I wasn't sure if it would be my cup of tea. I wasn't even sure if I would be able to finish them because I wasn't interested in any hard core S&M stuff. I don't read romance novels, at all.. so this was not my typical read.<br /><br />Those reviewers who didn't finish the book because it seemed to be going down the path of heavy S&M really missed out, because it never crossed that line, for me anyway. It is about so much more than how it seems in the beginning. We really get to see how the relationship develops between these 2 characters over the course of the 3 books. Some reviewers even complained that the author used English terms that were out of place... big deal. That has no bearing whatsoever on the overall storyline.<br /><br />I completely lost myself in these books, much to my surprise. I really loved all 3 of them. I know these started out as a Twilight fan fiction, but the only similarities are - a girl who is less than confident, and an overprotective, God's gift to women man who happens to be head over hills for her. That's it. That's where the similarities end.<br /><br />I loved these books so much, that I started reading the 1st one again the same day I finished the 3rd and I have NEVER done that before. They really are that good. I have gotten many of my friends to start reading and they love it as well.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are looking for award winning literature, these aren't for you. If you are a person who is utterly annoyed by the use of English terminology here andthere, then these aren't the books for you. If you are bothered by a lot of sexual content, then these aren't the books for you. Although, I think that the way the author handled the written sex scenes in the book was excellent, and extremely steamy. There will definitely be some 'OMG' moments.<br /><br />On the other hand.. if you are wanting to completely get lost in something.. these are the books for you. If you love a good love story with enough steam to fog up every window in your house, then these are the books for you. If you can handle falling in love with a fictional character, (oooh my, Christian Grey) then these are most definitely the books for you. Now, I'm off in search of a Silver Grey Silk Woven Tie. ;)
B004SOR4H6|5.0|twitter is an amazing app that is really fun for kids and adults! age limit from me would have to be about 11 and older! I recommend it for you... you will love it!<br /><br />Ps... you can follow your friends!!!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|it wasn't a bad game, ran smoothly and good graphics but controls sucked on my Droid 2. could be my phone or could be the game but I wasn't happy that I could hold down the jump button and the arrow at the same time.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|[[ASIN:B005UBNKZG AMD FX 8120 8-Core Processor 3.1 8 Socket AM3 - FD8120FRGUBOX]]<br /><br />I think the AMD processor is a great value for money. Got this CPU for CDN $180. Installed it into my ASUS Sabertooth 990FX together with my old Noctua cooler (just using one fan out of two for now). Also installed Windows 7 patches. Overclocked to 4 GHz. Works great. Runs cool at idle.<br />I have spent almoust the same amount of money on my Athlon 5200 just several years ago and as you can imagine the performance difference is huge.<br />The processor might be slower than i5 or other competitors in some benchmarks, but it runs all the programs that I need as fast as I want it to, and that's what matters to me the most.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I can't get through this book. It was page turning, I read it for 3 hours non-stop, depriving my night rest, but I can't get further after reading chapter 16. I felt so broken-hearted.<br /><br />I understand that this book coming from the imagination of E.L. James, and in your own imagination you can be just anything you want. But as a woman who was raised in Asia, with family and friends' expectations of following the traditional values, and appreciated much less just because of your gender, this book is totally against everything I ever worked for. In this pop-cultured western world when every woman can nearly be anything they want, young ladies everywhere are giving up their dreams to be smart, because to be popular, rich & famous is an absolute important. And now we have this book....<br /><br />So sorry Mrs. James, with all due respect to the British classic novels that I also love to read, I found your book difficult to digest. It makes me sad, and even sadder to know that this series are so popular.<br /><br />Freedom is a very precious give. If you ever have to work so hard to get it, you would appreciate more than anything.
0062073281|5.0|This book is a fun book to read, just like all of Lauren Conrad's other books. Nothing spectacular, but a great beach read. I would recommend it.
1451648537|5.0|I am not a big fan of Apple and have philosophical differences with their approach to products, yet I devoured this book in a matter of days in spite of my busy schedule.<br /><br />It is well written and seemingly candid overview of Mr. Jobs's life that covers every aspect of his time at Apple and Pixar that will have you pondering some of the conventional approaches to product development and leadership.  Steve Jobs clearly will go down in history as one of the great CEO's of our era.<br /><br />Well worth anyone's time, whether you're a fan or not.<br /><br />Some thoughts I had -<br /><br />Steve Jobs clearly is a genius, but he is also one of the great a**********s of our time.  He berated his employees publicly, he neglected his family, he took credit for ideas that weren't his, and he did a bunch of other things that go against the theoretical book of what good leaders do - yet he heads what is now the most profitable company in the world, and it is hard to dispute that he drove that success.  How?<br /><br />Because Steve Jobs also was a genius at seeing trends before most other people and understanding what makes up a good product, and because he ensured that only top notch people were able to work at his company.  Steve Jobs was also an example of pure drive at the expense of everything else.  These are the reasons for his success.<br /><br />What I fear most about people reading this book is that they'll see the personality and adopt it.  I do not condone the way he treated his people and there is an active debate as to whether it contributed to or detracted from his success.  I have worked with and for managers that exhibited many of these traits over the years (without the vision of course....) and have seen up close the impact to grown men and women humiliated in front of their peers or that have been condescended to repeatedly.  It is not a strategy of management that I will ever adopt or see positives in.<br /><br />But overall, this book is a fascinating read and I highly recommend.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I like it alot, and by that I mean more than my corn dogs yeah I said out corn dogs mfers
0143119680|3.0|This book is very long and while there are glimpses of interesting sections, there's very little excitement especially when there are so many supernatural beings lurking about.  There's too much academia and  not enough love story.  The vampire is too controlling and the witch is too agreeable.  The communication between the couple is far from realistic.  The world is interesting but falls short of what it could have been.
0345803485|3.0|Where do I even begin? The writing was horrific and yet, I was so fascinated with the relationship between the two main characters, Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, that I couldn't put it down. The Author is British, which is absolutely not a problem, HOWEVER, if you're going to write a story about two Americans living in Seattle, you shouldn't use words like \\"envisaged\\" (\\"envisioned\\" to us, American-English speakers), \\"rucksack\\" (backpack), or all the other British slang and spelling used throughout the book...she could also have probably used less of the word \\"beguiled\\" (who says that?!), calling the computer the \\"mean machine\\" EVERY.SINGLE.TIME she refers to it, the exclamation \\"Holy Crap!\\" (while I was reading, I prefered to tell myself that she didn't actually say this every time Christian gave her a \\"deep, gray-eyed glare\\" or every time she saw his erection), and saying the \\"Katharine Kavanaugh Inquisition\\" every time her best friend asked her a question. Oh also, did you know her favorite tea is Twinings English Breakfast Tea? (also not a common drink among 21 year old American college students) but is mentioned about 9237492834 times in the book...and that Christian is very turned on when she bites her lip every other sentence. And what graduating college student with an English degree going into PUBLISHING doesn't own her own computer?! Or cell phone with email capabilities? ...It really just irked me that the author obviously had no insight into what Anastasia Steele would actually be like as an American 21 year old college student.<br /><br />It's quite obvious this book was written as fan-fiction (for those of you unaware, all of the characters are based off Twilight characters: Christian = Edward, Anastasia = Bella, Katharine = Rosalie, Elliott = Emmett, Mia = Alice, Mr. & Mrs. Grey = Mr. & Mrs. Cullen, etc..., all of the Grey siblings are adopted, the \\"bad guy\\" of the story is based off the character James) but you would think that once it was \\"published\\" they would have cleaned up the writing and extreme repetiveness of the words and phrases being used.<br /><br />In the beginning, I was also very put off by the BDSM...so for those reading, be aware that it's very graphic in nature if you've never heard of what that lifestyle is about. But the author does a good job of explaining why it's such a huge part of Christian's life and why he \\"needs\\" to do it....and it turns out, it's not as bad as you would think (at least the way it is between these characters)...I think that BDSM in general is degrading and repulsive.<br /><br />I also do not agree with the price of the book (I bought mine for the Kindle) ...at that price, I'd expect a book to be much more polished and professional.<br /><br />I'll give the author credit where it's due though...the chemistry between the characters is electric and captivating. And I'm thinking it's going to make a whole lot of bored wives want to spice up their sex lives.lished\\" they would have cleaned up the writing and extreme repetiveness of the words and phrases being used.<br /><br />In the beginning, I was also very put off by the BDSM...so for those reading, be aware that it's very graphic in nature if you've never heard of what that lifestyle is about.

B007HJ91HU|3.0|Entertaining but lacked the pizzaz of the earlier version. The energy level seemed very low and the story dragged a bit.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Rated one star because i spend more time managing my media than I should. Apps are supposed to help not make it more difficult.
B004ZISVWC|2.0|This is a hoax with great effects.  They claim to have a real documentation of \\"Trolls\\" and they can sniff out any God fearing Christian man...  Just like \\"Blair Witch\\" this is all the same.  Fake with poor acting.
0385341008|5.0|Luckily for us someone picked up from where Shaffer (unfortunately) left, and continued this book to its end and send it out to the world to read.<br />It's a beautiful book about friendship and unity, and trust and support.<br />I read the Hebrew translation and it was loyal to the source, as it was very good!<br />I read some others thought it was too good all the way, but I guess this is the sight of our whishes for a better world, understanding and consideration at one another.<br />From my point of you - totally recomended :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|With over 300 reviews posted, there really isn't anything I can add but I did want to chime in with how incredible this book is.  I borrowed it from the library for my Kindle and I can tell you I didn't have to worry about the loan period expiring prior to my finishing the book.  I zipped through it in about 48 hours, reading 220 pages per day which is very fast for me.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good suspense novel since the tension runs high from the beginning all the way through to the end.  It keeps you guessing the entire time.  This author is a GREAT storyteller!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this too too much. once you start u cannot stop until it is too late to go to bed to get a good night sleep.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love the design and gameplay, but at times I get frustrated. good brainteaser, great game overall. blibbity blabbity blobbity.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to admit, when I started this book I was shocked.  But the characters begin to grow on you.  It is a love hate relationship and you cannot help but root for Anastasia and Christian.  I only wish it had'nt ended when it did.  I found myself wanting more of their NEW family.
1423136802|5.0|This series has sparked my sons interest in Mythology and ancient Greece and Rome.  He has read the follow up novels by the author and has now moved on th=o the Fablehaven novels.  He is 10 and in 4th grade plays competitive baseball and football and still makes time to read these books.  Absolutely recommend these.
0439023483|5.0|Aimed as a teenager book, makes is description-less and therefore a straight reading right to the end of it.<br />No fooling around with words, Collins builds the tension in a way that you simply can't let go of the book.<br /><br />*** Very good for non readers to start and find out the joy of reading and fall into something absolutly great!! ***<br /><br />Simply MARVELOUS!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|i play Quell on my kindle and its great!! it is my favorite puzzle game. you have to slide the bubble and try to get the other littler bubbles.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|for free this is a fun game.  sometimes I have a problem planting crops so that portion has a glitch and the people will not move which I don't like
B000EGF0NW|4.0|I began to read this book thinking that it would be interesting and a good read but it had a difficult affect on me. As a victim of rape myself I found it to be quite retraumatizing and I am trying to work out if I should work through it and continue to read or to put it down. It has already opened some pretty old wounds. It would almost be good to have some sort of disclaimer on the book so that the reader is prepared. It is well written though and I loved the Lovely Bones.
B0052U59F4|1.0|Had I known before I purchased this book that it was so full of graphic sadistic sex, I never would have bought it. In the reviews I read there was never any mention of this. I did not finish it and will not be reading or buying the two sequels. I have read and enjoyed, many books with sex passages, but this was over the top.
B0026PMN70|5.0|I'm very happy to have discovered Lee Fields. I first heard him on a MOJO magazine CD sampler of Rolling Stones songs a few months ago and was blown away by his voice: pure southern soul, marinated with honey and hickory barbecue sauce! Where had this guy been hiding all these years? He's obviously not a young new singer. To my delight, I saw that he's recorded several albums, so I ordered this one to see if it would click, and I'm happy to report that it sure did; an excellent set of songs. I only wish they had included some songwriting credits and additional info with the CD package; there is almost nothing in the way of liner notes, except for a list of musicians on the album. Nonetheless, this is a must listen for fans of 70s soul music. Of course this is NOT music from the 70s; was recorded only a couple of years ago, but the music retains that special 70s vibe. Personally, I don't quite get the James Brown comparisons; the songs on this album don't quite have that deep JB funkiness, and the horn arrangements are more subtle, but the songs certainly do have lots of soul and vigor. I'll be buying more albums by Lee Fields ASAP!
0439023521|3.0|I must say I went into this book reluctantly. I found the premise to be disturbing--a bunch of teenagers going around killing each other. But so many people enjoyed it I thought I'd give it a try. I enjoyed the beginning. The pre-battle preparations I think teens might enjoy but it seemed unrealistic that there was not more discussion and feeling about their impending death. I felt puzzled at the morality of the whole thing which never seemed to be addressed. I think young people could have benefited from more discussion and attention to what this meant to your fellow contestant--even the worst are from families that would be devastated at their loss. There also was no history or understanding of exactly how these games came about other than a nebulous referral to a \\"rebellion\\". I would have liked more development of that and I found the public viewing of the games nauseating. I would have given it 3 stars because of those points but on the positive side, I found the writing of the last half of the book page turning and exciting and found myself immersed in it. I thought the author did a good job of not being overly gory and had several of the deaths occur from the environment they encountered rather than direct hits from each other. I thought the death of Rue showed one of the few moments of humanity in the book. However, looking at it as a fantasy story to take you to another place it think it was exciting and adventurous and I did like some of the creative thinking of the characters and their resourcefulness. I think it would make a thrilling movie and fun to see all the costumes and scenery
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game<br />it is great...only 2 things.<br />1. They should not make you have energy that takes 3 minutes to get back.<br />2. there is no way of getting out of the game. you have to click the logo then you can get out(in kindle fire. ;)<br />over all great game every one should buy it!!!!!!!:)<br /><br />I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Some would rather take away the stars for a complaint in the ad department. however its a business and the review to me should reflect the game...That said, I recommend it. I'm enjoying the elements of its relaxing time pass on my Motorola Droid Razr!<br />Lol See? one for my company! lol

B002BU0DPE|3.0|The PX21 Ear Force headset is alright, I like it. Sound on the headset is OK, not really what it is all hyped up to be. While playing FPS video games I can hear people walking around, but is still a little hard to tell where it comes from 'cause of sounds only coming from left and right sides. There is a slight \\"buzz\\" in the headphones, but really can't hear it unless the sounds is low, but still is hard to notice. Everything is fine, I just believe the product is really over priced, then again, that is the value of our dollar at work XD.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very addicting! :) but a good game for the price...free! hopefully it stays that way..$ is hard toncome by though..
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is fun to play! I plan on doing a full review over this game on my youtube channel!
B003BWERF8|5.0|this little jewel is great it pairs quickly and works great with a generation 5 nano it also works great with generation 6 but it drains the battery in about 2 hours of continual use but its a great way to go for a wireless run or walk even at the gym generation 6 has a great clip and with a wireless headset you can do anything but swim!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I really like this movie, special effects and the actors. It is a roller coaster ride from beginning to end.<br />Great price also!
0312641893|5.0|This is a great setup for a series! The world building is rich and complete, and the plot is complicated enough to hold your interest and give each individual a believable motive. The character of Cinder is well developed and likable; even lovable. I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I remember playing this game on my friends phone and was happy to find it on kindle fire. great game.!
0307593312|1.0|Where do I start??<br /><br />I listen to audiobooks at work to make my days go faster. 47 hours of utter confusion ending in an anticlimactic blah ending.<br /><br />Summary: A hit woman (Aomame) wanders down a rabbit hole. A Math teacher/book writer (Tengo) apparently also is in the rabbit hole. The two main characters know each other from a 5 minute hand holding session from 5th grade and apparently 20 years later they're still in love. A book shows up and Tengo rewrites it so it can get a book award. The book is about \\"little people\\" coming out of a goat's mouth and they make chrysalises. The author of that book is a 17 yr old girl (Fuka-Eri) from a cult and apparently the story is true. I guess this book messes up the order of the universe or something? Aomame and her wealthy old woman client find out the cult leader has been sexually abusing young girls and so Aomame goes and murders him. Which isn't really murder because he's an all knowing entity and knew why she was there and told her he wanted to die. At the same time Fuka-Eri is holed up at Tengo's house hiding from the cult. On the same night Aomame is murdering the leader Tengo is paralyzed and raped by Fuka-Eri. Somehow this gets Aomame pregnant - which we never find out how or why it's Tengo's but she's sure because it's love. A third character, Ushikawa, is brought in. He's just a stalker working for the cult and kind of had no place in this story, but he's in there, so I mention it. Anyway... Tengo's father dies so he goes away for a while. Fuka-Eri decides all is safe and disappears. Aomame is being hunted by the cult so she goes into hiding a little ways away from Tengo who she still hasn't met since 5th grade. The third character, Ushikawa, is killed and Aomame and Tengo meet on a slide in a kids park. They go back through the rabbit hole and apparently live happily ever after.<br /><br />1. I listened to this book for days and still couldn't figure out what exactly was going on and what the point was to a LOT of the book.<br /><br />2. The details... OH the details. This book could've EASILY been cut in half. It severely needs an editor. What happened? I feel like someone told the author he HAD to make a long book and it was just filled with fluff and nothing details.<br /><br />3. SO many things left unanswered.<br /><br />Exactly what purpose is the \\"little people\\"? Who knows. Are the good? Evil? Who knows!<br /><br />What is a chrysalis? It's never explained even though it's supposed to be a main part of the story.<br /><br />The cult? Or Leader? Any details? Nope.<br /><br />What are Dotas and Motas? They come from the chrysalis of course... but anything further is not addressed.<br /><br />Where does the cult go in the end? And the \\"little people\\"? I guess they disappear into space.<br /><br />If they're gone can't she go back to a normal life with her friend the old woman? They existed before she went into an alternate universe.<br /><br />Am I to believe in an immaculate conception? Tengo is paralyzed and apparently raped by a 17 year old girl and somehow his soul mate he hasn't seen since they were 10 is pregnant with his child. We know it's his because she says so... why does she think that? Who knows.<br /><br />What happened to Tengo's older girlfriend? I guess she disappears because the actress no longer wanted to appear in the book... wait... it's a BOOK! Where did she go??<br /><br />Was it his dad knocking on doors while in a coma in a completely different town? I guess?? Who knows.<br /><br />Is the nurse from the \\"cat town\\" his reincarnated mother? It's implied, but never finishes.<br /><br />----------------------------<br />NOTHING is finished in ANY of these concepts. Why were they even introduced if they were never going to be finished ideas? Seriously... this whole book is a mess.<br /><br />4. What is with all the under-aged sex? And what is the obsession with breasts? I feel like some 14 year old wrote this whole thing. Wait... scratch that... I might be insulting 14 year olds who CAN write.<br /><br />I can really only assume that the 5 star reviews are from people who didn't read this. I'm not picky about books. I read everything and anything and 99% of the time I like them all. This one is just horrible. I wouldn't have even post about it if it were mediocre, but really... just awful. Don't even start it. If you read this review then you've pretty much heard the whole story. Is it confusing? Don't worry... you won't gain anything more from reading this.tch that...

B0055SWM08|5.0|Probably one of the better puzzle games for android. Just got it and I've been playing for like an hour.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I cant believe money was spent and talent was wasted to portray the boring life of this insignificant old hag. They should do a movie about Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's wife. There was historic mover and shaker.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game, I got the first Quell and tried the free trial of Quell Reflect it was so cool even the background. was cool.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this puzzle game is the funniest puzzle game ive ever played! it is very addicting! definately worth the money! .
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I found the free app to be quite entertaining. The main sticking point for me would be the price of the full app. Consider making it more affordable,  and I would be happy to buy it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very relaxing! Works great on my captivate running ics. Get it free while you can! I'm not big on puzzle games, but this one is great
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is the best game I have ever had. I love it! I think everyone should have it, but that's my opinion
B0068MNO4S|1.0|Sitting through this movie felt like I was subjecting myself to torture. I thought it was going to be interesting like Elizabeth the Golden Age, but it wasn't. I think you have to be brittish or some kind of english lit. Proffessor or student or shakespear aficinado to appreciate this movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great for the Kindle Fire.  This app has great graphics and soothing music.  I highly recommend this neat app for all ages.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a very fun game if you want something chalanging. if you want something to pass a bit of time; pick this up you'll feel smarter for it
B0052U59F4|5.0|When I first started reading the book I wasn't sure  I was going to like it. It gets better! by the end of the book I was ready for book number two. I am waiting on the release date of April 17. I have pre-ordered. I can't wait for more Grey!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and makes you think. And yet it can help you calm yourself  because of the lovely backgrounds I recommend it
1451648537|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I remember watching the movie \\"Pirates of Silicon Valley\\" and this book covers a little of what that movie illustrated.  What I love most about this book is the details it goes into around the products and projects that Jobs was a part of.  Great book for anybody in business of any kind.
B0007TKNII|5.0|We took our 10 year old daughter to see the Phantom of the Opera at our local playhouse. She loved it, so I was telling her about the movie that I had seen of it. Bought it and now we can not get the dvd out of her room! She plays it often and sings all of the songs! Great Movie!!!
B007PTJOV0|2.0|have to say its like super Mario bros but I cant wait to see who I'm chasing at the end. happy hunting
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its very additive u want 2 keep playing forget everything else cause u won't want to stop playing so get comfy n have some fun
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I agree with others that this game's downfall is the long wait between energy recharges. Other than that I think it's fun and a good way to kill a few minutes here and there. I also agree with others that we should share ids. Mine is sugi55
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Wonderful book to read, mesmerized me again while reading it completely. I have read only half of the book, will read it completely and give a final review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a cool game for the kindle fire. its challenging and fun. the update gives more tiny games and it doesn't erase the games completed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have been sucked right in! Super fun, super addictive! Downloaded it for my husband...you're welcome! Back to the game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games and great way to relax! Awesome. app for everyone. to enjoy. By far the best. free app on market
B0055SWM08|5.0|First and foremost, this game is really relaxing! The music, background, and gameplay all combine to put my mind at ease. I lose track of time when I play this game because I am so focused on how to complete each puzzle with the perfect number of moves. This game really reminds me of playing Bejeweled's endless mode--calm and engaging. By the way, I am playing this game on an ASUS SL101 tablet and it looks great. All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes puzzles.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great for my 12 and 13 year old's.  They both loved it.  Not sure whether this is because all of their friends loved it or whether it is due to the fact that it is really a good book for them.  There have been books that they have not finished due to poor writing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game ever! :) its like mario bros!<br />i really lved and play i almst everyday and the good thing is that it is free!
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice relaxing game. the music is a great way to set the mood. the puzzles progressively get more challenging. maybe you should make more obsticles
B001NEK2GE|3.0|IT DESERVES 4/5 STARS AS A PIECE OF HARDWARE. 3 STARS FOR USE ON FPS.<br /><br />Purchased a G13 thinking it might be a little better than a keyboard for playing BF3.  I've been using a keyboard to play FPS since Wolfenstein and have never once had an issue.  It was silly for me to \\"fix what ain't broken.\\"<br /><br />As far as a review goes.  I think everything has been covered.  The hardware itself is amazing.  Good feeling keys, the ergonomics fit my hand perfectly, seems to be well made like most logitech products, recording macros/keystrokes on the fly was excellent.  The biggest complaint I've read was about the joystick.  I don't know what the complaints were for, the joystick is perfect.  Even the software was good, which isn't a typical trait of logitech.<br /><br />My problem with playing FPS (BF3) was as follows:<br /><br />1) G20, which would correspond to CTRL or Crouch, is too far under the WASD keys to be comfortable or hit as easily as on a full size keyboard.  It worked ok and if that was the only thing I would have lived with it.<br /><br />2) G22, which was mapped to SPACE or Jump, is too far under the WASD keys to be comfortable or hit as easily as on a full size keyboard.  I mapped jump to the two \\"mouse buttons\\" by the joystick.  Worked well and my thumb rested on them much like it would the space bar...but those two buttons didn't seem to respond like a key would.  Had to mash them hard or multiple times to get myself to jump sometimes.  When coordinating it with G20 (crouch) I was often left standing out in a street in the middle of a gunfight I didn't anticipate participating in.<br /><br />3) No number keys.  I knew this when purchasing and figured I'd think of a work around.  The workaround I came up with was to map 1-4 to the joystick cardinal directions.  Since my thumb sat on the two mouse buttons this wasn't a bad setup at all.  I lacked the muscle memory to do it fast and know which weapon was tied to which direction but I think I would have learned it pretty fast.<br /><br />4) Arrangement of keys.  The rest of the keys were all more or less accessible and worked well.  The problem I had was that they didn't simulate the left side of a keyboard quite enough for my liking.  I knew where the buttons were and where they were supposed to be and could hit them when needed but it just wasn't easy, certainly not easier than my keyboard.  An example is G15 (SHIFT/Run).  It's more or less in the right place but it's a little smaller so my pinky has to stay tucked in closer to the hand (had to anyway to catch G16 and G20)and it just didn't feel right.  Wasn't uncomfortable but didn't feel right. The spacing and layout also seemed \\"off\\" for some reason.  When looking at it, it looks right.  When using it, it didn't feel right.  Moving your finger up from G12 (D/Right) to G6 (R/Reload) just seemed to take a lot more effort.  Almost like it was a longer travel or something even though it doesn't look like it.  It's almost, or probably is, that the keys were designed and laid out for a flat keypad then they stuck the ergo-hump in and it screws with the way your hand works making it comfortable but not quite fully functional.<br /><br />5) Just not enough keys.  Even though it has a ton of keys, it still didn't have enough keys (in the right places) to map everything I needed.<br /><br />6) Key labels.  I know what all the keys are for playing by touch and by site.  Example R=Reload, G=Grenade, F=Melee, etc.  When I had to hit a key, that wasn't a main key, rather than toss a nade while trying to sneak up and knife someone, I would have to look at the keypad and the keyboard to figure out where in relation to WASD the F was then hit it on the keypad.  On the keyboard though, I just hit it without looking or if I have to look it's F.  I assume muscle memory would fix this but I've got many years of typing memory that tell me where the F key is.  Nothing in me knows where the G13 key is much less what that button would even do.<br /><br />7) Somehow all the thinking involved with trying to manipulate the left hand really destroyed my right hands ability to be any good.  I assume it's just because it was something knew and wasn't instinct any more but my aim and response time was thrown way out of whack.  So, not only was the new key setup getting me killed, my ability to kill really dwindled and that got me killed.  I'm sure if I stuck with the G13 for a while this would resolve itself.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very nice piece of gear, could use some adjustment to key layout and some additional keys.  For MMORPG it might be great, but I don't play those.  For FPS, stick with your keyboard.<br /><br />I might give it a shot again on the 2nd or 3rd generation, especially if they aim at FPS instead of MMORPG.n would even do.<br /><br />7) Somehow all the thinking involved with trying to manipulate the left hand really destroyed my right hands ability to be any good.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|I have quite a general knowledge of the American revolution, basically the ideas and principles involved and political leaders involved. I am an objectivist and firm advocate of Ayn Rand's philosophy. I want to learn much more about this whole fascinating historical era of Founding fathers and I believe this good movie gave me even more insipration for further study. Would highly recommend it. Very long film (3 DVDs, at least 8 hours), it originally ran as series, so make sure you split your watching into at least 3 parts. Comment for non-US viewers: unfortunately dvd may not be playable on some european dvd players. I had to play it on my laptop.<br /><br />Jiri, Czech Republic
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Very good.  Hard to put down. Interesting ending. Characters constantly getting into sticky situations.  Looking forward to reading next book in series.
B0055SWM08|4.0|thats right i said pretty! seriously tho the music is enjoyable the puzzles are not difficult but still promote thinking about the solution worth the 99 cents if larger music library with same serenity theme. just a few different songs would be nice to add thats all!
B005BO2L9I|5.0|This is the first time I feel compelled to write a review on Amazon or any on-line forum for that matter.  I stumbled across this album by chance.  What a wonderful discovery...  Do not hesitate to buy this album.  You will not be disappointed.  Fatoumata Diawara is an amazing singer, songwriter, musician and storyteller.  She brings light to difficult subjects.  In every song on this heartfelt album, joy and hope transcend suffering.  Africa is a continent rich in culture and history.  Fatou reminds us why we need to change the way in which we lay our eyes on the birthplace of humanity.  Her voice needs to be heard.  Let music be an instrument of peace on Earth!<br /><br />P.S. Pour les fans du Canada: Fatou sera au Francofolies de Montréal les 13 et 14 juin 2012. Allez la voir!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Twelve brilliant stories! I loved this book! It was exciting, mysterious and thrilling! An absolute classic! Sherlock Holmes' stories are the best detective tales EVER! Wonderfully written!
B004LWZW8S|5.0|A great visual experience. For anyone that likes Epics like 300, this movie should satisfy, especially on Blu-ray. Looking forward to the sequel.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Sometimes somebody can state eloquently what one knows or experiences better than the person having the experience. I am active 75 year old that had been on a plane for many years and then made a conscious choice to form a new habit that would allow me to knock off 15 pounds, the author wonderfully described that key elements of what had had been doing (almost instinctually). I found that by grasping how the brain operates and the key elements  (especially finding a \\"hook\\") the description like a good coach or mentor helped to reinforce the goal I was shooting for.  If one is considering modifying a life style or has a sincere interest in forming a new habit I believe this book may be of help. It was for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quick boot up with fun and challenging puzzels. A great game for killing some down time.  Definitly recommend it for download.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is a great game but after a while it froze and now the time is 94 hours plz fix
B004H8GLXQ|3.0|This book took a long time to ship to me (chose standard shipping and it took longer than normal).  I needed it for a book club, so I had less time to read.  But the product was good once I got it.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|If you have memories of old mario you will enjoy this.  very similar to the first Mario same premise.  fun enough game.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Just an amazing movie and even better on Blu-ray. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes this style of film.
B004LROUW2|4.0|this is my second book ive read by haruki murakami, and anyone can see that its superbly written. its incredible how he takes two completely different characters and put them on opposite ends of a circle, and slowly tighten them until they completely overlap. its setting has a great mix of fantasy and reality, almost echoing that of the wind-bird chronicle.<br /><br />only thing about it: it is loooong……<br /><br />it took me months to finish it, and theres a lot of areas i wished he condensed it down. not that it drags, it just takes awile to get through. the book has a lot of intrigue that kept me going.<br /><br />i completely recommend it, but just be sure you know exactly what youre getting into. it is a 925 page book after all.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots of fun. good graphics. great take on an old classic. best free game ive played on the kindle fire.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent application, before going somewhere I always check my weather updates. Better application than others I have used. I recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The game is fun, but I do not have enough friends to complete tasks, and I wouldn't spend money on it.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I'm a math teacher and highly recommend this to both students andnother teachers.  Also this is super intuitive to use.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the kids and I love this game.  I would have gladly paid for it well worth it.  have had no problems with app.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|magedeths \\"13\\" is competent but just ok. its not bad but doesnt really stand out. its not '\\"rust in peace\\", or \\"peace sells but who s buying\\".
B001NB5BA4|5.0|i think with the technology these days is allowing us (the customers) hear more bandwidth which i think is the reason vinyl sounds better on smaller systems<br /> i think the original bandwidth of vinyl was 26-18 not sure. but i do know that the bandwidth on digital can go up to megabits which leaves plenty of room for incredible amounts of bandwidth (at least 15-25 beyond human hearing)<br /><br />which maybe the reason digital always sounds flat in most speakers.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Easy to play and really requires some brain power, I just wish there was an option to turn off auto level advance for when I retry levels to get better scores
B0054JZC6E|5.0|luvvvvvvvvving this app it is the best app u can get for ur kindle/ droid!!!# btw srry for my spelling! !
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy it! It is kind of like Sim City meets Oregon Trail meets Farmville. Except there's none of that annoying destruction of progress if you don't come back soon enough.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I have a mac pro laptop.  Bought this to hook up to a PNY smart active HDMI to HDMI cable for my TV.  Nice picture.  No audio
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a very addictive game. I find myself trying and retrying a level just to get a perfect. works great on the HTC thunderbolt.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this Cameos<br /><br />,this game is easy and very asome youguys should try to best all the levels try. it now and keep playing
0689870280|5.0|The little one loves this book. One of her favorites to read at bedtime. Great addition to our book collection.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have been noticing this one on the Kindle app page for months &amp; it was highly recommended by the Kindle Fire Dept blog. So, I was happy to see this as the FAOTD. I read some of the reviews saying that they had problems on the Fire. Well, I have played several levels with no problems. It is a fun game, one that I will play a good bit. It is fun, has good music &amp; lots of variety. In fact, it reminds me of Cut the Rope without the rope or nom-nom.  Clean, good for building strategic thinking, and challenging. Through in free ( or cheap, usually) and it earns at least 4.5 stars.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Having just read the Hunger Games series, and normally someone who only reads nonfiction....I was hooked on this series by this new author. Well done!  Kept my interest the whole time and very well written.  Almost read the whole book in one shot!<br /><br />I never read dystrophin fiction before the Hunger Games, the Wool series is on par with those series.  But has a more of a feel of being realistic.<br /><br />Loved this series and am really looking forward to seeing what comes next. This many people and their heartfelt accolades can't be wrong!  Buy the Omnibus and First Legacy.  Trust us as readers!<br /><br />Best regards!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|wonderful game p.s you can turn off the ads just go in pause menus there will be a delivery pig press him boom no ads
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun but can be very frustationg I don't know how to spell that but yea its pretty good some games are easy others are hard
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is simple yet addicting. it features all types of games yet if you like one type you'll still be quite content with this game.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I enjoy Nelson DeMille books and really enjoyed this book.  Keeps you thinking until the end.<br />Liked the character interaction and the descriptions of where everything takes place.
B007CGV6AI|5.0|originally purchased to send to my daughter for the newest grandson (6 mos), however, my second grandson(3yrs old)came to spend the night when this arrived. HE LOVES THIS BOOK. we read it over and over. he finds the word, armadillo, the funniest thing he's ever heard. it's great to go over colors and numbers as well as letting him make up parts of the story where there are only pix. i definitely recommend this book for preschoolers.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book has a different approach to the zombie theme. It doesn't tell the story from a single person or group perspective, but from different perspectives, showing many aspects of the war, like the early outbreaks, the failures of the governments, the strategies to fight back, what went wrong, etc., always as told by individuals sharing their stories. Extremely well written and very clever.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have played other games that are sorta like this one . but this game by fare is the best of the lot. the music love .. keep it up :)
0307120007|5.0|We enjoyed the book so much that we actually bought the other relevant titles \\"pat the...pig/horse/etc\\"<br />The textures are very stimulating for little ones.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|A book I really appreciate Seth Godin for sharing his insights with us. A bit strange to read at some paths of the book, it really makes a point about the \\"resistance\\" and brings a new understanding to the problem of talent devolpment (and talent loss).<br /><br />If you liked [[ASIN:1936719002 Poke the Box]], you too will like this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Enjoying this game a lot! Love the tasks; planting vegetables, building homes, helping the towns people, hunting, fishing, and collecting money and resources.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game is so addicting.  It is hard to put it down.  This is one of the best Mahjong games I have played (and I have played a lot).  Only thing wrong is the ads.  Very annoying.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game but I was told to re download for some reason.. will lose all progress. please fix.  HTC EVO 4G
B0055SWM08|5.0|At first I was curious as to what kind of puzzle game it was. once I started playing I became addicted. It takes pure thought to move the rain drop around to complete the puzzle. I am really enjoying this game.
0143034901|3.0|This is indeed a delightful book---until about the middle.<br />After reading page after page of Catalan names of minor characters and organizations, I became a little weary. The book, which started effortlessly and magically with a number of beautiful passages, is now becoming a bit of a drag to read. Too many sub-plots expand the book without adding much. I also dislike reading endless pages in italics from different characters' POV's.<br /><br />I will finish it because I must know what happens, but I think this embroiled tale would have been more exciting and a little more readable if some of the twists and turns had been edited out.<br />I was a litle irritated by a grammatical mistake on the first page of the novel, the relative pronoun \\"that\\" used instead of \\"who.\\" This may be the translator's error.<br />Still I recommend it because it has the \\"magic\\" that the reader was promised, in spite of the sometimes tedious plot in the second half.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Runs perfect on ics. Great little game. Best games are sometimes the most simplest. I highly recommend if you like puzzle games.
B001NI24OI|5.0|Great Movie, perfect example of FANATICS, by that I mean the parents, boosters, alumni and the townsfolk.  They put an enormous amount of pressure on the teens and the coach
0439023521|4.0|I rarely ever finish a book. This was definitely not the case with Hunger Games. From the very beginning I couldn't put it down. I literally read t everywhere nonstop. You owe it to yourself to read this book. This book renewed my joy for reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome!! this game is amazing..relaxing..frustrating..and quite addictive.  I never want the levels to end.  best thing..it was free in app of the day.  please continue to make more levels
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Outstanding series. Does the books justice. Really looking forward to season 2. The casting is excellent. Perfect choices for so many of the characters. Superb performances.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is amazing. It is a Leprechaun version of Super Mario Brothers... except it's free! This touchscreen game works great on the Kindle Fire. Man, this game is a steal!
B00005JMJG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters when first came out. It wasn't what I was expected, but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the movie even though it gave me a headache originally. I've only seen it one other time and still love it. If you do not like this movie, I think you either:<br />1. Don't like this type of movie, (for example movies that make you think)<br />2. Never have a passionate relationship or never had any relationship problems to even be able relate to the main characters.<br />3. Don't like the side side stories, (I admit, I don't really like Mark Ruffalo)<br />4. Didn't understand what was going on in the movie<br />5. Have a slow attention span<br /><br />Or maybe several of the above.
B0055SWM08|1.0|This free app will not download to my kindle fire.  This is causing major frustration.  I know 1st world problem.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is easy to play and lots of fun.  Highly recommend.  Only downside are the ads/promotions that appear prior to the start of the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a very relaxing game. It is usually played at the end of the nite.  No stress to this game. Lets one calm down before sleep.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a very simple solitaire app.  It is fun to play.  Easy to use and best of all free.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Music is literally everywhere, it's in the rhythm of a person's steps on concrete, in the rat-tat-tat on closed doorways, everywhere. It's simply a matter of, will you recognize it? Now every once in a while, you get lucky and come across some music, a certain album perhaps, or maybe just a few beats in a song, that strikes a chord in you and just *changes* your perspective, kind of shedding new light on old ideas. This album was one of those for me.<br /><br />\\"Epitaph\\" is now one of my favorite songs ever--simply beautiful and understated, a touch morose, but so wonderfully and artfully crafted. \\"The fate of all mankind, I see.. is in the hands of fools!\\" Ahhhh. All the songs in this are awe-inspiring. It's the perfect 'thinking music', if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Now, this is the first King Crimson album I'd ever listened to (yeah I know, the blasphemy), so I can't really compare it to others.. But I can say this: definitely give it a whirl, you won't regret it.
0765357151|5.0|I Am Legend is one of the best \\"after the plague has wiped out everyone else\\" books I have read. It's been made into three pretty good movies as well.
B005SLS3ZU|5.0|Reading this book was buzz.Would like more Mickey Haller character books.This as other Haller books makes for not only excellent courtroom reading but also the drama's outside the court room.
B0000AUHPB|1.0|I bought this DVD used a few months ago, I liked the 2003 version a lot and the DVD cover of this original version looked nice. The movie open with a red Lamborghini Miura who is running on a beautiful scenic road with entertaining music playing... until it hit a bulldozer parked on the middle of the road and explode, supposedly killing the likeable driver, and then ceremonially dumped off the cliff. Flowers are even thrown in the river. A similar thing happen in the 1979 Blake Edward's movie \\"10\\" where George Webber's yellow Rolls-Royce hit a police car, but apparently suffer only minor damages even if he use another car for the rest of the movie. I had seen the excellent movie \\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\\" a few years ago before seeing this one, so I have an excellent unadulterated opinion of Micheal Caine. The story didn't make any sense to me who was expecting a serious movie, I had to see it a second time to really understand they were intentionally making fun of him, like putting classy classical music when he act like a slob... I figure they told him they were filming a comedy...  Michael Caine's career, who look helpless and wear a dark blue suit for most scenes, apparently never recovered having for done that movie... There's also 3 making-of documentaries made recently on the DVD, the persons interviewed seem quite overwhelmed by what happened and seem to put the responsibility of the whole project to one of the producer... I can't understand why someone would want to do something like that to a excellent actor who didn't do anything to him... It should also be noted that this is the last movie in which the famous English playwright Noel Coward appear, he died of a heart attack in 1973... It may be unrelated, but after a very successful start in the 60s the Lamborghini carmaker was on the brink of bankruptcy when Ferrucio Lamborghini sold it in 1972, his financial troubles came when the South African and Bolivian government cancelled their orders of tractors who had already been manufactured in 1971... I'm not recommending this movie at all, it's a waste of time even when seen just out of curiosity, in fact the DVD is apparently out of print... It should be precised that in my opinion the 2003 movie with the same title is not really a remake, the story is similar but it was made differently...ho had already been manufactured in 1971... I'm not recommending this movie at all, it's a waste of time even when seen just out of curiosity, in fact the DVD is apparently out of print... It should be precised that in my opinion the 2003 movie with the same title is not really a remake, the story is similar but it was made differently...
B0059XTTW8|1.0|If you have ever seen the original \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" starring Alec Guinness, you will realize what a piece of junk this is.  There is simply no comparison between the Guinness movie and this one.<br /><br />I hope everyone who thinks this is such a great film will take the time to see the original \\"Tinker.\\"
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you're thinking of buying this, you're probably already familiar with GoT so I won't say anything about the series itself (which is awesome).  The collection itself is great.  It is well packaged, compact, but everything is preeettty easy to get to.  You will need a little space to fold it out.  I have mixed feelings on the foldout multi dvd packs, as they are much prettier, but you can't just open to your dvd.<br /><br />The extras are stupendous.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This was a surprise.  Engaging game requiring some logic. I highly recommend it. Hard to put down. You will enjoy it.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|I know whenever Incognito releases a new CD that there will be something special therin - even surreal! This comes in the form of The Way You Love, a fantastic, upbeat gem of a track with great hooks and inspired lyrics, superbly performed as you would expect from a tight ensemble of a band. Thanks Bluey, you always deliver the goods! Surreal is the real deal!!!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This is a really great game. Feels like im a real detective. It has a good similarity to law n order
B007MXOB4E|5.0|Awesome song in both English and Swedish! Can't stop listening to it. This is Sabaton at its very best. A must own for any fan!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob was a heart rendering tale of a family in crisis. The author kept me guessing and interested. The ending was realistic.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is a great movie it bring back old childhood memories that i can share with my children and hope in the near future they can share with their children as well
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great. It is like Mario but with Irish twist. Very entertaining. The graphics are good and levels challenging. Thanks for making a good game that keeps me interested.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome challenging game, fun to play, the music is a bit repetitive and annoying, but overall a fun game, recommend
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it it is a great game for kids and adults I like it and you should too I love this game it is great.
B0055SWM08|5.0|intuitive and fun. starts off easy, but gets really hard. finishing each stage is easy, but getting minimum moves is hard
B0034G4P4O|3.0|I agree with several reviewers that this is not the best movie ever.  If you have ever read any of the Tintin comics you will immediately feel that you've seen this before.  The producer/director just animated the comics.  They did a good job of the animation but you really didn't care much about the main character(s).  By the end of the movie I was just tired and wondered why the movie had gone on for so long and the final ending was basically a \\"meh\\" with a shoulder shrug (a la Gru's mom in Dispicable Me).<br />I honestly wondered why they even made a movie out of a little known Belgian comic book about a character who is a journalist who is somwhere between 12 and 20 years old.  If so, why isn't he in school and how is he a journalist and where does he get his money?
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun lots of levels, very well designed you can tell the devs spent time designing. I hope to see more from them
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|Too bad The Weinstein Company was so remiss in its production of the DVD Special Features. Why would it allow the producers to use the same warmed over interview bites in each piece? Somebody's asleep at the wheel, or they wouldn't have robbed their audience of fresh, new moments with Oscar winner Streep. Speaking of which, why not license a clip of Meryl's Oscar speech, red carpet and/or after party? Major fail over at TWC.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|reminds me of Super Mario. fun to play. so far no bugs very addictive. recommend to everyone who likes old school games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging, addictive, and fun. Highly recommended. Very clever. Simple, attractive graphics. Great hint system. Hours and hours of fun. Safe for children and adults.<br /><br />I was lucky to get it for free.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love that it is one of the only games that doesn't require an Internet connection... GREAT when I'm at work and bored
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very additive....reminds me of my alltime favorite game of Super Mario Bros! I would definitely recommend playing when ur bored
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So i kept hearing about this book and thought I'd give it a go. I wasn't dissapointed! It's pretty kinky which isn't something that attracts me to a book but lets face it, I read all three books in three days. The books have been getting some bad reviews, and sure they aren't super well written and the author does overuse words and phrases A LOT but I still got sucked in!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love it and i cant wait for the free updates. NER Brothers.....i just want to say u have done it. u jabe made us a masterpiece and for that we thank u
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the range of uses I use this app for: reading, devotionals, the Live feature is used at my church.  I do not do as much with it as I would due to the fact that so many of the features require real time internet connection.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Percy is not just an ordinary kid. He's the son of Poseidon!!!! As soon as he learns this, he starts Camp Half-Blood: a camp where kids that are half human, half god go to. These kids train to battle monsters and gods. Percy is one of these kids. He starts this camp and makes two friends: Annabeth Chase, daughter of Atheena and Grover Underwood, a satyr.<br /><br />It is now years later since then. Percy is now 14. When he returns, a surprise waits. Chiron has hired a new sword instructor: Quintus. When Quintus organises a training activity in the woods, Percy and Annabeth accidently stumble across a secret entrance to the labyrinth that Daedalus built. Percy questions Annabeth and it all goes back to Clarisses's secret scouting mission a few months before. Clarisse and Annabeth had been exploring the labyrinth and had been sent to find the nearest opening in the labyrinth next to Camp Half-Blood. The nearest was not that far away. But after the finding of the labyrinth, Annabeth realizes the camp is in danger. If Luke found the entrance into camp, all would be over. Luke and his men were exploring the labyrinth. After Annabeth tells Chiron everything that has been happening he grants Annabeth to lead a quest. Percy, Grover, and Tyson join. Their quest is to find their way into Daedalus's workshop and get Ariadne's string before Luke gets it and convince Daedalus to help them. Percy and his friends consult the oracle and then enter the labyrinth.<br /><br />In the labyrinth, Percy and his friends solve riddles, fight monsters, and witness the rising of Kronos!! Percy and his friends fight Kampe`, meet and fight the sphinx, and much more. Grover even finds Pan, his hero!!!!!!! I do not want to spoil anything else. This book has violence, but not really bad violence. If you can not read these books and are wondering what the age level is, I would say 8 and up. It is not inapropriate. All in all, this is a great book!<br /><br />My favorite part is the big ending at the end when Quintus, Briares, and Mrs. O' Leary show up. Kampe` is really cool. I love the part when Briares threw all those rocks at Kampe and buried her under. The only sign that showed she exited were two swords sticking out between the rocks. I also love when Percy fought Kampe at Alcatraz and rescued Briares. I love Kampe. She is awesome. I was really sad when Nico contacted his dead sister and had that depressing conversation. I love Bianca. I love Percy. I love this book.<br /><br />  -Julia
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is slow but hey I have the time to play it and I think its lots of fun!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love this game, it's just like a mario game! the only problem with it is it glitches sometimes and I get killed. but this is still one of my favorite games on my kindle fire!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is not only fun and challenging it is also soothing. I love the music the graphics and the puzzles. I would recommend this game to any and everyone.
B007R12TNQ|1.0|This movie is really lousy. It spends most of the time trying to incorporate annoying a cheesy pop culture into a lame and marginally entertaining story-line. If you liked the first movie and tolerated the second, this will make you never want to watch another chipmunks movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The gameplay is very enjoyable.  The difficulty progression its great so far, without huge jumps between levels.  The soundtrack is great, as well, and a perfect compliment to the environment my brain needs to solve the puzzles with the minimum number of moves. A+
B0054JZC6E|4.0|only bad thing about this is that it keeps on asking you to download different apps but otherwise it is pretty fun
B004S2W572|4.0|Killing Floor is certainly action packed and grabbed my attention quickly.  My main complaint is that the final confrontation was over way too fast for my taste.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I was never a big fan of the original Mario platform games but this a leprechaun with a mission. You are not stuck in front of a Tv it plays great on my Kindle Fire and being free doesn't hurt ether!!!
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this is exactly like super Mario brothers it is a copyright infringement and should be taken off of the store
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Five stars for Meryl Streep's and Jim Broadbent's performances (let's not forget Meryl's make-up artist of 30 years also won an Oscar) and two-stars for those who chose to dwell on Margaret Thatcher's latter years and gloss over her distinguished career as Prime Minister. As in other unauthorized movies and books, does any one for a minute believe that Margaret Thatcher's family, staff, and security would permit anyone other than her closest and valued friends and statesmen visit her.  Just as Nancy Regan cut off former President Ronald Regan attending public events and then visits from his closest friends and statesmen to protect him from being humiliated, so would those protecting Margaret Thatcher.  So, what was the source for three-fourths of this movie's subject matter-Margaret Thatcher's declining years?  Pure fiction!  A few of the reviewers suggested that this movie delved into a subject matter that some find difficult to deal with-dementia and Alzheimers...which IMO is more fiction.  The producers were speculating about Margaret Thatcher's latter years and in doing so, they showed their lack of information on dementia and Alzheimers. No, I would not see this movie again nor would I recommend it to anyone.  Whether you agree or disagree with Thatcher's views and abilities as Prime Minister-the Brits have every right to be furious and they are!
B004TSKKF4|5.0|i am a 15 yr old girl and i had watched this movie 2 yrs ago when i was 13 ... i loved it from the start ... i cried for a whole week ... i am a muslim girl and so at first found this a bit hard to understand but i eventually understood it ... after watching it over and over again i realized i wanted to be a doctor and find a cure for cancer or die trying ... i still do ... mostly for Jamie even though to most people she is not reeal to me she is very real ... i have just finished reading this book and have grown more in love with landon and jaimie ... they are my inspiration ... i do not care about the religion they follow or what they belives are ... i love them with all my heart and thank Nicholas Sparks for writing this book ... :')
B00005JKZV|5.0|The movie is great!  What I do not like about the movies, besides that in spite that they are wayyyy tooo looong, I do not like the endings.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|you do have to be patient, but the game is very entertaining in short spurts. I do wish you could play a bit longer, but energy does run out a bit fast. overall, I'm enjoying it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it when I'm bored an have nothing to do lol :) an u most likely always win :)
B000023VR9|5.0|This album is just as excellent as Dr. Dre's first album The chronic. Once again his beats and rapping is awesome. I will explain what my opinion of  each track one by one and tell you How many stars I'd Give each one out of five.<br />1. Lolo Intro - The introduction to the album. A skit at that skippable because I normally don't like skits.<br />2. The Watcher - This is an excellent opening song for the album that really gives you a great idea of what the tone of the album is. It has a great beat, intersting lyrics, a cool chours and the usual great rapping from Dre. 5 stars.<br />3. **** You - I am not really that fond of this track. I do like the beat a lot but I hate the way the chours is sung and this song has very uninteresting lyrics. The good beat cannot save this track. 2 stars<br />4. Still D.R.E. - An excellent track where Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg each come at full force and spit interesting lyrics about how they are the same way they were back in the early 1990s over an excellent beat to fit with all the rapping perfectly. 5 stars.<br />5. Big Egos - Another excellent track with a great beat, great rapping and a beautifully sung chours. 5 stars.<br />6. XXplosive - Another excellent track with a great guitar riff for the beat that makes it have a cool Rock n Roll sound to it. It also has great rapping and some beatiful tuneful singing by Nate Dogg. 5 Stars.<br />7. What's The Difference - Another excellent track with an interesting unique horn laced beat, Great rapping by Dr. Dre, Xzibit and Eminem, and interesting lyrics where Dr. Dre details his feelings towards his former N.W.A. Bandmates.  5 stars.<br />8. Bar One - A skit so I don't bother to give it a rating.<br />9. Light Speed - A cool track with a cool beat, great rapping and a well done chours that really sounds cool. 4.5 stars.<br />10. Forgot About Dre - An Excellent track with a fun bouncy beat where Dr. Dre speaks of how he deserves respect for all the contributions he's made to the rap music world. An Eminem being featured on it makes it even better. 5 stars.<br />11. The Next Episode - Another great track with just what I always expect from Dre a great beat, great rapping and a catchy chours. 5 stars.<br />12. Let's get High - a pretty good track with a cool beat but the rapping is not quite as good as in the other songs on the album but it's still good. 3.5 stars.<br />13. B***h N***az - A not so great track. the beat is not good like his other songs and the rapping is not good as usual. 2 stars.<br />14. The Car Bomb - A dramatic skit about a car bomb explosion in a car. I like this skit better than the other ones because of it's dramatic content.<br />15. Murder Ink. An Ok track but not one of my favorites. The beat is not quite as good as most of the beats on this album but it's still pretty good and Dre is not here to make the track excellent 3.5 stars.<br />16. Education - a plain old skippable skit.<br />17. Some L.A N***as - An ok track but not one of my faves on the album. 3 stars.<br />18. Pause 4 **** Skippable skit.<br />19. Housewife - A great track with great rapping and beats.5  stars.<br />20. Ackrite. A cool track with a cool bassline for the beat. 4 stars.<br />21. Bang Bang A great track with cool rapping, a great beat and intersting sound effects for the chours. 4.5 stars.<br />22. The Message - A great track honoring his late brother Tyree with a great mellow harp for the beat. 5 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's actually the first free app of the day from Amazon that I've enjoyed. Quell is simple yet fun and a bit addicting. I would spend the .99 cents if I had too knowing what I know now about this game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found this book to be an entertaining romance novel. I read it in one day and couldn't put it down. And that to me is a good book but it is not a work of fine literature. It is a good, easy to read story.<br /><br />It is an interesting look at the BDSM lifestyle and how someone so unfamiliar with it could attempt to adapt to it. An issue with this book to me is to believe that there is a girl in the world that at 21 was a virgin and had never masturbated. Maybe the virgin part I could see but the never touching herself part is hard to swallow.<br /><br />I am probably giving it a worse rating than it deserves because the remaining 2 books have annoyed me. The potential for a great story was there and in my opinion they ruined it in the 2nd book.<br /><br />And also the fact that the Kindle edition was 9.99 and you can't even loan the book out is extremely frustrating.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a lot like the version I played in school. just updated. so much fun. works great on my kindle fire.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to read this book due to content of it. Several gf's of mine had read it and would speak non stop about it. This book was a wonderful change of than my usual reads. The book leaves you wanting more! A must read for all you adult women out there looking for a quick escape.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|this app is good. but two levels for three bucks l. not worth it! I mean why cant we buy the regular version for 99 cents! and for apple users the free version has three levels packs! the danger zone pack wont come out for another 2 months on the android market. I'm just trying ti save peoples money. or just wait for the dangerzone level pack in 2 months. if the game was the reguler 99 cent version and had the the danger zone level pack then I would have put a good review.
B007PZ6T80|5.0|The title of the customer's comment is misleading.  There is a standard def DVD inside the package and the comment says \\"no standard def dvd\\", which is not true.<br />The customer is rating a product because they don't have a Blu-ray player, but fail to mention they can CERTAINLY play the standard definition DVD inside, which contains all the same special features as the Blu-ray, but in DVD format. The film is a combo pack, and the picture included in the listing clearly shows it also contains a standard definition DVD version inside.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Sigh...where to start with this book.<br /><br />For starters totally not worth $30 for the series. That's just insane. I'm actually ashamed I spent that much.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first book. The second book pissed me off completely and the third was just unnecessary. They should have stopped at the second...well really the first but they definitely should not have gone to the third.<br /><br />I've heard that this was fanfic for the Twilight series which I did not get while reading the story. It wasn't until after I heard the fanfic part that I realized there were a lot of parallels.<br /><br />This book is pretty much the same exact story as the second book. Totally redundant, much like the words and phrases the author uses. No character development, nothing was gained.<br /><br />Spoilers***<br /><br />Yes Christian had an epiphany at the end but with nothing to show that it was more than a fleeting moment. After pretty much 3 whole books of showing him as a crazy control freak with huge insecurities they couldn't spend a little time showing him not being an insecure control freak?<br /><br />Ana getting pregnant was horrible. I hated that ending. It was unnecessary. I don't think it added to the story line and would have been a better (albeit not great) book without it.<br /><br />And as I have complained on the other 2 Kindle editions, not being able to loan this book out sucks, especially after what I paid for them.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing this in school I love this game it brings back if you haven't played this game you need to

B0055SWM08|5.0|Thought through every little thing, and made it great.<br />Nothing makes me hate this app. Love the clean and simple graphics.
B00715SUI6|3.0|Overall, this movie was probably more fun to make than to watch. I guess if you havent seen anything like this before, which I hardly will watch anything of this sort, it was not too shabby. Not too scary and not too messy.<br /><br />So I give it an overall 3 star rating.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I had never played Quell. Didn't even know this game was a classic. I cannot put it down on my Kindle.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|This film deserved a far better fate than it got. It was well done. I saw a film review that said it was confusing, but a fun ride. Balderdash! It was not confusing at all. Could it have been improved? What film can't? This should have been a blockbuster. But the anti-hype destroyed it. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it. And then kick yourself if you bought into the anti-hype. It was and is a very fun ride.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep does an outstanding job portraying Margaret Thatcher! My main problem with the movie, is that they tell the story of Margaret Thatcher's life in a series of flashbacks. The movie focuses too much on the fact that she's suffering from dementia now due to several mini-strokes and the majority of the movie is set in a nursing home. The movie portrays her as an addled old lady who hallucinates that she's talking to her dead husband and remembering her time as Prime Minister by flashbacks. (Now it is a real-life fact that her daughter Carol says that Maggie is going through dementia and has to be constantly reminded that her husband died almost 10 years ago) but they could've focused more on her time as Prime Minister in the prime of her life and her brilliant speeches, etc and what she was and not how she's declined in recent years. This movie is ultimately a disservice to Margaret Thatcher as a person. While it hits the highlights of her time as Prime Minister, they shouldn't have portrayed her as a confused old lady. Don't get me wrong, Meryl Streep deserved the Oscar she got for the movie, but they could've structured it differently; ultimately a huge disappointment!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I've been looking for a game like this for a LONG time!  If you loved playing Mario's World then you need this game!  Plus it's
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is a lot of fun lots of levels that make you think more and more  thanks for the free app
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this reminds me so much of Mario bros. so fun. the graphics are great and I found no glitches at all.  great game.
0345456343|5.0|I love the first three (and argueably best) books of the Vampire Chronicles.<br /><br />If you're contemplating 'plunging into the stream' (the words that the Vampire Lestat himself 'lives' by) by giving Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles a try, than buy this particular version. I can't recommend it enough. [[ASIN:B007MHNMKY NightWatch]]
0439023521|3.0|The whole the book I was waiting for something to happen. I wanted Katniss to make a decision to have to make a hard choice but every time it came to that point luck had it that she didnt have to make it. The author does a good job at keeping the reader anticipating what will happen next but that is pretty much all that happens in the book. If you are bored and want something to waste your time on go ahead and read the book. It will keep you excited and disengaged from reality.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I read through many of the reviews before purchasing this Kindle cover, and am very glad I listened to the majority! It does fit! The elastics hold it in place very nicely and the \\"book cover\\" closes nicely too. I love it. It makes carrying my Kindle around very easy and I love the feel of the material, it's solid and soft.  I'm very happy with it and strongly recommend it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|My mother in law actually got me started on this and now I cant put it down!! so much fun!!
B004O3YGMC|2.0|I don't like the fact that, when I connect to the PC, the PCs screen size changes to fit the Android.<br />Other than that, it was very easy to use.
B0001AP13A|1.0|I just received this album today.  It's terrible.  The entire album and every song on it skips terribly!!  I want a refund or a replacement that WORKS!!!  I hope this will get to the right people for that to happen.  Extremely disappointed to say the least.
0380725398|5.0|Another great book by De Maurier. She leads you through the hardships of Mary that her Uncle Josh puts her through to the love of his brother. The horror of Josh's business and the insanity of her Aunt. Another book you can't put down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun set of a variety of games. I am mostly doing this review to get a bunch more points to unlock more games. hope it works.
0345803485|2.0|I know I am giving this 2 stars even though I am already reading the second book. It's only because I don't like to be left hanging!<br /><br />After the fifth sex scene I just started to skip the pages until I got back to the real story. The first sex scene was shocking and thought to myself \\"wowza!\\" but as they keep coming I kept \\"rolling my eyes\\" as much as Ana does as I read on.<br /><br />The book is insufferably repetitive and the same words and phrases are used over and over again. For example:<br />-\\"lips pressed into a hard line\\"<br />-\\"inner goddess\\"<br />-\\"flushed\\" or \\"blushed\\"<br />-rolling eyes<br />-eyes burning<br />-orgasm<br /><br />Ana annoys me and I can't quite place the reason why. I actually felt more sympathy for Christian than I did for Ana. Maybe it's the fact that she sounds like a huge hypocrite.<br /><br />Aside from the exceptions, what normal 23 year old college student has NEVER touched themselves, never got drunk, never did anything other than KISS someone... But then meets some guy and all of a sudden loses her virginity within a week and engages in S&M?
B0055SWM08|4.0|Great game but cannot give 5 stars due to being nagged to rate and like on Facebook. Chops/lags occasionally on RAZR  MAXX
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so much like Mario. when I first saw the photos,  It reminded me of Mario. It just looks so cool
B0055SWM08|4.0|gone through about 10 levels playing on my kindle fire and have not had any of the problems mentioned in prior reviews. relaxing, somewhat challenging as you get further along. good, mellow mind game to clear my head between reading books. I gave it a 4 star simply because Imo I just don't think its a &quot;WOW&quot; game.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I've read the books and appreciate the series' excellent translation into video.  Characters are true to the book, map openings are brilliant, acting, costumes and scenery are wonderful.  'Eager to see season II.
1568363931|5.0|I'm really glad i got this book cause it is every thing i needed. it gives lots of information and some really good recipes, japanese and other kinds, and it has a glossary of the japanese ingredients mention in lots of the recipes. It was a big help for me. all in all its a great book
B0055SWM08|5.0|its a calm puzzle game. it makes you think, but wont make you so frustrated and unable to finish. !
B007PTJOV0|1.0|what in the heck! this is a damn knock-off of mario! and to all of you block heads who gave this 5 stars, play this BS and play mario. look and think, &quot;hmm this looks exactly like mario bros.&quot;
B004X80QNG|1.0|how can such a strong app sellout just to generate sales on Fire? App is useless without Google calendar sync. How do I get my money back? Uninstalled after 5 MINUTES....
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is great. 5 stars for sure. the window frame background is pretty.  Everybody should download this. I love it
B0050DIWHU|5.0|Great book for restarting your career in this new and social world.  Provides relevant examples of how current companies and people have navigated this competitive marketplace.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best games ever played for all night so addicting so I wanna say everybody should download this app and play it so awesome
B000L53D4O|5.0|My daughter has FOUR different walkers and this one is the best.  Our other walkers have the following issues: her feet hit the wheels b/c they are too close together, they tip over easily, they're not engaging enough to keep her attention or the wheels do not move easily causing her to exert more effort.  This walker has none of these issues.  It's a great item for a FAB price.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful book! I cried, well teared up at a few parts of the book. Excellent read due to its combination of sci-fi and reality. Grabs your attention quickly and then you just have to finish to book. I'd recommend it to anyone.<br /><br /> P.S. The movie doesnt do it justice so if you saw it and liked it, the book is a MILLION times better!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this app! It's one of the best puzzle games I've played on my android phone. Gameplay is great too.
B000M06SU4|5.0|I love this album it sounds like I'm back at the show in Vegas it is wonderful to listen too
B005ZUR724|1.0|I can not get on the game it has downloading problems please fix this I am craving to play this game so bad.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Small and handy for a quick touch up for work knives. I would not use this sharpener on a good blade. That is why I give it 3 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well designed. Fun and challenging. Peaceful music. Quick levels perfect to squeeze in when you don't really have time to be playing a game.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|My work team is located all around the US, some of us decided on a Saturday to hold a virtual tea party and watch the Downton Abbey Christmas show. It was great fun and we conference called via our iPhones afterwards. This was an excellent experience.  Everyone has their favorite characters.  I'd definitely recommend this video and all the Downton Abbey Season 1 & 2.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its pretty awesome<br /><br />its a really really fun game. because its just like. Mario and Mario is awesome really awesome I loved it a lot
B0077ATSU4|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />There aren't enough Schells in the world. That's the way I felt after watching Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close. Society tends to dictate what should be important to us.<br />Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father, Thomas (Tom Hanks), walk to a different drum beat.<br />Thomas, who hums \\"I Am the Walrus,\\"'is constantly creating games for his 9-year-old son, Oskar. These are not a-typical games, but adventures where the youngster must visit odd places, talk to complete strangers and read many books to solve riddles.<br />The games stop on 9/11. Thomas, a jeweler by trade, has a meeting in the World Trade Center when the planes hit. He makes repeated calls home, which Oskar hears later via the answering machine. Their is no body in the casket for the funeral so Oskar has no closure.<br />He can't help but think this is another elaborate puzzle his father has left behind to solve.<br />It begins when he finds a key inside a small manila envelope inside of a blue vase. The envelope has the word \\"Black\\" on it. Oskar sets out on an adventure to locate every person, with the last name Black in New York City. Along the way, Oskar meets an elderly gentleman, Max von Sydow, who rents an apartment from his grandmother. The renter can't speak but instead writes notes to Oskar. The odd couple become closer as they search for clues.<br />Oskar resents his mother, Linda Schell (Sandra Bullock), because she wasn't there when his dad called home on that fateful day so he keeps his activities a secret from her.<br />In the end, Oskar doesn't find what he thinks he's looking for but much, much more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Tried it out on the train today. Made the ride go by quick.  The multiple levels keep you going especially if you don't get a perfect score.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It is great to get to know, a little better, the life of a mere mortal that changed the world as it is! I couldn't have read this book better that on my iPad. Great links with social network and all of the awesome links with dictionaries, how to highlight, anyway, loved it!
B004P95A8E|5.0|It cost my $24.56, my son is interesting in building LEGO. This set have 3 minifigure: Ki-Adi MundiACommander CodyAGeonosian. But the Geonosian have not wings
B0076R62FM|4.0|This was one of the funniest movies that i have seen in a while. It kept me laughing all the way through it.
B005ZOCFCW|5.0|Book is excellent.  It is well written and classic espionage but the movie has a lot to be desired. Even though the book goes back and forth, it keeps your attention.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very easy to pick up, and increases difficulty at a steady, appropriate pace.<br /><br />I honestly have nothing negative to say about it.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|it was a very enjoyable series and how they lived in the early dys of society, with the difficulties of society and how they considered the servants as family
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was so excited to see this as the faotd. It's a lot of fun and it's different from most games!@
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely excellent!  Both seasons are five star in my book!  Great period piece, and great cast. can't wait for season 3 disc.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|works great, easy to use. great graphics, usually I don't like these types of games, but this one is fun!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Boring repeated sex scenes would only be interesting to a preteen male.  Nice writing style and maybe an ok story, even if it is pretty shallow.  I wasted by time and resent the hype.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|It may have been written for children, but I am a senior citizen and loved it.  It shows the problems that can occur when government has total control.  There is a lesson for everyone to learn from this novel.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome I love it it is so fun to play this game is one of my favorite game fun for all ages
B0055SWM08|5.0|AWESOME GAME. You need to try this game it is a simple game concept played well. get it when it is free.
B007MU85D0|3.0|The debut album from Of Monster and Men have drawn comparisons to Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros and frankly the comparison is apt. Great minds think alike. I see that as a positive thing because frankly Sharpe and cohorts don't get the recognition they deserve and to the extent that Of Monsters and Men draw more people to this particular musical sound I'm all for it. Yet at the same time that's my problem with this album. For me the weakness of this album is that all the songs sound the same. The debut single \\"Small Talks\\" is excellent and deserves the play it's getting. But once you've heard that song the rest of the album sounds basically the same. Some will undoubtedly see this consistency as a virtue but I found that it tended to drag the album down. About half way through my first play through I found myself thinking, \\"Well this is great but what else can they do?\\" I never got the sense that the artists were revealing themselves or exploring their boundaries; rather I got the definite sense that once they found a formula that worked they were going to milk it for all it's worth.<br /><br />I guess that's another way of saying that I like this sound but I found the songwriting too formulaic. At least half the songs have someone singing \\"la la la\\" somewhere and the rest of the songs someone shouting \\"hey!\\". I concluded that all those la la la's and the hey hey hey's were there to make sure that the six band members all had something to do and didn't fall asleep from boredom rather than actually serving any artistic purpose.<br /><br />Sounds good but lacks character. One could certainly spend five dollars on worse things, just don't except to be blown away by an excess of artistic expression.
B000025SL5|5.0|Yet another wonderful cd to add to my growing Vangelis collection.  Just a hint of rennaisance to capture the mood.  Have listened to it over and over.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|I was first skeptical of purchasing this item due to the number of people that say the picture quality is bad. To start things off, no, it is not 7.1 surround (it's 5.1). I'm fine with that, though, because this movie doesn't really need it. No choppers flying overhead or crazy sound effects. The picture is great though. It is not as good as Avatar on Blu-ray, but is still a good 1080 picture. I'm thinking WB Studios has responded to feedback about it being bad, because my dad purchased Ocean's 11 on Blu-ray a couple of years ago, and I instantly noticed that it was not a Blu-ray worthy picture. These discs are just fine and dandy though. Then when you throw in the 13.99 price I paid shipped-from and sold-by Amazon, it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE: I went back and looked at Ocean's 11 on my DVR when it was aired in 1080p. THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE ARE CUT OFF ON THE BLU-RAY. I thought the black spaces at the top and bottom of the Blu-ray picture (I have a 16:9 screen tv) were because they just made it really wide screen and added to the picture on the sides, BUT, this is not the case. They simply chopped off the top and bottom for no reason.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is just like Mario brothers the game. Mario brothers is awesome my little sister is literally addicted. to this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very entertaining, challenging, yet peaceful game. I find myself relaxing as my brain is working. The music is a nice touch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love to play games.  now I get to play as much as I want and still get to play new games every day.
0061997811|4.0|Wanted some graphics to scan for a scrapbook, but in the end we're just glad we bought this for the content itself. We're huge HP fans and this is so cool!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Great game, really fun and entertaining. One mega flaw: even if your sound is off on your device and this game, every so often it will start beeping, and send a notification that just says &quot;Oregan Trail&quot;. Really annoying when it goes off at 3 O&quot; clock in the morning the night before you have a big test.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great app that makes you appreciate how we started out in this world. Only wish that your energy would replenish faster!
B0055SWM08|5.0|easily the best game ive played on my kindle, its well worth the price and a simple fun puzzle game
B007PTJOV0|1.0|tucking game keeps opening its facebook page anytime I use the web. way to take over even when i delete the app
B007PTJOV0|4.0|pretty good game it does remind me of mario alot but is very original at the same time. just wishe he would move faster :/  and maybe some power ups would be good too ;)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I checked this book out through library loan on my Kindle.  I am always concerned about the 2 week lending period. There are times when I just don't have time to read and what if I get busy and don't have time to finish the book, but this book I made sure I found the time.  Once I started it I couldn't quit reading.  The story line caught me from the beginning.  The characters were well developed and it was easy to step inside the family and their situation.  What made the book so intriguing for me, was sympathy for the parents in trying to believe in their son, and at the same time keep their own lives intact. I enjoyed the way the author incorporated the court testimony into the story, but keeps you from realizing until the end what the testimony is actually discussing, even though you think you know all along. I enjoy crime dramas, but I thought this one had a unique twist that made it more than a run of the mill crime story.
B000THGR0Q|5.0|A great replacement for a now unplayable LP.  Songs sound as fresh now as they did in the 70's and certainly took me back.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by my son's physical therapist. She was right- it's a fantastic movie! It's also a great movie for kids to watch. They will see what it's like for another child to grow up with a disability ane watch them succeed.
B005TVYVI2|3.0|I wanted to use the tempo trainer for running.  I wanted a fast pace during short running intervals.  I found it to be inconvenient to operate during the run.  There are other pacers available that are much cheaper and work easier.  For swimmers, the device may be fine, but it's not so good for runners.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that the game is fun just because you get to get points to unlock new games. love it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm addicted to this app! !! It is one of my personal favorite .. I cant stop playing .. I love it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved all the books.  The story was very well written.<br />I think male and female young adults and up will also love reading the stories.<br />I tell all my fiends that they should get the books.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|There is a resonance with these guys with legends from the past, but it is fresh and original.  I first heard them on Conan (\\"Hold On\\") a couple of months ago, and soon after pre-ordered this CD and was not disappointed.  This is one of those records you throw in, turn up, and jam with, and it seems to hit a nice mix of highs, lows and in-betweens.  It's like listening to the voice-child of Janis and Adele with a rough a dirty sound that ends up playing itself clean.  My ears are pleased with this refreshing debut; I'm all for a little throw-back to the classics peppered with some contemporary.
B004SIP6N6|5.0|For those who don't know this Film includes both the Theathrical and Directors cut, the Directors Cut is interesting just to see and know the Origins, but the Picture and Sound are Horrible, the real Gem is the Nicely Polished Theatrical Version.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I think this game is a pretty cool game it kept me occupied at the doc's office today i would recommend this game maybe not to buy but as the free app of the day it is cool ;-)
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of Puss in Boots from the popular SHREK franchise but there's something lacking in this film. It has its high moments but it also has some flat moments. Some of the moments that should have been funny were not yet others that should have been not so good were funny. The cats with Puss had some of the best gags. Some of the other notable voices were: Salma Hayek, Latifa Quaou, Billy Bob Thornton and Guillermo del Toro. There's a very nice sound track in this picture, too, arguably more engaging than parts of the tale.  The budget was $130M and it made a whopping $548M plus at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; HUMOR: B minus; ACTION: B minus; ANIMATION: B; WHEN WATCHED: early April 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.
B0055SWM08|5.0|intriguing, beautiful game.  I found it relaxing,peaceful, and fun.  Especially love the music by Steven Cravis.  I remember playing some flash games awhile back with music by him which also had a unique,peaceful feeling to them.  will be looking for more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was hesitant to download this game but I am glad my husband talked me into it. it's addicting. my kind of game
0307888681|2.0|SO who hasnt heard about this book \\"soon to become a major motion picture\\".. Surely you have its on the book cover proudly. My question is.. WHY?????.. -face palm- I give everything a chance.. heck i finished the book and didnt rush it, as i would a book that im over.<br />But i kept giving this book the any time now its going to pick up and change my mind about this chance.. i mean it has to right, look at the \\"5 star reviews\\", wrong. The book is original this will be given, clearly its a different style, but its not what you want from your zombie novel. Atleast in my opinion, i didnt, From the first 50 pages in i was like crap i am not pulled into this at all, i dont feel like im becoming lost in the novel, and im not feeling the \\"interviewing style\\" of the writing. To me it took away chances to get into deeper detail that the book didnt go into, it leaves it very dry and desiring more.<br />Besides the \\"main character\\" being just a handful of lines each chapter hes almost non-existent and not important!. And people are flipping about brad pitt being this character why? for a handful of lines?.. Hollywood will hack job this book to put him in it more if thats the case, whos willing to bet? One of the other problems i found with the story was the interviewes just went on beyond what needed to be \\"documented\\". Sometimes you find books where you read paragraphs that just seem like fillers to take up space and get the book to its goal. I found myself a few times asking why is this person still babling about nothing and how many more pages do they get, because their \\"story\\" just lacks draw~in power and depth to the situation. And a few people get way too much space about nothing special or particular to the importance of the zombie war. Besides the blind samurai story, no other event really stands out to a \\"memorible factor\\" in my opinion. The action, or suspense, drama, vivid details there just isnt any :\<br />Brooks does a good job of creating a unique answer to the zombies and the post zombie ordeal, but the characters are just dull and dont come off any other way other than robotic. Maybe that was his point, we lost all moral and human features like humor or sarcasm. Each person just talks in the same style noone has a clear difference about them, just bland and seeming to drag on their side of the \\"story\\".<br /><br />I guess i just didnt get the message that so many others seemed to find in their edition of the book, but to me this was a let down, i dont get the hype behind this one. 2 stars might be generous, but 1 star was hate it and i atleast liked the one story through the whole book.zombies and the post zombie ordeal, but the characters are just dull and dont come off any other way other than robotic.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a fun book that you will not have to put much thought into and can just relax and enjoy. The emails back and forth from Christian and Ana are fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game.  Lots of fun.  Haven't been able to put it down since installing.  Did I mention its lots of fun?
B0023P1D8S|4.0|Yes, I know this is an import. But, I can't understand why someone thinks that we should pay double the price for a second disc of demos and outtakes. There's a reason this stuff never made the disc in the first place: the quality level is not anywhere near as high. These extra tracks should be thrown in for next to nothing, because they are rarely worth more than that. Such is the case here. This is a superb Sabbath record, but the price is far too high for this \\"deluxe\\" version. Stick with the original single disc, or look for this on Ebay at a much lower price. I paid $18 for it.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I bought this book based on the thousands of five star reviews. I read a lot, but haven't read too much sci-fi and wanted to *broaden my literary horizons*<br />After struggling through the first half of the book, I finally decided that life is too short and gave up. It is undoubtedly well written, unarguably original and thought provoking....yet I found it criminally BORING. The lack of a real plot is what really lets the novel down. Undeveloped charcters and weak sub plots don't help things along either. Page after page of six year olds showcasing their battle tactics in some kind of zero gravity arena in space just isn't everybody's cup of tea.
