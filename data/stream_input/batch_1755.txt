0060930349|5.0|One of the most interesting and comprehensive books on the formulation of our country one is likely to find.  No matter what your present knowledge  if US history is, you will find at least &#34;Gee. I never knew that&#34; on every page.<br /><br />Thoroughly entertaining and informative
B009H442DG|5.0|Great Christmas CD from John and Olivia!  A great gift!  Highlight is \\"I think you might like it\\"<br />I wonder if this song will be released to radio?? Actually its a great song to dance to!! Where is the<br />video?
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The movie was fun and entertaining. Boys will like the movie too. Fn for the whole family. Three more words.
B008KE3960|5.0|Loads of play, intuitive, but with lots of variation. Good simple fun game. Fun aircraft, and a variety of tank to blow up.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Controls are touchy but lots of fun for an ex Mario player!<br />  Probably boring for the younger generation but keeps a 50 year old entertained!
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|I'm sure this was much better in the theaters and in 3D. The animation was pretty nice and the visuals were probably pretty amazing in the theater. It's just that the story was kind of dumb. I like the idea of a girl who wants to change her destiny from one of being married off to one in which she has a say and think it's empowering for young girls. However, her mom gets turned into a bear? We were sitting there going, who came up with this idea?
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Enough said in headline.  It's a great prequel-of-sorts within the Alien universe.  Apparently, this'll be the first of three films and it'll be interesting to see the next chapter.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was a wonderful book. I could not put it down! Great read, I would highly recommend this book read it soon
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I expected a lot more action.  Villains were very disappointing.  The movie was decent, but it DID NOT live up to they hype.  Again, the movie was alright, but I expected much more.  Very big let down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really a great book and once u pick it up u won't be able to put it down, great story and characters
B001USHRCK|5.0|I have many, many, many castle sets and pieces.  The thing I was really missing was a village.  I bought 3 of these sets.  The amount of pieces for the money is really worth it.  A must have to go with any large castle set.  And yes, I'm 30 and still play with legos!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great, it was enjoyable.  The great war was horrible.  I hope young people read this and understand that peace has a cost.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|1 I like it because its kinnda like facebook<br />2 because me and my friends think that its only lent for like if you r bored
B000FC0O7M|5.0|I know Gene and it was great to hear this story from his perspective. A great book.  Definite great buy.
B005KELQEU|5.0|i really like this case, as it feels very protective for 15$. i can take my kindle wherever i want without worrying about the screen getting scratch in my bag.
B000002KNY|5.0|Kicking off with the celebratory \\"I Zimbra\\" and closing with the haunting spaciness of \\"Drugs,\\" \\"Fear Of Music\\" was the first album where Talking Heads managed to mix all their influences for the first time as a whole. The funkiness that seemed buried under the surface of the previous two albums comes to fruition on the classic \\"Life During Wartime,\\" and the experiments that just seemed like art-school JO came into musical fullness. This was the Talking Heads' ode to New York City, and it still holds as one of their finest albums.<br /><br />There's a lot of rumbling claustrophobia (\\"Cities\\") wonder at the outside world (\\"Animals\\") and general anxiety (\\"Memories Can't Wait,\\" \\"Heaven.\\") I always thought that this was the album where David Byrne stopped thinking about inner city paranoia and actually statrted seeing bodies dangling from hooks on the walls; hence his fear of \\"Air\\" and dread of \\"Life During Wartime.\\" Even with Byrne's more pointed mindset, this would be for nothing if the rest of the band wasn't pulling their weight. Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz score points for their rhythm chops. It is their propulsion that takes \\"Wartime\\" and \\"I Zimbra\\" into dance turf, and Jerry Harrison's guitar and keyboards add the the enigmatic swirl.<br /><br />This is obviously a bridge album given how the danceable throb of muscle that was \\"Fear Of Music\\" would ultimately give way the the polyrhythms of \\"Remain In Light\\" (and the Byrne/Eno project \\"My Life In The Bush of Ghosts\\"). But for this moment, the Talking Heads took their NYC Arthouse Groove and served it up to a mainstream audience in the quirkiest form of anxiety ridden pop. Next to the friendly accessibility of \\"Little Creatures,\\" my favorite Talking Heads album.
B009CPES4I|5.0|A look at India that has been describe by others as accurate.<br /><br />Very Good Entertainment.  I strongly recommend this Movie.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Good sound, helps game play a lot. Wireless doesn't reach that far. Not sure if it was worth the price paid.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent calculator.  Even superior to Microsoft's version.  You can call back any of the previous steps.  And it is very readable on my Kindle Fire.
0316228532|1.0|I went through some of the reviews for this widely anticipated book. JK Rowling, the totally famous author of the Harry Potter books, I even excepted something different because she had not previously been an author writing \\"adult\\" books.<br />Maybe my expectations were too high, but as an adult I assume the level of writing is going to be something more, something approaching a level of life one achieves.<br />I felt like it was reading something that I might have given one of my grandchildren, but in hindsight, even they challenge themselves with something more. The pace tedious, the word comprehension level more of a sixth grade level, throwing a tid bit of something sexy and maybe a four letter word does not make a book become \\"adult\\". It was boring and difficult to plod through!<br />I was enormously glad that it had been a library loan and not something I had paid out cold cash for.....Please Rowling stick to adolescent books, attaining an adult level book is obviously too strenous!<br />My favorite British authors inlude Ruth Rendell, PD James, EM Forster, Jane Austin and the Bronte sisters, so you can see it runs the gamut from period romance to current day suspense. But there was no suspense in Casual Vacancy!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Not a bad game before they got too hard to solve! Now, instead of reducing my stress doing something mindless, I have increased it as I get frustrated trying to solve!
1554072840|5.0|I was amazed that a book could actually help my almost three-year-old daughter to finally be interested in using the potty, but this did! I love that the book is up-front about what happens on the potty. You can change the terminology as you read it to your child to fit the words you typically use.  My daughter was using the regular toilet, but it didn't bother her that the girl in the book uses a child's potty. I just kind of skipped over the part where they dump the contents of the potty into the toilet :)
B0041KVWI4|5.0|The vinyl remasters of the Beatles albums has finally arrived. Sad that so many bad pressings are out there. As for my copy of Magical Mystery Tour it played great and the sound was awesome on my JVC QLY-55F turntable. It was crisp and clear. Played quietly from start to finish. I have purchased other titles and I hope I am as lucky with my copies of those remasters as well. Even though the Beatles broke up when I was 8 years old they have always been my favorite band of all time and even my children love them. The Beatles are like good wine they just age well !
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|this app would not work for my kindle fire hd. i couldnt find any locations. this app isnt worth a penny. do not buy.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|This is my third review of a Beatles remaster. I seem to have got a nearly perfect pressing. It sounds as good as I have ever heard on vinyl. I have only one complaint and that during the song &#34;Good Morning, Good Morning&#34; the funky sax sound seems distorted during a couple of high notes. To the point it seems harsh ! However i went to my Blue box collection and noticed that it to sounds harsh in those same places but not as much. Not sure why this did not get fixed in remaster as it also does this on my old CD copy. All in all it was great
0345525558|5.0|Did not enjoy the main character at all, although it was an interesting book. The information about flowers was new to me.
B0041KVZ1I|4.0|The sound quality of this remaster is great ! Sad to say it does have a few pressing issues! Not sure if I will keep or send back to try and get a flawless copy of my favorite Beatles album. My copy sounds great except for song 5 on 1st side &#34;Octopus's Garden&#34; Has a scratching noise in 3 or 4 places. On side 2 song 3 &#34; You Never Give Me Your Money&#34; also has a fair amount of surface noise and scratching while the song plays but not as noticeable as on &#34;Octopus's Garden &#34; . I really wanted this one to be perfect. It sad that Rainbow Records let these leave the factory. They landed the Holy Grail of the vinyl record pressing business and dropped the ball. I hope they review the  issues and fix them and I hope they at least step up and make things right with retailers and customers. I will probably try to get a perfect copy ! Hope I'm not searching for my own Holy Grail !!!! The music is awesome none the less.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I wanted a basic no nonsense case for my Kindle Fire and this case does everything it's supposed to do.  I feel it is a great value for the money.

B009VSW15Y|4.0|Didn't realize the HD did not come with its own camera software so downloaded this and right away was able to take pictures and video. I just need to learn how to hold the thing.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave has a fresh, child friendly storyline that's fun for adults as well. I look forward to more new stories in this genre.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I do not consider it a camera when its only used to take pictures of yourself.  If i had known this i would have never purchased this app.

1250000971|4.0|DON'T READ THIS, START WITH THE FIRST BOOK:  Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles)<br /><br />Another installment in the Harry Clifton series.  This starts with Harry being apprehended in New York when he assumes the identity of a man, who is unfortunately wanted for murder. The story progresses through the whole set of the Barrington and Clifton characters from the first book and finishes at the end of WWII with Harry and Emma reunited.  Archer makes his back and forth methodology between characters stories work to make a cohesive whole.  Archer seems to have developed the appropriate ratio of dialogue and narrative to give the characters life yet keeps the  story moving along.  In the end, this is a very pleasent enjoyable read.  I just hope Archer keeps it going and gets it done...because...well....he's not getting any younger.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Susan's very best album! Songs from her heart to ours. From the sweetest voice to come along in ages. Bravo!
1455519006|4.0|A government assassin faced with a questionable hit fails to complete his mission.  In the aftermath he picks up an errant teenager while escaping and finds that she's somehow intertwined in the fabric of this hit gone awry.  He tries to protect her from unknown forces as the situation progresses and he gets designated to find out why this questionable hit was even assigned.  As the case progresses, witnesses start dying in his hands and he begins to suspect a cat and mouse game with him at the center and plenty of unidentified traitors in the ranks.<br /><br />This is quintessential Baldacci.  Engaging characters, tension, gunfights and a reasonable pace to keep you from getting bored.  This story can be read stand-alone, i.e. if you've never read Baldacci before, you can read this one with out crossing other book plot lines.<br /><br />Cons:  At the end, I didn't think there was sufficient info explaining how so many people could have been involved on the bad guy side.<br /><br />Pros:  A good action mystery read.
B009K0P10K|5.0|So addictive, watched both seasons over a long weekend. Gotta get past the first episode then you're hooked, can't wait for next episode to air
0446604844|3.0|A corporate tech officer stumbles on a secret, which gets him framed for murder and his lawyer wife (the main character) hounded by the FBI, her partners, and corporate bigwigs until she can figure things out.  This is an early (1996) Baldacci novel.  Baldacci seems to be worried a bit about plausibility, which initially drags this back toward the mundane.  Generally the limits of credulity need to stretched just a bit to make a truly entertaining novel.  If you get caught up in the \\"everything has to make sense and fit perfectly\\" mold, typically the story loses something.  That point is true here.  The characters are almost normal....and slightly boring.  At this point in his career Baldacci hadn't figured out how to make us fall in love with his characters yet, like Oliver Stone, or Maxwell and King.  To the positive side, reading this book 16 years after initial publishing, its impressive how much Baldacci was able to see and understand the path of technology and the internet and get it correct.  Some of the high tech plot elements seem a bit worn out here, but if you think back to 1996, you realize that this was fairly innovative.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|I was searching one month for a watch for, more or less, this price. I read lots of information and reviews, in Spanish (my mother tongue) and English. Finaly I decided to buy the Seiko SKXX009 and the the Orient Blue Mako, both in Amazon, and it was a good decision. First I bought the Seiko. This watch is built tough, has a personal and nice look, and it's pleasant to wear.<br />Mi Pepsi is a very accurate watch and, by now, only loses 20 second per month!. I think this timepiece is for many years.<br />The Amazon price and service were great.<br />A great purchase, a great watch. ¡Un reloj magnífico!.
0345802934|4.0|There's a lot of facets to this story.  How do we describe the plot?  A love story between a math teacher/writer and a sports trainer/assassin  who are eventually brought together by a teenager who exposes an alternate world from ours via a book ghost written by the math teacher, in which fairy beings (the little people) play a subversive role.  There, I think that's a fair summary.<br /><br />Now if you're looking at that sentence and shaking your head, good.  Its really not that confusing and its extremely well written.  The characters are very three dimensional and I loved them.  A lot of writers could take a lesson from how well formed the characters are in this story.  As the book goes on you get a sense of where the author is going with the book, but you're never quite sure how he's going to get there.  It does a decent job of keeping you guessing.  I wouldn't classify it as fantasy although it has some of those leanings.  You spend much more time in conventional activities than in the surreal.  I do like the way he handles the little people...by not handling them.  If you're going to explain something, then everything must make sense, and if you contradict yourself even once, you're shot, readers will jump on you.  This is kind of like Highlander, we don't know why they fight, but we know \\"There can be only one\\".  That's the rule, don't spend too much time worrying why they're there, or how they got there.  They just are.<br /><br />The number of literary allusions in here is also amusing,  Orwell, Chekhov, Proust, Kafka.  I found them entertaining, and they're not so deep as to ruin the story with philosophical rumblings.  They just added to the dimensionality of the story.  I'm not sure if the Japanese version was written in Katakana, Hiragana, Kanji, or all three, so I don't know how much credit I should give to Murakami or to the translators, but I do love the way the English edition reads.  Given this is only maybe the third Japanese book I've read, I found the societal references refreshingly modern.  There were many casual references as well as the literary references that translate easily to western culture.  You may think this funny or biased, but remember, these people have an alphabet for Japanese things and an alphabet for things that come from outside Japanese culture (say like a hamburger).  The blending of things I associated with western culture versus Japanese culture was a view of Japan I don't generally get or think of.  I think most readers will enjoy this book alot.  I think the only groups who would be disappointed would be the heavy sci-fi fantasy people and the full action people.  There's not a lot of sci-fi or gun battle action in this book, but that doesn't stop it from being a good story.<br /><br />Cons:  No real pinnacle of suspense here, and no real resolution.  In theory there could be another take off for a book at the end, or even a set of books.  In general, the end was OK, but unsatisfying.  There's also a bunch of hanging foreshadowing left over (besides Chekov's gun), for example, the continual mention of the \\"strangler\\".  What was that about?  It never went anywhere...und the societal references refreshingly modern.  There were many casual references as well as the literary references that translate easily to western culture.

B006YXTRHY|2.0|The bedroom scenes during the honeymoon was interminably long.  Similarly, scenes showing Bella pregnant were interminably long.  Effectively there was no storyline around these long scenes.  Some enjoyment could have been experienced if investment had been made in the storyline.  Bottom line is this movie is not worth seeing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a fun movie with new and old humor. A mass of super heros. I'm very fond of the multiple formats of the movie. I have utilized all of them. The digital copy is utilized mostly by the apple tv. For vehicle trips the DVD is the one and finally the blu ray is of course for the home entertainment system.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is alot of fun. There's a nice mix of easy and more difficult. The gameplay and controls work flawlessly. There are loads of levels that will keep you entertained for hours. This is a refreshing twist on the &quot;router&quot; games with more features.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is not just about zombies, but about the human interaction that happens after the fall of the world.  One of the best written zombie shows of our time
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was great. Always wanted to see it and Amazon makes it perfect to view content especially on multiple platforms.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 1 was so intense that I almost didn't read book 2.  Couldn't imagine what else these 2 people could do.  Have to say I ready book 2 in a matter of days & immediately downloaded book 3.  Book 2 is a love story.  Still a bit odd, but it is a love story.  Interesting to see how these 2 people turn their odd relationship into a love story.  Was really glad I read this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just could not stop reading it. Read it all in 1 day. Books 2 and 3 of the trilogy are the best ones. I wish there were a party 4, 5, 6.....i am addicted to it. Completely in lve with Cristian Grey...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|REALLY different than what I usually read & was kind of tempted to put it down, but my girlfriends at work warned me that I have to keep reading.  Was so glad I listened to their advice.  Such a different kind of &#34;love story&#34;.  Kept reading because I was so interested in the back-story of Christian, and also, why Anna would stay with this type of guy.  Would recommend with the warning that there are some really intense &#34;love&#34; scenes so be prepared.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|Great for a mother and daughter to bond. I got a great deal on the price of the movie download and we can watch anywhere.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Game is Ok, however, the amount of pop-up ads kind of bugs me.  Other than the ads, game is fine.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good free mahjong app. Runs well on both my Kindle Fire HD &amp; my husband's Droid phone. Lots of game levels to choose from. Backgrounds are non-intrusive and the tiles are easy to read (after a short adjustment period.) Game is timed to be challenging, but no penalty for rearranging tiles. Includes all the expected features like undo, hint, pause, etc. Can't ask for more from a free game!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't wait to read this book after the 1st 2.  Great way to end the series, but lets you continue the story in your head.  Would recommend this series, cautioning that there are some really steamy scenes.  The love story is really different, but worth the read.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I listen to it all of the time in my car.  I was very surprised how much better it was than the you tube versions.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|This is part of our neighborhood double feature with Young Frankenstein on every Halloween night following trick or treating. Shown on a 12' X 6' screen (154&#34;) in Blu-ray stereo with bonfires and a caldron of chili --  and brew, its a recipe for a perfect Halloween. Great flick that would only work with British humor.

The graphics for KFHD are smooth viberant and responsive. 4 stars because of the ( real money) I do support apps and their creators deserve some monies ,it would be nice to be able to earn app dollars with in the app. Good and fun!!
B008458O3S|5.0|Other than some easy levels sneaking in near the end, this game is a great little puzzler that kept me entertained. Would've gladly paid $3 for it if I have caught it has the faotd
B001E1GXPA|5.0|They really nailed it with this Album, by far the best one yet. Have heard it since it first came out and made me really wanna buy it because it deserves to be bought. Respect!

0761171703|5.0|Jordan Matter has created a masterpiece with this book. My son has moved from Massachusetts to LA to pursue his passion for dance and I was sending this book to him for Christmas.  I looked at the pictures and read the commentaries in this book for three days before I could send it. The dedication of all of the artists involved in the making of this book, from Mr Matter to the dancers and the people helping that you never see in the photographs, is certainly evident in the finished product. The love of dance in the dancers and the gift of capturing the perfect moment of Mr. Matter come together to create a work of art that is thought provoking, entertaining and astonishing. Don't hesitate to buy more than one copy if you're buying it as a gift.  You won't want to give it up!<br />  I look forward to more great works from Jordan Matter and I thank him and the dancers for sharing their talent with me through this book.<br /><br />Kathleen

B007SYWFRM|4.0|could use more clips and games but I just started so see how it goes. I love the graphics. but I need more nuts.
B003KGBISY|5.0|A great story - and so many great characters. This was before color film, where Kurosawa became a little bit to fund of filming beautiful landscapes - in my opinion. Seven Samurai has everything a good movie should have; love and hate, a great setup, life and death. Just love it
B007V4530A|4.0|When it comes to giving a talk before an audience, here's the best overall advice I've seen to date. It's an easy read, but take some notes. You'll be glad you read this book. And, so will your audience!
B00A2H9NCC|5.0|I won't bore you with a synopsis of the film, which by now should be quite familiar to everyone.  But I will say that the acting is simply superb -- particularly Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, as the coming-together thirty-somethings with a shared disheveled past and an emotional steamer trunk full of similar disconnects.  (DeNiro goes without saying.)  The way in which these real people connect their loose wires is a testament both to the author and to the director (David Russell) of this comic tale of human interaction.  You will long remember the characters and you will never forget the story.  This film is an example of what Hollywood can do well but unfortunately does far less frequently now by sacrificing the stories of real people on the altar of special effects, morphing and extended adolescent superhero nonsense.  Kudos to the Weinsteins for continuing to have the courage to bring us memorable tales like these.<br />***<br />Steve Schlossstein<br />Princeton, New Jersey

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is not predictable like most of the crap that is on TV these days. It holds your attention for the entire hour.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander's experience is a true one and I enjoyed reading about it.  However, the book was a little more medically technical then I would prefer.  Again, however, I felt it was important to include the medical information for skeptics to read and consider.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I actually don't watch much television but I was at a friends place and he was watching it. I found myself wanting to watch another episode then another. The storyline is great and the characters are engaging and each person has a different personality. So far I am completely satisfied and I look forward to the future episodes.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The kids and I loved it. It can get pretty intense in some parts, so I was glad that we watched it at home instead of at the theater. I have kids 3, 5, 7, and 8, at girl and three boys, and they all enjoyed it. In fact, watched it three times in the 48 hrs. we had it! They want to rent again, but we may just have to buy it.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|Stupid app wouldn't run on my android tablet. Couldn't even get it to load. But I noticed lately that there have been a lot of updating going on, and a lot of my apps won't work now.  Even ones I've paid for.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|We no longer have small kids or grandkids in our home, but the neighbor's little boy came over the other night, and wanted to know what games were on my KindleFire.  He asked if he could download Bad Piggies, to play when he visits.  I told him he would have to figure it out, because I knew NOTHING about Bad Piggies.  BUT..he is 7 years old, and knows WAY MORE than this old grammie does!!!  He had it on and playing in no time...showing all of us &#34;old people&#34; how it is done.  I have not tried it by myself yet, but may have to take it up!!!  Thank you for the convienience and generosity of the free download!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Who better to visit heaven than an atheistic, professorial, neurosurgeon. His story is amazing. The difficult part is relating it to the world. You sense the struggle he has finding the words to describe his vivid experience but he does it beautifully. You'll want to learn more about what is still in his mind. Next book? If you struggle with the concept of heaven but have an open mind-this may be a game changer for you.
B008458O3S|5.0|I don't play many games, but this one really makes you think.  The rules are simple and the UI is done well.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|This movie has a little of everything in it ie: makes you want to cry then laugh, holds you spell bound on the edge of your seat, lots action, romance, & more. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
B009LROCJI|4.0|These recompositions are different enough to make you appreciate the originals while enjoying the the works themselves. I highly recommend them.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Mesmerizing. Even if you think you know what happens, it still blows your mind to know how people deal with their loneliness.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The story strays a bit from the comic, but keeps up with viewer interest. I am glad they aren't following the exact story. Great series to get in to.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Just love Tim Burtons work...he has a long history of working with some of the actors it's camp and it is awkwardly humorous-
B009ZAY8MM|3.0|Pentatonix put their signature treatment on a handful of Christmas carols here, but I feel like the gloss and energy of their sound doesn't really suit the repertoire. Too commercialized for Christmas carols. Still great performances, but are they necessary? Best track: The Christmas Song (with a very slick vocal trumpet solo from KO)
B0090EKRKU|5.0|I loved the lesson this movie taught. The way it was presented kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Not to mention the beautiful artwork in this film. This is a movie my daughter and I can enjoy over and over again.  Two thumbs up for sure!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best Zombie show I have ever seen.  Don't miss it, you won't be dissapointed!  The walking dead is what Zombie movies should all aspire to!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Modernized versions of the Sherlock Holms stories are often disappointing, but not in this case.  The entire series is truely great; well written, funny, and intelligent.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|This is great for a classroom, either individually or on the projector. It's also available for iOS, Windows, and OSX.
B004AP09CU|5.0|This has the feeling of one of his live performances. You can sense the songs are being formed as you listen... like Bruce himself is really listening. On a grey November day, driving along a midwest highway, nothings better on the stereo... or iPod... or whatever.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Thank you for an that works great and easy to use. would recommend for everyone. Keep up the good work on this app.
B00913DPW2|1.0|No idea what you are supposed to be doing or looking for. Gave up on it. Won't be going back to it.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|BAD PICTURE AND ACTING.  I WAS BILLED 4 TIMES AND ONLY RECEIVED 1 TERRIBLE FILM.  PLEASE RECTIFY COST.  AND PLEASE LOOK INTO COMPLAINTS OF OTHER COMPLAINTS I MADE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LOOKED INTO, PLUS MY KINDLE THAT HAS NOT WORKED PROPERLY FOR 2 MONTHS AND NO ONE HAS RESPONDED TO.
B005KELW26|5.0|Love the color, ease of use, and the fact that this holder protects my Kindle Fire from harm.  It looks good while I'm standing in line, reading while getting a pedicure, in the hair salon, or on lunch break at work.  Good buy!
B009HEMW4W|1.0|I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED IT.  I ONLY NEED 1 AND I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH ON MY PC.  I WANT THE PHYSICAL DVD I CAN PLAY.<br /><br />.
0374275637|5.0|This is one of the more extraordinary academic books I've ever read.  Kahneman has essentially written a summation of his career.  He reassesses most of the ground he's covered with insights about how all those ideas have progressed - not just what he's done with them, but other prominent thinkers as well.  He also takes advantage of writing in a popular style to do much more than \\"popularize\\" the work.  He uses it to add insight about the conduct of his research (and that of some some rivals) that one could never do in any academic publication - and he does it without any axes to grind or excessive feeding of his own ego.  He tries to impart some of the wisdom he's built up over a long career within a highly readable summation of the work he's done over those years.  I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like it.<br /><br />My sense is that this is a valuable read for anyone who's engaged in academic research for any sustained period of time.  It presents an amazing method for looking back at one's career and using it to move one's field forward still further.  Even for those who have issues with some or all of the content, this is an extraordinary accomplishment.  Definitely worth the time.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|This episode was great, quality was good. There is definitely room for improvement on the quality side, there were 2 times when the video got blurry.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I came to this book as a person who was pretty convinced that vegetarianism was the way to go but still deeply in love with the taste of meat, the experience of eating meat. Foer managed to ruin that for me. He is neither didactic nor self-righteous, but the force of his logic, the power of the experiences he describes, leaves little room for a pro-carnivore argument.
B007SGM084|1.0|This was one of the worst pieces of writing I have ever encountered.  It bears no relationship to literature.  I have read far better pornography in pulp rags.  I gave up on this piece of tripe after just a few chapters.  My time is far more valuable than reading this ill written trash.  It's a rare book that I have ever felt so strongly about.  I am furious with myself for having ordered the trilogy and was only too glad to erase them from my Kindle.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is lots of fun for kids and adults. If you like the other Angry Bird games, you'll love this one.
B009FZFONO|5.0|love this show. keeps you interested and on the edge of my seat. can't wait till the next episode on sunday.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Not only a fantasy novel, George RR Martin's saga gives an interesting insider view of politics: how to maneuver, to take setbacks in stride, to keep one's eye on the long term goal and just change the method of obtaining that goal.  Good material couched within an interesting story line.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I purchased the entire series for a friend and he really like it. I have all three books on my Kindle. What a rollercoaster ride.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Superb acting, story, and camerawork! This was the best season so far and am looking forward to the next one.
B002PYW26O|5.0|Unfortunately, I was one of the few who thought this movie was great. I loved that they put some of the original characters in the movie, and the special effects were awesome.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Free version is rigged to self destruct ny failing controls and lack of instructions. Not sure what to say it had great potential though
B009329Y30|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and would watch it again.  Story line was a little predictable, but, it was still worth renting.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We have had fun watching the movies.  I read the early books but the directing, costumes, imagination is unbelievable.  The deep English tradition is quite evident.  Really fun to watch.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Noticed I didn't have this movie in my collection and couldn't believe it! I have Escape from L.A. and need this movie.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Started kind of slow but \\"WOW\\" what an ending!  Patricia Cornwell really knows how to keep you guessing.  Never would have guessed that one.
B00000AOTZ|3.0|Great cd to have but it is very short. I wish more music was included on this but maybe one day.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|Saw this movie in theatre and enjoy watching it at home with the grandkids. Great inspirational movie, especially for girls.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the Bingo Blitz!  I like that you can play in different cities, with players from all over the world.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|GREAT episode!! Well written, excellent acting- all around fabulous. And the ending promises even better yet to come! Can't wait to see this week's episode.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an awesome read.  Had trouble putting it down.  Read first book had fo read the entire series!<br />Definitely worth buying!
B003L9CMNU|4.0|Must see for teens , great morality lessons an entertainment. We loved it. Douglas was great and the Sheens also
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is such a great show. I love watching the DVD rather than watching it on TV. no commercials and we can watch it for hours!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Scientifically, the author's story of his near death experience is unique and thoroughly convincing.  No way could a person with an inoperative  cortex undergo, and recall any experiences.  UNLESS our consciousness emanates from a source other than the brain.  Hmmmm.  This tale blows long-held conclusions out of the water.  As a yogini and seeker of enlightenment, it's a joyful thing to see yet another tangible example of the merging of science and spirituality.  Somehow though, I was expecting the author to relate an enlightenment that was more spiritual in nature.  The solid, indisputable realization that \\"I am not my body\\", and the awareness's which would evolve from that core knowledge, would propel most would-be yogis off to meditate in a Himalayan cave - forever. Our author just didn't seem to be as blown away as I would have expected. His heart didn't shine through his prose, and the non-profit organization plug right at the end of the book could have been placed or articulated in a way that didn't smack of a donation request.  Still this NDE account is so distinctive, and so detailed that it demands a read.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The app was working fine for about 10 months or so; however, it stopped working completely!  I can't check any of my mail using this app.
0761163808|5.0|This is an AWESOME book for children of ALL ages!  Plus, most parents are grateful when a present is both entertaining AND educational.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the most unbelieving game that goes non stop. this is the only game that makes u go and go until u fall ot die and then u see the words new high score u get so happy then u did or fall and u just get so mad because u have to restart.then u get mad because u don't get that same high score.Because I played it all summer and by the end of August I had the most highest score tht I ever got which was 4,035,999.when I saw new high score I fell off the kliff and threw. my ipod to the ceiling and started to cry my mom said I'm probably the youngest 10 year old girl to get that score.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|if you are a fan of Angry Birds you will like it.<br />if you are a Star Wars fan, you will love it!<br /><br />Really creative way to renew the Angry Birds franchise. Totally worth!
B0045XICB2|5.0|Watched on my laptop. Stream was a little slow but didn't take away from this really good movie. Go Bella!
B008458O3S|4.0|This is a simple yet thought provoking logic game.<br />I have played for a few hours and I have enjoyed every minute of it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie, loved it. Saw in movie house when released,thrill still there. It's gonna be a classic.Recommend to all, watch it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When I first found out about the Kindle for Android, I was in heaven. I'd bought five books for my Sony Pocket Reader and then dumped it for this app on my smartphone. Finally, I had color covers, and when I touched a word with my finger, I got the definition without even putting the book down! The only gripe is that there's no text-to-speech, but after getting the Kindle Fire, I decided I don't like TTS so much, as it sounds computerized, so that's not even a gripe. Plus, they give you suggestions at the bottom based on what you bought, an excellent bonus. Kindle does make the best eReaders. Great app!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. As good as the first book, Bared to You. Can't wait til the next and last<br />book comes out in May.  If you like the Fifty Shades books, this is just as good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't read but this Trilogy kept me up late and couldn't wait to get up to start reading again.  Fantastic writing.
B003204MQS|2.0|It was fine when it was scary. It was horrible when it got bloody.  It went go far and become just another disgusting  slasher movie.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|A true FF game and not just an app. Hoping this sells well enough so they port over more FF titles to the kindle. the price is a little high but then again it is for a full game not just some side scroll 10 minutes and I'm done app based game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not typically into shows with constant action but this show is amazing!! Love it and usually cant wait for the next episode.
1423140605|4.0|I can't wait to read the next book.  Lots of action and learning about the greek gods vs. the olympic gods.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Some episodes have been a little boring but the others make up for it. I look forward to watching every week.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Perfect movie for the whole family. Something for everyone! We watch it over and over. Can't wait for the second installment.
1451695187|5.0|I bought this book for my mother. She received it within 2 days and loved the book. She sent it to me to read and I will return it to her after I read it. Thank you for your super quick delivery!
0486275590|5.0|This is a great story in a great format/edition. I'm excited to give this to my son for Christmas and experience this story with him.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This was an awesome video series. I wish there were more of this series coming out. So interesting and incredible acting. I love historical movies such as &#34;The Tudors&#34;!
B007THA4FI|2.0|&#34;Casual Vacancy&#34;<br /> Disappointing.  I was expecting more from the author.  Boring.  Just could not get into it--might try again though.
1451629184|3.0|There was not enough detail about Jaycee's experience. I think it was interesting but she glossed over so much. I am hoping she will write another book with more details.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|it is exciting, fast action and holds my attention.  i have watched this over and over again.  i have an abdoer twist exercise machine and i exercise with this dvd as well as watching.  i don't get sick of this movie. i like the storyline.  i think it is realistic enough and a joy to watch our marines risk their lives to save ordinary people.
B007704HO6|5.0|I loved it and would highly recommend it to everyone! After I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. A very good read.
0525953728|5.0|Couldn't have been better and written by one of THE men that was there.  What a thrilling and factual story.  Like being there in person!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I don't usually read &#34;suspense&#34; novels but this had a well developed plot and enabled me to visit Paris again. Thanks to the author.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Really Fun. great for when you're bored and good for wasting time (long car rides and plane rides etc.) Great overall.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as much of a page turner as previous novels have been. Had a suprise ending. I prefer the novels that concentrate on litigation.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|This book is for everyone. With an accessible and clear style, it has something for engineers and general managers, startup founders and corporate managers.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Excellent, exactly as described, shipped super quick!! Blu ray is awesome. I know this will be on tv like for 30 days straight but it won't be in blu ray, it's the best.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|Great storyline with many twists and turns that keeps you reading to the very end. Highly recommend this to others.
B003HOXLE8|5.0|I was recommend by the Instructor for the introductory course for photshop cs5 in school. Since Continued education for adult in Community college, School can cover only basic in Photoshop but this book brought me to the understanding of the whole Photoshop and adobe products.  all 14 chapters covered all aspect of new CS5.  Having this book is better than asking question in the class.  all steps are easy to follow, all tricks from evangelist's experiences help you feel having more confidence in new technological field.  Most students dropped out from my class because they don't learn much from the class, but this book give me desire to explore more in Photoshop field.  I went to school to understand how to fix some old photos but from now on, I feel like I am ready for the exam for adobe certified associate exam after this book.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|It's an average story, that isn't engaging or suprising and have a common end. I didn't enjoyed it so much.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|I have to admit... it was funny as hell! I was never a Jump Street fan so I didn't expect to enjoy it. It is crued though so be careful who you watch it with.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Now I own all of the DVD's for SADE and I still can't get enough ot them.  They are the best band out there and have been doing what they do for almost 30 years.  Continue making music for many years to come.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie prides itself in realism and in using real situations to make this film. I had the pleasure of meeting the SEAL's that played in this movie. Top notch guys and gals, one and all. BTW, these are all real SEAL's except one or 2. I have seen it 5 times. You'll be glad you watched it.
1844256383|5.0|This book is perfect for someone who likes to help maintain the condition of the instrument but wants to stop short of messing it up.  Howard knows when to tell the tinkerer to stop and turn the work over to a genuine repair person.  The photos are superb in their detail and the writing style is clear, light, and very illuminating.  Although some of the specific maintenance products he recommends are not found in the U.S., it's not hard to find suitable substitutes.  I just wish the author had done that work for me - but then I'm probably just being an ugly American.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|But that is about all. I was disappointed in it and hoped it would be better. If you like a tough guy type roll, this may interest you.
B001223BLU|5.0|We saw the show New Jersey Nights in Reno, and I wanted to hear the original group. Brings back memories! Love the album
B008F5YDRI|3.0|So, that is what got me interested in seeing this. I was better than I expected and told a tale that made you want them to succeed.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is the antithesis of fantasy. It should be read separate and apart from Harry Potter. There simply is no vestige of Harry Potter in this book.<br /><br />The characters are neither villains nor heroes: they are well developed and flawed. Petty and mean, ego-centric. You feel like you KNOW these people by the end of the book.<br /><br />The book is not &#34;enjoyable&#34; --- it is a reflection of life in a small town.<br /><br />It seems to me that it was written for a higher purpose.
B008A1NSTG|3.0|It was a feel good movie that we enjoyed.It didnt hold the attention of our kids very well though. For a family movie with kids 10 or older, give it a shot.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I rated this movie a star off of perfect because I loved it, but thought it was not academy award quality.  It has all the parts I look for in a movie humor, emotion, believable story line and good acting.  Since I am a senior, I think the movie was very age appropriate.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Grandkids really enjoyed playing this game.  I'm sure they will get a lot of fun from this game. Very intertaining
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This movie is a very important narration of life viewed from an experienced perspective and reminds you the importance of family and relationships. Great movie!!!
B000SGSU58|4.0|Sure looks like Harry has crossed the line too far and too often. He finds himself in court not as an investigating officer but as the defendant.  He has to find answers to an older murder investigation and new bodies showing up, before his trial goes to the jury.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Show keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Picture quailty really poor in SD on amazon instant video. !!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It's great. I watch these whenever I can find the time. I'm hooked on this series. I love the ability to watch instantly
B002NHGG92|5.0|Watching it again while I wait for new eps to come out for season 4.. I dnt usually rate, but seriously thumbs up..TWO thumbs up..this is my fav.series!
B006LMMN8I|4.0|I really like this compilation because the artist did not compromise and rely on auto tunes or studio magic.  Real live musicians vibing.  Gregory Porters' vocals are organic, pure, unique and refreshing.  I do hope we get back to the purity of sound and live instrumentation.  This is art. It has prompted me to search for other artists of Gergory's ilk.  Be good was on my facebook page.  Someone introduced his sound to me and I am hooked.  I will share it with all my friends and encourage them to purchase his music.  Thanks to Amazon, I was able to purchase on their site.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Keeps getting better Nd better! This series has me watching it over again! I dnt usually write ratings, but its thaat good!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This album has its place in every playlist.<br />Its great to work to, drive to, and chill down at the end of the day with.<br /><br />  I've never bought an Idol winners album before, finding them to be canned<br />Pop garbage most of the time. Phillip Phillips proved tho he deserved a mainstream place for his unique sound.  I have this album playing with Avert Brothers and Mumford & Sons. Its a perfect matchup.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|this app is terrible. it keeps crashing and the quality is that of the first camera phone. it even warns that the 1080p option is unstable and keeps crashing so u might not want to use it.lol<br />the whole thing crashes and is real buggy. worst app ive downloaded in a long long time. i knew i should of bought an ipad.smh<br />i cant believe people are only complaining about amazon not giving us a camera and video app. any one that says this app works fine is crazy. i just waisted $3 cuz id rather use nothing then this app.<br />guess we just have to accept that the kindle fire hd has no camera.<br />this is the last time i ever stray away from apple.
B00785P2QC|2.0|its a nice and free replacement for sim city while i can not get to a computer. it could have better graphics and give you a choice of what you want to be in your city.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It's by Mitch Albom, so you know how his stories go. It wasn't as good as I'd hoped but kept my focus which isn't easy to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Mitch Albom's writing.
B000002SE0|5.0|The conventional wisdom is that the Pavarotti/Sutherland recording of Turandot, conducted by Mehta for Decca in the early 1970's is the gold standard for Turandots.  And it is vivid, well-recorded, and well-sung.  No one who owns it (and I do) need have any regrets about that.  But even on the recording, it's clear, I think, that the voices are on the small side, and that discreet engineering helps it all come across.  The Nilsson/Corelli 1965 EMI recording is a different sort of beast.  The sound isn't as good,and the conducting seems a bit routine, but with Nilsson and Corelli going at it, and sounding good doing it, you're in a different world altogether.  Corelli can be an irritatingly uneven singer, clumsy in phrasing and articulation, sometimes bellowing, sometimes showing off fancy vocal tricks, but here he is generally splendid.  The voice itself is an amazing instrument -- lots of weight and richness, but not at all baritonal, a really big, real tenor voice.  He's a less reliable singer than the comparable del Monaco, but when he's \\"on\\" his voice has a warmth and tonal sheen that del Monaco's doesn't.  On this recording, the heart of the matter is Act 2, and here Nilsson's \\"In questa reggia\\" is stunning in its steadiness and attack, and, as we know from her Wagner and Strauss recordings, she is also capable of beautiful softer singing.  She is fierce in the Riddle scene, and here too Corelli is her match.  The climax for me is what immediately follows the Riddle scene (from \\"Figlio del Cielo\\" to the end of the Act) -- Corelli is simply tremendous here, powerful when power is called for (the high note attacked in \\"\\"Ti voglio tutt'ardente d'amor\\"), the solidity of \\"Tre enigmi . . .\\" and the melting warmth following \\"Dimmi il mio nome\\" . . . then the chorus goes crazy.  I don't understand why this recording has not been remastered for the Great Recordings of the Century Series, which contains many lesser lights (L'Amico Fritz? Seriously??).  There is some congestion and lack of clarity in some of the big climaxes with chorus, and these perhaps could be improved.<br /><br />Some will say, what about Nilsson/Bjoerling on RCA, recorded about six years earlier?  There you have the great Turandot and one of the great tenors of all time.  I own this one too, and Nilsson is again great, and I even prefer Leinsdorf's conducting to Molinari-Pradelli for EMI.  And Bjoerling sings most beautifully -- but the voice (like Pavarotti's in regard to this role) is a size to small AND is put at a disadvantage by the recording balance -- he seems set back in a different aural space (maybe remastering could help that too),  but with all the positives, there's not the animal energy of Corelli, no attempted high note at the climax of Act 2.  The Bjoerling recording does have Tebaldi's Liu, warmer than Scotto's for EMI, but Scotto is fine too.  The Carreras recordings are not in the same class, nor, I'm afraid is the Karajan/Domingo, with Ricciarrelli seriously out of her vocal depth as Turandot.  I haven't heard the Heppner/Marton, but I would expect Heppner to be very good as Calaf.estion and lack of clarity in some of the big climaxes with chorus, and these perhaps could be improved.<br /><br />Some will say, what about Nilsson/Bjoerling on RCA, recorded about six years earlier?

B002361MLA|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. Much of the time I felt the information was hard for me to absorb but I got the jest of it. The information in the book is very helpful if you can figure it out and put it to use. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for enlightenment. Cool book.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Typical fagen magic. Always a new sound but always unmistakable Steely Dan's better half and as good as it gets.

B000002KHF|5.0|Just a great album written at the height of his early brilliance (Astral Weeks; Moondance; Tupelo Honey). Although Tupelo is my personal favorite, this is pretty much 1A.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Bought this and the other P of C  now have them all I think. Love watching them time and time again, wonderful movie. Thx Amazon once again.
0547884591|1.0|I was super excited when this book came out, especially after I saw that it had over 60 5 star reviews the day after it was released.<br /><br />I mean this is a 672 page book so I was just amazed that so many people had been able to order the book, read its  672 pages in one day and then crank out a 300 word essay about how great the book was.<br /><br />So, obviously, this isn't really a cook book, it is a \\"learning system\\" that teaches you how to speed read and write *awesome* reviews.<br /><br />So I rushed out and bought the book.<br /><br />I must be a slow learner because it took me nearly two days to finish the 672 page book yet I was so exhausted by the effort that this is the best review I can write.<br /><br />I can't help but feel that I have failed Tim Ferris somehow.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|gift person loved all the P of C I like them 2. we now have all the p.of c. plays what more can one ask for ?
B0030B624E|4.0|Great movie.  Only problem is now the quest for Twinkies got more complicates since Hostess has gone out of business.

0007447868|5.0|The most impressive modern fantasy, both in terms of conception and execution, is George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Begun nearly a decade ago with `A Game of Thrones,' Martin delivered volume four in 2005, `A Feast for Crows' (Bantam, $28, 1.024 pages), with at least three more to come.<br /><br />But Martin's grand vision has complicated the usually straightforward process of delivering a fantasy series. First, the cast of characters is enormous. There is a 64-page appendix to `A Feast for Crows' that just lists the names of the characters so far, and more are introduced in every chapter. There are so many major characters, in fact, that Martin concedes at the end of this 1,000-page volume that he had to make an unusual and somewhat frustrating choice: He simply had to ignore half the characters who have carried the series so far.<br /><br />What that means is that `A Feast for Crows' advances the plot for the royal twins, Cersei and Jaime; the warrior maiden Brienne; the hidden princesses, Arya and Sansa Stark; and fat scholar Samwell Tarly, but leaves Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Davos Seaworth and others completely out of the narrative. Martin's only other option was a 2,000-page book, or a very fragmented 1,000-page volume that tried to track all the complex interweavings of a fully realized medieval world that also contains magic and dragons.<br /><br />Which leads directly to my biggest criticism: There's no synopsis. Martin plunges dead ahead at the beginning of `A Feast for Crows' without the slightest regard for the fact that book one came out in 1997, and the most recent work arrived in 2000. I was forced to pull down about 100 pages of chapter summaries off a fan's web site to have any idea of who was doing what, and what they'd done before, and that's simply asking too much of readers.<br /><br />Ideally, all of the books should be read in a row, and if I had the time, I'm sure I would have been rewarded by going back to `A Game ofThrones' and reading all three previous (long) novels before I started on this one, but not many people have that kind of leisure. When the series is finally complete, newcomers will be able to go from start to finish at their own pace, but right now, eager fans are forced to try and digest this wonderful series piecemeal.<br /><br />And make no mistake, `A Feast for Crows' is a worthy successor to what has gone before. Like all middle volumes, however, it is pretty much stuck in bleak mode, as Martin's protagonists are a long way from redemption (if indeed that is to be their reward). And speaking of those protagonists, one of the great pleasures of A Song of Ice and Fire is that the villains and heroes are difficult to distinguish, as Martin makes them fully rounded personalities rather than cardboard cutouts who must serve as paragons of good or horrid examples of evil.<br /><br />If you haven't encountered this brilliant series before, definitely begin with `A Game of Thrones' and enjoy the buildup to `A Feast for Crows.' Those who have already plunged in may actually be better served by waiting (if they can resist) until volume five comes out in 2007, and reading both back to back. But no matter how or when you read A Song of Ice and Fire, you will know immediately that you have happened on a masterpiece that, barring a complete collapse in the later volumes, will be mentioned with the great works of fantasy.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|Talk about a bad movie.  Why does Kristen Stewart continue to get &#34;acting&#34; roles?  Charlize Theron was truly lowering herself and her standards to have participated in this film.  When will Hollywood realize that just because someone gets lucky and has a role in a movie that was already a blockbuster due to the book that that does not qualify someone as an actor in anything else.  Don't waste your time with this movie unless you really have nothing better to do or are looking for something to put you to sleep.  If you want to see a Snow White movie, get the one with Sigourney Weaver.

B00006IU73|5.0|I'm embarrassed to admit that I hadn't even heard of Porcupine Tree until a couple of weeks ago, when my teenage son put on the song \\"Shallow\\" from Deadwing in the car, and while listening I thought \\"wait a minute, this is actually good,\\" and investigated further.  After seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews for PT CDs on Amazon, I went on a Porcupine Tree spending spree, picking up Warszawa, In Absentia, Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet, Anesthetize, and The Incident in one swoop.<br /><br />I watched Anesthetize with my sons, but only had one pass through it on a school night.  I then wanted to listen to the oldest stuff first; however, Warszawa won't arrive for several more weeks, so I went full-gorilla with In Absentia.  I love this album, and have listened to it at least five times now (haven't even moved on to Deadwing yet).  Good music for me has to be listened to several times to \\"soak in,\\" and I've been enjoying the In Absentia experience.  I would say that a couple of the songs are weaker than the others, but even those are past my \\"remove this song from my library\\" threshold (I have no problem nuking songs I don't like, even from my favorite artists, as I care about quality, not completeness).  Additionally, removing any of the In Absentia songs would be like removing a track from The Wall or 2112 - you just don't do that.<br /><br />I'm a forty-something who spent my young-adult life listening to the likes of Rush, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Boston, and a variety of others...and I must say that I haven't been this excited about happening upon a \\"relatively new\\" artist since coming across Vertical Horizon a few years ago.  I very much look forward to listening to the other PT albums, and soaking them in like I'm doing with In Absentia.<br /><br />Last but not least, I've seen comments saying PT is not really \\"progressive rock.\\"  Long ago I decided I would strip the genre tag from every song in my library, because it is such a subjective thing, as well as time-sensitive (exactly when does rock become classic rock, for example).  For me, music is either \\"good\\" or \\"not good,\\" and I have no need to place subjective labels on it.  So far, every PT song I've heard is in the \\"good\\" category.as time-sensitive (exactly when does rock become classic rock, for example).

B009HV2JT8|4.0|Movie Review Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012)<br />A movie that is great beyond its promise and premise.<br /><br />The trailer for this movie left me stuck in the middle. We have an insane premise- that the 16th President of the United States did double duty as a monster killer and some wicked and slickly filmed chop chop action thrown in. Director Timur Bekmambetov, from the Night Watch and Day Watch movies, is no stranger to fangs in film. He channels his passion for all things dark and scary and then adds a pinch of Matrix (no surprise) and Brotherhood of the Wolf. The Brotherhood nod is for seeing early Americana mixed with Martial Arts.<br /><br />It works. The movie succeeds- a huge credit goes to the serious handling of the iconic Abraham Lincoln character [played by Benjamin Walker] and the great lengths taken to capture the mid 1800s spirit. Writer Seth Grahame-Smith has layered a dark tale of vengeance around the most important issues of the time- slavery and the Civil War.<br /><br />Vampire movies have always preyed and played with the idea of man verse monster. It's always been the choice between gaining enormous power and holding on to our fragile humanity. We parallel the struggle between the monstrous idea of slavery verse the inalienable rights of every man to be equal. Who would have guessed we'd tap such weighty subjects in a film about honest Abe obliterating bloodsuckers with an axe.<br /><br />The fight scenes are a sight to behold and every element of film is used to enhance the action. We have great use of sound (albeit loud and obvious sometimes), slow motion and fast motion and even color takes an active role. We can see the obvious cooling and warming of shots, the isolation of colors, but the symbolism of color draining (like blood) is a marvelous touch. The visual respect for film matches the respect for the subject matter.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, I kept thinking `They didn't have to go that far', but really- that pursuit of quality is what saves Vampire Killer from being a quickly forgotten b-movie. I believe they purposely walked the line of historical fiction and period piece drama as events in the movie closely follow history and Lincoln's personal story.<br /><br />I liked it, I liked it, I liked it. This is one for the shelves even though every time I reach for it, I'll have to tell my company \\"It's good, trust me, it's good.\\" Well done. I'm not a movie critic; I'm just critiquing a movie.of quality is what saves Vampire Killer from being a quickly forgotten b-movie.

B0013F1D02|5.0|Stardust is a wonderful movie, it has good acting, reasonably complex characters, is beautiful to look at, and all in all a lovely fantasy. Perhaps part of the reason that I loved it so much was that I watched it right after watching \\"Witches\\" which was a idiotic, completely non-entertaining movie.<br /><br />The basic plot revolves around a realm of magic linked closely to a 19th century English town called Wall after the wall between the realms that borders the town.  A young man whose mother is on the other side crosses the wall to collect a fallen star for the young woman he is in love with. He is not the only one looking for the star for a variety of reasons.  The treacherous sons of the king who has just died are after something that will determine which one is king, and a trio of witches is after the star for the purpose of extending their lives and becoming beautiful and young again.  There are spells and pirates and a unicorn....  all wonderfully conceived.<br /><br />Stardust has all the trapping of a good fantasy film, beautiful cinematography, Good vs evil, magic, true love, and all this inventiveness as a wonder-full dressing over serious themes of being true to yourself, and the importance of knowing what you really want, and why.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy, movies that are beautiful to look at, good acting, or movies that are uplifting.<br /><br />One of the things that really pleased me after the lack of attention to detail of Witches, was the attention to detail here.  Little things, such as the fact that the Princess, her son, and most of her brothers had a clear family resemblance made me happy.  In addition little things that seem like throwaways when they occur come back later with added importance.  This should be expected from a story based on a work by Neil Gaiman, but still, it was a delight.<br /><br />There is also no unnecessary gore, nothing explicit, and no foul language, for those that care about such things.  This is a good movie for the whole family.
0525952926|3.0|I expected more historical rather than famial anecdote that the first book in the series offered.  There was a lot of remembering the characters required.  In all, I can not fault Follett for pressure to turn out another book in quick order for the publishers. However,he would have been better served to have taken the time to do the research that he did so well with Fall of Giants.I will still read the 3rd book in the trilogy but hope he gives it more historical detail as he will be speaking to a generation that remembers the Vietnam war  era well.

All the major characters from Season I are here.<br /><br />Some I hated and wanted them &#34;to get theirs&#34;.  I was not disappointed.  There are so many character and plot twists that kept me glued to the set to see how they would be resolved.<br /><br />But, by far, the special effects are spectacular.  This series is noted for its blood and gore.  It's so frightening that you want to turn away, but cannot.<br /><br />The stunt coordinators show the techniques that enabled these spectacular movements.<br /><br />This one is better than the first in character and cultural development.  I cannot wait until I get Season III

B003PBB4ME|3.0|My biggest complaint with this item is that a 550D/T2i or similarly sized camera will not fit if you're using a camera grip which means you'll have to carry your battery door with you and remove your grip and replace the door (the camera won't turn on without it) or just not use the battery grip.  It is mostly just an inconvenience if you plan on using this for a DSLR and not for just shooting video.  The X-Grip only needs maybe 1/4 to 1/2 an inch more clearance to support the use of a smaller DLSR with a battery grip so it seems like a short-coming that should have been corrected before production.<br /><br />Another short coming is the grip is flimsy.  It flexes in all directions.  It's noticeable when you stop moving, especially if you're zoomed in.  This may be due to the weight of my camera set up, which is probably light to average in weight for a DSLR.

B003X7MBOA|5.0|First - I am not a diehard Govt Mule fan. I happened to hear one of their studio recorded tracks on local radio a few years back & felt they were a pretty good rock band. The Mulennium, however, is plain old southern rock live at its best. The riffs & guitar interplays did not overpower each other & you can hear the notes & structures clearly. Infusion of blues set in a live setting brings out the best of their talent. On top of it - the recording is mega long! After going thru the whole session you feel you have just had enough, especially as the ending 4 tracks are the best in this compilation. I cannot get tired of listening to them over & over again.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|This Movie is awesome!!!!!!!! Batman is one of my favorite superheroes and when you put a great superhero+ Christopher Nolan that ultimately= The Greatest trilogy ever!!! So much can be said about this film. The acting is nothing short of great; Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. Joseph Gordon Levitt was good as John Blake/ Robin. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were both equally as great as they have been in the previous two movies. Anne Hathaway portrayed Selina Kyle very memorably; I think she and Christian Bale have good chemistry. NOW, my complaint with The Dark Knight Rises is Marion Cotillard. I feel that they did not give enough time for character development with her character Miranda Tate. The plot does has some unexpected twists that will surprise you. Christian Bale again delivers with his performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. And Despite my gripe with Miranda Tate, The Dark Knight Rises truly is the greatest ending to the best superhero trilogy ever! Christopher Nolan is just plain and simple, Pure Genius. The Dark Knight Rises gets:<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />RIP to the Aurora,Colarado victims.
B0098VXE50|4.0|This was very enjoyable to watch with our family. Great special effects and enjoyed the actors and actresses. A little bit of a twist for an old movie.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Best show on TV, After Hurricane Sandy power and tv were unavailable. It was great to be able to catch up.
B0091THRCU|4.0|The only problem I have with this product, it's very tough to pull out iPhone feels like paint going ware off the phone.
B009CPIR9K|5.0|Was surprised, didnt think it would be good, turns out to be very funny, at times nicely goofy. enjoyed, CGI space battle was fantastic.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is awesome! Reminded me of my rebel times... sometimes we think we know it all and take our parents gor granted... mom knows best!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones!! I can't deal with those earbuds, they are just uncomfortable. Most stores are not selling these over the head headphones and I'm not sure why, they are comfy, they stay in your ears, and they are so lightweight!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a overly fun game to play on my kindle. I absolutely love it! great to play when one is bored.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Can't ever get enough Zombies. This is one of the few shows I watch. Dvd came fast and was in great shape
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I always thought that science was so boring but when I got alchemy I was like WHOA!!!! This is the only thing I like with science so u should go get this app. it has Mario yoshi plankton zombies and more.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Just can't beat Zombies. One of the few shows I actually like on the tv. Got this dvd fast and was in great shape.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a favorite. You can build houses, underground tunnels, and swim to the bottom of the sea. My favorite part about Minecraft is that there are so many options on what to use to build structures, and you can also fly up, down, and across the land in Creative mode. I recommend this app for anyone who likes to build or design.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|It was a good movie in general. It has some crazy production design. It's definitely a film that's worth watching.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Very good story. Interesting from cover to cover. The type of book that you cannot wait to pick up again if you put it down.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Got this game because the grandkids play and I wanted to be able to keep up.. great game. Very addictive.
1451695195|4.0|I wanted to approach the subject from a scientific as well as a spiritual point of view.  Dr. Alexander could have gotten much more heady in his analysis but instead kept it at a easily readable level.  Easy read.  Good read.  Inspiring read.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Exellent acting and scenery give this movie an erie and dark feeling.<br />This has a nice story line and allot of the scenes actually scared me and that isn't easy to do, as I watch horror movies all the time. It's nice to see originality . Sometimes, as I'm watching a horror flick, I think &#34; why didn't you do this, or that&#34; there are allot of openings people miss and too many dull moments. This show is full of ideas not many, if any dull spots.  Daniel Radcliffe did an exellent job, as did all of the actors making it a believable and spooky show. I've already watched it twice and could see it again - Five stars !!
0547884591|1.0|Isn't it odd that notorious spammer Tim Ferris has hundreds of 5 star reviews on the day of release?  Especially when the book is 600 pages of wandering ill conceived ideas that have very little to do about cooking.  I would only advise this book for someone with severe attention deficit disorder who isn't interested in learning anything and has some kind of impacted bowel disease and needs something to pass time.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the story line better than 50 shades of grey. Love Gideon and Eva. Love that they are both equally screwed up.
B000005B0V|2.0|Hi, I misread but I thought I was getting a DVD not a tape. guess I read to quickly.<br />Is there anyway it could be returned as I have no device to play it on.<br />Thanks
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|The only draw back with this DVD is that Fat Bottom Girls is not performed.<br />Everything else is great.<br />Must have!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Really enjoyed following the characters!  Had a lot of twists and turns. interesting to learn the British view of WWII and labor issues.Can't wait for the 3rd book.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This held my interest and I couldn't put the book down. A poignant story well told. I hope that the next book is as original.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus  love this movie is one of the best  is very good i had lot of fun wathching this movie
B009KHDT0C|5.0|It was so funny and so Johnny Depp, I used to watch Dark Shadows and loved it. yea yea yea
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I loved it; it was interesting and very well paced. The variety of characters was the main reason I enjoyed it.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Perhaps the best new Christmas release since the first Vanessa Williams! Rod continues the tradition established with the American Songbook series and is joined by some superb friends like Michael Buble.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this story the author really draws you in. I was on an emotional roller coaster the entire time.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|Creative, beautiful and uplifting music.  I would say that Rebecca Ferguson's voice and music are timeless.  I have been listening to this album every day since I bought it and it never gets old.
0385535147|4.0|Great fun read- keeps you guessing until the end! This one is good compared to his books in the past few years.<br />S
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|i really enjoyed this game. This game is good for anyone who likes building stuff. This is the best angry birds game yet!
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|Love Phil Phillips. He doesn't disappoint! Love the album, listen to it all the time. :) great purchase love amazon mp3
B006WQLH7G|4.0|it's really to early to tell if it works or not....I just put it in, it's free and time will tell. I got it due to ratings.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Love Robert and Jude.  Hope they have another Sherlock to come.  Awesome team work and both are sexy as hell!!!!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie is simply just okay. The problem is it has no real moving story. She does not want the princess duties blah blah but learns to accept her responsibility. Her Mom and brothers become bears but turn back into humas at end of film. Predictable.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Received it on time and for a GOOD price.<br /><br />The album is solid. Tells a story. Although there are some songs I do not like, the ones I do like are great. BUY IT!
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I purchased this movie because it was 1 of my favorites when it was released...I first saw it at the movies...very cool film. This is a cult favorite.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Kenneth Branagh should have gotten an oscar for this film. For the first time ever, al four hours of this show are on film. This is great for students who have to study the work. i'm beginning to believe though, William Shakespeare did not write any of these shows. He only had a six grade education for pete's sake. so someone else must have penned them and put his name on it, but who? I saw a full-length version of this work on stage one time and it was excellent. it appears to be a favorite role of many actors. Would like to have seen this on the big screen.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. The story is amazing. Also, the blu ray has many great features that any true fan would really enjoy.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|So boooooooring that my daughter, 6 years old ended up sleeping the first 25 min I two attempts to see the movie!
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I really loved this movie. It has many scenes in which I laughed hysterically. It also has many lines that I'm sure will be referenced and quoted for years.
B005ETANC2|5.0|Excellent quality and just as I remember it. I have been trying to collect many of the Sci-Fi movies from my youth and this is one of them that I had to have.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD has all of Adele's best and greatest songs.  It came in new condition at a great price!  I listen to it all the time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games books are fantastic!  Great escapism from reality and really interesting.  Found the entire series to be engrossing!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Friends keep telling me how they love watching &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34;  I bought this for a great price and it has 2 seasons!<br />It is a Christmas present from my husband and I can't wait to start watching it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|i absolutely loved the characters of this book not only was it a great love story i also found it to be humorous.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Fun for all ages. Great graphics and animation. It nice that you can accomplish building bridges many different ways not just one cookie cutter way. I'd say about 6 and up.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|The game is OK. What I don't like is the fact you have to keep buying items to keep playing different levels. Just charge one price and be done with it...
B004TB6GUY|4.0|If you love BLS you already know. Just toss this disk in and bang your head like we all do to the rest of the BLS collection.
6304711905|5.0|As a lover of the Earp history and done my own life long readings on him & been in Tombstone twice , this movie is 'roughly' about as close as you can get to the truth outside of Henry Fondas black N white :  Earp seldom went armed , was fast & decisive & Freely admitted to killing many who were law breakers --I give the movie five full stars :
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use.  easy to down load.  all around nice calculator.  I recomend this product to all.  nothing fancy just a good tool.
B001OFJPIS|3.0|As is usual, sequels are often not up to par or exceed the orginal ;  As a follower of Ron Pearlman from his early days of Beauty N the Beast from decades back, I had hopes this sequel would be equal to the orginal but while its a &#34;nice&#34; move in action sequences it left me personally lacking in approvals---
B00005JMCT|5.0|love the movie<br />loved it so much that now i can watch it when ever i want<br />great movie great movie
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Watched the movie before taking the grandchildren on the Polar Express train ride in Saratoga, NY. They were wound before the trip and even more so afterward.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|must see for any one<br />great story and acting is amazing love this movie so much this is a must have
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring,  although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book.
B000031WD9|5.0|love the movie<br />loved it so much that now i can watch it when ever i want<br />great movie great movie
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The Facebook site is not really easy to navigate from my Kindle Fire....not as user friendly as from my computer<br />Verna Sorensen
B002NJWHHA|4.0|Liked effects- not as great as the b ook but to be expected. My 10 year old really liked it.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I did not see AHS season 1, but, all I heard were rave reviews, so I was very excited to see the first episode of the second season. It was all and somewhat more than I expected, real old horror movie stuff.  Well, it has slid downhill from there! The most recent episode, has Sister Jude back at the asylum, and two parents, leaving their somewhat &#34;troubled&#34; adolescent daughter, in her care. Pure raw horror movie stuff has been replaced by an adult soap opera. I must say, however, Jessica Lange rocks, she is the most talented living American actor.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This EP (only six songs but what GREAT classic Christmas songs) is a compilation of six classics with a &#34;Pentatonix twist&#34; which allows for those ages 2-90 to enjoy them all over again.  This is not the usual, but the unusual in that their professionalism and personality come out in each of these numbers.  I am having trouble putting this album down, the melodies and complicated beats give it a refreshing flavor to the usual Christmas songs you hear each Christmas holiday season.  I highly recommend this if you want to feel the Christmas spirit while going about all of your preparations for the holidays...................you'll not want to put it down and will want to recommend it to all your friends and relatives too!
0545101425|5.0|Great product. Bummer ending to a great start of a series. We look forward to the movie though. Katniss loves... I won't spoil it ;-)
B004L8A34U|4.0|I had to watch for a college course. It is in mandarin so that means you'll have to read subtitles if you don't know the language (I do not know mandarin). Movie is overall pretty good but there is a section in the middle where the protagonist comes off as a super creep and that part is sort of awkward.
B00973DDN2|4.0|I really like this band and this album does not disappoint.  The sound is familiar, yet fresh and I'm playing it over and over as time goes by.
1401200923|5.0|I've always liked Jim Lee's work. This book only reinforces his legend.<br />All in all, the Hush series was written superbly and with top notch pencils, you can't go wrong. Truly, a must have for comic book lovers.
B000000XB9|5.0|Always great!  aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaa aaaaa a a a  a  a  aaaaa aaa aaa aaa aaa a  aa  a a a
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|I'm not sure which they are asking to be reviewed here so ill review both.<br /><br />Viewing the movie through Amazon was excellent as always. The movie stopped only once which was most likely a bandwidth issue at my house since everything connects and streams over wireless. M<br /><br />The movie was horrible. Long and not much action our much to the story. Hopefully part 2 has a lot more to it.
B000148KK2|5.0|Soulful lady!  aaaa  a a  a  a a  a  aaaaaa a a a  a a  a a a  aaaaa a aa
B000AAF1U4|5.0|My 4 yr. old grandson loves the Disney movies so i try to find some of the older ones for us to watch together.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  This movie brings together The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man stories (plus a couple of minor super heroes) and delivers non-stop action, and lots of humor, giving the viewer a wild and entertaining ride. Loved it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like the game. The colors are nice. I'll enjoy it for a long time. It is really easy to download and use.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a very exciting and and challenging product. You will be fully engaged in it and surprised at how realistic the product is.
B005R32L66|4.0|It is a good app and downloaded just fine, but I had to get help from an IT guy to get it downloaded because Google Play Store does not work on my tablet.
B002APU580|5.0|This is, in my opinion, a thoroughly satisfying rendition of the beloved novel -- or, at least, it's the film version that I prefer. The acting is outstanding, from bit parts right on through main characters; the settings evocative of place and period; the sets are visions of color, lighting, details that entrance and convince that this is authentic (or, at the very least, a &#34;reality&#34; that satisfies)! Revel in the beautifully chosen colors and luscious tints of walls, gowns/costumes (whether plain or dress formal) and then glory in the sweeping countryside shots...There are some memorable scenes in this one -- enjoy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun app. I would like to see an easier way of exiting out of all the ads every new deal.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can refer to weather in may parts of the usa in a few moments and it helps me decide what to pack.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Great for passing the time. Very challenging, but could do without the undo button - makes it easy to cheat.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|A continuation of the series, it is a good book that wonderfully melds the Percy Jackson series to this one. Good action sequences and a must read for followers of this series.
6305127646|1.0|Simply put I really hate this movie. \\"The Saint\\" as in the character is one of the all time greats in detective and suspense books and screen. This movie has nothing to do with that character but basically hijacks him to promote someone's fantasy about free energy. It is a wretched failure both in the world of imagination and in the real world because guess what there is no \\"free energy\\". It is bad enough that the world is filled with con artists bilking innocent people with these kind of schemes. We don't need Hollywood to glorify them. Big thumbs down.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A riveting read with a lot of hidden analogies. I liked the post-apocalyptic set up with characters that had very believable mindsets.  A good book for young and adult readers alike.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|I can't believe an actor of Liam Neeson's qyality was is a movie like this.  &#34;Taken&#34; was the worst movie I have ever seen.  It was terrible.  Ftom the reviews I have read, &#34;Taken 2&#34; is just as bad.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|started off as a really fun game, but after a couple days of playing it started crashing while making selections in the store, and now while opening new mail. too many glitches.
B00A14SQBU|4.0|this album stays pretty consistant with its sound, in my opinion. it really focuses on being a &#34;fighter&#34;. the songs that made the most impressions on me were the lotus into, blank page, and just a fool. it's a solid album and if you're a christina aguilera fan i think you'll definitely like it.<br />the reason i gave it four stars was because while i know an artist's sound changes through time, i wish there was a little more soul like there was on stripped.
B007V65R54|5.0|Silver's casual and witty writing style makes this an easy an enjoyable read.  I recommended this book to someone and they asked me, &#34;Is this going to be like a math textbook with lots of Greek letters that's all theory and no practical application?&#34;  I said, &#34;No, it's just the opposite of that.&#34;
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book both for its length and the depth of its characters. I have never read a Follett book before and was rather pleased.  The book flows nicely with the back and forth stories of its central characters.  I am now reading the 2nd book which picks up after Fall of Giants concludes.  Both weave a good dose of history into the books which puts the realities of world war l and II into perspective.
B002ZG99TK|1.0|Even if I had not worked in railroad operations for two Class I RR's, I would not have had trouble figuring out how ludicrous and completely lacking in authenticity this movie is.  From the get-go, with a runaway which never would have happened as portrayed, to the idea that RR's move hazardous materials without documentation (and must go to an oh-so-handy FRA inspector for info), to a train dispatcher needing to ask a crew where their train was, to yardmasters (of either gender) having time to wander around and ponder what to do, what to do in the face of crisis, to the means supposedly used to halt the out-of-control train.  A runaway train would have been derailed ASAP at a point as far from population centers as the railroad could arrange it.  Portable derails do do their job; it would only be a question of how long it would take to get an employee to get to the point where this device could be safely placed.  Railroading is a highly, highly regulated form of transportation.  All employees directly involved in the movement of trains must pass extensive rules exams at least once every two years.  Shippers must provide detailed information on shipments before a railcar is moved, and that is used to construct bills of lading required for transport.  Does it ever occur to those associated with creating films to do some basic research before making a movie, or are their products designed to check how low the IQ of the general public might be?<br />There is so much about railroading which would provide a factual, fascinating story lines.  I could spend the rest of my life writing, on the basis of my own experiences, and so could many other rails I know.
034580404X|5.0|It was the best book I have read in a long time. Simply the best. Would like to find more books like it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|the demo does sick because pf the time limit but if you get the download everything pro app you can get the full version on 4shared.com for free! I highly recommend this because I myself have done this and its awesome. :)
B009LUCPWQ|4.0|Not as pumped up as in the '70s, but just as acerbic and entertaining.  Welcome back, Rumour!  Great stuff!! Thanks
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have got all the way though level 222 something r there anymore updates. I am addicted to this game. love it.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids love this movie , everyone in my family love this movie along with kids.  With Blu ray video is stunning
0439023521|5.0|Very fast shipping, came in perfect condition. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a new adventure to go on. Fantastic read!
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book and can not wait until the next book comes out in December. I think if you read this one you would fall in love with characters.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game.. I play it all of the time. this is one of the best games on my kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is reccomended for all ages it is really fun and saves up so much time!!!! (: it really is a great game incase your bored.
B009SKPVO8|5.0|i love this strap. it is very comfortable and holds by camera in a secure way i highly reccomed this strap<br /><br />i would rather buy this than a black rapid for more than 2x the money<br /><br />Before you buy on amazon check your local best buy when i bought mine it was $4 cheeper and no shipping time (obviously)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's just like those machines at arcades. They suck you in!  Unless you're buying more coins in game (which I don't), the coins go pretty fast, for a quick, progressive game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This episode was good and worth it I am eventually going to buy both seasons when they come out. Awesome series
B0090EJR1K|2.0|I guess I expected it to be funnier. Most of the humor points weren't funny. They weren't even stupid-funny. It was slow, drawn out and disappointing.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a fun way to learn to play the piano.  I especially like playing &#34;The Entertainer&#34;.  I recommend it!
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Fruit Ninja meets Cut the Rope. It's addictive and progressively more challenging. Started out slow. I thought it was too easy. It gets much harder if you want to keep on par.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|Several of the songs seemed pretty cool - I particularly liked Clementine.  But some others didn't do much for me.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app is awesome because 1. its free 2. you get to fly around in a jet pack 3. lots of upgrades/ special actions
0385344333|3.0|I really like the Jack Reacher books and this is pretty typical.  But it does seem like much of the same things are being rehashed and I can't ever get really worried about Reacher because I know he is pretty much invincible.  Then there are some strange things -- like his nose injury that is never really explained.  I think he mentions getting a gun butt in the face from a law officer.  If so, how the heck did that happen, and what did he do after that?
B009YU62H2|5.0|Gotta love Soundgarden!  Album was great the first listen and it just keeps getting better every time I hear it!  Highly recommended!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It was always a tradition between my brother and I to watch &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; on Thanksgiving Day, in order to officially kick off the holiday season.  I was on my own this Thanksgiving (out of town on work) and was not able to purchase or rent a copy of this classic movie before Thanksgiving Day itself.  Fortunately for me, Amazon had this wonderful &#34;on demand&#34; service available, and I was able to rent and watch it immediately for just $2.99.  Thanks, Amazon, for allowing me to observe a long-time tradition, and making me feel a little closer to home on Thanksgiving!
B001VIMCW4|3.0|The film tells the fictional secret story behind the Cochabamba Water Wars of 2000 ([...]) that occurred after the government invited privatization of the badly mismanaged state-owned water utility.  The political situation was already tense and the multinational that took the contract and massively increased the cost of water overnight merely put match to tinder.  Aside from the interesting historical backdrop, this film was disappointing, doing little in terms of character development, unless you consider killing most of the likeable characters as development.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I love the movie because not only can you watch it with your kids but it has a greater understanding for adults.
B001RMYWG8|1.0|it's the city as it was.  before there was a Starbucks on every corner. with Al Pacino early in his career giving a performance all he's got. I had forgotten about this movie but  I saw a news item with the real Serpico in it then I went to Amazon to order. the story shows how bad corruption can get and how we should be glad for people like Serpico who had the guts to speak out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think it is awesome because you get a lot of prizes and coins and more people should get it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Sit back and enjoy great performances by your favorite actors. Great story with great actors. Enjoyed it so much. Buy this!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Has some new birds---but pretty much the same.  He played for a little bit but switched back to the older versions of the angry birds games.  He is 6 and loves playing games on the Kindle---but this one is OK--not great from his use.
B009LA1R34|5.0|Im in love with this cd, it has different styles of beats, she is Awesome, no wonder she es known as the queen of Latin POP, I really  love it
0060920084|4.0|I read this book several months ago on a plane from Atlanta to El Paso.  I laughed so hard I cried and pretty soon everyone on the plane was looking at me.  I was by myself but had to be moved in between two women and I shared as much as possible with them when I just couldn't stop laughing.  I'm sure they thought I was nuts.  The last third of the book was an ordinary but interessting travelogue.  I really felt like I got my money's worth and it made the long trip home very short indeed.  I then sent the book to my sister and my daughter.  Anyone who needs a good lauhh should read it
B0016LTNL4|5.0|I could watch this over and over -- it is brilliantly written and acted, and laugh-out-loud funny. The choice of cast is impeccable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you love zombies, action, suspense and twisted crazy fun, watch the walking dead. No one is exempt from becoming a zombie, kids, star of the show or anybody. I love this show, and would recommend it to anyone who love horror, and zombies, as well as as the best actors on TV. I would rate it a 1000 if I could!!!!!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I have to be honest, I have read most of Nicholas Sparks' other novels and was gripped from the first chapter.  This one was not so.  I kept reading a little and putting it down...reading a little more and putting it down.  I did this throughout the entire first half of novel.  It just seemed so disjointed, and none of the story lines were making sense or fitting together.  Then all of a sudden, the story just took off!  I couldn't put the book down!  I literally cried at the end.  The ending made the first half of the novel well worth sticking it out to the end. The only thing that prevented me from rating this five stars is that the beginning was so hard to plod through.  Another amazing novel by Sparks!
B002N7P23I|5.0|I wish like crazy that I had seen this original version before viewing the American version starring \\"Dexters sister\\"......I believe its title was \\"Quarantine\\". It was a good movie and virtually identical to the original Spanish version I am now reviewing.<br />The original did at least as good and possibly better job of making available a great horror movie that is both scary and claustrophobic and did so with one heck of a smaller budget.<br />I wonder if Hollywood remains capable of making an original good horror movie of if it has declined to the point where we HAVE to literally rob foreign film makers in making re-do's of their films? It has been quite some time since this country has made a really great horror movie with very few exceptions (Spliter, 30 Days of Night,American Psycho, a small handful of others).<br />Like in so many other areas, America is no longer the maker of the best of everything. Makes ya wonder if the Romans actually knew they were declining when the evidence was so apparent that indeed they were. Now with Obama dead set on Socializing our country at a faster pace than it was already on. Obama is dead set on removing all incentives to excel by his attempts to \\"level the income gap\\" while not rewarding hard work and sacrifice with EARNED financial incentives. Our once \\"Greatest Country On Earth\\" is on a MUCH steeper decline thanks to \\"Barry\\". We are not falling like Rome, we have already fell and merely awaiting the impact. The proof is easily seen in our ever increasing reliance on copying the works of other countries, be it movies, cars or what have you. In a year our for the moment, greatest healthcare system available anywhere will also decline into mediocrity by way of Socialism. Why should our great surgeons work in a country with set fee schedules that Obamacare will mandate. Socialism is the womb of mediocrity.
1451695195|5.0|I have read a lot of literature regarding NDEs or Spiritually Transforming Experiences and highly recommend this book.  It presents a very clear account by a Scientifically minded medical specialist who is totally changed by his experience.  He is able to assess his experience from a scientific point of view and find that Spiritual truth is compatible with Science.<br />He now teaches that Love is the essential ingredient of everything.

B00AA7O6QC|5.0|you dont find many movies better than their first. This is one for sure. We absolutely loved this movie. Action packed!!!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Definitely worth seeing.  Maybe there could have been a little more depth to the characters - I don't know - a little bit of something was missing in the story or the characters.  But definitely a good movie
B004JHY80I|4.0|This is the first Sarah Waters book that I had read, so I had no preconceived expectations. Set in the 1800's, once you settle in to the prose of this book (and I think it's a lot easier to read than a Dickens book) you quickly become immersed in the story.<br /><br />The story quickly unfolds into a treacherous plot, and just when you think you have the story all sorted out, it twists.<br /><br />There are parts of the book that are, at times, long winded but overall the story did keep me captivated.
0307949486|2.0|I wish I could see what other people see in this book.  When I finished it, I literally had to investigate whether I was reading the same book/version/edition as everyone else.  It turns out, I was.  Since The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has been so well received, my only conclusion is that the disparity between how I perceive the book and how others perceive it is simply a consequence of differing tastes.  That being said, I would give this novel 1 star but I have generous standards.  I would only give 1 star to literature that has rampant grammatical mistakes, syntax errors, etc.  So The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is certainly \\"readable.\\"  Larson's literary style is decent enough and sentence to sentence, there are no glaring problems.<br /><br />The issue I have is with the plot and the flow of his narrative.  In the first 200 pages, for every paragraph that advances the plot, Larson drowns the reader with 10 more paragraphs that are filled with meaningless details and \\"clues\\" that amount to nothing, in the end.  A lot of the dialogue runs like conversation in real life...  most of the time it's inane, meandering, and leads to absolutely nothing.  When I finished the book, I realized that the first 150 pages could have been completely snipped away and it wouldn't have changed the plot at all.<br /><br />And worse, Larson has mastered the high sin of \\"info dumping.\\"  In the world of creative writing, \\"info dumping\\" on your readers is considered a mortal sin.  In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it's the norm.  What's worse, Larson's info dumps don't even say anything about vital characters, relationships, or relevant events.  Instead, he'll blather on about the weather or what the protagonist fed his cat.<br /><br />But the greatest offense to me the reader was that I felt insulted by his novel, and that doesn't happen very often.  The source of the insult?  The rape, murder, and sex.  And no, I'm not offended by the idea of rape, murder, and sex in literature when it serves some purpose to the plot.  But in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, rape, sex, and murder is just thrown in as an afterthought; as a cheap shocker.  It's like hot women in beer adds.  So Larson's main characters decide to have sex for the hell of it.  Women get raped and it does nothing to serve the plot.  The murderer has no motive, reason, or underlying psychology behind the crimes he commits.  He/she just does it because, well, he/she is a psycho and that's what psychos do, right?<br /><br />Given that so many people are raving about this book, I feel as though I can't recommend NOT to buy it.  All I can say is it's one of the least enjoyable best sellers I've ever read.en it serves some purpose to the plot.

B0063IH60K|5.0|The best solitaire game l've played! I reccomend it for anyone who wants a challenge. I love it's ease of card movement.
0316223239|5.0|When I sat down to read Room, I didn't stand up until it was finished.  I'd rather not spoil anything about the story, so I'll simply say this: I'm astounded that an author is able to keep a story about such a confined space so interesting.  I generally don't give books five star reviews unless they offer something new and interesting to literature.  Needless to say, I haven't quite read anything like Room.  Naturally, this book is not for anyone seeking action or adventure, but for anyone interested in how extreme circumstances shape human psychology, this is certainly a worthwhile purchase.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I rented it and asked for a refund due to the audio problems. I didn't watch more than the first five minutes when I found I couldn't folow what anyone was saying..

B005OLF6BI|5.0|This Tour was great in every single moment. it is like in one moment you have Broadway and Taylor Swift.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Some ghosting. Pricing was comparable to others streaming services but seems like  VUDU streaming has the best HD.. I think most services use 720p for HD streaming. What I would like to know is what's the min connections speed for full 1080p streaming..My min connection is ~3 mbs up to 10mbs
B007IXWL2C|3.0|There is a story line in there somewhere, but when the author finally gets to it, there is a let down.  It could have been written much better.  It feels as though the story is in there, but you never really get to see it.  Those are my two cents anyway :)
B000FC12C8|4.0|This book is the Bible for index investing. But it's simply too long to read and pretty complicated if you're not super finance savvy. I prefer Bogle's book  if finance or investing is not your livelihood. If you are a hard-core numbers cruncher, you will like this book and probably read it many times over. If you want a simple book on index investing, this is not your book. Read something like [[ASIN:0470102101 The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns (Little Books. Big Profits)]] instead.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|wish the controls responded to what I'm actually doing a lot of the time (which is pretty much every Spidey game), otherwise great fun
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fresh Flynn, typically thrilling style, topical, makes you want more...ended way too soon!  Mitch Rapp still the most dangerous man on the planet...with more heart, soul, and vuneralbility...great character development...same for Irene Kennedy...loved the power and her tears!  Have read them all...highly recommend...can't wait for next one.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Been waiting a long time for a new album from him, and this does not disappoint.  Turn up the stereo
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|The family enjoyed this movie,  especially the kids.  The graphics are very good and the story line is enjoyable also.  Recommend getting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Highly recommend this series and I am eagerly anticipating more from the author.  I hope I do not have long to wait
B008WCP2KG|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  Don't waste your money.  There is no story line. Poorly done. What a waste.
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it again.  The Mark of Athena is another installment to the Heros of Olympus that doesn't fail to deliver yet another thrill ride.  Quoting my son, he gives it two thumbs up.The characters are easy to love and root for during their quest to save the world as we know it from the rise of Gaea.  We have totally enjoyed getting to know Annabeth and Percy and the other demigods as they fight to overcome not only the road blocks to succeed in their quest but also to overcome their own personal insecurities and fears.  This book is not only for young readers but those who are young at heart and enjoy adventure.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was really good with a good message about making decisions as well as opening your eyes to no-traditional standard.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is super entertaining. It is probably my favorite! GET THIS APP!!!!!!!! The main idea is you're getting chased by man eating monkeys through a temple ruin after you stole an ancient cursed idol. I promise you,  anyone to get this will ADORE it!!!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Unlike the one that came with the Kindle did not word for look up ...I found that very disappointing & confusing...BUT this one woks & I get to look up what I need to look up...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best app I have ever downloaded. Great reading plans to follow. I like the way you can share notes with other believers. Great way to be held accountable by optional notifications.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love how Follett weaves such in depth historical research with an intriguing story line.  As with all of his books, I had a tough time putting it down.  Fall of Giants MUST be read first.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I've tried EVERYTHING to download the flash player,but it wont do it. Heard adobe won't support  mobile devices anymore. If that's the case......they suck.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  The special effects were very good.  I think most SyFy fans will enjoy this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|it's a good read but not the best from Grisham. the story is a little forced, light and airy, by Grisham standard.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|This movie rocks, I loved it very much. I recommened that every one buys this movie. Very Very Good movie.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I know that the developers need to make a living, but the ads drive me nuts. I would rather pay for the ap and be done with it than put up with the ads.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading it again. I read it many years ago as a young child and enjoyed it so much I wanted to read it again.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It is easy to use. Very convenient. I use it often when reading. Having it on Kendle makes it very portable.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|enjoyed this film very much, it is light hearted and fun to watch, great actors and interesting roles, would watch again
B004GYY714|5.0|Download was quick and finding radio stations from all over is a blast. Would recommend this to everyone! Super cool
B0053TMP24|4.0|Rick Riordan really knows how to plot. This was one of the most detailed books in the series, but it was so good I couldn't stop reading. If you are looking for a carefully organized story with action, mystery, adventure, and even romance, look no further.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This lovely book is written from the perspective of a boy who is normal in every way, except for his disfigured face and his capacity for forgiveness. As the story progresses, the perspective switches to several other characters, all students, and each one speaks with their own unique voice.<br /><br />At no time does the book ever become preachy or overly dramatic. It's light and easy to read, and very hard to put down. It is not manipulative or maudlin, and yet it is profoundly moving. I think teachers should add this book to their elementary school curriculum. I think it could really reach students in a powerful way, because the story is told by kids they will be able to relate to.<br /><br />The simple phrase &#34;choose kind&#34; could make such a difference.
B001W79MBI|5.0|Amazing movie! I loved the characters, story and action. Well worth the buy. If you have not seen the movie but love anime fights like those in samurai champloo then this would be your thing. story wise the way the two main characters developed from begrudging companions using each other solely for survival to becoming friends is well done. The action is not over the top so don't expect the main characters to shoot energy blasts while randomly getting a power up at the end due to friendship or some other cliche. the fate of the main character is left up to your interpretation. its does not say what exactly happens to him. While this may sound off putting to some of you trust me it is done in a way that leaves you satisfied with the ending and you don't feel like the  story was incomplete.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|This product was exactly what I was looking for. I like to get on my Harley or in my car, point it in a direction & go. I love to get lost on the back roads of America without a GPS telling me &#34;re-calculating&#34; or which way to turn. However though like all of us, I must find my way back sometimes & this mapping software is great to allow you to follow where the road goes while sitting at a coffee shop. You can take road trips with this mapping software before you leave the house, so you can decide that the back road you found on a previous trip actually goes somewhere or if a U-turn is in your future. This software also has the availability to map road trips for lots of other countries too ( for those world adventure seekers). Yes, I would recommend this mapping software for those that do not travel the beaten path.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|A well written and original way of  looking at the contribution of ancient and medieval thinkers in our modern western society.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Great, amazing, fantastic album.  In true Black Key's fashion they once again are able to keep their identity yet develop some new sounds.<br /><br />One of the few albums that has come out as of late that i can just press play, hit repeat all, and not worry about getting a song i don't like.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000001F95|5.0|Everything was perfect and I will most certainly use the site some other time again and also recommend it to my friends.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Great album (wish they had a clean version, but i just deleted the one Explicit song).<br /><br />Totally recommend buying this.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|A fascinating piece of pseudo-realism, cleverly constructed, with compelling characters and a series of walloping reveals.  A complete surprise and wholly unique.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Hands down, favorite holiday movie--Will Ferrell's facial expressions are hilarious and Zooey Deschanel  has the voice of an angel. Even better than a combination of Fergie and Jesus.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I had a little trouble with the pacing of the second book, but I couldn't put this one down! I completely agree with Orson Scott Card's assessment of Sanderson as a writer, he brings so much wisdom to his books and his characters! This book boldly addresses challenging ideas:  What makes a good leader? What is the purpose of loss and destruction? What does it mean to truly love someone? At the same time it's an engaging story with lots of action. It also addresses the burning questions you undoubtedly had from books one and two. All I can say is read this book!!! Heck, read the whole series!
B008H6GHL0|4.0|I thought this was a sequel to the other CGI Resident Evil? It feels like a stand- alone movie... which I guess is what the producers want anyway. My comment is that this is so short
B002APU580|5.0|I LOVE this rendition of the story.  I have rented it and watched it over and over so I decided to purchase it.  I also own an older version of the DVD with Lawerence Olivier but find it much less satisfactory  telling of the story.<br /><br />The direction and performances in the Kiera Knightly version are outstanding in my opinion.
B004IDYK0G|5.0|The Script is the type of songs that I listen to. I do wish Amazon would publish more albums at $5.00 or less. That'll make people like me buy them
B0053O89U6|5.0|Okay, this comedy series can delight all kinds of families.  As nutty as they are, they have the same situations we all face in our lives.  This is not stapstick in any way, just terrific entertainment. The actors make this show!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I like this band and the songs they sing. It gives a positive spin to what they want to say.
0345529057|5.0|Quick delivery, It fills in do much more detail the Game of Thrones on HBO. Too bad book 5 isn't included. Youll have 2 yrs to finish before book 6
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this game is great it teaches kids how to upgrade and build and how to spend their money and not to blow it on stupid stuff
B000S0DDG0|5.0|Easy movie for a weekend rental. Eddie Murphy is great in this film. Watch with your significant other definitely a chick flick.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This movie has plenty of action. There are very seldom times where there aren't guns blazing and blood flying around. Overall it is pretty good. There are a lot of cheesy moments which are expected with the cast. Worth checking out if your into a lot if gunfire and overaged actors.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book was so juvenile I could not get through it. Was bored out of my mind. I would not recommend it unless you are about 15 years old.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A wonderful book totally captivating with unexpected twisting events throughout.<br />Unstoppable reading till the very end.<br />Highly recommended as one of the best trilogy drama books I have read.
0553382152|5.0|This is up there as one of the best books I've ever read.  It was absolutely incredible.  I can't believe that I waited so long to pick it up.  I had heard of it being about a woman who had a near death experience, but I didn't realize that she went into so much detail.  Having been connected to the other side since I was born, what they've shown me is very similar to what this author writes in this book.  It's 100% accurate.  I was floored how similar her accounts were on par with what I was shown.  Everyone is going to be in for a big surprise when they cross over that debunks this.  The ones that will be hit hardest will be atheists and hard-core religious people, both who have it backwards.  Atheists will be probably be hit even harder since at least religious people are open to some form of a God.  They are at a lower level of spiritual growth in this lifetime and only what they can handle and will become privy to the truth on their own time.  If that doesn't happen in this lifetime, it will for sure when they cross over, but they'll ease them into it delicately so as not to shock their system.  This book discusses some of that.  Highly recommend for the open minded and for those who are all about love, because in the end that's what this book is about and our purpose here.  Giving and sharing love.  The others that show hate, negativity and judgment have a lot to learn while here.  You have to have a closed heart to not like this book or its simply beyond your capacity to understand at this time.<br /><br />The reason why we are all here is accurate as well as the process and journey after our spirit exits the body.  She discusses coming into contact with Jesus, but what isn't mentioned is that this doesn't mean everyone comes into contact with him immediately.  He comes forward quickly to those that are devout believers of him as the author must be.  If Buddha was the one that you were looking to, then that's who would come forward for you.  You would eventually grow to learn that the others are very real as well.  As I said this wasn't mentioned in the book and that might be cause for confusion or disbelief to some.lly grow to learn that the others are very real as well.

B0018AM1YY|5.0|Love his greatest hits, Neil Young is a talented classical musician.  I've seen him play live in person and amazed at his ability to play several instruments.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It's a power/patch chord. What could be confusing about that? Well, I thought I was getting a power chord, but the power head is not part of this sale. So, I put it in my suitcase thinking I had a spare for my out of town trip. Surprise! I only had a patch chord! So, there was nothing wrong with the product--I just didn't read the description closely enough. Make sure you are getting the whole enchilada! Fortunately, I was able to patch it into my computer so I could recharge my Kindle while out of town, but it was not what I thought I was buying.
B004TLMG4Y|5.0|This is one of WASPs best albums! Intense lyrics and hard driving music. A good listen for those like Me in the BDSM community!

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was disappointed with this book. It seems like the last two books that Grisham has written were not up to par. This one kept dragging on. It will be a while before I order another John Grisham book.

B00A17AD36|4.0|I've been waiting for this project for over a year and I am impressed by the remastered tracks from his mixtape. If you are already a fan you will just be a bigger one after this.

0307352145|5.0|This book affirms me!  It is easy for introverts to feel like they don't fit in this extrovert-laden world, but Susan Cain helps me realize how much I can cherish my desire for solitude.

B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|i loved it but i wish &#34;pour it up&#34; was longer and &#34;numb&#34; didn't have Eminem in it...i thought the song didn't really need him
B009HV2JT8|4.0|You'll be disappointed. I was fully expecting to laugh at what I thought would be a ridiculous plot. Little did I know, I'd find a well written and acted story with just enough reality and history in it to keep you entertained and believable. The plot moves at a good clip so you'll not be bored. You have fact, fiction, action, romance, revenge, explosions, and a great fight scene. Everyone will be happy although under 13 not recommended as they may have nightmares and some parts can be a bit bloody and violent. I will add this movie to my library and will watch it again for sure.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham books are always page turners, and I have read them all, but this one was not as good as usual.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book, but I will never look at relationships and other people the same way again. good luck.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I've been a big fan of his since Andromeda Strain.  This book harkens back/reminds me of some of his earlier works.  I liked it better than Latitudes but very graphic (gory at times).
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I was told how great this series was, so decided to try it.  It is one of the most boring books I have ever read!  Since I purchased the series, I figured I should read all three.  I couldn't wait toget to the end of the last book.  The author just kept repeating the same things over and over and it was difficult to get enthused in the story line period.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|Just plain powerful and masterful by the legendary saxophonist.  Every serious saxophonist should have this in their collection!!!  I play this CD often and always find something else or hear something else from the previous listening that I didn't pick up on before!

B009FZHYKU|4.0|I was able to view all episodes except Season 3, Episode 1 on Time Warner Cable and Netflix.  I was happy to be able to view this episode even though I had to pay for it.  Thanks to Amazon.com I was able to catch up on all episodes.  Now I watch the current episode every Sunday.
B009SCRERI|5.0|My daughter simply love it:) Was a great family movie too great for the holidays! Would def tell my friends about it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I watched the entire season in one weekend. It is a terrific show. The cast is amazing. As a Charlottean, I enjoyed seeing local places where scenes were shot. Oh yeah, and the storyline is pretty enthralling too. I subscribed to Showtime so I could watch season 2 immediately.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|did not get to watch the movie so I do not know how good it was. sorry it was to late too<br /> watch time expired
B00846TTDG|4.0|I found this movie to be more realistic in the genre of war movies. Actors were not as professional, but they did a good job. Lack of gore, sex and foul language made it especially worth while.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|Much of the dialogue could have been written by a male adolescent or by the less mature members of a frat house.
B005UG542S|3.0|The final movie in the series. Each movie seemed less impressive. Followed the book fairly well. Darker with a bit more teen romance. I miss the feel good, funny stuff.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|Very nice as a night light, and the motion detector works very well for the price.  I was looking for a battery powered LED lightweight, overhead work light, for when the power is out. This light is too dim for this purpose.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Maybe I'm expecting more from movies these days. Hunger Games was a great book, but not as believable as a movie.
1611294185|5.0|I loved this book.  The characters are complex and so thoroughly explored, and even though they may not be likable for much of the time, they are wholly familiar and relatable.  It's an honest book and Franzen somehow managed to write about all of life in contemporary America by focussing on these few characters and how they relate to each other and the world.  It's fascinating and ultimately very satisfying.  I like this so much more than THE CORRECTIONS.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|The title tells the story , its that predictable. Simply all about a psychotic room mate. Its incredibly slow with the one piece of little action near the end if you can stay awake that long. Thank goodness for the jump forward facility on the dvd player. Not even scary. or thrilling in the slightest.
B009G3TNIM|4.0|Great recording quality; although, not my favorite Converge material.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Converge for ~16 years now.  I am a bigger fan of their earlier albums: Caring and Killing, Petitioning the Empty Sky, and When Forever Comes Crashing.  I didn't fully appreciate Jane Doe until recently.<br /><br />This is a good album, just not my favorite.  I'm sure I will eventually grow to love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant about this one after all the hype, but unlike other over advertised books for this audience, this one was very well written.  The characters are compelling and the pacing of the plot makes it difficult to put down.  Eager to read the next one.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|was nonstop action from very begining,and all the pop culture jokes where priceless,is a movie i will watch many times
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book helped me to find my meaning or I should say my purpose of living. It's an awesome account of what concentration camp prisoners had to deal with but not solely geared toward that alone.<br />There are comparisons on their life and a average person's life in which one can relate to his and the other, experiences.<br />For the price even if you don't find anything you like about it, it wouldn't be something you regret but that's up to your discretion. I think it was a awesome book and I have referred some of my friends to it already.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|This CD came fastly and with no problems at all. It was great for a gift for someone in my family.
1452110581|5.0|The author of this little book of cat poems has written word-pictures of how a cat thinks. Of so it seems, to me. If you've ever lived with a cat, you'll recognize many of these behaviors. This little book of poems makes a great little Christmas present for that friend who has everything.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|It took a little long to arrive but everything else was great. No damages or problems what so ever. Thanks.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|i got the moive to see if my little girl would like it,,, she is only 3 and she sat though the whole movie,,,,, she loved it we have watched it alot
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|Great precursor to what I hope is a full length album.  Favorite songs are: Ride, American, Cola, & Gods & Monsters
0547884591|2.0|This book is great for someone who wants to learn: how to count cards, how to shoot a basketball, how to swim better, how to tie a rope and start a fire, etc. completely unfocused, Tim should have stuck with one idea and not have inundated us with stupid asides that he already explained in 4 hour body. This book wanders, and finding the nuggets that can enhance your life and experience are like digging for gold. Tim's 4 hour work week was amazing, but these follow ups just don't hit the mark.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Kindle is still running out of battery juice within 3 hours.  The cable did nothing.  It must be the &#34;battery&#34; within the Kindle device that is the problem.  PLEASE ADVISE.<br />Thank you.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Prometheus is a good show with great effects.  I would recommend it to those who enjoyed the Alien Anthology.  As a prequel to the Alien Anthology, leaves quite a few questions in the story that hopefully get all tied together by the post-prequel episode(s).  This deal was a pretty good price for the package.
B000TVNW50|5.0|While it is an older movie, I am using it to close out The Canterbury Tales with my seniors.  They were a little skeptical at first, but after the first 30 minutes they were hooked.  They are now comparing Lancelot's characteristics to the code of chivalry from the Medieval period.
0374214913|4.0|A very fun read from beginning to end about a group of friends on a journey to solve a 500 year old code.  Thrown into the mix is the current trend of moving from the tangible real to the digital virtual in many of our human endeavors especially regarding books, art and communication.
630463949X|2.0|Video is in OLD 4X3 format but it is poor quality.  Audio is poor as well.  Bottom line on this purchase:  REGRET
B00992CF6W|5.0|I WANT IT SO BAD!!!! PLEASE MAKE IT CHEAPER BECAUSE ITS EXSPENSIVE! I HEARD GOOD REVIEWS SBOUT IT SO PLEASE PLEASE MAKE IT CHEAPER
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|A great family film :) I was able to get my whole family to watch it :) it's a must watch :D
1454701250|5.0|This is a beautiful book that teaches how to take the beauty of nature and objects and make them into stamps for creating decorative paper, fabric and other projects. It's a simple technique and it all starts with a soft rubber carving block, made from the same material as a small white eraser. After you come up with a design you would like to make with your stamp, you transfer it with a pencil and carve it out using a craft knife. The author offers helpful tips throughout, for instance, try to stamp on matte surfaces instead of glossy, for staying power.<br /><br />I bought a few small white erasers to try it out and my daughter wanted to get involved, too. We started with simple shapes, including a filigreed heart that I love using to personalize paper, envelopes and even a t-shirt. I like to use the same design motif with several different shades of the same color. In the back of the book, the author shares several pages of her own beautifully illustrated designs that readers can use in their own works. I love the endless possibilities for this fun and simple technique!
0547884591|1.0|Tim Ferriss is a snake oil salesman plain and simple.  40 5 star reviews on the first day of release?  What a crock.  Save your money, a 650 deadlift?  In what oz?  Every couple of years this guy pops up with his stupid experiments.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy they finally have it for the kindle fore it is so fun to play but sometimes they have little glithces but I love his app!!!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|great picture and color etxraordinary ill watch it over and over! thought i was buying the actual dvd not realizing i just downloaded it.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Very good animated movie! Disney has done really good with this show, has a very good story line as well!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Whenever I read Customer Reviews, I like to read the lowest ratings to see what people did not like.  It would be nice to be able to sort the reviews so it is easier to find the negatives.<br /><br />Product pictures seem to be presented better than on the website.  Overall, I like it better than browsing the website on my tablet.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|can't down load movies and they are placed where i can't find them very confusing and slow can't find movie list of features that help
B009329Y30|2.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks and have loved most of his books and the movies that follow. However, this will now be considered my least favorite of his movies. I thought that the characters lacked any \\"spark\\" or real chemistry. I wanted to like her but didn't. I have not seen any of her work previously but was not a fan of her now. This movie is also my first movie watching Zac and again. I am not a fan of him.<br /><br />  What i did take away from the story itself was how he handled his situations. He manages to handle almost all of the things thrown at him with so much dignity. It made me thinking about how i can handle things better in my life. Her ex pushes him and at times i can't believe he doesn't' punch him. But he holds his emotions in check well.  So as much as i love the story line itself. I wish they had picked stronger actors...
B009KYQNSA|5.0|Loved all the actors they all fit well good action great plot good story good performances by seasoned actors and new comers
030758836X|5.0|It was fastinating to read how two people who started out so much in love distroy each other and how we manage to deceive when we think we are in love.  Most of the book is a real page turner, hated the ending.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to Pinterest!. I check it out daily for new ideas. It is definitely at the top of my list. Check it out and you will see why everyone loves it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We really enjoy this movie.  Had to buy it since we got rid of cable and Netflix doesn't it have it.
B002APU580|5.0|Great chick flick!  Love this version.  Long the actors and can watch this over and over.  Highly recommend to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, wonderful series and even better author... I was kinda worried due to the in-tenseness of the writing and descriptions but it was entreaged
B009A9BF5G|2.0|Why music band don't learn the lesson from Rattle and Hum of U2, when we buy a rock concert dvd we want to see a show not a pseudo documentary.  This DVD is neither a good rock concert or a good documentary.  Also, the quality of the picture is awfull.  I bought at the same time Led Zeppelin Celebration Day, it's a million time better.  I was at Coldplay concert in Montreal July 27th and that DVD doesn't capture the essence of this show which was one of the top 5 show I've ever seen.  So disapointing!  Hopefully, the band will reconsider and release the full show instead.  What would be great would be a package with the 3 type of shows (stadium = Stade de France, arena = Bell Centre & small venue = la Cigale).  Coldplay announced that they will take a 3 year break, hopefully they will fufill my wish by the time of the next tour.  The only reason to buy that DVD is the audio CD, but even that it is missing some song.  Find the Emirates Stadium concert radio broadcast on the web, it's better!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, wonderful series and even better author... I was kinda worried due to the in-tenseness of the writing and descriptions but it was entreaged
B004HX4RT6|4.0|This is a nice little chess app, I really have no complaints at all. Play is satisfying if a bit predictable, but that's true of any of the computer chess games I've played. Recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, wonderful series and even better author... I was kinda worried due to the in-tenseness of the writing and descriptions but it was entreaged
B004TI5N38|4.0|I am from coal country, almost anywhere WV. My family has worked the deep and the strip mining. I have seen places and things that made no sense in those hills and hollers. This book sadly depicts a lot of what coal mining has become. Greed has made one of our best energy sources and income  something dirty and shamefull. the story was good.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Author is good. The book rocks and I couldn't put it down. Got all three books and wish it continued on.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have downloaded this app for my children and they love it! It is very kid friendly and allows for some positive fun on the tablet or cellphone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, wonderful series and even better author... I was kinda worried due to the in-tenseness of the writing and descriptions but it was entreaged
1439156816|5.0|Lots of little tidbits jam-packed into this book. Great information, insight and quite comical at times.A good read for any writer.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book, wonderful series and even better author... I was kinda worried due to the in-tenseness of the writing and descriptions but it was entreaged
B002DFOXIA|4.0|Love this cast - love the cars even more.  The dialogue is lacking, but the movie is still a lot of fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, wonderful series and even better author... I was kinda worried due to the in-tenseness of the writing and descriptions but it was entreaged
0425263916|5.0|I cant wait till May for the next book....there was a little more story with the sex...cant wait to hear more details in why<br />they are the way they are
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Definitely gave me some food for thought. Im going to have to read it again just so i can better absorb the details of his experiences.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|easy to log in, lovely to watch. my favorite show of the season. thank you for making it available. i love it.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game gets old but other them that oi like this game it is really a lot of fun I think its fun but can get boring
B007NZDES0|5.0|You can't go wrong with Sade. The concert was awesome live and just as great on DVD. The CD is a must have. Great price for both. I would recommend.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is an awesome game I love it I never got old I think if u r going to get this app u should
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park always delivers. Classic album. Must have for any collection. You don't have to be a hardcore rock fan to enjoy this album. The album came well packaged and in a timely manner. No complaints.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I learned a great deal from reading this book, and it is information that we all can apply in our decision making.
B004F1F32A|4.0|good movie, we liked it better than the second taken 2 movie.  This is a movie we will buy. thanks
B0086700CM|5.0|how in the world do you make a game his good! I luv it. I got hooked on it rite away. I showed my mom now she plays it every second! I'm good at the objectives. speaking of objectives that's wat makes the game interesting. I wish I could giv it mor stars!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This one kicks some major terrorist butt!!  Characters are so believable.....except for Brody - I think they missed the mark on that one.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a good game with nice graphic. I really enjoy it & recommend it to anyone who wants a decent Android game.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Had possibilities but missed the mark. Should have played up the camp. Some parts were very funny but others just stupid.
B009GED3HS|5.0|it doesnt matter all the charecters seamlessly flow togather  making  the mundane  even funny. personally i really think barny is the best
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Second part of a Trilogy, Follett intermingles different characters that are somohow related, either by family bonds or by sharing extraordinary life experiences. All such characters are lively and sound real; any of them could have been me. I am eagerly expecting for the third part to be published!!!!!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|the trailers and other media gave a  different impression of how the story would go and the ending seemed  weak at best
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I was hoping for more from Tim Burton, with a cast like Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. Tje uh usually do better than this. But it's an okay movie.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|...at home of course...This game is a delight so far, spinning around in an office chair! I'm freaking flying baby!&ndash;which is my default opinion unless I have anything to add later on as I play more. I just want to say to my cyber world friends that I love you. Now, let's not screw up this world! =]
B0090EHVMC|5.0|It was easy to fall in love with THE LORAX and amazingly  it kept the interest of everyone in the household !
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I decided to take a chance on Kelly Clarkson's Greatest Hits CD. I knew of some of her songs but I wasn't a big fan. I  received Kelly Clarkson's Greatest Hits Chapter One today and I have to say this is a Fantastic CD! Every song on this CD is Awesome and a lot of the songs I didn't realize she sang! If anyone is thinking of purchasing this CD, don't hesitate I think you would be very satisfied with every song on this CD.
B008J344BQ|5.0|I cant say anything about the CD because this is not my kind of music but my wife likes Pink so I guess if you like pink you will like this CD. Good luck and enjoy the CD. Amazon shipped it fast and I had it in just a fews days, I think it was under three days.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it!!! If you loved 50 shades of Grey you'll love this. No S&M in this book, but just as HOT!!
B009VB97EY|2.0|I didn't care for it because there wasn't really a story line!!! The only thing it was about was stripping not enough about the person stripping!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Like I've said before, I loved this whole series.  Books 2 and 3 much lighter on the S&M.  Such a passionate love story!!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|this game is addictive.  the only thing keeping it from being 5 star worthy is how hard the lizard is on the last battle
B0091QS88K|5.0|I can't lie I've snuck a game in or two. I think it's a great tool for kids in teaching kids hand coordination!! It's helped my 2 year old tremendously!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three books in no time. Non stop passion! Absolutely loved it!!! If the S&M turns you off, read books 2 and 3. It's such a great passionate love story, and all is revealed!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A lot like 50 shades of Grey without the S&M, but still passionately written, and is still sexually graphic, but an amazing story!!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Oh I love this one-- I love this princess-- I just love her!!! Finally a princess with a ruddy complexion and flaming red hair that problem solves and doesn't need a man to take care of her problems!  Love it.  Just love it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My grandson, 10, had seen this once and just loved it so we saw it again.  It is well-done and has just enough 'scary' scenes to keep the children on their toes and the edge of their seats.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|The game itself if what I remember playing on other devices, but it is particularly disturbing that I have had so much trouble exiting the game to go back to another stored game or to go to the home page.  Especially for this reason, I haven't played it since.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|Being an old codger, I have seen Deep Purple at their peak live in May 1972. I remember when Machine Head was originally released and wanted to check out this tribute album. I'm, happy to say that all the contributing individuals/bands on Re-Machined have recorded excellent renditions which are faithful to the original tracks. 40 years later, and there is still something powerful and magical about listening to these Deep Purple songs performed by current musicians. Fantastic.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|I loved reading this book to my daughter. I loved its message of nature's beauty, bounty, and importance, along with each individual's responsibility to do their part to maintain it. The movie, on the other hand was filled with frenetic noise, pointless activity, an emphasis on evil bad-guys instead of personal responsibility for lack of long-range planning. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I wish I could apologize personally to Dr. Seuss for watching this degrading version of his wonderful book.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I have another AmazonBasics stylus, with one size tip, that I have been using on my Kindle Fire for the past 8 months, and it has held up well and only had two issues -- both of which are addressed in this version. First issue was that I was having to dig around in my pocket for it since there was no clip, and the second issue was that it was too large to be used effectively on a smartphone. Now I can happily put my old stylus aside as a backup and use this one for all my current needs. Thanks Amazon for listening to customer feedback and creating products that are useful and affordable!
B004ZN9J0K|5.0|AWESOME CD LOVED MUSIC  GREAT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION LOVE ROGER WATERS PINK FLOYD  GREAT MUSIC GREAT ITEM TO HAVE
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I am a Ferris fan, expected to buy hardcover, but jumped  at the $4.99 ebook price.  The production was so flawed and the book so doesn't work as a kindle edition.  I have given some thought to purchasing the hardcover. I see that the hardcover gets more admiring reviews, but just don't want to throw more money at this and am skeptical.
B000002U8G|5.0|G R E A T M U S I C E N J O Y E D I T !! AWESOME
0062127241|5.0|A good read, and filled in many holes in my knowledge of The Who and Pete. A great view behind the scenes.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|Product was great, in its own original, sealed box from BBC as expected.  Batteries were old and didn't work, though (not seller's fault - it's an older toy), but it just took buying new ones to make it work perfectly.  Lots of fun playing with light and noise - Dr. Who-like - although I don't much care for the &#34;pen&#34; that's part of it.  Overall, a great toy for Dr. Who fans, and seller was great on his/her word!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am a now confessed addict of this game. I grew up playing the Oregon Trail and this game is the logical sequel to that original computer game I played first on an old Macintosh in 1990. Love this game. Time really flies by when you are in this game's world. Gameloft games are the best of their kind and this was the first-of later many-gameloft games I've purchased. None have let me down.

B006YXTRHY|4.0|The audio & video quality were great on this movie, and the convenience can't be topped!  I gave the movie 4 stars only because there were so many details in the book that weren't included in the movie, even with only 1/2 of the book being covered in Part 1.

141659521X|3.0|Vince Flynn is not so much a writer as a storytelling propagandist for the anti-terrorist industry. His invincible character, Mitch Rapp isn't particularly a sympathetic or evolving character and Flynn's writing is more interested in moving the plot relentlessly forward than working as art and it's not particularly descriptive but the stories themselves are captivating the way newspaper stories about war and espionage are. Most salami tastes the same but we enjoy eating it anyway.<br /><br />I've read all the novels he's written and enjoy the process. I do always feel like I'm being sold a conservative, paranoid agenda but hey, look! I'm continuing to buy them....<br /><br />If you like James Bond, Jason Bourne and other similar characters I'm pretty sure you'll get your adrenaline fix from Mitch Rapp too. Sometimes a good story is just what we want.
1619695006|1.0|I can think of few books that I have disliked more. It's dreary and overly long filled with characters that are dismal and remain so until the very dismal end. I'm positively miffed to have spent money on the audio version for a long drive. This book made that drive twice as long. Would not recommend.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is the funniest movie. Chevy Chase is always hilarious. This DVD seems to work fine and I am happy with this purchase.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|this is a great game classic concept new take on it with classic nods to arcade galaxy shooters like galaga 9 out of ten worth 3 dollars$
B00943SQCI|5.0|Johnny Depp shows he is more than just a HOT pirate---he's one SEXY vampire as well!!!! As long as you keep in mind this is NOT the TV serial, you will definitely enjoy this movie. It's funny, sexy, more of the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fare we have all fallen in love with. Did i mention Johnny Depp is SEXY??  LOL!!!
B003KUSUN6|5.0|I LOVE THIS DVD! I have always loved the music of the Shadows and this &#34;Final Tour&#34; DVD is great. The music is wonderful and full of memories when words were not always necessary - the music said it all. The interaction of the guys is full of fun and shows these guys haven't lost any of their talent and expertise with their instruments
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie Underwood has done it again! She is not only beautiful, but her music is absolutely a gift that she gladly shares with her fans. She is definitely my 'Idol'!!

B009JZTOG8|5.0|Fresh Ideas. Great Plot! Great Characters. Keep going.....there is endless fairy tales, so keep going and going and going and going...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have found that it is just as fun as the other versions with enough changes in bird skills as in objects to overcome!  I love the music and background of Star Wars.  Fun!
074356619X|5.0|I've benefitted from listening to this so I've purchased several for friends. It's a Cd I leave in the car and listen to when I need to turn my thoughts around to something positive.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My Niece and I loved it. Entertaining, funny, visually great and held a moral for all parties involved.<br /><br />Great family movie.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really loved reading all about what makes Tina tick. I couldn't put it down.  She writes with refreshing honesty and humor.  I recommend for any Tina Fey fan.  It is more for adults with language and some themes.
B002WJI63A|3.0|Very expensive. For the price I expected it to be perfect. It has lots of minor flaws in stitching and gluing. Not good quality control.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Hugely Addictive Game!! Hours and hours of fun.  Have to keep recharging my phone because I play it all day!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Perfect for when you're waiting, in line, at the Dr.,for a friend.  Addicting and it is perfect for the price! Great time waster.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fantastically fun browsing. Love the imagination of people! Some great recipes as well. Like that it links to my Facebook account as well.
B000TGJ80S|1.0|This movie is nothing like the book. The only thing that is similar to to the book is the character names. The similarities end there. Please do not watch this movie if you have read the book, you will be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book!  I am still trying to catch up on the sleep I lost while staying up at night to read it...Imaginative and intriguing tale of a couple who appeared to have everything going for them, told alternately in the person of the husband and the wife. Makes me want to read everything Gillian Flynn has written!
B001706I5I|5.0|Love love love this movie!!! Great for all ages! I love that I got a free gift of viewing it on amazon as well!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Still Alice is like a combination novel and textbook about a brilliant woman who is diagnosed at the height of her career with early - onset Alzheimer's.  Alice's story of her descent into this disease and how she, her work and her family are changed by it is at times both heart wrenching and heart warming. Thanks to the Harvard-trained neuroscientist author, it contains accurate and up to date information about the symptoms, treatment, and research surrounding this disease.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think it is a very good way to connect the world.<br />I prefer for everything to remain the same, but realize stock holders might view it differently.<br />I am greatful for the oppertunity to be able to connect
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Provocative and beautiful literature. A teenager's struggle with survival and his spirituality.  The descriptions of his journey are vivid and st times spell-binding. Nothing quite like it!
B006Z9K97E|4.0|A rare glimpse of non-human life in an inhumane society that reduces people to mere survivors. Horrifying must-read! (&#34;Like it&#34; as is stated here is hardly relevant)
0316174483|5.0|This is a great book for kids and adults like.  Soo much fun.  Ede emberly books are easy and fun.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|If you are a P!nk fan, then you will love this album! Classic edgy sound mixed with a new softer side. Much like life with the ebbs and flows we all have, P!nk is once again reinventing herself & her sound and giving us a glimpse into her life. The Truth About Love will make you laugh, cry, think, but mostly dance. Enjoy the ride!
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You and Reflected in You have been the best reading experience in many years... I read BTY just because it seemed like everyone was doing it (much like 50 Shades of Grey) and I couldn't miss out on the pop culture phenomenon. But I was in for a real surprise. Sylvia is a wonderful writer and the story behind this Crossfire series is profound, complex and extremely hypnotizing. I can't wait for Entwined with You!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I didn't hate it, but it also didn't make me want to read the other 2. There is no story aside from the sex.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to You and Reflected in You have been the best reading experience in many years...

B00846REIS|5.0|Really good book, not a dull moment. Its nothing like fifty shades of grey. Its much more detailed and emotional
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is one of the only work-out CDs that is worth the price. I had as a VHS tape. This is only thing that ever got me in shape.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have no complaints about Battery HD. This app works great on kindle fire hd and it is simple to use.
B0000X61VE|5.0|No work-out videos to date have topped this one. Truly one of the best. It will get you in shape.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We just bought a 3D tv this black friday and OMG, the 3D is awesome!!! Worth the wait!!! I am tahnkful that I got to buy this set for a low price. Thank you Amazon.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|As usual, pure action from start to finish.  Jeremy Renner is a great addition to the new team.  Cruise is superb.  Have your food and drink already handy before you start watching, because you won't want to leave the room.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Was good until the update. Now whenever I download a video the info doesn't appear on my status bar about how far it has downloaded, and I looked in preferences and there is no way to enable/disable this feature. And as other users are saying, there are too many porn ads.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I do not want my kindle fire to get malware or any viruses It protects me from getting a brick
B001EYGOEM|3.0|On the paper that came with the cd it said it had scratches but it didnt effect it playing the songs! Thats a lie i cant play song 3 at all and 7 skips really bad!
B002XTBEDI|3.0|Let this act as my review for both seasons one and two.<br />Don't get me wrong by the rating, Cranford is a charming miniseries with an excellent ensemble, and it's extremely humorous in more than a few instances. It's just that after hearing my mother rave about it for months, I expected something different when I finally sat down to watch it. Those interested in this series are likely to get what they're looking for, which makes it a worthwhile piece of entertainment for most, it's just not for me.
1843560267|4.0|I am a graduate student who uses Greek daily, and this is excellent for giving me concise definitions on words I could otherwise not figure out. Not as good of a dictionary as it could be, but it is abridged, so very good considering.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This has been working great! I use it every day! The whispernet is great too! It downloads books very fast!
B004H1U2HE|4.0|This tale of growing up in Israel contains wonderful descriptions and interesting historical background, but its real strong point remains the depiction of a child/adolescent mind.  Voice of the protagonist carries it forward.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Bill the Butcher has a new rival for best villian/character ever.  Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game.  Fantastic movie.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very nice look, very handy to use, and seems pretty accurate so far. No real complaints, especially for the price.
B00884GR0W|1.0|The Block Story brings fear. but Minecraft is hear! guys I play minecraft a lot! don't bye this MC PE is now on the kindlenfire! its just a few more $'ss ;)
B0087ZG7HK|4.0|I bought this for my mom as a gift, as it's one of her favorite movies. I was excited by the prospect of all the additional features it came with, but realized it only comes with a theatrical trailer after we popped it in. It's just a copy of the movie folks, no extra fun stuff. That's the reason for the 4 star review.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I got this app for my grandsons and the little one plays with this.  The older he gets though the less he plays with it so you might get this if you have young kids maybe 2 or so.
1594200823|4.0|I choose this rating because this book is very informative book that brings to attention alot of things the reader probably never knew.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I actually played this on my computer first, and so enjoyed, it I got the app for my phone.  It is really fun and I would recommend it to anyone who likes 3 in a row games.
0345803485|1.0|Go this for a co worker. I have no interest in this kind of liturature. My co worker likes this.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Oh my gosh,  I could not put this down.  There were so many levels and I love buying and picking out my gear.  It was a very entertaining game, thoroughly addicting.  I might have to play the first one and maybe even get it for my computer.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I never watched the original but my spouse was addicted back in the day.  So I watched and laughed my backside off.  He was disappointed.  He was looking for the plot turns and characters that had been developed in the soap opera.<br /><br />I had no expectations so the whole thing seemed pretty campy to me.  I especially loved the bouncing through the walls sex scene.  And the little kid was so scary as the only non-crazy member of the family.  Then there was that truly scary teenage daughter.  We all shake when we encounter that, don't we?
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This app is the traditional Mahjong card app.  When I have time to spare, I play this app for a few minutes or one game or so.  I would recommend having it on your kindle to pass time.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I don't know what I'd do without this alarm. I love the math problem thing to dismiss the alarm. It also had a timer on it too. The app comes in handy more than you may think
B008GXHOFW|4.0|its great but it stoped working on me but the graphics are great and you get to fight stuff and get stuff but most of all you can climb and swing on webs and jump high and I loved it until it stooped working
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|The movies are good and have gotten better with each one, however I like the books better because you get more details.  I find myself watching the movies saying, &#34;That's not the way it really happened&#34;
B006YXTRHY|5.0|loved the movie and the fact that I was able to watch it instantly without going out to my house to rent it
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Love the album! Pentatonix can sing practically anything and make their unique spin on some Christmas classics! Amazing! Highly recommend this for the holidays!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I loved Johnny Depp's movies, but I was disappointed about this one.  The actors and actresses are good but the plot is boring
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This download never worked for me. Once I completed the download, I was never able to play as it continued to show an error.
B0045XICB2|4.0|it was not as good as the rest of the Twilight movies, but even though the plot is not as great it is worth watching it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My granddaughter loves the Angry Bird games, She just asked me to get this one for her.  She is 7 yrs old and these games make her try to figure out how to get all of the points.  It is a great hand, eye coordination game. I play the game with her which makes grant play time for us.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|This cd is wonderful!  I didn't think she would be able to make the arrangements happen, but I was WRONG!!  Never too late is perfect, even better than the original!  I wish she would tour with the orchestra....
0316228532|5.0|I started off reading the negative reviews, because after finishing the book last night, I was left feeling sickened, sad, and angry.  So naturally, I thought I must not like this book.  With some time to mull it over, I am really starting to appreciate the truth of the story.  A peek behind the curtain is often hard to stomach, and JK Rowling nailed that feeling, and then some.  American audiences are used to a happy ending and lots of comeuppance.  You will find none of that here.  Almost all of the characters are despicable, petty, judgmental, and cruel, yet there is good reason for their behavior.  Pagford is anytown anywhere, and Rowling has deftly unmasked what lurks silently in the hearts of human beings.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|The series downloaded fast, had great quality, all the shows streamed flawessly on iPad. I definitely recommend this series to download.
B001EBWITA|5.0|One of my favorite movies...the action and storyline are top notch and I will watch it over and over again!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Too many popups and other distractions.  Cannot concentrate on game.  Deleted after five attempts to play.  Don't waste your time.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I watched it at home by myself. It's definitely a movie to go watch with a couple of girlfriend on the big screen.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I bought this as a gift.  I've seen the entire first season on ABC on Sunday night.  Thought someone else would enjoy this.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child is back to his old story telling.  Loved every minute, Could not put it down. I recommend it.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Nothing new same old same old. Kiss's new cd blew this one away only if you are a die hard fan can you even stand to listen once<br />The fall of original band are just that nothing special now too much fighting to long between cd's. This was  slammed together and hoped it would work.  Not
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i thought it was a great thing to pass time and keep u thinking at the same time. you could really get into the hard levels but you don't have to try that hard to have fun and chslenge your self
B005LAII8K|1.0|Yeah this is a mess of a movie. It sets up many rules only to drop them at the earliest convenience. It's hard not to spoil the movie and make my points. I found it the work of an auteur out of control or at least surrounded by \\"Yes\\" men. The script is atrocious and the one hit premise of chasing down your future self could have been cool, but the muddled time travel and crowded suspended of disbelief is stretched too thin, especially when we're dealing with \\"TK\\" sensitive people as well. It looks kinda nice at times, but the logic of the story and world doesn't hold together no matter how \\"cool\\" the movie thinks it is.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book, even though it is sluggish at some parts. Too many names to keep up. Still reading on the third one.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Everything I expected it to be. It was Borderline 5 Stars and may be for most people. It was a Very good movie.
B008458O3S|5.0|A lot of fun...still haven't figured out how to properly use my stars but who cares....this game is a lot of fun.  Who wouldn't want to deliberately crash a train when the outcome is positive?
B007ZVSHR0|3.0|It's what sells nowadays. I feel he has alot more talent than this album shows but, it may be his niche that is Best for his wallet.
B009E3EY38|4.0|This is the 4 disc bluray set. As you can see from the other reviews, its a great show. If you had one of the bootlegs from years ago as I did , this is miles ahead.<br />The fourth \\"bonus\\" disc is mostly a throw away. Its rehearsal footage shot from one static camera and some promo stuff that you have seen elsewhere. So don't let that be a dealbreaker for you if you can't decide which set to get.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Though a big fan of speak now, I don't always pay for good quality of her album. But this one is really economic!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|The news changes continuously for all the categories that I am interested in.  But I don't like this requirement of this review.  I can't just give it stars, I have to write a certain amount of words to submit this review.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I like this because it provides a realistic opponent such as one you would find socially.  So you don't start off by playing at a Grand Master level.  You can improve the strength if you want.  Much more like asking another person (i.e, human) to play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You Version is a great Bible resource.  It's very easy to compare over a dozen English translations.  It has a good search tool that's also easy to use.  I use it on my iPhone weekly for Bible study and now have it on my Kindle Fire. Lynn Elam
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follet never ceases to deliver. Well developed characters with unbelievable insights into the the people involved in World War II.Impossible to read and not make comparisons to the current world situation.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I thought this book was pretty interesting - I could NEVER have done what Ms. Strayed did.  She was naive in taking on her goal and was very lucky that she survived.  I did like this book a lot more than Eat, Pray, Love - similar in that both authors were trying to find themselves.  Ms. Gilbert was self-indulgent and insipid, vs. Ms Strayed's I-can-do-anything attitude. I totally disliked Oprah's comments that were added to the digital edition.  They didn't provide any insight at all.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Missed it in the theaters.FInally got time to watch it..Brilliant acting, wonderful story..Feel good movie of the highest order. Rent it now!
B0095R64AO|1.0|Oh yeah, Judd Apatow is associated with it.  This movie is awful.  Don't waste your time, or anyone else's.  No good.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This series was just amazing. I went into it unsure of what to expect but after being told to watch it by so many people I decided to buy it. This is one my new favorite shows.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great action, decent drama.  Loved the humor that was slipped in here and there.  Can't wait for the next one in the series!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great Game. Makes you think. Wakes up brain.  My Daughter started playing this form the time it was installed on her Kindle Fire.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|Planet Pit I would say is one of the best CDs ever produced by any artist. All the songs are good. I am a huge Pitbull fan now.
B000002MZ9|5.0|Awesome sampling.. no one crunches behind Neil like Crazy Horse, but PJ is one of the few bands around up to the task. Neil tries to lead them on extended crunch riffs that PJ just cannot quite sustain like the Horse.  Still, If you are a fan of the other lesser known works of both artists, it's something you will be happy that you own
B0049VVE7Y|4.0|Started off slow in season 1 but picked up in 2nd season. Give it a try. You'll get hooked right away.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|So fun and so addictive, this is one of the best apps I have had, great graphics, amazing sound effects and very addictive gameplay
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I am hooked on Walking Dead after watching season 2. It's really good and worth watching. Can't wait to start watching season 3 and see what happens.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good read. Time well spent. Keeps you wanting to know more. Haven't finished yet but so far excellent read. Interesting.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Easy to read - insight into the life of a man scarred from a childhood in an orphanage and an adult unmarried woman tied to her mother.  How their lives intertwine is intriguing and kept me interested until the very end.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|I tried to watch it, I really did! No actor-wanna-be-director has ever directed such a slow paced western since Billy Bob with \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" A cup of strong coffee might have helped matters! What I found silly and irritating was the slowwwww and dummmmb drawl of the main male characters, as if cowboy types are stoo-pid. I live in cattle country and yes, cowboys can actually speak normal English and have a brain. I kept looking for the Appaloosa, couldn't stay with the movie long enough to see one horse. When I saw Rene Zellweger was in it, that really killed it for me. Don't know how she even became an actress, always looks as if she has a mouth full of marbles and her face is always shiny like it's smeared with grease. Now she's going to show up in Brigette Jones 3-Looking for Love At The Rest Home?<br /><br />The plot is as tired as they come pretty much knock-offs of Open Range, Silvarado, The Postman, Water World (not westerns, but same hack plot!)If actors are going to do westerns please give us an original action flick like Dances With Wolves? What a waste of time and money this was!
B004UQPM4E|5.0|The Superman movies (Reeve) were always a childhood delight, even if the third one is too comedic, and if the fourth one is too much of an attempt to re-make Superman II, and if all of them are dated (the charming saccharine stuff about truth and justice... Ah, for the innocence of those days...).<br /><br />Donner's vision for the Superman films (1 & 2) were ahead of their time.  Filmmakers did not want to try putting superheroes onto the big screen, out of reasons of credibility.  Yet Donner took the risk, and made a fantastic first outing.<br /><br />He did shoot the first two movies back-to-back.  Unfortunately, he was fired, and Superman II was partly re-shot.  You can find details all over the internet, and while I overall prefer Donner's vision,  some of Richard Lester's alterations were not bad.  (Do note, the special edition of II is a \\"what if\\", based on existing footage and screen tests.  It's not HOW his vision would have fully been, especially as the Paris scenes and spinning around the world to prevent time travel would have been eliminated and used elsewhere respectively.<br /><br />III is Lester's vision, which is a little too campy at times, but still has some substance.  In particular is Ross Webster (in what was originally meant for Lex Luthor) wanting to make kryptonite.  In the comics, the red kryptonite is what makes Superman go berzerk, whereas in S-III the kryptonite is still green (a pity it wasn't red, since Superman looked decidedly suspicious at the green crystal).  III is a mixed bag but is somewhat enjoyable overall...<br /><br />IV feels like a bad remake of S-II, which is unfortunate as it was great to have the full and proper cast back.  (With Donner's firing, some of the cast left the franchise or had scenes cut down, but they were persuaded back for IV.)  Unfortunately, the mojo just isn't there, and Lex's kid looks is the personification of 1980s fashion (best left unseen unless you're wearing dark sunglasses and coated in SPF-500,000 sunblock...)<br /><br />Pity 'Supergirl\\" wasn't included...<br /><br />But we've all seen the movies and have varying opinions and I can't hate IV, either.<br /><br />I could spend a day tackling the extras, which pretty much define \\"definitive\\".<br /><br />My package came with Superman II and the Donner Cut both slightly popped out of their packaging, but not enough to be bopping around the case to get scratched, and Blu-Ray discs have a coating to prevent scratching.<br /><br />The set I bought has the 3D logo emblazoned on the front and seems to be a US release, based on verbiage on the box.  Some have received import sets, but there is no difference - apart from the box design (that I know of).  For the <$60 I paid, I don't care that much.<br /><br />The sound quality is top-notch, especially given the limitations of the source material used for recording.  As always, John Williams (amongst the others who scored the movies) always set the bar for movie soundtracks high and it's a delight to listen to.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray quality are sharp, as you would expect.  Details are fine, compression artifacting is minimal, blacks and grayscale contrasts (shadow detail) are very nice, and grain is remarkably limited.  Some grain is good, as too much noise/grain removal strips detail, but for this set they got the balance perfectly.  You will see more grain in multi-layered edited scenes (e.g. blue screen with Kypton in the background in the opening of Superman II).  But compared to other recent releases (which still get high marks for quality control), the level of grain reduction is handled extremely well, especially in live action scenes requiring little post-production layering.<br /><br />Some scenes do have negative scratches on display - this form of cleanup was well-handled overall, but some got through the restoration process.<br /><br />And some digital enhancing was used to remove wires... It's nice to see some of this type of editing was put into place,meant to keep true to the original production but to remove gaffes.  They didn't add CGI fluff in the background just for pointless theatrics.<br /><br />But, especially for III and IV Superman's costume, Clark's denim jeans, and planet Earth were remastered in a teal color rather than the original blue.  This is distracting.  Some of this might be due to the source material and editing means available in the 1980s, of course.  But as some websites pointed out, his outfit had been the proper blue in earlier releases but a deep gorgeous teal for the Blu-Ray release.  So far, it's noticeable but not disconcerting, but if they removed wires from Superman, it would have been cool if they remastered all scenes to show as much uniformity between film elements as possible.<br /><br />UPDATE EDIT:  I was wrong; Superman II is also afflicted by \\"the Man of Teal\\".  Color accuracy is incorrect with blues, but the sharpness of the imagery just about makes up for it, IMHO.  I wish the mistake hadn't been made, since I don't think this hue adjustment was deliberately made. Especially as some scenes don't show the change as overtly as others.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid set - if you can handle the occasional blue->teal color shift in Superman's outfit, Clark's denim jeans, and Earth in some of these films, then it's a no-brainer.  The overall restoration work, and slew of extras, IMHO, makes this set well-worthwhile despite the technical gaffe.
B009MF56GC|5.0|LIKED THE MOVIE. NICE TO SEE THE MAJOR ACTION STARS OF MY ERA ALL TOGETHER IN ONE MOVIE.GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES AND GOOD STORY LINE.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|This movie was below par for the Sherlock series. Maybe it's because I was in the middle of the Sherlock Holmes modern TV show from BBC. Not nearly as witty. Much more slapstick style comedy.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|IT'S THE MATRIX.WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY. DVD WAS COOL, BUT SEEING IT ON BLUE-RAY IS MUCH BETTER. FREE YOUR MIND.
B005JR47R6|5.0|They changed things up quite a bit, but for the better. I darn near pooped myself at the ending! Please watch.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a great little game for those who like empire building strategy games and the medieval genre.  It would be an epic 5 star game I would pay as much as $5.00 as an app download IF:  1) it has full 360 degree view of kingdom 2) gets rid of the ridiculous \\"diamond\\" currency that you have to pay for or suffer a much longer and monotonous path to achieving certain milestones and makes acquisition of certain building structures almost impossible.  3)  has a better unit improvement method (or simply do away with diamond currency).  4) better \\"diplomacy\\" interface and quests.<br /><br />I play this game more often than any other on my kindle as I find it relaxing and enjoyable, but I would love to see the improvements appear in a new version of the game, or I'll play this one until I find another that has these features.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is fun and adictive.  My grandaughter put it on my Fire.  I like a quick minute of i play or several minutes of play.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|More of the same from the same.  Great action adventure.  4 stars because one character we love to watch departs early. Watch the chair at the end.
1582701709|5.0|Like most people, we've heard about The Secret at least once or twice, and along the way we'd roll our eyes or completely turn the other cheek away from it after we deem it as nonsense. I've first heard of The Law of Attraction back in 2009 when I was going through a heartbreaking breakup with a serious boyfriend, and people on the online forum that I was on was talking on and on about the Law of Attraction and how it attracted their exes back. I thought nothing of it and continued my path of depression and heart brokenness. Fast forward about three years later, and for some reason, I started to get into this LOA stuff and couldn't wait to study more about it. One day, as I was hanging out with a girlfriend as we were shopping, I realized we were near a book store. For some strange reason, I felt compelled to go in and find a book on LOA. They had the LAST copy of it and I had to buy it right there and then. I have to say, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my entire life.<br /><br />I go home and read it. It took me several days to finish it (One chapter a day), but I was so intrigued by what was written in it. It features many inspiring examples about how it worked for the other people who believes in the law of attraction, and what YOU can do to manifest exactly what you want! I find myself rereading it over and over to absorb everything when the first time doesn't click into me.<br /><br />In The Secret, I've learned the three simple rules for manifestation. The first rule: Ask. This is the easiest and most fun way in this book. What you want to do is gather a piece of paper and a pen, and write, \\"I am so happy and grateful now that...\\" and then you fill in your wish in present tense. For example, \\"I am so happy and grateful now that I have a pair of beautiful designer glasses! It makes me look cute and sassy!\\" And guess what? I now own a pair of the most beautiful designer shades. The original price was $30, but... I got it for almost free! It looks EXACTLY how I wanted it, with some new designs thrown in since LOA is very fanciful like that. That's another great lesson... Sometimes, we may ask for something specific, but The Universe gives us either exactly what we want or something even BETTER than what we originally asked for! Because of this book, I've also manifested a second job and more money.<br /><br />The second rule... Believe. Believe that it's already yours. This is the hardest lesson to learn, but once you harness the power of believing, you'll go far in life. You MUST believe that the job is yours, that the money is yours, that your ex-lover is yours (doesn't matter if you two haven't talked in a long time... they're YOURS! BELIEVE!) and then you have to let this wish go. Stop worrying about it and live your life with full confidence that it's yours and on it's way. Think of it as ordering at a restaurant: You've asked the waitress what you want and you're fully confident that the food is on it's way to you. You have to treat life the same way!<br /><br />The third rule... Receive. Once you receive it, be thankful for it. Enjoy it. Thank The Universe for this present. \\"Thank you SO MUCH for this (fill in the blank)!\\"<br /><br />I'm ready to manifest even bigger things, like a soulmate and the opportunity to see other countries. I already believe that these things are going to happen, because thanks to this book, anything is possible and nothing is EVER impossible! If you want to change your life for the better, forget all those other self-help books and get this one instead. The year 2013 is nearby, and for your new year's eve resolution, instead of complaining and moaning about not losing enough weight or not having enough money or the fact that your ex-lover is ignoring you... why not give this book a fair chance and see what it can do for you? Hey, I've already manifested things. My second job seemed to have fallen from the clear blue friggin skies so I know this book is legit. :)<br /><br />Give it a try. You might be pleasantly surprised! Happy manifestations, everyone!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It was absolutely amazing. It is a geek‘s  heaven. If you like video games, pop culture, and awesome things, then you will have your mind blown by this book.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|We watched them all through the Sing Off and ever since we just can't get enough of them.  They make music so much fun to listen and sing to.  It is a pleasure to see 100% real talent and to watch as it changes the music world.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|It's kind of a quirky movie with a great cast.  Definitely strays from the mainstream formula movies, but is entertaining and worth seeing.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I use this app every time I set up a client's network to avoid channel conflicts and measure uniformity of signal at the site.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|This is a great movie!  It's really creepy and the little girl does such an amazing acting job!  If you get spooked easily, it's probably not for you.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game because it is just adventury and awesome.... I have this game on my kindle and my I phone it is awesome to play in the car and when you are bored
0425263908|4.0|Not quite as good as Fifty Shades, but still really good.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the Crossfire Novels.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this book for my son. His dog Lucky enjoys swimming. Turns out Underwater Dogs was a big hit with his friends and makes a great coffee table book.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|it turns the camera on. you can take pictures. there's no delete or place to get rid of your pictures.  it's pretty lame.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie takes a while to get going and eventually works its way up to make it mildly entertaining. I'm not sure that I would rent it again, but it was worth $1.99.
0307346617|5.0|I bought this a few years ago and still read it every year in October. The layout really makes this an easy read. There are people I know who aren't even readers that enjoy this novel (they also of course have an appetite for a good zombie story).<br /><br />What I enjoy about this novel is all the little things I personally never would have thought of when it comes to a zombie apocalypse. So many details are covered in a complex, grand scheme. You obviously have the military side, the politics and the civilians... But then they go into other aspects like quislings and ferals, it is such a plausible scenario that I take my hat off to the brilliant writing behind that.<br /><br />I could go on about this book but I will save you the time, if you like a good zombie story read this. Don't get over-hyped by all the good reviews and just go in knowing that it goes beyond fighting actual zombies and gore. It's worth looking into.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I rented this movie out of curiosity and because of the fairly high ratings.  It was worth the $1.99 I spent to rent it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app. I have it on my kindle fire, ipod, and laptop. I love being able to see my notes wherever I go.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Thought the movie was especially cute. Went out and purchased the dvd after watching it here. My 4 year old adores this movie!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this series. Normally we record it but missed the first two this season. Definitely worth the cost.  You have to see episode 1 to understand the rest of season 2.
B003MC5N28|5.0|These books really drew me into the stories rapidly.  I liked the way they interconnected in the fourth book.  Good stories for readers of all ages.
B00628SJJS|5.0|I read this book as my monthly book club read in November and wasn't to sure if I would like it.  Reading has been a favorite of mine since elementary school and I am very particular about my selections.  This was a fast read and, much to my surprise, one that I found most enjoyable.  The ending wasn't quite what I expected, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and I'd recommend it without hesitation.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Bad Piggies proves to be a daunting challenge.  It isn't the usual &#34;pull back and let 'er rip&#34; like the Angry Birds games.  A wee bit too much thinking and planning for me...
1574214276|5.0|Informative, easy to understand, and a must for any Zentangle lover out there!  Zentangle is relaxing and really &#34;takes me to another place&#34; when I'm doing it.  Check it out.....both book and &#34;tangling&#34;.
0486282112|5.0|I love the Dover Thrift editions for any book!! This was no exception. Great value, great book in print. THe pages, like all Dover books, are thin and of poor quality- kind of like the SAT books,  but you get what you pay for, and all you want is the actual text itself anyway.
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|I like the price, my son loves trains, but my husband and I did not enjoy it with him, seemed a little unusual
B001IAME78|4.0|This is a really fun movie. It brings a different take on the whole accident and such. I like that they  made the Hulk more then just a mindless blob of anger. They added a bit of dimension to him. This was just a fun movie to watch.
B00851M38S|3.0|I love the two previous books. They each kept me reading well into the night, and I eagerly anticipated this continuation of the story. Yes, it ties up some loose ends, and yes, he's one of the best writers out there, but where the other books surprised and held my attention this one starts to build tension and then fizzles out.<br />Even his usually hypnotic, illuminating descriptions at times seem muted and pedestrian. Unfortunately, he set the bar too high with his previous work and this one just doesn't get there.<br />Having said that, I will buy his next book (whenever that may be), based on the quality of his first books.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love this new album. everything about it, cant say enough good things about it. If you are a Marroon 5 fan, then you will love this too.
B006LSZECO|1.0|So disappointed.  Heard how great this novel is and it didn't even capture me like most books in the free sample.  Was bored to tears and came back to check that I had sampled the correct book!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|to fully understand what is being done to you by the powers that were... there is an evil more sinister that you can imagine that manipulates the money supply and therefore the economy. Watch it and then share it....turn off your TV.....wake up from your slumber and apathy America!!!!
B00A14SQBU|5.0|Each song is pretty great, but my faves have to be Army Of Me, Cease Fire, and Around The World, but each song is very pop driven and what I expected
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Awesome special effects, mind-bending theories, and a innovative cast, all carried this movie foward into the genre.  The cheesy captain role enforced racial stereotypes that detracted from the film.  Altogether a thoughtful film.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Its real hard for us to all enjoy a movie together.  Son who is 10, daughter 12 and daughter 19.  To find a movie that they, and my wife and I also want to watch, let alone like, is hard to do.  The avengers movie was a great choice.  Action packed, funny, &#34;family friendly&#34; and a good movie.  Special effects in HD are awesome and sometimes seemed real.  Robert Downey Jr. stole the show for my kids with his sarcastic humor.  A great movie night.  Only reason for 4 stars, not 5, is that the movie is a bit long.  I think it was 2 hours 22 minutes.
B00866JL96|5.0|purchased movie for my granddaughter... she loves the movie. we will watch it together after christmas....<br />she loves zac and his movies...
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is such a fun game for my 7 yr old!!  She loves it so much!!<br />She cracks me up yelling at the screen!!!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I have listened to this mostly as a background music, and not as attentively as I'd like yet. But I found the songs powerful enough to interrupt my thoughts, and find my heart enraptured by the sounds. Finding my heart in a vulnerable place, these songs meet me there.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Simple, clean, easy to use and understand, works quickly.  Found old files that used to belong to uninstalled apps.  Kindle runs much faster!
B007HIEBV2|5.0|High energy swing and electronica make a great pair in this band. Makes you feel good!<br />If thinking about getting it- I say go for it! You won't be disappointed.
B004MPESSY|5.0|This movie gets 5 stars across the board for me. You wont be dissapointed but hey ,check out for yourself and thank me later!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Raw, powerful and sexy.  Exactly what I would expect from Phillip.  Really great no matter what mood you are in.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I got this to help improve my memory, which it has but the added bonus is that its a lot of fun.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have never read a Vince Flynn book that wasn't the very best. Hopefully he will have more in the future.
B00A77II0U|5.0|great game. graphics are impressive and the doll in  the storyline are really creepy. i hope it becomes a series
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|I don't know if this was supposed to be some Greese type musical, but if fell horribly short. Not recommended.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I've relied on this app for my daily weather report for months, but all of a sudden it stopped working. It seems to have some bug in connecting to the Internet for updates. If this isn't fixed soon, this is unacceptable as a paid app.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|So despite the last book leaving you a bit bored and less eager to go on, this one helps shape things up again!<br /><br />The story gets fired up, and you get a nice cocktail of characters as well, like before. You feel like you're home again, sort of.<br /><br />It's a bit long, but what I really didn't like about this one is the chapter titles. I always thought the power behind this series was how the story was told from the point of views of different characters. In this book, the titles don't state names, instead weird titles and descriptions that leave you confused till you get a hint of who or where this is. I found myself missing some details that I had to reread once it was clear where this chapter was taking place. It really becomes very annoying!<br /><br />Still one of the greatest series I ever read... The next ones cant come soon enough!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|These books are great for keeping yourself and your kids amused .  I bought them and share them with the kids in my life after I'm done reading them.  They are that well written.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This episode was so rad.. Def recommend it and the whole show for that matter. Easy to get hooked on this series!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Excellent.  I've watched this series numerous times through netflix: one at a time and decided I'd own it..I can't expect that anyone purchasing this, would be disappointed.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is a classic that my 2 year old loves it and practicality watches it eveyday. It was a reasonable price
B008GANNIC|5.0|I have been listening to POD since the BROWN days and love the band. Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the last album (when angels and serpents dance) and I bought it more to support the guys. I was hesitant on buying this album based on that experience, but this CD is AWESOME! In this album POD goes back to their raw sound mixing so well some great riffs with great vocals, some tough parts, reggae,etc... I really think &#34;the boys are back!&#34;
B002QE3CTY|3.0|It was an OK book.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but the end rushed a bit and it didn't resolve all my feelings.  I'd suggest you check it out from your local library because it honestly wasn't something I would keep forever.<br /><br />Good plot, okay carrying out, and an ending that makes you upset because it happens so quickly.<br /><br />But, for certain, read it!<br /><br />I just don't think its 5 star worthy.
0316069884|5.0|This book tells a story while giving you factual information about eating and farming meat. It is interesting, engaging and thoughtful. It can get a bit emotional at times but the book does touch on some heavy issues. It's one of my favourite books and has changed the way I look at making decisions.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love using this app on my iPhone to read books and I use it daily. I can read at work, in bed, while waiting at a doctor's appointment, in line at the grocery store and on and on.  This app is quick to install and you can customize  the size of the font, the color of the text and background including white on black and sepia, and I love the new font choices.<br />This app brings up your list of Kindle books to choose from and download quickly when you make a selection. It syncs from the computer Cloud drive, your phone or your tablet to bring you to your furthest reading point in your book.<br />If you shut your phone off it automatically bookmarks the last page you were reading.<br />There are plenty of free books available on Kindle too which I love since nothing beats free.
1449410243|5.0|My friend received this book and while I've never read it he says he and his wife love it. The oatmeal, overall, is great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I ABSOLUTLY LOVED IT! But alas. All true loves come to a horrible end. One day I was playing Minecraft when my Kindle Fire died. I plugged it in and started playing (while my Kindle Fire was still plugged in). When I opened up my world ALL the blocks that I placed down were gone. In fact the world was back to the same way it generated when I first made it. The only proof I had that I ever worked on it was 2 swords in my hand.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The Bone Bed by Patrcia Cornwell positively lives up to the suspence and page turning quality of all of her previous novels.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|if you don't know how to play chess, then you don't know didley.  and you should get to know didley.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|I don't know if this is the right ratio but it does look good. On broadcast television it seems a little less zoomed in than on this disc. Also, no commentary which stinks because the UK version of the SE had that and a documentary. The studio needs to put up more cash for a proper SE Blu Ray. But this is a good start.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I read this per a recommendation. It was well written, but didn't Even get into the Osama killing until 50% of the way into the book. Also, the title is misleading. Without spoiling the book, let's just say that the day they got Osama didn't seem any harder than any other day/mission in the middle east (per the author's comments). A quick read, I like the author, it's not his fault the finding of UBL wasn't more exciting.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I've used this app on my Kindle Fire and my Android enabled smartphone for a little over a year.  For the first six months, it did great and would always update and give me an accurate forecast and let me know what was going on; over the last several months, the app has a hard time connecting or gives me a message the weather service / forecast is not available for my area and to try again; it does, however, work when I travel around the USA from big cities to areas out in the country.<br /><br />Seeing as how I live in Houston, I find that rather hard to believe the Weather Channel doesn't have a forecast for me.  If this happened intermittently, I would be a little more patient.  A better bet has been the [[ASIN:B005K17RU0 AccuWeather for Android]] app, which has now replaced the Weather Channel App.
B008MM9630|4.0|Great farming game with a twist.<br />Must play for those that like farming games and or Faerie folk. interesting for all ages.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've used this app on my Kindle Fire and my Android enabled smartphone for about three months now, and it is great - always up-to-date, good radar coverage, and this really displays nice and crisp on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Traveling with the app is convenient, as you are quickly able to determine your location with the app (and switch back to see what the weather is at home) and get the local forecast.  They make it easy, and best of all the app is free.  I would highly recommend this app for all Android-enabled devices as part of the standard core load!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I bought the game and doesn't work. I would love to enjoy this game and I'm sure I'd give it a 5, but 8 I'm unable to play it.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This was a well thought out movie that keeps both Adults and kids alike interested right to the very end.<br />This is a must see family film.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome<br /> I think you should make a second temple run that would be even cooler. I love the game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I remember watching this on TV as a kid, back then it was a once a year 4 hour movie plus commercials. Every year they have editted it down to a 2 hour show. I just started reading this book and so far it has exceeded expectations. I love that there is a kindle version so I can read on the plane !
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I love all of three days Grace's albums on this just adds on to the collection of awesomeness! I recommend anyone that likes three days Grace's albums by this
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got mine frond 4shared but it is a awesome app and shut up about being nothing like Pc its for android and its still in the making oh and I need to say.................GET ENDERMAN IN IT
0446547654|5.0|I so enjoy all of Mr. Sparks books.  I did have every one that he has written, but I then donated them to a school library.  They are books that are accceptable and loved by the students.  Thank you, Mr. Sparks.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Love this flick. Have seen a few x's & love it every time. Great acting, great story, some of the best fighting on film & I'm a huge Tom Hardy fan & have been for quite some time. This is a must see. Totally engrossing, very entertaining & quite touching also. See it! Its a  must own movie!
0385535147|5.0|I have not read The Racketeer yet; I did just get it.  Anyway, I have enjoyed every one of Mr. Grisham's books so far.  I would certainly recomment his books to anyone interested in legal mystery.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter really loves this game.  She says it is an adventure. She also thinks that it is one of the best apps on my kindle.
B0079J26TI|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this 2 disc set to any one looking for a definitive Schumann 4th or Hebrides Overture. The remastered sound is significantly better than my old late 80's CD copies of Schumann.  I am referring to the SACD layer of these recordings but I would not be surprised if the CD layer is almost as good. Regarding performance, each is at or near the top of the pile as far as I'm concerned.  For me, the only rivals to the Klemperer Schumann fourth and Hebrides overtures on this CD are those conducted by Herbert von Karajan with the Staatskapelle Dresden (Schumann 4th) at the Salzburg Festival in 1972 on a DG cd (which I fear is now out of print) and HvK conducting the Hebrides overture with the Berlin Phil. in the early 70's. The sheer intensity of the live Karajan/Staatskapelle wins by just a whisker in the Schumann 4th but Klemperer/Philharmonia have the edge in the Hebrides. Klemperer's Italian has also placed itself alongside Munch and the Boston Symphony as one of my favorites. This is rock solid conducting. While his tempos in the Italian may be a little slower than some others, they are not as slow as the ones ones he favored in his sunset years.  Here the performance still has a driven, bracing quality that I find refreshing. If you have SACD playing capability (even if you don't) snatch these up and hopefully EMI will be encouraged to continue releasing newly remastered classic analog performances on hybrid SACD.
B009X01C64|5.0|This cover holds Kindle Fire very secure and protects well.  Three different angles for landscape-stand Kindle positions, providing excellent viewing angles.  Does not interfere with fingers' movements, unlike my prior Kindle cover.<br /><br />This leather is smooth and soft, but I'm not a fan of leather.  My prior Marware imitation leather cover felt almost as good, and may have an advantage in tolerating slightly wet conditions.  So, given the lower price of imitation leather, I'd go for that.  However, if you're a leather fan, this product is outstanding.<br /><br />The cover holds Kindle so tight that takes some time to remove.  Insert such that the USB insert is accessible--on Marware's side with the empty space in the middle (this isn't explained in the instructions).
0525952926|3.0|This book was obviously a huge and ambitious project. The history was amazing and personal. however,  the major extermination of 6 million Jews was not even mentioned! How can you write a book that covers WWII so extensively  without covering that aspect of it! Characters were well connected but it took about 500 to really get into the plot.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I always worry about my favorite on American Idol that I won't like the music they put out after the show, which is often the case.  Phillip has been consistent with his style, which I like alot, during and after the show.  I like the arrangements of the songs, the melodies, the lyrics, and of course his voice.  I can't help but compare his style to Dave Matthews Band, who I also am a fan of, but their styles are similar.  I think this a great first album.
B00004U8P9|1.0|This DVD did not work at all in the first player I tried (neither discs); I tried in another player, and it appeared at first glance to be working there OK. I tried to watch  it the net day and it skipped,stalled,lost the sound...it was a total waste of time. The greatest disappointment however, was that I purchased this to watch with friends I knew were coming the Thanksgiving holiday to enjoy it also. It ruined the whole day, as they are leaving tomorrow.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have used this a lot recently and it works great. It doesn't have all the features of the native site,  but it works very well
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I VIEWED THE DRAGON TATTOO IN THE DUBBED ENGLISH SWEDISH RELEASE.  I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE FULL MESSAGE OF THE FILM UNTIL I SAW THE NEXT TWO.  THE FULL STORY , TO BE FULLY ENJOYED, WAS FULLY EXPLAINED IN IN FIRE AND HORNET'S NEST.  HORNET'S NEST GIVES HER THE PEACE THAT SHE DESERVED.  THE DUBBED RELEASES ARE THE BEST I HAVE SEEN OF ANY MOVIE.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It is good but only 2 worlds!?! I completed the worlds in a good week but then when I am going to play the extra levals i unlocked i find a nother world for the price of the game! Tip: I heard you can get the path of the jedi free by getting 3 stars in every leval in tatoonie and the death star. another tip: In path of the jedi at the end you unlock a ultra green lightsaber for luke that  cut through every thing and is bigger. Also they should make a yoda and ghost birds! hoped this helped.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|There were a few plot points that bugged me (can't be more specific without spoilers) but I generally enjoyed the story and main character. Someone more religious might get more out of the spiritual aspects of this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is epic!!!! minecraft pocket edition could use some work on graghics because on my ipod it gets pitch black all the time but on my kindle it never does. Also I got a update for it and i dis not get the new items in tell like 2 weeks later. Overall get it. I also think u sould get thiscover story block. there forth 5 stars.
B00006L6YG|5.0|I am not familiar with Stan Getz or the bosa nova, but I do know beautiful music and amazing sound quality and this SACD has both.<br /><br />I bought this online - it was delivered 3 days ago. I put off listening to it because I've been disappointed many times in the past.<br />But this SACD is flawless - even though it's 50 years old it sounds brand new.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B009CG2YDE|1.0|this game sucks don't get it its a waste of time don't. seriously DONT its like an old game and it SUCKS
B000U7XUKK|4.0|So many tunes hit the internal chord of what it's like being a kid. Great variation in the tone and style of music between the tracks.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that this game ia good. It never does anything bad but it sometimes it gets a little borring. the game is good and you should always look at the review before the game.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Although I am left with feeling the writing is underdeveloped, the journey the author take the reader on is worth the time investment. And it is an investment with the heft of this book.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I've been a  Sci Fi fan for a loooong time, and this had to be the biggest bunch of cretins ever packed into a space ship. The actions of the supposedly bright individuals was laughable and stupid. I don't like monster movies, and this was a thinly disguised horror film, not even mediocre Science Fiction. I've liked most of Ridley Scott's films recently, but this one gives me pause to reconsider. I gave it a generous \\"one star\\" only because there isn't a \\"no stars\\" option.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Just was not thrilled, but I was bored so I guess I did get to pass some time away.  This movie was just okay (eh) to me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I never knew that this game could get my mom and I so hooked! I've spent at least an hour sucked to my kindle, not being able to go away. My brother, mom, dad, and I all love it! It's  a must get.<br />:-)
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|all star cast, all around waste of time.  bad acting, lousy plot, action was marginal.  suprised to 'notice' the green screen in this day of technology.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the game isgood but I keep being booted when I try to plant cabbage I am stuck because it wont let me complete tasks
B009CG2YDE|4.0|The controls aren't very obvious unless you look at the tutorial, which for a game this simplistic shouldn't be necessary. Aside from that, it's Space Invaders with far more awesome characters.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I'm not a huge pop fan. For that reason alone, I don't tend to get caught up in the Idol hype that's tends to be reinforce by tweens and teens. That's why Phillip Phillips stands above that chaos.  I don't know how well he is managing his own destiny in the industry, but this album at least has the look and feel of something &#34;he&#34; intended it to be.  So here's to the very first &#34;Idol Album&#34; I have purchased.  Well done Mr. Phillips.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple Run was entertaining for the first few times I played it. There are objectives, so it keeps the game fresh even though it's the same scenery over and over. However, it wasn't enough to hold my interest. Good thing it's free.
B00881VLCE|4.0|if you enjoy puzzles, you will love this application. its easy to use but can be difficult. enjoy the pictures too.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is well worth the $0.99 I paid to play Ski Safari! I first played it on my mother's iPad and I was bummed to see that it wasn't available for the Kindle. When I saw it was available for my Kindle, I got it and was pleased with the performance and quality of the game. The objectives change each time you fulfill one, there is a scoreboard to amp up your competitive side, and coins that you can collect to get cool additions to the game with no additional cost out of your own pocket. The sound effects are catchy, funny, and fitting. Addictive. Must buy!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Such a wonderful premise and storyline.  The characters and plot are so well executed and intriguing.  I did not want it to end.  This is the type of book that leaves you with a bit of sadness in the desire and wish to be able to go back and read it for the first time all over again.  If you grew up in the eighties as a gamer and sci-fi fan like I did then you must read this book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I like this book because the story is an unusual twist on the old doomsday scenero.  Easy reading and surprising twists.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford does not disappoint in this second album.  It is just so good from start to finish.  It is very hard to pick a favorite track, because they’re all so poignant and special.  I’ve seen them in person twice at writing this and will take every opportunity to see them in the future, and look forward to more and more from them in the years to come.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|My wife and I love every aspect of this concert.  Enjoy having the audio cd as well - should be an option with all concert dvds.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|There Comes a Time<br /><br />There comes a time in life when you read, feel, or hear something and words<br />Cannot not describe the emotions, thoughts or actions it brings out of you.<br />There comes a time in life when you feel inspired to do something that it is you've never done before,<br />Experience things you never thought you could do.<br />There comes a time in your life when against all odds you know there is a light at the end of the tunnel,<br />And that you will make it out okay.<br />Breathing, living, crying, screaming, yelling, smiling.<br />There comes a time in life when you know that no matter what happens, you can still look back,<br />And say you gave it your all.<br />In today's world, it seems like nothing will turn around for the better as we sit and wait and become bitter.<br />In life you find things that are astounding. In every way imaginable and every way you can see.<br />Things that are life changing in the best way possible. Things that you can only describe with the most vivid of words and actions.<br />There comes a time in life when you say no matter what, at the end of the day I gave it my all.<br />Knowing that there is peace within you and with all that surrounds you.<br />There comes a time in life when you smile because you know, at that time life is everything you<br />wanted it to be but never thought that it could.<br />Shouting from the rooftops the joy that you have inside and wanting to share it with the world.<br />There comes a time in life when all is at it should be and you turn around, look at yourself and know that this is what you were meant for.....MLD<br /><br />...And that time came for me throughout the entirety of this book. I cannot remember the last time I was so touched, so inspired, so intrigued, so consumed with a book as I was with Slammed. The slam poetry was utterly brilliant and the story to go along with it was damn near perfection.<br /><br />Layken (aka Lake) is an eighteen year old who has just moved away from everything she's ever known as \\"home\\" after her fathers sudden death. She needs and tries so hard to be the rock that her little brother, Kel, and mother can lean on. On moving day, she meets her neighbors from across the street, Will and his little brother, Caulder. It was pretty much love at first sight...for the little brothers as well. I loved the dynamics of the kids' relationship. How easy it is to just accept and be happy at that age...<br /><br />Will asks Lake on a date and it's unlike any typical date she's been on before. None of the boring questions about how many siblings, dogs, cats, etc.. Then he brings her to a Slam session. She is thoroughly enjoying herself and begs him to do a slam for her, he volunteers, does his slam and the rest is history...<br /><br />Three days ago, I was devastated, bitter, and hopeless. Today I woke up feeling happy for the first time in months.<br /><br />Will did that for Lake, in all the months that had passed and while her unhappiness began to consume her, he helped her to see life in a different way...<br /><br />...Then a devastating revelation happens....and then another, and you think to yourself, WHY??? Why can't everything just be okay?!...<br /><br />Throughout the course of the book, Lake and Will had to face some of the toughest obstacles any two people could ever or should ever have to face. I would like to think that Lake's best friend Eddie helped to keep her grounded, she was one of my favorite characters in the book; her joy leaped off of the pages to me and I found myself smiling every time she would give off her words of wisdom...<br /><br />This book had me going through so many emotions. I had a lot of ups and downs, tears of sorrow and tears of contentment, grins and frowns. My heart beat rapidly at times for the hope of a solution and beat rapidly at times for the nervousness of what was to come...<br /><br />So many adversities to overcome, so many issues to work through, so manyquestions of priority. Through poetry so much is revealed of how one copes with things, deals with feelings; pouring their soul out to a captive audience. Why? Because it speaks volumes:<br /><br />The ways these poets are able to lure you into a whole new world, viewing things from a vantage point you've never seen before. Making you feel like you are the mother who lost her baby, or the boy who killed his father, or even the man who got high for the first time...<br /><br />This was so much more than a book to me, it put so many things into perspective, it touched me on a deeper level. At the first slam, I knew this would be one of my favorite books of all time, now that I'm done? I'm glad to see that I was right! I would give this book WAY more than 5 stars if GR would let me, but for now, know that I absolutely LOVED this book and am excited to read more of Layken and Will's story in the sequel! In closing, I will leave you with this...<br /><br />Be accepting of everything. People's differences, their similarities, their choices, their personalities. Sometimes it takes a variety to make a good collection.questions of priority.

140053271X|5.0|Easy to use, bright screen and since its capacity can be expanded up to 32 gb by adding a micro sd card I think it is better than a Kindle. With this ability you are practically able to carry a library worth thousands of books. Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website. I have also purchased a CaseCrown Regal Flip Case from Amazon at a bargain price. It fits the Nook very well and is also a beautifull case.<br /><br />I am thinking to buy more of them in combos as presents to my other family members.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Difficult to use, does not always work. Disconnects automatically. Way over priced and over promised. Customer Service is slow to respond.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Kids/adults will enjoy this movie!  I enjoyed the story and it was definitely full of adventure...Go Brave Go....her brothers are HILARIOUS!
B0014KFV6I|4.0|I bought this LP over 40 years ago and it still has the same draw to me today.  She is quite the lyricist.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|Love this album. It is in my main music playlist and listen to it all the time. Buy it now.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This picture makes you think you're actually on the HMS Surprise!  The casting was superb and the sailors looked like they've been on a ship for years!  The soundtrack completes the movie espically thru the battle scenes....you'd swear the cannonball is coming through the TV .<br /><br />I've had a major man-crush with Russell Crow from the Gladiator days and he plays this role without any overdone or unecessary melodramatic overtones.<br /><br />Drawbacks? No sequel made.
0143122010|5.0|This book destroys a whole bunch of young and old false narratives.<br /><br />The premise (massive reduction in violence) is intriguing as we swim daily into an ocean of media reflected and amplified violence and many false narratives (the noble savage, the evil capitalism etc.) are taken as unquestionable truths.<br /><br />It puts things in perspective. Whenever I hear how life is hard and poor in the western hemisphere from people who never washed clothes by hand in their life, who cannot imagine that plastic bags can be re-used, who think it is normal to have strawberries around the year, I wish them a three month stay in the daily life of the slums of say Delhi. That would clarify what poverty is. That would be a geographical perspective on poverty. This book provides a historical perspective on violence.<br /><br />The book also sheds some light into some of the more obscure workings of our institutions and culture (for example how did the movement against violence to children started?).
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I personally loved this movie.  Also, stop complaining about the ultraviolet.  I hate it too but you don't have to use the digital copy, just enjoy the movie
B008EQIA7W|3.0|Nice special effects, but the story line is a weak point.  If you like special effects over story and acting than this is a good movie.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|This album brings the things I liked about each of my favorite Deftones albums and mixes them together.<br /><br />Entombed, What Happened to You?, and Rosemary and all my top picks for this release. Swerve City is up there, too.<br /><br />Overall this is an impressive addition to their album list. Their sound has continued to evolve while maintaining that feeling that distinctively says &#34;Deftones&#34;.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I switched from the included text program on my Droid X when it crashed and I love it! I really like how it learns your text habits to help the word anticipation.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I love the 70s tones, which make this vampire vlick quite unique. I love the movie, and its another great Burton/Depp collaboration.

B009JZPH32|5.0|Straight from Oliver Stone. This is one of my favorite recent movies and it has it all. Sex, drugs, and killing. Whats not to like?
B00632HWOG|5.0|heres the mail it never fails and when it comes i wag my tailwhen it comes i wanna yell mail
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I've always loved the music Mika has put out, but his second cd wasnt exactly a home run for me. There were a few songs I honestly did not like. But I absolutely LOVE every single song on this cd. I listen to it everyday.
B005LAII08|5.0|Very good movie and the animation was exceptional.  The whole family will enjoy this story, along with a \\"be careful what you wish for\\" lesson.  I think the 3D was very good. Not really pop out at you good, but very good none the less.  I am having a problem with the digital copy included, but that is a Disney issue.  I have not been able to properly open it for sharing on my other devices.  I have never done this before, so I may have opened it wrong?
B00571F26Y|5.0|Having eaten properly (thanks My Fitness Pal) and exercised diligently over the last 5 months, I had lost 45 pounds but hit a plateau.  A friend referred Wheat Belly and it has changed my life physically.  I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and read the entire book that same night.  As a result, I will never eat wheat or products made from/with wheat again.  In two weeks, I have dropped another eight pounds.  I am no longer hungry, even if I've missed a meal.  Sometimes, I actually have to remind myself to eat.<br /><br />I LOVE breads and pastas and thought the elimination of wheat would be difficult.  It has not been hard as there are many websites now offering Wheat Belly wheat-free recipes.  Also, because I am not as hungry (wheat causes your body to crave more food sooner) I am able to eat some higher calorie foods and still lose the pounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It will change your life!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I love the new abilities for the Star Wars characters.  I love the space gravity puzzles--very cool!  I think it's great that the game gives you a way to get around a level that you just can't figure out, by way of the Millennium Falcon, while at the same time making it another aspect of the game you can try to improve.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the last world is locked out unless you pay another fee.  What the heck?  I paid the full price for the HD version, and I get something that kind of like a demo?  It says Hoth will be a free unlock once it's done, but the Daghoba level required you to pay more.  No thanks!  This would be 4 or 5 stars if not for that aspect.<br /><br />Being able to play money for more Millennium Falcons is fine, I'm sure it will generate revenue from some people who are completionists or just can't get through the levels.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This was an exciting if offbeat movie. Plenty of action and the acting was above what I thought it would be.
0525953728|5.0|The author's account of his historical adventure was so compelling that I read this book in just one weekend. I ordered more copies to give as holiday gifts also, and I note that part of those proceeds will go to charity.
B004GYY714|4.0|...but minimally so.  The stations and programs available are really wide-ranging.  I especially like the availability of the European programs, especially the German ones.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This product shipped quickly, and watching this movie is so much fun! We had to watch the Avengers again after too, of course.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This is a really good alternative to the browser supplied with most tablets.  It gets the job done with little fuss.
1594744769|3.0|This book was really fun.  After the first 30 pages I was blown away.  Loved loved loved the way the photos and the text worked together.  What keeps me from rating the book higher is that it seemed to lose a sense of direction near the end.  It became a bit unwieldy, and while it appears to have set up a sequel, I think it could have just as easily been written in a single novel.  I would have preferred a stand-alone book, rather than one that strays off at the end.
B000GFLAI0|1.0|Dylan covered the old Muddy Waters classic \\"Rollin & Tumblin\\", but changed a few lyrics and kept the songwriting credit for himself. Muddy was not well off in his life and I'm sure his family would've appreciated the royalties from this song -this album was acclaimed and Bob could've made a difference, but he chose not to. The music and most of the lyrics were the exact same. Come on Bob, live up to your standards - credit were credit is due!
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I've seen every Pixar film but Cars 2 and this was easily Pixar's weakest effort. It's story we've all heard too many times to put any original spin on it but even Pixar's typical twist where the story is told through toys, cars, wildlife, robots, etc was missing. It will be the only Pixar film that doesn't end up in my house on DVD.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Just like the old invaders style games. Asks you to review after level 4, seems early for a review but I dont want it bugging me after every level. The difficulty seems to be increasing quite quickly.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|If you like Angry Birds and you like/love Star Wars this is a fantastic combo. I love how the video shorts follow the movies and all the special abilities of the different characters. Much like all the other Angry Birds, I've wasted a fair amount of time playing. Again, if you like Angry Birds you'll love this.
1611134900|3.0|\\"The Best of Me\\" is the story of a first love of Dawson Cole and Amanda Collier, 2 high school sweethearts from different side sides of the track that were force to part and take different paths.  Twenty years later they are reunited at the funeral of their mentor and friend, Tuck Hostetler.  Together they must take care of Tuck's estate and remains and forced to deal with the choices each have made and rediscover that sometimes first loves never die.<br /><br />Sparks tells this story through various people point of view which allows you the reader to get intimate and close to the various characters in the book.  I stopped reading Sparks because many of his books are depressing and make me sad - finding that characters is the book find happiness to only have it yank away from them.  This is more of a 3 ½ star book mainly because I found the ending of this book very predictable and sad.<br /><br />Sean Pratt narrated this book and in general I enjoyed his rendition.
B000FC130E|4.0|This book was alright, I expected a bit more based on the reviews.  Worth a read for sure if your looking for a quick read..
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Great movie based on a real person with a good outcome. Who could ask for more in a movie. Watch it!!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Bizarre premise, strange acting, someone was on drugs when they wrote this one.  A waste of good actors' abilities.  A cross between Tim Burton and Clockwork Orange.
B007SGM084|5.0|fity shades triilogy bundle.... had the second and third book at home when i went on vacation...<br />awesome that when i finished the first book... i popped up the whole set and finished<br />on vacation.<br />these books keep you guessing what next!!!!!!!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|This movie is solid to the rest, but very depressing. I don't know who started the dark bad ending writing, Stephen King, or someone, but people now days think everything must have a cost, or bad ending to be realistic. They think fairy tale endings are bad writing, but that is not always true. Especially in comic book heroes. A good writer can also put his cost through the series, and then have your happy ending. A bad ending does not always equal good writing. This writer is sold on this new age of insanity that thinks everything must have a depressing ending to be realistic. I will spoil the sad and stupid stuff below, but here are a couple things his writing did do. We get little of Batman. I beleive it was way into the movie, thirty minutes or more, before we even saw him. When we do, he is often broken down and nearly crippled. Catwoman, Anne Hathaway, is nothing like you expect, though she did steal the show. She was the one bright spot to this movie that kept it going while Batman was missing in action. A few more actors did really good, and look to have a solid acting future, but... They aren't Batman. Would I watch it again? Yes, but mostly to see Catwoman, and other cool stuff. I could not sit through the whole thing again, but some scenes may catch my eye when it's on TV. With nothing else on.<br /><br />  SPOLIER.. Batman, pays the cost in this one. As if he didn't pay enough in the others right? He is broken down, nearly crippled, and severely depressed or some other mental illness. That's not enough. Halfway through the movie, the bad guys use his finger print to invest everything he owns. The stock market crashes and he is bankrupt. Loosing nearly everything. This.. I don't even think it's possible. The police and everyone knew it was a fake print. That means it's a fraud and he shouldn't owe a penny. International laws or not, I simply wouldn't pay it. No matter how you look at it, this was idiotic.. Yet we need more cost. He gets sold out and tricked twice by allies, spending at least fifteen movie minutes in a jail. Then the ending. A self sacrifice as he flies the nuclear bomb of and blows up with it. Saving millions, and dying the hero death. This is ok. It's been done a lot, but a good way to end things, but not with a whole movie full of depressing things. Maybe not in a comic book at all. I'd take the ending or his being crippled, and take the other two out. Any of those sad cost he has paid are enough. When you put to much, you have to wonder if the writer himself is insane or a criminal. A very dark mind to put all of this in. He's not of coarse. He's just copying what is popular in the world right now. Which is.. Selling out in my opinion. Pretty soon we'll shift back to where everyone has to write fairy tales for it to be realistic. We need more balance, and originality. A good mix.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in you A  Crossfire Novel... this book was interesting because it went in<br />directions you weren't expecting and was still racy!
B00A12VW86|4.0|After the rock opera of American Idiot and 21st Century Green Day has returned to the 3 min punk pop genre, I really enjoyed their venture of AI and 21st but am glad to be back to just popping in some Alt punk and not feeling obligated to follow a underlying story. Looking forward to the release of Tres so I'll have a nice playlist of fun Green Day.
0345404475|5.0|A genuis who tackled the Cyber world before the culture had ever been invented. Ideal read for those wanting to see the fledgling influences of the computer age on the world of literature.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Back to funk punk alt rock, enjoyed the rock opera of AI and 21st but I'm glad BJ and the boys are returning to the 3 min punk tune....
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Anticipation of course! And it delivered! Just waiting for the updates to come. It is a combination of Angry Birds space and a little more attitude.
B000T433CO|5.0|I love Kate Winslet in this movie and she and Jack Black are great together. Cameron Diaz and Jude law have amazing chemistry and I loved seeing Law in a different type of roll for him.  It has now become a holiday favorite of mine!
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|When I rented it I didn't think it had any witchcraft and stuff. Not what I want for my kids.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It's Reacher, you don't like it, he'll kick your &$$. Lee Child delivers once again, only downside is I forgot how Reacher broke his nose and it is never explained!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I had read most of the Holmes stories as a child and am glad to have the collected works along with other items of Doyle that I had not read.
0739341243|5.0|Listening to this book has given me a new understanding and appreciation for people who appear to be shy and are soft-spoken. I gave it a 5 star rating because the material was organized and presented in such a logical, yet entertaining way that I am now recognizing the 'quiet' people in my life and changing my own approach to them.  The reader was well chosen for this message, as she has a soothing, in-control voice that is very convincing.  It is written in the first person, and the author shares personal stories and quests she made to understand herself and other 'quiet' people.  The result is nothing short of stunning.  I have been recommending this book to both SHY, and Extroverted people, but especially to parents of young children who may not be recognized for their strengths because they are innately quiet and are damaged by being pushed and punished because they are just different from their out-going parents.  A great book also, for counselors, teachers, business leaders-and anyone interested in improving communication and cooperation among their family members and peers.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so much fun.  I play it almost everyday.  I rrecomend this game to everyone.  if u like anything u will like this.  buy it buy it buy it.  I cant stress this enough buy it.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Compelling and memorable.  Lovely writing.  One of my favorite books of the year, so far.  Would love to see this made into a movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Can't believe I gave it a star... but Amazon doesn't allow for a no star rating.  Here's my quick summary of the whole book:<br />Boy (who is too rich and too good looking) meets girl (who is too naive and too unknowingly beautiful); Boy breaks up with Girl; you have to buy another book to find out if they get back together again.  The cliffhanger?  He spanked her once, and she wants him to never spank her again.<br />I wanted to give them both a good spanking.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story is original and entertaining, but dark.  The author does a great job describing the characters (husband and wife) and their emotions toward one another.  For better or worse, many married couples may relate.  However, the story is dark and ultimately depressing- it is as much about mental illness as it is a bad marriage.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book – so much that I started it again as soon as I was done.  I couldn't get enough of Enzo, who is the most interesting character I have come across in a book in many years.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Great reading. Wonderful insight to a truly unique person. a warts and all account. recommended reading.<br />I always wanted to get a better understanding of Steve Jobs and this book does just that.<br />Well written and full of detail.<br />Great work and a great tribute to a truly remarkable person.<br />Thanks.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It isn't easy to write in Jane Austin's style, but P.D. James succeeds.  Highly recommended for Austin lovers, or anyone<br />who enjoyed Pride and Prejudice.
B003JJA59K|1.0|This movie was slow and at times boring. The little boy whined the whole time. I do not recommend this movie. It lacks inspiration and some parts where purely annoying. I don't see how they survived for so long they didn't even have a knife!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|it wont let me play the game anymore please solve this problem I'm really far in the game and I don't want to loss everything
B009NQKPUW|5.0|For those followers of the ALIEN movies this movie answers some questions about what happened before the first ship landed on that dreaded planet.  The special effects were excellent and the cinematography was great.  I highly reccomend this flick.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fantastcal story has you believing in the fantastic as it gradually seduces you into th evening world where anything can be true.  It's about faith, love, trust, and basic animal behavior, and how it all can not only save our lives, but deepen our lives experiences.
B009KHCT94|4.0|Iron Sky is the ultimate B movie.  It has action, humor, and passable acting.  The movie starts a little slow, but makes up for it toward the end with hard core space battle action.  If you have seen the movie Battleship and thought how could this movie pass as serious and believable, Iron Sky has none of these problems and embraces its B movieness.  So don't sulk in the ocean and reach for the sky, the Iron Sky.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I'll be the first to tell you I'm not Jennifer's biggest fan. I'm in the camp of people that think her acting is pretty good and her singing is just below average. However, this CD is catchy. It's not a perfect 4 but it's close. I actually owned and liked her \\"J.Lo\\" sophomore effort back when I was in like 11th grade. But this album is a little better I think. I like the mix of pop, dance and R&B going on here. Some of the songs don't have much punch such as \\"Talk About Us\\" but it's still a favorite (especially of the ballads) because of the R&B production.<br /><br />But maybe that's the problem with this disc. There isn't enough vocal chops displayed and when she even tries to open up her mouth a little she kinda falls flat. Some of the songs that I like rely on a good beat. I also remember \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" (english version) being better than it is now. Oh well. The spanish version is good though.<br /><br />So all in all, it's a fun disc to get into because it's mostly upbeat. There are some ballads here that show a bit of vulnerability here but she's best at the uptempos. I actually commend her for making a CD like this whereas now she mostly sticks to the dance pop stuff that I'm not crazy about in large amounts.<br /><br />3.8 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"If You Had My Love\\"<br />\\"Feelin' So Good\\" &<br />\\"Talk About Us\\"
B0001D0FTW|4.0|For the metal bands that start with the letter &#34;E&#34;, Edguy fits this situation perfectly and is only five letters long.  Small words are easier to pronounce.  The &#34;Hellfire Club&#34; tracks are also easy to get into and enjoy.  The music can almost be considered mainstream metal rock which is easier to sell.  This only goes to show that even hard core Edguy metal bands want to eat three meals a day like everyone else.  So sit back, grab your imaginary girl friend, and enjoy the romantic melodies of Edguy's &#34;Hellfire Club&#34; album.
B0095J0AL6|4.0|Now this doesn't really bother me but I know some parents that will definitely care about stuff like that. No, there are no swears on this CD but more sly wording speaking on hooking up, etc. are present in at least one song (\\"Kiss You\\"). I'm actually kinda shocked to hear this from a pop group like 1D so soon. Anyway, I'm not gonna get hung up on that. I'm just gonna tell you what I thought after listening to this a couple of times.<br /><br />If you liked 1D's first CD then you will probably like this one too. There are still the catchy, uptempo pop numbers that get stuck in your head for days. There are still the sappy ballads that will make your pop heart melt. And there is still the 5 group of cute guys singing so you can swoon. \\"Live While We're Young\\" was definitely not the best choice for first single in my eyes though. It has nothing on \\"That's What Makes You Beautiful\\" which might still be my favorite 1D song ever. lol. But it's OK. \\"Kiss You\\" honestly feels like a Bruno Mars song. That isn't a bad thing either cause I L-O-V-E Bruno. It's very uptempo and pop. \\"C'Mon C'Mon\\" is very typical of this boy band but in a very good way. It's very catchy and non-offensive and one of those songs like I mentioned earlier that you won't be able to stop singing for some odd hours. My favorite song from the album is \\"Summer Love\\" which is a bittersweet but beautiful pop song. My friend Chad told me it's Zayn's favorite too. Some of the songs are a little repetitive and not so fun but overall I'd recommend this to pop fans that like their music upbeat and fans of music that doesn't take itself too seriously. If you are unfamiliar with this group of pop stars they are similar to N'Sync from the late 90s except their songs are more amped up like a sugar rush.<br /><br />Like I said you can't really lose with this CD if you liked their first. Honestly they don't seem that much different although I think as a whole I enjoyed their first one a little more. But maybe that's because they didn't do too much different on this album and I was looking for a little more. Who knows?<br /><br />4 stars.ecause they didn't do too much different on this album and I was looking for a little more. Who knows?<br /><br />4 stars.

B003TSEEDY|2.0|This is another book I read because my teenage daughter read it.  I can't imagine what the movie was about, because not much happened in the book.  It would have been more satisfying if the reader learned who the narrator was writing to throughout the book.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson really nails it with short stories like this one. Read it, it is actually great. And I really want more stories set in the same universe.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Loved this book - felt like I learned something.  At first I didn't understand why &#34;Mark Owen&#34; would write this book - thinking it was a betrayal of his military code.  However, as it went along, he wasn't telling any facts that we didn't already know - he just added his story, feelings and journey.  By the end I felt like our government sold the team out.
0688101364|5.0|It is that time of year again . . . family and friends are awaiting their annual tin of holiday cookies, and four of them always come from this book: Lora Brody's Rugelach, Thumbprints, Traditional Rolled Christmas Cookies and David's Dreambars (men adore these, but it is definitely a Christmas splurge to make a cookie that requires 6 Lindt chocolate bars, among other ingredients).  The rugelach are absolutely the best I have ever had, including those from well-known Jewish bakeries and many accomplished cooks.  They are time-consuming to make, as are many of the cookies in this book, but if you break the recipe into steps (I always make the dough the night before), you can make the process more manageable.  I bake a batch of these cookies whenever I want to give a special hostess gift, packaging them in whatever suits the season, and they never fail to delight.  Other wonderful recipes in the book include those for Maple Walnut Sable Sandwiches, the Ultimate Lemon Bar (it really is) and Pecan Tassies.  There are excellent sections on ingredients & equipment, and each cookie comes with instructions for use of either a food processor or a stand mixer (which I, unlike Ms. Brody, prefer).  In her equipment sources section, she lists my favorite local store, La Cuisine in Alexandria, VA, which provides excellent mail-order service, and can supply you with the highest quality bakeware.  As Ms. Brody suggests, do invest in good quality cookie sheets; they will definitely improve your results and will last a lifetime.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I'm a college student who has only had a Kindle Fire since this past summer. Before I downloaded this app, I would email all my school pdf documents to my @kindle.com email address so that they would show up in my 'Documents' tab on my Fire's homescreen. This worked well at first but as the number of pdf's on my device increased I started to see the many flaws of the default pdf reading and storing software on the Kindle Fire. Here are all the features this app gives you on the Kindle Fire:<br /><br />You are able to search and highlight text.<br />You are able to organize your documents into folders. (this is best done with your Fire connected by usb to your computer)<br />After reading a document using this app, that document won't pop up on your Carousel.<br />Instead of scrolling through pages left to right, in this app everything is vertical.<br /><br />I don't understand why all those features aren't already standard on the Fire (especially organizing into folders), but since this extremely useful app is free, the only thing I can complain about is not finding this earlier.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I enjoyed the songs on this album.  I wish it was a lot simpler to download the music without the downloader.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|.  NNaked Heat  Like Castle books and TV.  Touch of humor in a mystery!  Love their off and n again love affair
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The ending had a good twist because I hadn't considered that they were both in on the scam to get him out of jail to set up the plot to get the gold bars.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|The red slide to open from the top work poorly.  I love that it is a nicer container than the ones that come pre filled, but the red opening needs to be reworked.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Looks great. Was a lot of fun. Feels like a culmination of the style<br />presente in all the others. Good date movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was probably the best book that I've ever read. Enchanting. Loved it from page one! The plot was so beautifully woven throughout the entire story. I highly recommend this book!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is a very good movie. It makes you appreciate even more what our men and women do everyday to<br />keep our country safe.<br />The price was good and it shipped quickly. Very satisfied.
0783225733|5.0|Excellent movie.  I am covering space travel and the Apollo program with my students. this movie was shown to the students to explain how even the best plans go wrong.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It 's good for anyone who would like to solve these kind of puzzles. It's okay. I don't play it a lot. It's still okay though.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This series was purchased to go along with the books that I am using for literature with my class.  It is easier for them to understand the novels if they also see the video.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Love this leather case. It looks real nice and sleek. Keeps my kindly nice and safe. Overall well designed case.
B004DP9QFS|4.0|Pros:  I like this app.  It gives some interesting information, and some nice visuals.<br /><br />Cons:  Overall, it isn't quite what I wanted.  It requires too many taps to get to the different screens, then to back out of the app.  My battery life is a bit less since installing this, using the default refresh time for the cloud overlay (this is noted by the author).  Also noted by the author, on my Samsung GS2 running ICS, you can't scale the widget, which stinks, but isn't the author's fault.<br /><br />It's only $3.  Try it, you might love it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Not quite the good read I would expect from Mitch Albom. This wasnt a bad book, it was okay and worth reading. Would exactly say it's a must read though.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|excellent film, well written, suspenseful. If you are expecting a scary scifi film, u will be disappointed. If u are a fan of the Alien films, at least rent it and give it a view. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful to look at. The ending will blow u away.
B00914JWSW|5.0|This is a sweet surprise and much like those albums in the late 60's that filled you with a rush and made you want to listen over and over again.  Who knew How Are Things in Glocca Morra? (not one of my favorite songs I might add) could bring me to tears and be such a show stopper!!  Then again it is stresand delivering this compilation of one act plays to be enveloped by the listener.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|An excellent film, a great, darker twist on the classic fairy tale. Great cast, Charlize Theron is amazing as the evil queen Ravenna, Chris Hemsworth is great as The Huntsman. Kristen Stewart does well as Snow White.<br />  If u like fantasy, and a good story, pick it up and give it a view.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|this is pretty fun. ive only gotten to level 5 so far but its interesting not too difficult. I shall keep playing :)
0800141660|5.0|This is a great movie with a full cast of notable actresses and actors. This is my favorite version of the story. It leaves out some of the lesser characters but follows the book fairly well.
B009KKLQVS|4.0|The first thing I want to do is respond to an earlier reviewer's claims that The Beach Boys sing to a studio track on the song \\"Isn't it Time\\". You are dead wrong! It's done live and it's wonderful as is the rest of this oh too short concert film. Why would The Beach Boys lip-sync when they have Brian Wilson's magnificent back -up band behind them literally doubling all the vocals. Not only does this allow the boys to relax and concentrate on their own harmonies but it makes for a much richer live reading of their classic works. For hardcore Beach Boy fans like myself, this concert thankfully contains a juicy center beginning with \\"Heroes and Villians\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Wouldn't it be Nice\\", \\"All This is That\\" (Which made me cry.), \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\", \\"Sail On Sailor\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\" and the timeless \\"California Girls\\". I, like many other fans reviewing here, hope that this isn't going to be the only visual and audio record of this historic musical event that I feel so lucky to have seen this past June in Columbia Maryland. Let's have another volume of the 50th live concert, only this time include what's already on this dvd plus the rest of their 50 song play list. I'll buy it and so will all of the other millions of Beach Boys fans, it's a no brainer and everybody wins. This was a well filmed live concert, the Blu-Ray image really put you there and the 5.1 surround, although I had to crank it up, sounded really good. They all looked relaxed and like they were having fun including our national treasure Brian Wilson who never sounded so good (No lip-syncing,THAT'S FOR SURE!) My four star rating is only because it's not the whole concert.So get this dvd and hope that one day soon, the powers that be release the definitive entire set for our enjoyment in the years to come.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Only thing i can say about Dexter Season 4 is : that the last episode will blow your mind!! EPIC
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Boring. Boring.  boring.  On top of that, this film is actually more anti-Christian than anti-Capitalism.  Very anti-Christian.  Sad.  But this is what we get now a days, since we never complain or resist.  Sad.  Almost as sad as this boring, worthless, piece of crap movie.  I guess you don't get your film proclaimed a masterpiece without embracing the forces arrayed against this once Christian country.  And, apparently, Day-Lewis is a life time member of those forces.  Only a mentally ill, godless, sociopathic wanna be Bolshevik would [claim to] like this movie.  In fact, it was recommended to me by a Bolshevik.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the game I have been waiting for on the kindlefire. It was tottaly worth using my last 7 dollars on this game.
B003E88TKS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, timely for the state of our economy, love Clooney's character, insights into the industry and the nature of the job.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|Features several different artist which keeps if fresh and the lyrics at time can just be comical (in a good way!).  WARNING:  I would not let my 13 year old listen, or younger kids, listen.  Pretty graphic and in my opinion for this is clearly for adults.
B008MEM24S|5.0|well worth a buck. Just when you thought you'd had your fill, this game reignited that flame. Take where's my water to another level!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I came to read this book expecting this book to be what it is, most have said how overated or stupid this is when honestly they probably expected somwthing more than it is. I enjoyed it for what it is, a funny, sexy but corny book but it was fun to read. So I recommend this book with caution that it's no alexander dumas, shakespeare or ann rice book so enjoy it for its corny parts and even it's stupid parts.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Better than expected, strange concept but very entertaining.  Very violent for younger viewers. But I would<br />watch it again. See it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The time period in which it takes place was very well portrayed. The costumes were great and the acting was wonderful.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this book is awsome I totally recommend this book to a lot of people. I really hope Jeff Kinney writes another book, this time book 8.<br />  8-)
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The 3rd song is played on the radio and I've really enjoyed it. I'm usually leary about buying an entire album because they often disappoint. Amazon had the album on sale for $3.99. Why not when I would have to pay .99 for a single song? Much to my surprise the it is a great album!
B0076UXKDG|4.0|It's more expensive than the various knock off grips, but it's also a better build and I know Nikon will stand behind it. To me, that's worth the additional cost over the after market grips. Two things I will not purchase as aftermarket are grips and batteries, not worth the risk of having a problem with them.
B0082SU98U|4.0|A kids book with lots to teach grown-ups. Well written and easy to read. An classic eternal book; I hope future generations will appreciate as well.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I definetly liked the first book best of the three but felt I had to finish the trilogy to finish the story. It's a good book but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
B008476HBM|5.0|one of the best books ever written! These topics are eternal and Jane Austen displays it with such charm you can't stop reading until you finish the book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It's interesting to watch this new series unfold, with its charismatic, complex hero and well-constructed milieu. Let's hope they maintain the high level of the first episodes.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Love that I didn't have to FFWD through commercials. Don't what else to say- the quality of the episode was great, but doesn't that really have to do with the TV? Anyways I was happy with th purchase (though if my OnDemand was working properly I would have rather watched it for free on there)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Beautiful melodies! It is so relaxing when i'm upright and I use it anytime of the day or night. Thanks. for creating it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My kids really enjoy this app.  It is fun to play and keeps them occupied for hours at a time.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I liked the change in location.  This version throws a new twist to the game.  New characters and new actions.  Keep it up.
B004F1F32A|5.0|First time trying Amazon videos...will definitely use again...movie is definitely worth having in your collection...you will watch is more than once...
B008M4MB8K|5.0|What no one has answered is what is different about this \\"30th Anniversary\\" edition blu-ray that the previous blu-ray edition from 2007?<br /><br />Is there any noticeable difference in image or sound quality at all?<br /><br />Fans are acting as if this is the very first time that Blade Runner has appeared in high-def blu-ray and that's not the case. Has everyone forgotten the previous five-disk 2007 release that also contained the so-called \\"final\\" cut?<br /><br />First of all, I doubt that Ridley Scott can keeps his hands off this film, and that more final-final-this time I really REALLY mean it versions will come out in the future.<br /><br />Secondly, I never for a second bought into the lame idea that Harrison Ford's character is a robot. Even if the androids THINK they experience memories (implanted from real human donors), the idea that they can love each other is absurd. I always read the film to say that Deckard is a living flesh & blood human being like you and I.<br /><br />Thirdly, the best version of this film by far was the original theatrical release with the Harrison Ford narration. Ford's narration is vital to the story, as this plot is rather vague and hard to follow at times. Any newer versions that try to establish some lame sort of ambiguity towards the main protagonist is just a cheap gimick to make suckers spend more money on new \\"versions\\".<br /><br />Lastly, Ridley Scott's lost his touch. Compare this masterpiece to his most recent \\"Prometheus\\", a very tired formulaic film that sadly tries to capitalize on his monumental 1979 original \\"Alien\\" movie's coattails. Lets just say that I no longer trust the director's artistic whims. Leave your classic films alone, Mr Scott, because like George Lucas, you're just ripping off your fans at this point.<br /><br />Lets see less new re-versioning of this classic, shall we. All I want is the best image and sound quality available of the original film. Is this that? Is this version better than the 2007five-disk blu-ray package at all, or are fans being ripped off?
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a great movie for the whole family. I found it funny and had a good moral. We loved this movie.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|So fun and upbeat. I had never listened to them before but they came to my school for homecoming so I bought the album and they are so great! A perfect album to roll down the windows to!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I don't often write reviews for anything much less a movie. But this was a really good one for staying home on Sat night. Had all the right elements. Rachel McAdams really got a genuinely good character going here. I almost think she could have gotten a nomintion or 2, if not for the fact that  simple romantic comedies like this never seem to get considered anymore. Harrison Ford is always great and so is Dianne Keaton. Will say that my all time favorite \\"guilty pleasure\\" movie is [[ASIN:B000SW4DK8 Working Girl]].  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this one so much, LOL! And by the way, that one got several Oscar nominations and those who have seen it will enjoy this one too. Just stream it, what the heck. If you have Prime (like me) it's free! Enjoy with a glass of wine. :-)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have enjoyed playing the game. My 9 year son loves it! Just wish we could earn things without spending real money!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It is the best zombie show ever made! It is the most realistic scenario show to actually happen compared to other zombie shows/movies. I like it because it actually has a plot with a lot of high points. It is a very unpredictable show which keeps me watching.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Superbly written, slowly unwrapping story, and the characters are so realistic. The world that the story describes is awful,but humanity is still there. Hope to see continuation of the series.
B003V3FVOS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The fight choreography was done by someone who knew what they were doing. The storyline was compelling and the action was stimulating.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I was looking forward to this book after really enjoying the first 3 books in the series. But I have to say I was disappointed in A Feast for Crows. The first 3 books had great plot twists and character development. So I overlooked George RR Martin's unnecessary foul language and violence. But this book in the series has reversed this so that the offensive language and violence, particularly aimed at women, takes center stage and the plot seems to be lost. I plan to read the next book since I am interested in some of the characters; however, I don't find myself looking forward to it as eagerly as I did to this book.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The show is great it leaves you wanting the next episode and waiting for the next season to start and wanting more
B00A12VW86|4.0|I'm a HUGE Green Day fan, and I really like ¡UNO! and ¡DOS! a lot!  I'd probably be giving this 5 stars if they weren't coming on the heels of American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown - both of which I think are BRILLIANT.  ¡UNO! and ¡DOS! aren't quite up to those standards - but those are pretty darn high standards!  If you like Green Day, these albums won't disappoint - except that they are a bit short... I'm glad I've bought them during their first week of release when Amazon sells them for five dollars.  I'm looking forward to getting ¡TRE! on December 11th - so I can listen to all three of these releases back to back to back!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun game! I am sad because I have a windows phone and can't get it for my fun. But was excited to find out I can download it on my kindle!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|It was free and I downloaded it for my kindle because I had my kindle one night but oddly not my phone. Did the trick!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I was a huge fan of Phillip while he was competing on American Idol, and Phillip - along with Crystal Bowersox - seem to be the only winners who have been able to retain creative control on their debut albums.  This one is FANTASTIC!  There are many comparisons with Dave Matthews, but there is an energy and joy in the performance that Dave Matthews hasn't displayed in a long, long time.  If you liked Phillip on the show, you'll love this album.
B0064SHI9I|1.0|There is only have 377 mb online storage (of course you can BUY more space)!  It doesn't let you backup to a network path/ to your computer.  Only to the SD card that is in your phone (would be worthless to put in a new SD card just for the back up, cause most people have apps/data on the card - that's why you have the SD card. duh! My phone has 1.29 GB internal/28 GB SD Card) I guess you can back up to sd card, then copy file to a safe place.  Basically, they charge you for the app, then to keep it working easily, you have keep paying a yearly subscription.  I feel that when you pay for a program, it should be self contained.  RIP OFF
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is fun and addicting but when it first comes on it takes a few minutes for the option/beginning screen to come on. please fix this
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Kind of familiar! I wish Mr grey was a bit more closed off, he seems to be breaking his own rules to easily.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games. There is alot one could say about it but i have few words to contribute. First off I don't mean to be like everybody and their mother, brother, sister, cousin, and for some people even their extremely smart cat or dog but i found the hunger games, for lack of a better word, AWESOME! However I did feel they could have done a much better job with the movie, but were not discussing the movie are we? Back to the book, if you think about it this could be our world in the future and that brings more of a realness to the book and lets me consider what i have and what I am thankful for. So good job Suzzane Collins, i think you did a wonderful job weaving such a wonderful story and lesson. hehe........SPONGEBOB!!!!!!!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I am one of the greatest fans of Voyager. I recently moved away and had to leave my complete series set behind. I am slowly rebuilding my collection. To me Voyager was the best Star Trek series. I have watched it so many times I can almost recite the script verbatim. If sci fi ever had to be described, Star Trek Voyager would leave you speechless. Season 7 was pivotal in that so much took place in the last season that encompassed the whole series. Buy it and really discover the Star Trek experience
B005DA63EY|5.0|Good story about a lawyer that practices law out of his car.  The truth about the law system is resolved...scary, but true!
159420411X|4.0|This book is a signal in a lot of noise and is quite valuable.  I would have given it 5 stars except for one reason.  At a few points in the 2nd half the book went into too many irrelevant details and personal anecdotes.  I could have done without so much information about poker and chess playing computers.  However, this book should be read by every thinking person and by every expert.  The good in this book is easily 5 star information.  The concepts are explained exceptionally well and very persuasively argued.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this book.  If you skim over unimportant details in the 2nd half and read the rest of the book deeply you will definitely increase your knowledge of a very important subject.  This book has Amazon's \\"Search Inside\\" feature and I recommend you make use of it to preview the contents.
B009OWGMYI|5.0|I love the cover of Strangeworld HIM does cover songs like no other band and the  compilation of songs of g their 20 years as a band is great.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|We couldn't wait for this to come out, and we have watched it multiple times.  It has a good message but is entertaining too.  Different from the book, but still a good movie.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|i like this movie but i was expecting more from it. It doesn't seem to matched up to the hipe it had.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Clever story, with very clever writing.  The author incorporates almost every one of 'today's' technologies within the tale.  It was a fun read.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|if you like arcade games then check this one out it is so AWSOME every one has to get this game
B0077ATSZE|3.0|Wanted to love ,this. Love Tom H's other movies, but this one was just ok. The trailers were the best scenes.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Exciting movie, and quite good all around, Daniel Craig has been turning into my favorite James Bond. They even had a terrific homage to an earlier Bond movie.<br /><br />While I did enjoy it overall, I think it needed to be about 5-15 minutes longer to flesh out a few points. The movie may have moved a bit too fast at times, and may have done well to slow down a bit more at points to let some plot points of characters develop, such as Strawberry. Also, while I appreciate it was a continuation of the previous movie, perhaps there could have been a little bit more touching on the past events, and if they weren't fresh in your head it got a bit tough to follow.<br /><br />Excellent movie overall. It just needed another few minutes to flesh it out and polish it off.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It's inventive, fun, funny, unpredictable, exhilarating. The only thing wrong with it is that it ends. A friend of mine recommended it to me after she stayed up all night to finish it. I found myself reading at the oddest times, because it was really hard to pull away from. One guy, his mind, an environment that's trying to kill people even worse than Australia's, and an adolescent sense of humor? More, please.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I so enjoy the Dowtin abbey series that I could watch it over and over. It was a good tv watching experience
B003VANOFY|5.0|Most headsets hurt my ears after a while because at least one spot is rubbing. not these. The thick padding keeps off of my ears and the sound is awsome. Can hear people walking up and tell from what side they are coming from. The wireless is a great feature and can be used wired as well which is great. Love it all round.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|First to note about this would be the rendering time. Its horrible. Another would be the complexity of the menu selections, nothing seems to work half the time and at other times it just crashes. Plus, the website function is completely broken if you ask me. It can only load pages with a very minimum amount of items and download links, so you can forget about downloading through the website. I do like though all the functions provided by it like highlighter, and voice reading but whats the point if it crashes before you can use them or if its so unresponsive you just give up to frustration.<br />m
B0063M22QO|4.0|not to bad  play it most days.....You need to put more games on there it only goes up to 98 tiles
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson does it again. A super cute movie about teenage love. The styling of the movie is<br />fun enough to watch on its owen. You will enjoy every minute.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i love this app because i downloaded fwarp and i used all the pics that i got from that and edited them
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|What a great movie. The cast was great and the story was great too. I love me a super hero movie. It was funny too. Lots of little one liners to get a chuckle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i bet if you playfor a hour or two you will love minecraft  sorrrrrryyyyy if you get it and hate it
B001P36OY2|2.0|I would start off by saying I wasn't expecting all that much, and truthfully all I was really looking for was for Vin Diesel to do his super cool macho thing where he stands in slow motion and then punches someone in the mouth. Maybe some of those cool voice overs where tells you a story off screen(which he does do.) Its probably a good thing I set my expectations there, because its quite questionable as to if the movie manages to deliver on that.<br /><br />To some extent the movie suffers a bit from wanting to outgrow its budget. From the look of things the proper vision would have had bigger effects, and I would guess that whomever created this world probably lost a bit of sleep somewhere along the way watching their vision get stunted by the realities of budget constraints. This in of its self really isn't the core problem but it does mean you can't get distracted by all the pretty explosions, and fancy special effects. Essentially it it forces it to live and die by its own merit as a story, and that is the core problem.<br /><br />Its hard to say too much without spoiling the plot, but we are on a journey of mystery concerning a girl and what she truly is. It ends up feeling like the mystery is far more fun than the answer, and by the end of things I'm not quite sure how we got to the credits, nor I am sure what Diesel's character has been working for. He grows as a person but has not really accomplished anything the viewer traditionally desires he accomplish. The bad guys aren't really bested, and the whole thing is frustratingly anti-climatic, if not down right nonsensical. These layers of lack of pay off make it difficult to recommend even for someone not looking for much out of a movie. I suspect there are a handful of people that will &#34;get&#34; the point, but I must conclude that they will be rare. As for the majority of people this movie offers precious little. It is a shame. I really did want to like it more than I did, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. Even to those just looking to kill some time.
0374275637|5.0|My best read for 2012. Why?<br />Covers what could become a complex and dry topic in a lively and easily readable style which maintained my interest throughout. EAsy to follow and to understand. As a person with a formal education in psychology I found that Kahneman was able to put psychological concepts across in a way that kept me interested. And when talking about statistics or economics (the other 2 disciplines melded into his overall theme of this book) I found it  interesting as well as easy to follow without being patronising.
0525952926|3.0|If you can keep track of all the characters after setting the book aside for a day or two, good luck. The story relies on nearly unbelievable coincidences of characters' paths crossing in major historical events. Not sure if I can struggle thru book three.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|the game eternity warriors 2 is a more challenging game than the first eternity warriors and this is so far the best game glu mobile made.
B008MBXFEM|4.0|I do not like this Batman soundtrack as much as I loved the others, but it has some great tracks. In particular, I bought the MP3 because it contained the Junkie XL remix that is not on the soundtrack CD. If you want some of Hans Zimmer's best stuff, then check out the 'Crimson Tide' and 'Inception' soundtracks.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am so happy mark of Athena was everything I hoped for.I can't wait for house of Hades to come out
B0093WVND4|5.0|Although in retrospect, the story is surprisingly simple, and the villains unrelievedly villainous, yet I could never pass a bookshelf with this book on it, and not pull it down for a bit of a read... usually this resulted in my borrowing it from the library (yet AGAIN).  That premise of man against the machine (okay, fox against the machine) was energizing to me (I later found the same energy in the legend of John Henry).  I'm glad I own a copy now; I can read it to the children in my life and enjoy bringing the same magic to them.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Missed an episode on tv.  Show was easy to purchase and the quality was good.  Great show! (would not reccommend for young children)
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I really didn't care for this book.  I was so looking forward to it, I really was.  It was just so drawn out....I just about gave up when the book gets to India.  AND as someone who loves India and lived there for nearly year that is saying a lot.  The beginning is okay.  The middle is way too long, and the end is quite humorous.  I loved the parts in Bali.  That being said I don't think it was worth reading through the 1st two parts of the book to get there.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a great story!  What would you do to survive?  Very thought provoking! The suprise ending makes the tale.  Read it<br />before you see it!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this series.  I like how she explores the human psyche....how it is put to the test in life and death situations.  Throw in a little love, a little adventure and plenty of suspense and you have a recipe for success!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a fun and entertaining story for people of all ages. Collins is an awesome story teller and I can't wait to read the next one. The Kindle version is very well done and is not chopped up weirdly like some other kindle books are.
B004IYISSK|5.0|I love this book.  Many have a hard time reading it but it illustrates the relationships between women so well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The letter form this book is written in is great. Finished it in two days and cannot wait to see the film version. I highly reccomend this to anyone looking for an easy read.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Interesting read, funny stories.  It was pretty good...we read it for book club.  I would not have picked this myself but did enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an outstanding game for your kindle. I mean who doesnt like building incredible worlds. Its that fun. Outstanding
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|While I enjoyed the relationship between the main characters I felt like the story was predictable....it didn't really capture my imagination.  I was disappointed, mostly because I really did like the two main characters.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Its an ok chess game played it alot at first but then i got really bored of it. Its ok
B00A12VW86|2.0|This is definitely not the highest quality Green Day album. There are a few good songs on this album, but not all of them are fantastic.
B004SBX112|5.0|My whole family was yearning to play thisd game on my kindle fire. It's an awesome game buy thuis app
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like all Grisham books, it pulls you in immediately.  This book kept you guessing until the very end.  Could not put down.  Highly recommend.  Definitely one of Grisham's best.
B006YXTRHY|2.0|Loved this first 3..this saga was slow, bad acting.  How this could be rated PG 14 is beyond me.  It was pathetic.  If this had been the first Twilight series, I wouldn't have watched the rest.  A a grown adult...(albeit a wolf) imprinting on a baby?  SICK
B004AKCME8|5.0|I bought it for my Mom because she likes owls but I think I like it more then she does.  Only down fall is the seller will spam you threw USPS with giant catalogs.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I only review movies that make me want to get other people to see them, and Warrior is one of such films. Written, acted and delivered with perfection, you owe it to yourself to feel inspired by this film.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Everything that I purchase I really like or I would not have spent my hard earned money on them. I liked to be entertained and I feel that my purchases are doing just that.
B0060CXAHC|4.0|The overall message is about family sticking together, about rising above what we've been &#34;labeled,&#34;and  about getting past the &#34;sad parts&#34; in our lives to find new joy.  My young kids love it (31/2, 7,9,10).  It is also extremely funny.  There is minor &#34;potty mouth&#34; in a couple of places, and the sisters scream at each other...but I thought it was realistic, not poorly done.  Overall thumbs up.
B00845MRKE|4.0|I think this is the best Blade Runner version you can get.<br /><br />I had the suitcase (VK) version on dvd and that was one the best collection i ever had, but seeing the extras on HD adds a very good tocuh to the experience.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. The book is a plus too.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|This movie could have been better.  There was something missing from the story, it failed to capture the sense of a real love connection between Snow White and her &#34;true love.&#34;  Special effects were great but failed to make up for the shortfalls in the story.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre. Had to buy the soundtrack with the movie.<br />Loved it. Great cast. One of my favorite movies.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I really liked this movie because it offered something fresh from the movie industry that otherwise seems to recycle old trusted and tried storylines.  I was initially concerned about the violent nature of the kids hunting kids theme, but found it was not overly portrayed in the film and thus not quite as offensive.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and bought it for my Thanksgiving movie.<br />when it was released. WOW-Everyone loved it! Really great cast.<br />So glad I bought it. It was a big hit - Love Tom Cruise!<br />I will watch it many times to come.
0307887448|5.0|i absolutely love this book. it was perfect from the beginning. i has the right amount of action and is super geeky and fun. i love Ernest's writing style. very cool. :)
B008458O3S|5.0|Brilliant idea and very slick and clean interface design. Very fun and engaging game. Wish there were even more levels!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Intrigue with style, even the kids are cool.  Klinda is super smooth, will is super hot, Eli is super sensitive.  Love it.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|This app just did not work for me. Perhaps I will re-install and try again. If anyone has any tips, please let me know.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I bought this movie because I love it. It's really cute. If you like chick flicks, you will like this movie. I seriously watch this movie on my days off every week. Also, I think the cast is awesome. Worth a couple hours of your life.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|The choices of music just weren't for me-more for the younger generation. It was a good variety of artists though.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I download a number of PDF's each month... opening them in ezPDF Pro is easy and makes studying (high lighting, writing notes  on the pages) very convenient.
B003Q97D48|5.0|This was a good way for me to get more familiar with the series my daughter is so wrapped up with!
B008YJFF2M|4.0|Finally a Bond film gets the Best Song Oscar, and is it on this recording?..........nooooooooooo. Otherwise, the compilation is fine-the early songs generally being the better, more Bondish songs, which is why Skyfall would have fit right in, as a reversion to the old Bond themes
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I like the book and good scientific information but it didnt help me loose weight....but in my many years nothing has so i quit....i eat healthy!!! Thats it! And and so far i dropped a pant size!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|It was terrific, the whole family Loved it. The story, the color, the sound all awesome.Will watch again and again!
B0063IH60K|4.0|i really enjoy Solitaire. I love all setting changes available on this game and I really enjoy the ability to play multiplayer. I also like that I can rank myself to see how I compare to other players.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Bought this for my Kindle Fire HD.  Love the tablet so far and this app was very cheap.  I don't know why so many people complain about the price. Two Bucks?? C'mon!<br />My issue is the lack of a lens/eye on the back of the tablet.  Who want's to take pix of their own face?  Works great as a mirror, but to use it as a camera is very difficult.  What am I supposed to do....aim it at my subject and blindly tap the other side in hopes I hit the tiny circle that snaps a photo of an image I can't preview??  I'm sure it works great for video chat/skype, and so far the functions seem easy to use, but I just can't get past the huge flaw of how impossible it is to take a reasonable photo.  I guess the flaw falls on Amazon. This tablet NEEDS an outward facing lens!!!!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Being a digital artist myself, seeing epic or moving animated movies that are extremely well thought out, animated, and put together is part of what inspires me and keeps me going.  This wasn't really one of those movies but it's enjoyable.<br /><br />The plot line, which is no doubt what most people watch for, is mildly entertaining and predictable to a point.  It has several noticeable incongruities and odd 'turns' that make little sense but pretty much have to be there for the movie to get on with the plot.  A lot of it has to do with developing the characters, especially Merida's mother.  She suddenly has, to me, a mostly inexplicable change off heart.  The rest of the characters stay static; except for Merida... somewhat.  I don't get the feeling that she's genuinely changed but doing things to save her mother.<br /><br />Compared to other extraordinary Pixar and animated films in recent times, there is nothing about this movie's rendering and appearance that is superb.  Everything is standard fair.  The only aesthetic palette teaser is Merida's hair.  There's no breaking the mold with 3D here.<br /><br />That said... it's -okay-.  I'd watch it again for entertainment purposes and mothers/daughters alike can take a lesson from the power struggle.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Good movie, but glad I did not pay to see it in a theater. It was a pretty good ending.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Great visual effects, a few mild gaffs, and a lot of scary content make Prometheus the best Sci-Fi flick of 2012.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|As a retired seamstress I especially enjoyed the designs of the costumes as well as the backdrops.  Andrew Lloyd Webber always does a wonderfull job on all of his films
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a very well written book. The  story draws you into it. You never know what is to happen next. The ending is set up for a follow on book. I'll be waiting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it runs great and is fun to play but needs to be updated better hrf  fhfbfvf hfbfhfurbfhf dhdhf fuf h
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I loved the album from the first listen.  A little different from the run of the mill stuff being churned out these days.  Highly recommend.
