0525951113|5.0|Rarely have I come across a book so enjoyable and technically correct. So many 'techno-thrillers' just don't get the technology right and lose the audience by their sheer silliness and scare tactics.<br /><br />This book is based in technology: CURRENT technology, and the story is dependent on in it. Rather than painting a picture of the scary near-future, the events in this book could conceivably begin tomorrow morning (or last month, for that matter).<br /><br />More than simple 'automation gone awry' like many short stories and movies of the past, this book explores the technical, financial and political implications of a nearly omnipotent automated, distributed system; one that can bring together, leverage, and coordinate much of the disparate technologies already in place or available today.  Mainstream technologies like VOIP, GPS, WiFi, online games and Internet-accessible anything.  Imagine the possibilities -- David Suarez has and the result is incredibly interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />The nearest I can come to a comparison is something like a cross between Michael Crichton's Runaway and Minority Report. If you like Tom Clancy's earlier work, like the Hunt For Red October, and are a fan of technology, READ THIS BOOK!
0756404746|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the fourth time since I purchased it, which was soon after it was published. Rothfuss is an author in the classical poetic style, with excellent character development and beautiful imagery. I eagerly await the second and third portions of this story.    Epic fantasy has a new star...
0307394549|5.0|My husband checked this book out from the library, twice.  We loved the cookies he made so much we had to buy him the book.  Recipes are interesting and have complete detail.
B001HYY35G|5.0|I just got my copy a few days ago and I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD yet, but I have kept the CD in my car since the day it came and have listened to it on repeat (at least 4 times now).      I was definitely skeptical about buying a live version of an electronic/dj artist's performance, but I am SO GLAD I got it.  They definitely re-worked all the great tracks off \\"Cross\\" and even overlapped them onto each other, and mixed in a couple other songs.      Most definitely worth buying, if only for the CD.  I can't wait to check out the DVD...
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I purchased this dvd for my best friend Mary from Ireland.  She loves Sex and the City.  She was extremely excited to get it being that we were on the Sex and the City Tour in NYC.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I bought this toy for my 22 month old son.  He loves it.  From the start he could put the circles on their peg.  The other shapes were more challenging, but soon enough he was able to do the rectangles.  The squares and triangles are still challenging for him but he enjoys working at it and doesn't find it frustrating.  I think this is a great toy for promoting focus and concentration in toddlers/preschoolers.  My 4-year-old also enjoys playing with this toy even though the puzzle in its intended form is too simple for her.  Instead, she stacks the shapes in non-traditional ways to see what sort of sculptures she can create.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|(1) Surprise, the movie just starts, no menu no pause!? Normally, this wouldn't matter except (2) Dolby HD is not the Audio default !? If you want this option (it does make a difference), pull up the pop-up menu, go to languages, and select English HD. This is the first Blu-ray I have seen that requires this operation. This movie was made for HD!
141690977X|5.0|I got the hardcover copy of this book when a friend of mine got married and gave me all her single girl books.  This was a couple of years ago and I read it at that time.  It made perfect sense then and still makes perfect sense now.  Not much has changed in my life since reading it the first time and I am currently still single.  The relationships that I have had in the past couple of years or ones that my single friends have had are very similar to the situations discussed in this book.  If I had paid more attention to what I learned the first time I read this, it would have saved me a lot of time and heartache on a long term on/off again relationship that just recently ended.  When a guy disappears and doesn't call/email/communicate in any form, he is just not that into you.  I got my answer when I emailed him one last time and never heard from him again.  I am free from this relationship and hopeful for the future.    If you take anything away from reading this book, it would be the following:     * The guy that you are meant to be with will be so into you that he will want to spend time with you, he will call/email/communicate with you, he will not cheat, he will not be able to keep his hands off you, and he will treat you like the wonderful, beautiful, and precious woman that your are.    *  It is better to be alone than in a relationship that makes you feel bad, depressed, sad, or variations on this.  In other words, it is better to be single and happy than in a relationship and miserable.      This book gives both sides of the story with Greg being the happily married guy and Liz being the 40 something and still single.  The chapters are easy to read and layed out like an advice column.  The situations presented are ones that we have all heard of before or have been involved in ourselves.  The reasons that women have so many issues with relationships is because our emotions are so wrapped into them and it is hard to let go when the relationship is not goingthe way we envisioned it.  This book is an essential guide for the single girl trying to navigate the crazy dating world and finding the one guy who is so into you. I will continue to use it myself as I continue to enjoy my happily single life while trying to find the one guy for me.    We all want the fairy tale ending and want to live happily ever after.  What if we are kissing all these frogs (that are not right for us) and our Prince comes riding in?  What do we do then?
0316017922|3.0|Gladwell is not a scholarly researcher but he does posit several ideas for parents of young children. The lack of parental involvment does affect the chances of a child's success. If children are given a break as the students from a low social economic background were given by the law school, then they too can achieve social success. The study Gladwell uses proves it is what happens to all the law school students after they graduate that is surprising.  A Tiger Woods does not happen without practice-practice-practice. Parents and children need to know that and I think most parents really know this but Gladwell puts it in such a way as a parent goes \\"Ah Ha!\\" that is something good to know.  A nice easy read and entertaining but nothing really new. Still, I was glad I read it and it was a talking point among our friends.
B00005RHGL|5.0|For whatever reason, Tombstone is my husband's favorite movie. Since he had worn out his VHS copy, I thought it was time to get him the DVD and purchased this director's cut for one of his Christmas gifts (2008). He LOVED it! ...and had a blast seeing scenes that had previously been edited out. I can't even estimate how many times he has watched this film, but he never gets tired of watching it. I've seen Tombstone a few times as well, and liked what the additional scenes added to the story line.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Good Movie if you are a fan, it might be a little slow or not too clear if you have not read the book
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|\\"Slumdog\\" is one of the few movies that lives up to and surpasses the trailer. It's also one of the few movies released in the last months or two that is worth watching. You get enough plot info from the trailer. Slum Kid Jamal ends up on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire,\\" and is on his way to the 20 million rupee top prize. But how does he get his answers? The movie intertwines Jamal's present-day troubles with his back story as a dirt poor kid, his wild adventures with his streetwise brother, and his loyalty to a young girl. There are gansters and call centers and Muslim-Hindu violence and young blue child-gods -- a fantastic blend of Indian of the past and present spiced with danger and love. Also phenomenal music -- one of the few movie soundtracks I wouldn't mind picking up. It's blend of atmospheric tunes and pulsing beats anchors the movie's intense action. The acting by the entire ensemble is first rate. The three leads are played at different ages by three actors, some of the best child actors I have ever seen on screen. Watching \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a great way to spend 2 hours on a cold, wintry Sunday afternoon. Wild, action-packed, dramatic and moving. Definitely worthy of an Oscar.
1596434252|5.0|What a great and fun book for any youngster; although, I probably had the most fun opening each page for my new young nephew!  Very artistic, dimensional, and fun! A great 'different' gift!
B00008PC2O|5.0|Terminator is my husbands favorite movie and he was really happy with it!! We really enjoy this movie! Great Buy, highly recommended!
B000AP04EW|2.0|I received this video and it looked okay.  No visible scratches on the back or anything recognizably wrong.  However, there are spots in the dvd that will pause and not play without skipping the scene.  This was very disappointing because the seller said it was fine.  I hoped that they would have been able to tell me if there were any issues with it.  Oh well.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|DVD was as described, but delivery was extrememly slow - ordered 2 wks before Christmas and came day before.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is one of the most profound looks at World War II I have ever seen. The progression of the characters as they develop shows how different war effects each one. There are some great laughs and some of the most stirring situations I have ever experienced in film. I consider it to be an absolute classic. I loved it and I am so glad I have it to see again and again.
B001F7MSG6|1.0|I have a new Sony Blue Ray Player,Also, a 40 inch Sony, HD T.V.  This Blu-ray Disc did not play, and when I saw how much it cost to send back. I just filed it.
B001FBSMW6|2.0|I'll be brief. Keane's previous efforts were pop gold. But regrettably, this new album simply leaves me flat...kinda like the vocals you'll hear on \\"Perfect Symmetry\\". Honestly, he's never had a strong voice--but the vulnerability worked. But here is simply sounds weak. I tip my hat to them for trying something new and still consider myself a Keane disciple. But if you loved the sound and tone of the first two releases, prepare to be jarred. I'm really not hearing the \\"brilliance\\" cited by other fans.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I admit it, I'm a \\"Wingnut.\\" I love the series. Fast paced, intelligent, and funny.<br /><br />Even though the first episodes were written over 10 years ago, it's amazing how in-synch the show remains with today's politics and world events.<br /><br />Other reviews have done a good job describing the packaging and contents of this boxed set; no need to repeat all that. What I add to the mix is my disappointment over the episode commentaries and bonus materials on the DVDs.<br /><br />The episode commentaries were created by recording the voices of people involved with the series as they spoke off the tops of their heads while watching an episode. These recordings replace the episode's sound track.<br /><br />Yes, you get the occasional snippet and tidbit. But, if you're a fan of West Wing, you'll probably wish for more depth. And, because these are unscripted, unplanned remarks, there is a lot of dead time while nobody says anything. With a little more thought, the episode commentaries could have been much more engaging.<br /><br />There are special features (gag reels, unaired scenes, interviews) on each season's CD. These are better than the episode commentaries but are not nearly of the caliber of the show itself.<br /><br />So: if you loved the series, buy the set. Every episode is faithfully reproduced and no commercials, no promos, means you can watch each episode in only 41 1/2 minutes. Sweet!<br /><br />If you have most of the episodes already, you can buy this boxed set for the convenience of having everything in one place.<br /><br />Just don't buy it for the episode commentaries or the bonus materials.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|This is one great live set. CD's & DVD's. If you are a Pink Floyd or David Gilmour fan this is a must have. Some of the last music from Ric Wright. (RIP My Friend)

B000007SPU|5.0|'This Mortal Coil' was a superband for 80s alternative label 4AD.  I read somewhere that this record was partly the inspiration for NIN's THE FRAGILE.  Certainly, it is one of the most influential 80s new wave/goth albums in the canon.  It manages to avoid the sickeningly overblown melodrama of several other bands in this category (i.e., Sopor Aeternus) and skips many of the genre's cliches, as well.  The emphasis is on mood, voices, and texture; the overall result is suprisingly coherent, given the sheer diversity of participants (cocteau twins, dead can dance, wolfgang press, etc.)  Definetly without a question a must-have-on-a-desert-island album.
0439023483|1.0|Wow, totally amazed.  This is such a ripoff its almost funny.  Attention: This is not a new concept. Its been around in America for 6 years. Ever hear of Battle Royale? If no, then I understand. This is so bad, its almost funny. Except it isn't. Its a warped and twisted mix of 1984, Battle Royale, and The Running Man. Stay away.
B00005JLCI|2.0|I found this movie almost impossible to watch.  To be sure, there are some incredible performances here, turned in by some legendary actors.  But Branaugh manages to ruin the film with his obnoxious over-the-top ham acting.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|An outstanding performance by Tess and Alec, gorgeous scenery and costumes, stunning BBC classic.  Loved it!  Already have it pre-ordered for the release date.  Alec- Hans Matheson- fabulous evil & tortured soul has been seen in some of his other works (The Virgin Queen & Mists of Avalon), I think he truly soars in this production.  Tess is wonder, sweet and tragic, proud and practical all in one.  Gemma really captures this.  I did not like Angel, there was just too little chemistry, and often thought, why was this actor cast in this role?.  Either way, this DVD is well worth every minute.  Excellent production!
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Shipped in a very timely manner for Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed the movies-a truly classic series!
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Thank you for a speedy transaction. Item as described. Fast shipping. Safe Transaction. Great seller.
B000KC86F4|4.0|Great move! Plenty of action and have one of the best action scene. Great movie on blu-ray with spectacular graphics and sound. Make sure you have enough nacho's and popcorn, because the ending leaves you at the end of your seat. I definitely recommend this movie in your blu- ray collection.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie is very uplifting and fun...Very well done.  I have recommended it to all my friends and family
B00011CZRE|4.0|This is a good movie. I'm not realy a Morgan Freeman type guy but he was pretty good in this movie. I can see how he won an oscar. The reason why I rushed to buy this movie from amazon is because someone told me that this movie was scarrier than the exorcist. So I rushed to get it. Not so. It's just a mystery type. But still a great movie.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|nice to have all his loose ends tied up. turns out he's somebody else, cool!
B001F12J0C|5.0|Pleased with the quick delivery! Item made the perfect gift for an affordable price!!! Played great!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this game for Christmas. I have 3 kids age 9,7 and 5.  All three of them are able to play! It is a good strategy game for the whole family.  I even like to play it, as an adult. It is worth the money!
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I bought a DVD for myself and 1 for my daughter, granddauther and a friend and they all loved it.  I saw the movie and I have watched my dvd twice already.  This is a wonderful movie and everytime I watch it I feel so happy.

B0007MWZEK|3.0|I have no problems with the sweeper, it's designed well, it works as advertised. It picks up dirt from all four directions and I'm surprised at the amount of stuff it picked up from the kitchen floor that I didn't even know was there.    The battery was OBVIOUSLY provided by the lowest bidder.  I've had my sweeper for less than a year and I leave the battery on the charger overnight, take the battery off the charger and place it in the sweeper and turn it on.... the sweeper runs slower than a turtle with 3 bad feet going uphill...    A higher quality battery may increase the cost from the beloved \\"as-seen-on-tv price of $19.95, but it would have DEFINITELY improved my rating of this product.     Now... off to spend another ten bucks on a new battery...
B0015AARJI|4.0|I was happy with my order.  The remote is just like the one's they sell at the retail outlet but I saved over $25 ordering through Amazon.  I was especially thrilled that it arrived in time for Christmas.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a great miniseries that I highly recommend to those who like dramatic war films.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought Planet Earth a while back and it was the best money i have ever spent, ever. The photography is the highest quality imaginable. Some of the shots are mind blowing. This combined with the gentle and effective narration makes this the most moving, inspirational, eye-opening DVD you could ever own.
B0019IB26I|4.0|I purchased this CD for my wife for Christmas. She loaded it onto her MP3 player and plays it almost constently while she is on her computer. I have sat in the office and heard the songs, over and over again. They are both catchy bluesy toons that will get your foot tapping and melodic verses to kep you listening intently. Although she requested the CD specifically, I think she has been quite pleasntly pleased considering the ample \\"air time\\" it has received in our household.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This video is a cute video and gets the message accross \\"A person is a person no mater how small\\".  I think children of all ages need to remember this.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This was a great present!  She (we, all) really enjoyed the movie and the little girl I gave it to, wanted to share it over and over with the family.  Good Christmas present.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|The series are wonderful with good quality DVD's. The only downfall with the set is that the DVD's are not secure enough and can fall out. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star.
B001GKJ2ES|5.0|This was a great present!  He really loved it and enjoyed the whole gift set.  And, it was here in time for Christmas!  Bonus!
0545128285|4.0|I enjoyed reading the stories and commentaries. My favorite story of course was the Tale of the Three Brothers because it was so important in the last Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows. The book was definitely a short read and had morals to their stories just like muggle fairy tales.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I looooooooove this movie.  The girls are all there with fantastic clothes and most of all fantastic SHOES.    This movie ties everything up for all the SATC fans.

0345472322|4.0|Often, the simplest solutions are right in front of you all along. A friend of mine who is an Ivy League graduate recommended Dweck to me.<br /><br />First off, although I gave it four stars, it is one of the better books I have read in a long time. It actually has come along at the right time for me as I have been stuck in a rut.<br /><br />Dweck's insight, working hard and focusing on growth and learning is not revolutionary.  It is practical common sense.<br /><br />What is revolutionary is her discovery of why this doesn't work so easily for everyone.  Dweck provides insights into the internal dialogue that takes place within high achievers, and the fact that there identity is often caught up not in succeeding, but in not failing. In protecting their identity and sense of self as successful.<br /><br />All too often succesful people have been able to get buy at high levels on pure talent. The challenge is that when the going gets tough they may never have learned the skills that will allow them to persevere.<br /><br />I gave it a four because although there are lots of insights and analogies to help the reader understand the concept, you are left wondering, \\"Where do I go from here?\\"<br /><br />Perhaps that is her subtle point, it is now up to the reader to figure out and learn what to do next.<br /><br />To be honest I would have preferred a few practical exercises and perhaps a recommended reading list.  As a teacher she should at least provide some subtle nudges and steering.<br /><br />A quick and worthwhile read.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />Bernie
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I was please with how quickly I received this product.  It was a present and they really enjoyed watching it again.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|Jim Carrey does a great voice over on this adaptation of 'Horton', and I found myself laughing at it quite often.  Good computer animation, and on Blu-Ray it looks fantastic.
1433502402|5.0|Don't buy this bible if you think that all the perks of the study portion will make you feel like reading more.      If, however, you are interested in reading the Word of God and going deeper, make this purchase.  The articles are incredible, particularly the ones on salvation history and biblical theology.  With all the OT, NT and theological scholars that poured their heart into these study aides, The ESV study bible is a cut above the rest.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Both items were purchased as gifts as both individuals were extremely pleased with my selection.  I was please with the price & the shipping time.
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|Just like Viva La vida.  First, I hated it.  Second, i warmed up to it.  now, I love it.  Incredible Music
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Beautiful cd. My cd had a flaw so one of the songs skips....but love it too much to return.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I was hopeful after seeing the positive reviews, and I do not demand perfection from my entertainment.  I do, however, demand that it be entertaining.  I couldn't make it through more than three episodes, this show is so boring.  And it's not because it is too high brow either, it is decidedly low brow.    My husband pointed at that there is not one sympathetic character here.  You will not care about any of them.    I was marginally interested in the historical aspect of the show-- but don't be fooled, even if you don't care that the show isn't accurate, that doesn't mean you will like it.  There are a lot of other great new TV DVDs you should check out instead-- Dexter and Extras are both great finds.
1598561634|4.0|This same edition of the Hebrew Scriptures is published bound together with the Nestle/Aland 27th edition of the Greek New Testament as Biblia Sacra Utriusque Testamenti. Students interested in both languages should check the web pages of the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft or Amazon.de to compare prices.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|Gemma Arterton is fantastic, if not perfect, as Tess in this new TV Film version of Tess of the d'Urbervilles.     As a male viewer (Yes, I was sucked into this film as I started to watch it with my wife) I certainly gained a greater appreciation for women. I cringed at just how awful men have treated women throughout history. I can't decide who I hated most, Alec or Angel. I think they both provide examples of how NOT to treat the women in your life.     Although in many ways it's extremely depressing, I still highly recommend this film. It contains a lot of important messages about forgiveness, tolerance, and love. It was also great to see the up-and-coming actress Gemma Arterton's wonderful performance.
0060723513|5.0|Absolutely great boook,one of my favorites.Bought this one for my doughter.Marlo Morgan's great adventure is  so much fun to read and very inspirational.
B00000ING2|5.0|This is the Coen Brothers take on a 1940's romantic comedy.  Complete with shy, naive, bumbling, hero; worldly, smart newspaper dame; ruthless business men; clocktower narrator and loads of quirky, fast-talking minor characters. Is our hero a genious or an idiot?  Is he man enough to get the girl?  \\"You know, it's for kids.\\"  If you love Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowsky, you will appreciate the subtle humor and madcap comedy that hits you where you laugh.  Fine character acting throughout with standout performances from a cigar chomping Paul Newman, clueless Tim Robbins, cocky Jennifer Jason Leigh and a ukelele playing angel named Charles Durning.  Go Eagles!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|[[ASIN:B000HIVIOW The Raymond Briggs' The Snowman]] After all these years, this is still a wonderful classic.  I strongly recommend this for both children and adults and it makes an excellent gift for all those new nephews and nieces.  Be sure to also get the companion picture book for bedtime story reading.  The art work is nicely done and the music will stay in your head the entire holiday season!
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I am not a huge country fan but I like Talor Swift's new record.  It has some great song and a great vibe to it.  I have enjoyed her music since yet debut in 2006.  I think she is a great crossover artist with a very unique voice.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Great movie!  The little ones might not follow the entire story line, but the short attention-grabbing segments will keep them giggling. As they grow older, they'll appreciate the movie even more.  There is not much (well, actually NO) dialogue in the beginning, but the little robot charms you into falling in love.  The underlying anti-rampant-consumerism message is fantastic to discuss with the kids.  There's a lot to learn and not a whole lot of violence and explosions.  Wall-E is beautifully written and animated. THANK YOU DISNEY/PIXAR!    (Finally, a Disney movie where they don't kill off the mother.) ;-)
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Fast shipping and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  Movie came in perfect condition and my daughter loves it!  Thanks so much, will purchase from again.

0151006903|3.0|The Holy Roman Empire was a misguided attempt to resurrect a civilization that should have been left dead? In the Umberto Eco romp through semi-ancient history, he lies about Prester John and other topics much as he did in his other novels like the entirely fake Foucault's Pendulum? The Greek -Christian kingdom of Ethiopia is usually thought to be the root of the Priest John kingdom?<br />I see, here, Umberto Eco talking about himself as being Baudolino like?<br />A liar who makes up historical myths<br />when he knows better?<br />I'm not a big fan of this sort of historical distortion.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I appreciated Amazon getting this DVD to me so quickly and at such a great price. I bought it cheaper than I could have bought it locally right off the shelf! I haven't been able to watch the video yet as I gave it as a Christmas gift, but I look forward to sitting down to watch it soon.<br /><br />I can sing the praises of Amazon.com - they shipped lots of orders to me in time for Christmas and at great savings!
0670020745|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor's little book is three powerful books in one. First, it's an amazing testimony of her experience as a neuroanatomist (a research scientist specializing in the physical workings of the brain) who undergoes a severe stroke. She gives a brief description of her family history and writes about what drew her to the study of brain science, then describes what she remembers of the experience of losing multiple key brain functions due to her stroke, and finally speaks about what she and others did that helped her to make a total recovery. Second, her book is a brief but eloquent explanation of how the human brain works. And third, it's an evangelical plea to employ the brain's full capacity to live an irenic life in meaningful relationship with one's fellow creatures and in harmony with the universe. It is likely that some readers will favor one part of this book over the others. I suspect there are those who will find the last third of the book to be a little too spiritual and \\"New Age-y,\\" but I enjoyed this section a great deal. If nothing else, I found it reassuring to know that everyone has the ability to deploy the right-brain's capacity to seek unity and to see the big picture as a way to let go of worrisome judgments (of self and others). As Bolte Taylor says, \\"My stroke of insight is that at the core of my right hemisphere consciousness is a character that is directly connected to my feeling of deep inner peace. It is completely committed to the expression of peace, love, joy, and compassion in the world.\\"<br /><br />The two appendices, \\"Ten Assessment Questions\\" and \\"Forty Things I Needed the Most\\" are worth photocopying and keeping with your Living Will so that loved ones will know how to help your recovery should you ever experience a stroke. Kindle readers should know that all the diagrams of the brain that are found in the print book are included in the electronic book as well.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|[[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray]]]  Much better quality than the original.  Bought it as a gift, and recipient was very pleased with the restoration of the movie and enjoyed all the extras included with the trilogy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My brother had been wanting this movie for a year.  The Amazon price was about half what Walmart was asking.  It was received in time for Christmas as promised. My brother was very pleased and surprised.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The best series I have ever seen. I'm a WWII buff and this series is the first thing I think about when I speak of WWII Combat films or entertainment. It was the first Blu-ray I felt fulfilled when I purchased it.
B001NAZPYM|4.0|I too love this album.  I can't say much more about this album that already hasn't been said. It is great, filled with some of the best songs of the era.  My only complaint is that it is not the reissue CD that contained a few extra songs. That's my reason for 4 stars. Too bad, I would have bought it to replace the original 1984 CD release.  But, if you don't have 'Who's Next', I strongly recommend it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Great celtic music and beautifull looking Celtic women. Nice way to spend time watching a magnificent concert. I recommended 100%
0783240287|4.0|We purchased this because my oldest daughter was wanting to try out for a local production of this musical and wanted to familiarize herself with the music.  We really like the music in it and Donny Osmond was great as Joseph. There were times that it seemed to drag a little, but once it picked up it was engaging.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder takes an absurd, behind the scenes look at a blockbuster Hollywood production while satirizing the war film genre. From tongue in cheek jabs at great war flicks like Platoon and Apocolypse Now, to prima donna actors, to Tinsel Town power brokers (Tom Cruise's best performance of late), nothing is sacred. Stiller's humor is over the top and razor sharp, Jack Black does what he does best, fart jokes and physical comedy, and Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />The special features include the standard behind the scenes featurettes and deleted/extended scenes, but hidden among them are two gems. Rain of Madness does for \\"Making of\\" documentaries what Tropic Thunder does for Hollywood blockbusters.  Also included is the sketch from the 2008 MTV music awards showing Stiller, Downey, and Black trying to come up with a viral marketing video. The clip had me laughing as much or more than the feature did.<br /><br />If you are into satire and silliness, Tropic Thunder is a solid fun movie.
0684833395|5.0|This book runs through the gamut of emotions in a single chapter. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional rollercoaster. It's a difficult read in the beginning as the chapters are like the corner pieces of the puzzle, they seem random and disconnected. Eventually you're given the pieces that tie the whole puzzle together and it's a beautiful sight to behold. It's a war story, but it's also a commentary on bureaucracy and the social condition. For me, it sums up my views on life in a way I could never express. Heller just gets it.
B00003CXAA|1.0|one of the dvds was damaged and not playable.  product needs to be returned.
1423113497|5.0|Great seriese for teens and adults. My daughter bought book 2 for me on my birthday, so I had to go get book 1. Before I started reading it I thought the series would be cheesy and just for kids, but I needed to humor my daughter and read the book because she bought it for me. Once I started reading, I found the books to be fun. I actually really enjoyed reading them and went and got book 3. Now Im looking forward to adding book 4 & 5 to my collection and excited for my daughter to start reading the books herself!
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Let's just get this over with.  If you like meaningless films where goofiness reigns supreme, JUMPER is your nirvana.  A young man named David (a bewildered-looking Hayden Christensen) discovers he has the ability to \\"jump\\" (teleport) from one location to another--anywhere in the world.  So what does he do?  Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.<br /><br />Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .<br /><br />But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are \\"evil.\\"  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.<br /><br />Oh, and the electric \\"ropes\\" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.<br /><br />Between this flick and [[ASIN:B000JBXHQY Snakes On A Plane]] ol' Sam has really been freaking out.  And the gorgeous Diane Lane is totally and utterly wasted in her brief appearances.  Yet I give this stinker three stars because director Doug Liman furnishes eye-opening vistas, visuals, and special effects to demonstrate at least someone brought some imagination to the set.  Yet JUMPER doesn't show that teleporting is unique.  Heck, my doctor, lawyer, and accountant do it every time I really need them.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I really liked this watch because of its old time kinda look. I bought it for on duty work. I am a deputy in Florida, so we wear green uniforms. Everything works great about the watch, it keeps great time. I feel like I am wearing a rolex sometimes because of the constant motion of the second hand. The watch is on the small side, so if you are a big guy I would not recommend it for you. My dad bought me a Seiko, which I still have, when I was a teenage. I will always wear Seiko, they are great watches.    The only bad part that I have found about the watch is the band. To be frank, it sucks. It is just too thin for a mens watch. The watch just doesn't sit well on your wrist with the band. I stoppped wearing it to work and bought a Casio G-Shock [[ASIN:B000AR7S3A Casio Men's G-Shock Classic Ana-Digi Watch #G100-1BV]] for work. Recently I was walking through walmart and decided to look at watch bands. I found a Timex universal brown velcro band. It was 9 bucks and gave this watch a new life. This is now going to be my new kicking around watch, and might wear it to work every so often. The only drawback is the Timex markings on the band, but i really don't care. It doesn't take anything away from the looks of the watch. It is very very comfortable now.  [...]

B000KJT8IG|4.0|I love the movie and it looks great, but some films just don't do Blu Ray justice.  Still, love the product.
B001F290E4|5.0|Not sure why so many naysayers for this CD, but I love it.  While playing it at work, my boss heard it and now he's going to buy the CD.  Guess different opinions make the world go 'round and I'm sticking with mine.
B000063S31|4.0|The product is fine but it took forever to get it. I ordered it on Dec 10th and did not receive it until Jan 8th. I know that we had Christmas in there but 4 weeks delivery is way too long!
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I gave it three stars for technical reasons, not subject matter.  The production is very well done and should be seen by all.  I first saw this on a rental and the dvd would halt the action in spurts and would sometimes take up to a minute to restart itself. At times it would take 3 to 5 minutes just to get through a short phrase. I chalked thia up to the dvd being a rental.    However, the discs I purchased through you are doing the same thing.  It is not my dvd player becasue other dvds play normally.  I would have returned them but by the time I first watched it, it was past the 30 day time limit.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is like a mix between chess and tetris. Anticipating your opponents moves, while trying to fit your pieces together to maximize your coverage of the board. The rules on how the pieces can be placed, and how they need to be placed to keep your opponent blocked, keep you thinking. I would give this game 5 stars for fun, but the frustration of losing makes it only tolerable for 5 or 6 games in a row before I need a break.
1400063515|2.0|The ideas are interesting and relevant.  Unfortunately,  the author can't get over his own ego, this makes it  an annoying book to read, where it could have been  a real pleasure.

B001EIOOVS|4.0|This is an excellent movie and the acting is fantastic. I would have given it five stars but the nudity is over the top and adds nothing to this film.
0956010903|5.0|The product was well in shape and delivered in a very short time, so I am very happy to give my son his present on time.
B0007TKNII|3.0|On the whole , a very intertaining movie. Not as scarey as the original or as musical as the one on Broadway, but certainly worth the watch on a long Winter afternoon.
0679805273|5.0|I love the book! It's inspirational and motivational in a sweet (not cheesy) and simple way. It's a great gift for students who are finishing high school or a program.
B001EN71CW|4.0|This movie is very enjoyable for the sci-fi genre. Even if you did'nt watch the television show (albeit short lived) the movie is fun. The characters are querky and somewhat complex.  The Blu-ray version is a must have if you have a Bluray DVD player.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|This is the first of three movies on the Resident Evil series.  Resident Evil is a great movie about a virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies, once you get bitten you get the virus.  This is one of the best Zombie movies out there, if you love Zombie movies you will love this move, great cast of actors also.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|\\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is in my mind, near perfect. It delivers everything that a good film should (comedy, tragedy, action and great songs) and more importantly in knows when to end.    At just around 45 minutes, it easily could have been padded out and \\"whored up\\" to make a feature, but director and co-creater Joss Whedon knew that Dr Horrible was just what it needed to be. A great entertaning (something that's hard to achive in Hollywood lately)film with the twist of the \\"Bad Guy\\" being the hero and the \\"Good Guy\\" being the villan.    Yes, I will admit that I was one of those people waiting at their computer at midnight as the new Act's were being released, something I've never done before. Mr. Whedon and company should be congratulated for creating this masterpiece that brought the filmmaker and audience together for this brief moment in time.    And to add, as I wrap this up, any film that shows the Producers and Studio's out in L.A. that money and success can be found without their \\"help\\" deserves all the support we can give.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|I've always loved First Blood since i was a kid, awesome story, but the VHS was so poopy and the DVD looked the same. I couldn't believe how good the Blu-Ray is; it looks like a movie... you can see all their faces and you really get pulled into it again.
B00005JL2O|5.0|another great austin powers movie. if you liked the first two then youll love this one. the new characters are great.
0061537934|5.0|Just like an a majority of the other reviewers, I think this is a great book. If you've ever connected with a dog, you'll certainly love this book. This book would make an awesome movie.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Okay, they don't sound the same way they used to.  Great musicians improve and evolve.  Okay, \\"Sex on Fire\\" is their biggest hit ever.  That doesn't make them a sell-out.  I only wish other bands would start out as strong as the Kings did, and then improve as much as they have to this effort.  I was struck dumb by the quality of their music the first time I listened to this album, and I've liked it little bit more every time I listen to it.  Yes, it's that good.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|said it would not get in tell jan. 6 but got it 10 day after order, very nice
1600243916|5.0|I couldn't stop listening to Malcolm Gladwell (Canadian) in his listenable narrative \\"Outliers\\".  His examination of real human nature is superb and with the only detectable mistake in describing a glidslope as a glidSCOPE, I'd say he very well.  I am passing this audiobook on to as many people as I have friends.  I hope all policy makers listen to this book.
0823003590|5.0|I finished reading this book and was very impressed with the candidness and knowledge of the author.<br /><br />When I finished the chapter on the head, at first I was a little disappointed because it did not go into any great detail. But at the end of that chapter he explained why. His whole philosophy is to not get caught up in the standard way of drawing. Many of us look for that \\"cookie cutter\\" type of tutorial lessons. His thing is use your eyes to draw. If you draw from memory (i.e standard egg shaped head) all the time you will fall victim of the type of art where every one of your characters shares a resemblance. His thing is to draw very light the gesture of the persons face and head and run through the rest of his steps outlined in the book.<br /><br />I like how the book is written because it puts you in the mind frame of getting personal tips from an established artist. The style of chiaroscuro and sfumato is stressed in his book and I personally think those are the techniques that really gets the compliments from viewers. You will amaze people with your work just studying and applying those two techniques.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Ratatouille is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie.  It does engage in French stereotypes (I have lived there) but the proof of it's entertainment value is how highly it was accepted in France.  It's a simple story, but one that is fun to watch unfold.    Thank you
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this CD, there is a great mix of different songs by different artists and they are all good.  I listen to this CD all the time, money well spent.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is truly a terrific show, it has absolutely everything I could wish for in a TV series. At no point is there a lack of drama and suspense or even comedy, it's simply a perfect mix of all of the above, from beginning to end of the first season.  What some have mentioned already is the camera work. There is a subtlety to it that makes it an immense pleasure to just watch the screen as it sucks you right into the story, and once you're in there, you'll be drooling over more of it. It's truly addictive!    And of course not to mention the brilliant performance of Bryan Cranston. But also the rest of the cast is very, very good and without a doubt worth mentioning.    Some minor pacing issues aside, this is great television and one of the best currently running.
B000V9KFM8|3.0|The first forty times I listened to it, \\"Magic\\" sounded pretty damn good.  Then Obama was inaugurated and, ironically enough, it all came crashing down--like seeing a magician put a rabbit in his hat and then pull it back out.  The album sounds great: the Boss is rocking harder than he's rocked since, I don't know, \\"[[ASIN:B0000025UW Born in the U.S.A.]],\\" and he hasn't been this pissed since \\"[[ASIN:B0000025D0 Darkness on the Edge of Town]].\\"  But while he doesn't forsake music for lyrics like he did with some of his Nineties work, these songs are all about Bruce's political message; if you disagree with it, the songs aren't worth much, and once we've moved out of the Dubya era, they probably won't be worth too much either.  There are two rock-hard gems, though: \\"Livin' in the Future,\\" which could've been on a classic Boss album, and \\"Gypsy Biker,\\" probably the most poignant and pointed song recorded about the Iraq War.  Other would-be gems: \\"Devil's Arcade,\\" a beautiful memory filtered through a nauseating nightmare, \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" a blast more for its sound than its subject, and \\"Last to Die,\\" which is almost excellent but is weighed down by the fact that it's, well, a piece of propaganda.  The same applies to the album.
0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri does another great job of portraying well-developed characters in interesting situations in a wonderful compilation of short stories. She highlights well the Indian culture without making an overwhelming presence.
B000069HKH|4.0|Having almost disappeared through three lackluster albums in the 1990s, Springsteen got back on track in 2002 to hold together and inspire post-9/11 America.  He showed more resolve on \\"The Rising\\" than he'd shown in years; the fact that the music is inseperable from the September 11th attacks isn't detrimental at all, instead ensuring that this remains one of Springsteen's most interesting records.  Songs like \\"Lonesome Day\\" and the brilliantly uplifting \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" are just what the doctor--or, in this case, the Boss--ordered.  If \\"Worlds Apart\\" overdoes itself, \\"Empty Sky\\" is remarkably powerful (\\"I woke up this morning to an empty sky\\"), and the wandering depression of \\"Nothing Man\\" and the insecurity of \\"You're Missing\\" are spot-on.  Most telling is \\"Mary's Place,\\" which could've been on \\"Born to Run,\\" only here Springsteen wonders, \\"Tell me, how do we get this thing started?\\"  And if the happy-go-lucky bomp of \\"Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)\\" doesn't convince you that Springsteen's as hip as ever, its \\"doo doo do do\\"-ing should: anyone who can release as much stellar material as Springsteen and still sound like they have something to say while \\"doo doo do do\\"-ing at his age is truly gifted.
0670020745|5.0|Amazing, wonderful!!!  Deep understanding of living peacefully, joyfully in the moment.  Clear, easy teachings on the brain and brain science behind our different ways of perceiving reality.  Also a  very moving description of a woman's experience of having a stroke and her journey through to an even more full and joyfull life!!!  Moved me on a very deep level....very Insightful!!!
B001ECQ6YW|4.0|We gave this to our son for Christmas.  He loved it.  We watched it with him, too and enjoyed it a lot.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|This is an awesome DVD.  I am a John Mayer fan and was very very happy with the DVD.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I really like Indiana Jones but this was too much. I started to watch it 5 times and still can't get through it. it is terrible. What can I say. No real plot, No great acting. It's just awful.
0545128285|2.0|I was surprised and disappointed by this collection of tales, if you can call five 10-page stories a collection at all.  The stories themselves were trite and simplistic, revealing little if anything about Potter's universe.  Each lacked the depth and skilled narration I have come to expect from the Potter series.  Commentary from Dumbledore, a beloved character from the Potter series, gave historical context and opinion.  Above all this commentary was weak.  J. K. Rowling has built Dumbledore up to be the greatest and perhaps most intelligent individual of his time, so I expected more than brief, unimpressive, and at times childish notes.  This was a weak effort by Rowling, one she clearly spent little time on.  It's a pity, because so much could have been done with this concept. If proceeds hadn't gone to a worthwhile charity, I would feel cheated indeed.
B0002HZHXG|3.0|Purchased this to use with the Bruder garbage truck.  The garbage truck is still going strong, but the sound and light module has stopped working without much use.
B000002IZM|5.0|Much has been said, most all of it completely positive, about this outstanding CD. It is best to think of this CD as a Vangelis CD with a Blade Runner theme for he has taken the music and added a few additional selections to create a smooth seamless selection of works from the original soundtrack that will evoke memories of the outstanding film as well as serve as a stand alone work of musical mastery.
B001IA46D8|2.0|After the dissolution of TT, back in 1996, Barlow said : \\"I was always the least popular member of the band\\". Being the songwriter, having a good voice and a classical good american look I wondered why.   Circus will give you the reason why. Having hired John Shanks (they must have paid him a fortune), they are hopping to lift up Barlow's songs from mediocre to excellent. And that is a very good idea. Shank's a real genius when it comes to perfectly balance a pop song and craft it flawlessly with the help of his art of guitar playing (one of many talents). With his arrangements everything he touches becomes pop gold (\\"Fly\\" sung by Hillary Duff being the best example of it (he won a Grammy for that one)). Of course, all that genius means nothing if someone else messes up with it, this for example by adding to much vocals. And that is exactly what happens here. So don't look for too much John Shanks in this circus. No matter how hard you will try, even the guitar solos are covered with Barlow's voice (please give us a break!).   If you recognize a talent bigger than yours and your only interest are the music and the fans, why not share the diva space? If the music is better than the voice, why choose the voice? Why stop half way? TT did not go half way on \\"beautiful world\\", they probably knew what they were worth. But on this one, they probably though they are the reason why people still listen to their songs. Big mistake! Narcissism (Barlow's ultimate sin, I finally got you there) won't pay! And don't tell me he did it because the world is in need of another Barlow song!   Conclusion: This album left a bitter taste in my mouth. I expected real talent but instead found out that it's just good ol' Barlow who's back.
B001E75QGG|1.0|I can NOT believe Goerge Lucas and Steven Spielberg together can make such a bad movie.  It is a shame for both of them and for the Indiana Jones series.  Contained in the Extras, Goerge Lucas said during the production interview that they intended the movie to be old style \\"B Class\\" alien/flying saucer type of movie.  I guess they succeeded in flying color.  What a disappointment!
B000002VCU|5.0|In 1980, the Alan Parsons Project released \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card,\\" a theme album based on gambling, but easily relevant for any addiction or relational issues. The orchestration, the melodies, the lyrics, and the production are all fantastic. This is one of APP's masterpieces, and sets the bar so high that even other APP albums are sometimes difficult to compare to this one.<br /><br />The opening tracks \\"May Be a Price to Pay,\\" \\"Games People Play,\\" and \\"Time\\" are simply phenomenal songs. I discovered the Alan Parsons Project in 1994 and 1995 at a time in my life when I needed to make some changes. This album, especially the song \\"Games People Play,\\" was instrumental in that process.<br /><br />Picture yourself in a dreary situation that you have let slowly engulf you, and you wake up one morning and hear the line \\"I don't wanna live here no more / I don't wanna stay / Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life / Quietly fading away.\\" I know everyone doesn't need a song to tell them what to do, but what if you don't even realize that those feelings are there until you hear someone sing it? Absolutely brilliant song, especially in that context and at that particular time in my life.<br /><br />If you read my other reviews of APP material, you will see that I had similar reactions to many of their albums. The Alan Parsons Project is an incredible band whose music has made a lasting impression on me. It is deep, thoughtful, and simply beautiful, and I owe many thanks to Alan Parsons, Eric Woolfson, Ian Bairnson, and company for their catalog of brilliant material. Thank you, guys.
B001KW0C96|3.0|Better than I had expected.  De Niro and Pacino made this a better movie.
B0012GMWJS|5.0|Eve was the fourth album by The Alan Parsons Project and was released in 1979. This record gets it's share of mediocre reviews from AP fans, mostly due to comparing it to works like \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" and \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card.\\" However, this album easily holds it's own in the pantheon of APP albums. It reflects the feelings of a man who, for whatever reasons, is just tired of dealing with women. It's really that simple, and I cannot imagine any man not stirred up by this album at some point in life.<br /><br />It also flows through the emotional roller coaster (of dealing with a bad relationship) perfectly. It begins with the driving force of \\"Lucifer,\\" then takes you right into the sharp and pointed feelings of \\"You Lie Down with Dogs\\" and \\"I'd Rather be a Man.\\" The lyrics here are not politically correct by today's standards, but neither are they offensive. They simply and appropriately express a guy's feelings, and they are superb.<br /><br />The absolute zenith of the album are \\"Winding Me Up\\" and \\"Damned if I Do.\\" Listen to these in the right frame of mind, and they are mind blowing and unforgettable. This album, along with many others in the APP catalog, were life-changing for me when I discovered all of them in 1994 and 1995.<br /><br />If you have ever been angry with or hurt by a woman, or simply allowed yourself to be used by a woman for much, much too long, and all the head games that go along with that, give this album a try. I recommend repeated listening at a volume level higher than that of the average conversation.<br /><br />My review is for the original \\"Eve\\" album with 9 songs, not the one with the bonus material.
0525951113|5.0|You don't have to be a computer geek to enjoy this book--but it certainly helps if you're familiar with some of the jargon.  So if you know some of the terms such as (you can find them on Wikipedia) SNMP, VOIP, IP, DNS, DHCP,TCP,  etc, it will help.  Knowing a bit about worms, trojans, viruses, bots, distributed systems, and ports also helps.  I teach computer science at a large state university, but I'm too old to be a geek.  The first thing to know is what a \\"daemon\\" (not \\"demon\\") is.  To be confusing, the term tends to be associated with UNIX/LINUX, whereas Microsoft Windows likes the term TSR (terminate and Stay Resident).  The classic daemon is a background process that basically hibernates and waits to be called.  SMPT (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), for example, is linked to TCP port 25, FTP (File Transfer Protocol)is linked to TCP ports 20 and 21, SSH to port 22, etc.  On your PC, you can download TCPView, which tracks Internet connections, and control-alt-delete will show you active processes/daemons/etc.    The book starts with the death of a brilliant (220 IQ) young gaming software tycoon from brain cancer.  Matthew Sobol has left quite a legacy:  hibernating daemons on huge numbers of computers throughout the world.  Some of these are doing things like scanning cnn.com for news of Sobol's death, and when they find this news, they fully wake up and trigger series of actions--such as waking hidden daemons on other computers.  Sobol was also the master at creating MMORPGs--massively multiplayer online roleplaying games, and his games feature some of the most sophisticated AI (artificial intelligence) ever.  So Sobol has left behind powerful AI tools.  There are ways to kill people, generate computer phone messages (VOIP), take over companies, and more.  This isn't science fiction:  there have been viruses, for example, that were quiescent until a certain date--such as Valentine's Day, when they could trash your hard drive.  The level of sophistication is,thankfully, way beyond what most people might be capable of.    The story centers on a number of people after Sobol's death:  Peter Sebeck, a California detective, Jon Ross, an enigmatic software specialist, Dr Natalie Philips with NSA, and \\"bad\\" guys recruited by Sobol's AI after his death.  The FBI, CIA, NSA, DoD, and other government agencies get involved. You'll get tours of MMORPGs, hacking, backdoors, distributed systems, denial-of-service attacks:  there's a lot here.  The writing is solid, it's not a cyberpunk book for geeks, and it's fast-paced.  And, by and large, feasible--that's perhaps the scariest part.  Thoroughly entertaining!
B001BPJJ9G|3.0|The storyline was ok, but the film itself was breath takingly beautiful. The colors and locations were worth watching. I only wish the storyline had been better. Its hard to pin point what I didn't like. Overall though, it was worth watching.
B000002J1S|5.0|Throughout my years as a fan of rock n roll music, very rarely does listening to an album have such a profound impact on me that I can say I remember when I listened to it for the 1st time, and recall what I was doing at the time.     Yup, \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" is added to that list of around a handful of albums that mostly consist of 1970's era music strangely considering I wasn't even alive back then to witness when those sounds were considered modern.    Don't be fooled by any other concept albums bigger sales, critical acclaim,or more time spent on the charts this is the most seamless story I have ever heard and read in album form to the point where songs become chapters and the album a novel and that line blurs very well, granted you will have to take the time to read the story wrote by Peter Gabriel to truly get a better idea of what is happening, and read the lyrics because at times I can't even tell what he is saying.    I don't have any complaints other than I don't think this record is for everybody, I actually think its genius behind it is going to fly over the heads of people who don't even know Genesis used to have a singer other than Phill Collins and that they used to be progressive instead of pop, and I could keep going with this but I won't, just don't expect to listen to this album for hit songs cause one of the reasons this album is so great is because I don't even think they cared if any songs sounded like hits, this wasn't about making a hit song it was about making an album from begining to end.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|I love this series!  I read a lot of vampire books, but finding a good vampire movie was extremely hard.  I've watched maybe two dozen and they all sucked.  This one and the sequel were exactly what I've been looking for--fast, weirdly believable, dark, and with a touch of romance.  highly recommended.
B0000062GE|5.0|Darkest Days by Stabbing Westward is one of the records I really enjoy and have since the 7th grade. Darkest Days was the record me and my buddy used to listen to when mom and dad werent with us at school on our sony walkmens (remember those days!). This record is sonically and lyrically great. This album is very depressing and dark to say the least. It is one of the darkest albums I have ever heard or own. However, this is SW at their pinnacle. It gets no better than this. I have many copies of this record and still buy more of them when I loan someone a copy or give one away. Rest assured, this is one album I always have a copy of. One of my all time favorite records!

0316067601|2.0|The first half of this book 'drags' on.  The difficulty in becoming 'special forces' in our country is in fact very very hard. No doubt about it. But I felt the author was shoving it down the readers throats over and over.  The second half tells a compelling and chilling story about fighting our enemies and the brave efforts and sacrifices of some great Americans who paid the ultimate price for us.  God Bless them and their families.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|Unfortunately I was not aware that there were \\"HD\\" DVDs that do not play in regular DVD players.  I purchased the Planet Earth Series for my grandson who ABSOLUTELY LOVES Planet Earth.  My daughter called me after Christmas to tell me that none of the 4 DVDs will play in their DVD Player.  They just get a continual message that the DVD is \\"loading\\".  I contacted the seller only to be told that if they don't have an \\"HD\\" DVD player they may not play.  He went on to inform me that if I return the DVDs and they play in HIS \\"HD\\" DVD player I cannot be issued a refund.    I suppose I am responsible since his information DID state \\"HD\\" DVD, but I think the seller should have explained the difference in his information and specified the part about the HD\\" DVD player being required to play the DVDs.    I have since ordered a regular DVD set, and it may even be from this same seller.      I wonder if anyone else has ever encountered this situation.
B00076NYFU|5.0|I remember reading about Quo in CREEM magazine back in the 70's.  Oh yeah, I knew all about them as a band, huge in England/Europe, but basically ignored in the U.S.  When you mention Status Quo to most Americans, the only thing that pops up is: Pictures of Matchstick Men\\".<br /><br />Having read above such article in CREEM, I purchased \\"HELLO\\" on vinyl.  I cranked up my old Pioneer receiver and was blown away...not a bad song on the entire disc.  I kept buying their albums, and now replacing all w/the CD format.  Killer, party Rock N' Roll.  It's no wonder they have always been England's biggest band, outselling Zep 10 to 1...start here, then maybe Piledrive and Quo, but buy all their stuff; and RAWK OUT!
1595141715|5.0|I love this book. I bought it yesterday and finished it that same day.  Now this was the first book I've bought that was heavy (deep, I mean, like a tough subject, like suicide). So I wasn't sure if I should buy it at first, but I am so glad I did. (Oh, and I'm a freshman in highschool)    The layout is intriguing, so it gets you hooked from the very start (so it doesn't have a boring beginning like many other books I have read).     If you are skeptical of reading this book, please don't be. The beginning my turn you off a little, but I assure you this book isn't creepy, its very blunt though. So true, it speaks what everyone is thinking, and that's what makes it such a great read.    Once you finish this book, it doesn't end there. I kept thinking about it the whole night. It definately keeps you thinking.    Buy this book today, you won't regret it!

0316017922|3.0|This book has provided me with a couple of insights that I will take into account guiding my children. Eg. it's been an insteresting point that parents' support and positive attitude is a crucial factor in helping the children to attain success (though it does not seem really novel). I do not take the \\"principle of 10,000 hours\\" literally, but I think that indeed to attain real fluency in any area one needs a lot of effort (even geniuses do).     I agree however with one of the reviewers that a couple of ideas that Gladwell presents are not a \\"breakthrough\\". Also, the book seems a bit patchy and not always fully substantiated.

B000EQHHJW|3.0|I purchased this Rigoletto because most of the Amazon reviewers liked it. While I watched it, I was aware of the fine singing, but I was also aware that I was not getting involved. The reason was because, to me, the director, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's, hand was obvious. All the action was noticeably staged, giving the performance an air of artificiality. Why he had Rigoletto suspended in midair while moaning the abduction of his daughter, Gilda, to close the second act was jarringly ridiculous. The 3 stars are for the excellent singing
B00127RAJY|5.0|Don't be fooled by anyone who claims these workouts are \\"20\\" minutes. I timed them and they are all 30 minutes. I tried the first workout after walking on my treadmill for 90 minutes and it was fairly easy. I did modify the jumping jacks because who wants to ruin their knees? Also, just when you think you are done with an exercise, it gets repeated so that makes it a bit more challenging. The exercises in the first workout include: arm crosses, windmills, jumping jacks, hip circles, push ups, squat with weights, more pushups, squat and press, jumping jacks, jumping rope, jumping jacks, crunches, reverse crunches, bicep curls with lunge, running on the spot, boxing, running, side crunches, chest flys, side lunges, jumping jacks, running on the spot, boxing, jumping rope, bicycle crunches and cooldown stretches.

B000000OMB|3.0|By the time this album was released (1982), the classic progressive rock style had completely morphed into the American stadium rock and English symphonic pop styles, so when the formation of this supergroup was announced I was pretty excited - classic prog would reign again.  Unfortunately, while the Roger Dean cover was very cool, the reception to the music was mixed as I recall - some people loved it, some hated it, and I found myself in-between.  Indeed, I was not completely bowled over - \\"Steve Howe is here, but this is not Yes\\" - I thought at the time.  There is however, something immediately attractive about the sophisticated technique of the players and the rich vocal harmonies.  After listening to this album again after such a long time, I realize that the debut really is not bad at all.<br /><br />The lineup includes members of Yes (Steve Howe - electric and acoustic guitars, vocals; Geoff Downes - keyboards, synthesizers, vocals), U.K./King Crimson (John Wetton - bass guitar and lead vocals); and ELP (Carl Palmer - drums and percussion).  While they are all first chair players, Steve Howe really needs to be singled out.  His playing is exceptional throughout and he apparently did not let the fact that he was in a pop group water down his approach.  John Wetton uses the slightly distorted tone on his bass that characterized his work with King Crimson and his vocals are OK, although he does strain to hit the high notes on occasion.  The vocal harmonies however, are stunning. Carl Palmer does an excellent job and demonstrates once again why he is one of the finest progressive rock drummers.<br /><br />The tunes on the album are pretty short (3-6 minute range) but are very exciting and feature top notch musicianship - my favorite tracks include Time Again and Here Comes the Feeling.  Unfortunately, the songs sound somewhat similar to one another (energetic prog/pop) which is a consequence of a lack of dynamic contrast and similarity with respect to instrumentation.  Although there is a nice piano break on one piece and atmospheric synthesizer parts here and there, they are the exception and not the rule.  After all, these guys wanted radio airplay and you could not get that with sharp acoustic/electric contrasts and a marimba solo.  Speaking of which, I think it says something about the time when members of progressive rock acts could get together, put out an album, and do so very well.<br /><br />On a side note, Asia fans may be interested in the fact that John Wetton recorded an early version of Here Comes the Feeling with members of the French prog act Atoll in 1979 (the track is featured on the Musea re-issue of the Atoll album \\"Rock Puzzle\\").  Although there were plans to form a group, Wetton eventually went on to form Asia without them.<br /><br />This version of the CD release is pretty skimpy and features OK sound quality.<br /><br />While some people may regard this as the final nail in the classic English progressive rock \\"coffin\\", I think it sounds a lot better than it did in 1982 and is a fine example of well written and performed prog/pop.  Indeed, this album has influenced at least a few of the neo-progressive rock acts currently active, so its legacy will live on.  If you liked this album, check out Danger Money (U.K., 1979) and especially Drama (Yes, 1980).h there is a nice piano break on one piece and atmospheric synthesizer parts here and there, they are the exception and not the rule.

B00007L4MJ|4.0|In the future a small elite group of people live in a Utopian world seemingly unaware that their city is being run by huge numbers of slaves who live underground. When a mad scientist develops a way of building robots who could replace the workers, one of the world's controllers kidnaps the workers' leader, Maria, a kindly woman who preaches peace, and replaces her with a robot Maria, who incites the workers to violent acts which will justify their murder.<br /><br />For a silent movie made in 1927, \\"Metropolis\\" is incredible. The plot is highly detailed (as detailed as a novel), and in the same vein as dystopian classics such as \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\". Anyone who liked either of these novels will certainly like \\"Metropolis\\". Although at times a bit slow moving, the film is nonetheless fascinating enough to hold your interest even through these scenes. For the time, the special effects are very impressive, and the film is not as severely plagued by over-acting as many other silent movies (such as \\"Nosferatu\\") are.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the aspects of the plot involving the robot Maria. Brigitte Helm who plays Maria is incredibly convincing in this dual role. She makes it believe that there exist two different people who look exactly the same - the robot and the human, although, Helm particularly excels when playing the robot. The character of robot Maria is so entertaining to watch and so different from anything I have ever seen that I am surprised that \\"Metropolis\\" has not been remade.<br /><br />If \\"Metropolis\\" were made today, I am certain that it would be a runaway success among science-fiction fans. As it is, there has been no remake, but don't let the fact that this is a silent movie put you off. There are good reasons why \\"Metropolis\\" is considered a classic and it should still be enjoyable for modern audiences.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|Watching this phenominal series is the closest a civillian could come to experiencing what it is really like in USMC Recon. Surprisingly accurate down to the language, attitudes and daily struggles, as well as the equipment and procedures, and was not made more pallatable to the inexperienced by dumbing-it-down as is done in most movies portraying this sort of subject matter. Brad Colbert was a good friend of mine in 3rd Recon in 96-98; we went through early recon training together. There is insight to be gained by watching this series that can be attained nowhere else in the film world.

0767020308|5.0|This edition of Emma was so true to the actual novel, and the acting was extremely well done. I honestly was hesitant in buying this at first. I am a big fan of Jane Austen and movie adaptions based on her novels. A while ago I rented the Hollywood version of this movie. I fell in love with it and decided to buy it. But then I found this version, and had a hard time choosing which one to get. I ultimately ended up choosing this one, but I eventually ordered the other one as well.    Each edition (Hollywood and A&E) are extremely entertaining. Although I would say that the A&E version is the one you should get if you're in the mood for a true Jane Austen adaption. The Hollywood version is much more of a comedy, and one that you would watch when you're in the mood for laughing.    The A&E version was very true to the novel. The acting was extremely well done, and very believeable. I would say that the best actors, and character potrayls in this version are Emma, Frank Churchill, Harriet, Miss Bates, Mr. Elton, Mrs. Elton, Mr. Woodhouse, John Knightley, and Mr. Weston. In the hollywood version Jane Fairfax, Isabella Knightley, and Mrs. Weston were better than the A&E actors. As to Gwyneth's potrayl of Emma she did very well, but Kate Beckinsale is so much better for the part, and she made a better emma. But both Mr. Knightley's were excellent in their role. I particularly prefer Mark Strong, but the other actor in the hollywood version is just as good.    So my suggestion is to buy both versions if you can. If you can't defineatly choose the A&E version. The only thing I didn't like in the A&E version that I liked better in the Hollywood version is the actors for Jane Fairfax, and Mrs. Weston. Kate Beckinsale was a beautiful choice for Emma.

My favorite track is \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\" and \\"Down In The Flood\\".  Vocalist Mike Mattison shows his powerful soulful voice on these tracks.  Mike also shows that he can also sing the slow songs.  I love his song \\"Days Is Almost Gone\\".  This song is very relaxing.  I also love the groovy beat of \\"Something To Make You Happy\\".  This song is a five minute party.  I love Susan Tedeschi's vocals on the track \\"Back Where I Started\\".  The acoustic guitar playing is good on this track.  \\"I Know\\" is a song about the need for human contact.  The musical arrangements on this track sound so good.  I love the music of the Derek Trucks band.

B001HZ9ABM|5.0|First off, the packaging...in a lovely, luxurious red velvet BOX, not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be...with the title gold embossed.  Open it up and the treasures flow out...first a round red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W cover, and Robin's buggish sunglasses...he looked downright alien-ish...a precurser to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!)...with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known...prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give \\"Odessa\\" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song...all versions.<br /><br />Now, the songs, oh man, THE SONGS!!!!  There are 3 CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there ever was one) release...CD1 is the 17-track album in stereo, CD2 is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CD3 is the REAL treat, the 23-track \\"Sketches For Odessa\\"...cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio.<br /><br />I won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album ever, a true masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album.  I don't know what is better, the stereo or the mono...they both sound great.  I love the songs on \\"Odessa\\", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3-part harmonies and excursions into alt-country/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes...it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece, yet each track coulda worked as a killer single (except the 3 instrumentals of course).  Faves are def \\"Melody Fair\\", \\"Marley Purt Drive\\", \\"Give Your Best\\", \\"Never Say Never Again\\" (ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), \\"I Laugh In Your Face\\", the awesomely cool Maurice-led \\"Suddenly\\"...on and on, one of THE great pop/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...<br /><br />Now, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, \\"Nobody's Someone\\" & \\"Pity\\"...those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!  They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer.  Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, \\"First Of May\\"...nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single...\\"Melody Fair\\" or \\"Marley Purt Drive\\" or the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks...<br /><br />NOW, with this GRAND 3CD reissue, people will realize what they truly missed, the treasures in store for them.<br /><br />So far, best reissue of 2009...nothing will top this.alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), \\"I Laugh In Your Face\\", the awesomely cool Maurice-led \\"Suddenly\\"...on and on, one of THE great pop/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...

1416562605|4.0|Aptly named, this book pounces upon its subject, the two Indias: one a land of \\"Darkness\\" where farmers and servants are not free, where corrupt politicians, police and capitalists feed upon the poor; the other a country of \\"Light\\" situated in bright, modern sections of cities and inhabited by people whose children enjoy entitlements that allow them to become the type of characters conjured-up in (wonderful) Jhumpa Lahiri stories. The entertainingly comic central character claws his way out of the cage, becoming a successful entrepreneur . . . by murder. This uneducated, brown Indian creature of the dark achieves enlightenment (as did the Buddha, who achieved enlightenment near the central character's birthplace) freeing himself from servitude and quoting a famous Muslim poet, whose birthday is a national holiday in Pakistan, \\"I was looking for the key for years, but the door was always open.\\" The morality of murder as means for obtaining a \\"Big Belly\\" in a corrupt society seriously must be contemplated, since the white tiger closes with the murderer handling an accident in a far more moral way than the person he murdered. Thus, Adiga provides a good-read much in the movie manner of Slumdog Millionaire, perhaps, with more emphasis on India's dark underbelly.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very captivating book that you will have trouble setting down.  It starts off many years in the future where North America is divided into thirteen districts and an oppressive capitol. Some time in the past the districts tried to rebel, but the capitol had suppressed them too well, and also ended up destroying the thirteenth district.  Now, after all the years the capitol's insurance against another rebellion has been the sick hunger games. In which two children from each district are chosen to go and fight to the death. Unexpectedly Katniss's sister is chosen so she goes in her place to fight it out to the death with twenty-three other contestants....some trained all their life for this moment.
0393327345|5.0|Violence?  Yep.  Crazy plot?  Check.  Great writing?  It's there.  Amazing book?  Yeah!  Go check it out!  This is Palahniuk at his most entertaining and thought-provoking.  I loved the movie, but the book is even better.
B001ER4CSO|2.0|Disappointing. The humor essential to Hellboy's survival in a world that treats him like a freak is totally missing. Without this and his love for family he would totally crack up and destroy the humans around him. The love affair has been cheapened by marriage that makes the love a \\"given\\" rather than a genuine feeling that takes place against all odds. What's left is just another film about monster chasing. Yawn. Worse yet, this film seems confused about its audience. The scene with Hellboy fighting a monster while holding the baby is just a rehash of Hellboy I scene of fighting a monster while holding the kittens. While the kitten scene was believable, the baby scene is not - wouldn't he just put the baby down somewhere? What audience does this kind of scene appeal to? If you're going to write a film about monster-chasing, at least come up with some original material. And preferably make it somewhat believable.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Two things will tip you off that this isn't Disney's Peter Pan: Hook's first scene, when he props his elbow up on the table...and he doesn't have a hand, and the extremely creepy mermaids that will \\"sweetly drown you if you get too close.\\"  I wasn't much of a Pan-fan before this movie. In fact, the Disney version was probably my least favorite of the animated classics.  We rented this one because we had recently viewed The Patriot and had one of those \\"who's the guy who plays the villain and what else has he done?\\" moments about Jason Isaacs.  Well, right after renting this I went out and bought it.  It is just a great movie all around.  The production values are top rate, terrific acting (in addition to the extremely entertaining Isaacs, who gives 150% in dual roles as dad and Hook, I enjoyed seeing the great Richard Briers as Smee).  I thought the script writer really caught the emotional content of the story, much more so than I would have expected.  The special features are just as interesting as the movie itself.  Highly recommended for anyone, it's not just a family film.
B000HT386M|5.0|This movie is very funny at first, then gets really emotional toward the end! Everybody did an awesome job! It has a great plot. Sandler plays Michael Newman, a good guy who deserves a break, but doesn't get one. His boss makes him work overtime and hardly has any time for his wife and kids. When he goes to a Bed, Bath, and Beyond, he meets Morty, and receives a universal remote that can control his life. He can stop time, go back in time, fast-forward into time, and much more. He breaks a rule, and the remote keeps taking him into the future where he is divorced, overweight, and sees that he become a corporate monster. Will he ever make things right again? I highly recommend CLICK!!!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Dr. Horrible's sing-a-long blog was great fun when it was first released on-line and the DVD is a great follow up.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|If you're thinking about investing two or three hundred dollars into a DVD set, it's a good idea to know the content is worth it before taking the plunge.  This is an excellent series with excellent writing, interesting stories and great character development.  The show and special features alone (including the bonus special feature disc exclusive to this set) are worth the price, which is a good thing because the special edition packaging is, in a word, crap.  Cheap packaging has become an unfortunate Paramount trademark, and this set is the latest in this rather pathetic tradition.  The discs are held securely enough, but the outer packaging, while amusingly ornate, arrived at my house already cracked and coming unglued.    Bottom line:  Paramount knows full well that the fans of this show are devoted enough to buy anything official, no matter how cheaply put together it may be.  They took full advantage with this set.  If you ike the series enough to want to own every episode, then this set is an excellent bargain and I highly recommend it.  If the content alone isn't worth the money to you, however, check out that Stargate SG1 set and sleep on it.

B00064WSN2|4.0|\\"In The Wake Of Poseidon\\" stands on it's own as a classic, especially considering that the original band lineup was fragmenting at the time of the recording. Yes, ITWOP does somewhat follow the same format as \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" including the song titling to a point, but that doesn't mean it's an exact \\"clone\\" of that album; not by a long shot. Upon repeated listens, you'll find a very different feel & vibe going down here, & I very much agree that it grows on you each time you hear it.<br /><br />\\"Pictures Of A City/42nd & Treadmill\\" has a Frank Zappa feel to it with new member Mel Collins' sax phrasings mirroring Robert Fripp's guitar work leading up to a heavy, distorted vocal section. From there, it morphs into fusion territory with complex start/stop tempos to keep it interesting. Next comes the gentle \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" that blends into the title track with more mournful Mellotron work going on.<br /><br />\\"Peace-A Theme\\" contains some of Fripp's most beautiful & intricate guitar work that fades out & picks up the pace again with the strange & jazzy \\"Cat Food\\". \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is essentially a reworking of Holst's \\"Mars\\", which was also done by Dave Edmunds' group Love Sculpture around this same time, just in a shortened version. Among the bonus tracks are the single version of \\"Cat Food\\" & its' B-side \\"Groon\\".<br /><br />The 24-bit remastering is excellent & brings out every nuance of the original recording with astounding clarity.  Give this album a listen, actually, repeated listens & you'll discover some fantastic music.
0374531269|4.0|Engaging autobiographical account of author's flight from Sierra Leone civil war, eventual conscription and particapation in war atrocities, and his post-war rehabilitation.  Story is powerful & shameful story of current chaos in Africa and the arming of children.  Though only 225 pages in length, this memoir spends too much time recounting/ analyzing author's post-war rehabilitation while his evasion from rebels and combat accounts are more interesting.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I followed the whole internet campaing about this movie. The wait was horrendous! I knew that Christopher Nolan would get this right once again, but even that wasn't enough.<br /><br />In 2006 we saw the first image of the new Joker. Then was time for Harvey Dent. My God. I trembled. It all seems like it was yesterday, and I feel like Heath Ledger is still alive.<br /><br />The whole cast shines here.<br /><br />Christian Bale was perfect in Batman Begins, and here he continues to impress. His Batman is what we all waited to see on the big screen: haunting! Scaring! Intimidating. Bale gives Batman the right feel, the right personality, he simply shines on this role. Every time he is Bruce Wayne he does the suave executive of Wayne Enterprises with a tragic and well known past. But when he becomes Batman, thugs, beware!! He does someone that knows no fear and no bounds to make justice. Also, he does that angry and gritty voice to show his anger and to intimidate his foes. Bale here is a hell of a star. As the movie goes on, he realizes that he will have to embrace his cowl for the rest of his days to make justice. It's very beautiful how, in the end, he decided to turn into the \\"bad guy\\" to save everyone and to save the image and reputation of that man who in that moment was the hero the city needs, and not what it deserves. He becomes a truly Dark Knight. Bravo!<br /><br />As for Ledger, his incarnation of the Joker is masterful! It won a well deserved Golden Globe and an Oscar. His Joker is haunting, scaring, funny in a dark sense. He intimidates even the worst hitman of the mob. Ledger's Joker have no past, no reason to do what he does, and that's that. He is just a force of evil, an agent of chaos, as he defines himself. And he brings hell, even to Batman, turning himself into Batman's distorted reflect in the mirror, or in his other side of the card, as it shows in the end of the movie, in the outstanding confrontation between both.<br /><br />As for the other cast, Aaron Eckhart is a very competent Harvey Dent and the perfect incarnation of Two-Face! Oldman is the perfect Gordon, and he shows that since Batman Begins. Maggie stands as the best version of Rachel Dawes. Cillian Murphy returns as the Scarecrow and continues to do his wonderful job he started in Begins.<br /><br />All in all, this is a truly masterpiece of crime, drama and tragedy. A dark masterpiece, inspired by the bonds of the very best noir and police productions of all time.<br /><br />So, forget about the fact that the DVD is very limited and watch it of what it have best: The Dark Knight!arvey Dent and the perfect incarnation of Two-Face! Oldman is the perfect Gordon, and he shows that since Batman Begins. Maggie stands as the best version of Rachel Dawes.

B001C08RHA|5.0|As a movie, Iron Man is one of the better superhero flicks to come out in recent years. If \\"The Dark Knight\\" hadn't come out the same year, it would have been unquestionably the best superhero movie in several years. Even then, it holds its own.<br /><br />Real-life troubled celebrity Robert Downey, Jr. plays fictional troubled celebrity Tony Stark, who through a personal trauma changes his ways and becomes a self-made hero. Like Batman, a lot of Iron Man's allure is that he has no superpowers; he is fully human, using tools that are available to him. The movie is similarly human, with drama, humor and a touch of the poignant.<br /><br />The DVD itself has the movie and just a few special features, like extra scenes. If you're buying the DVD for the movie, this is a great options, but if you like your special features spend a few dollars more and get one of the deluxe editions.
B000V6MQX2|5.0|If \\"[[ASIN:B00005MLU0 My Aim Is True (With Bonus Disc)]]\\" landed on the music scene like a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit, \\"This Year's Model\\" was the explosion that came after. Elvis' first album with the Attractions more than lived up to its predecessor, in that having a working band behind him matched the music to the blunt force of the songs.<br /><br />Once again, it is the stark voice of EC that opened the album as he ominously intones \\"I don't wannna kiss you, I don't wanna touch.\\" When the players kick in, it's a whole 'nother world from \\"My Aim Is True,\\" and for the first time, \\"new wave\\" had a front man. Before this album had been released, one of the central songs had made headlines. Elvis' broadside at narrow-format broadcasting, \\"Radio Radio,\\" was performed in such a bizarre fashion on Saturday Night Live that he was effectively banned from the show for almost a decade and made this (then) seventeen year-old a fan for life. That performance sealed a decision for me to get into radio and make artists like Elvis accessible to listeners. When I was fortunate enough to tell him this many years later, Elvis kindly autographed a ragged poster of \\"Armed Forces\\" \\"Don't blame me.\\"<br /><br />Personal nostalgia aside, fourth CD version \\"This Year's Model\\" contains all the songs that comprised the original US and UK versions and the original UK artwork. These are some of the songs by which EC is measured, like \\"Radio Radio,\\" \\"Pump it Up\\" and \\"The Beat.\\" The Attractions' playing was melody driven in addition to frenetic, a perfect compliment to Elvis' brilliant lyrics. And it was already becoming apparent that keyboardist Steve Nieve was becoming an architect of what American ears would identify as \\"punk rock.\\" The remainder of \\"This Year's Model\\" provides some hot songs that proved what this band of raving 20 somethings were capable in their rock and roll youth. This was the second of Elvis' \\"Angry Young Man\\" trilogy and it is a perfect moment.

0143038419|5.0|I haven't read a novel in about 5 years.  I'm definitely glad I got back into reading with this fabulous book!  I was very busy planning my wedding, so it took me almost a year to finish it.  But it was so great I had to buy a copy for my mom, mother-in-law, my sisters and all my friends for Christmas.  Some of them have already finished it!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|You need to go into this movie with the right expectations. It's not a \\"great\\" or an important movie. It's just a solid piece of fun, escapist, family entertainment. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed.    I saw this with my 11 year old granddaughter. There were a couple of moments it seemed to drag, but overall it was incredibly engaging. It was cute, a little scary at times, and kept you on your toes. When it was over we both looked at each other and said \\"already?!\\". This was the absolute best family movie I have seen in years and years and everyone except very small children should see it.    Be aware that it is incredibly unbelievable, but remember it's not trying to be. It's FUN! There will be some dialogue that's so silly it's funny. The characters are very watchable and likeable and you care what happens to them.     So - put the youngest ones (under 4) to bed, because the sea sequence will scare them out of their gourd. Grab everyone else, load up on snacks, and settle in!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie is the story of a single mother in 1920's Los Angeles who loses her little boy, and then when he is returned to her by the corrupt police department, she finds the boy they have brought to her is in fact not her son at all. Although she tries to tell the police the boy is not her son, but the police will have none of it. This movie tells about her fight to learn the truth about her son and to end police corruption in the city of Los Angeles. This movie is very dark, and at times very upsetting, but tells about the stark reality about what this woman really went through. Angelina Jolie is wonderful in this movie.

I happened to read the review of Hunger Games in People Magazine back in September and immediately knew my 14 year old would love it.  (She did!) My 17 year old overheard us discussing the book, started reading it, and hasnt been able to put it down.  When I say he hates to read, I mean he grudgingly reads books that are required in HS and absolutely not a word more.  He can not get enough of this book!  I highly recommend trying this one! I've never written a review before, but just wanted all Moms of non-readers to know, keep trying, you CAN find something that will engage even kids like ours!
B000TGCR38|4.0|This was a refreshingly unusual take on the War, at least from my American media-saturated perspective. Our media tends to focus on America's role in the conflict and largely ignores the dynamic struggles that took place between Nazi authorities and underground resistance movements throughout occupied Europe.<br /><br />Black Book tells the story of Rachel Stein, a Jewish woman who joins the resistance in Holland at the end of the war, as Allied forces are on the brink of liberating the country. Stein is given the task of seducing the head of the local branch of the gestapo, who turns out to be a fairly decent guy, and complications ensue. Further complexity is injected as each member of the gestapo comes to grip with the fact that Germany has lost the war and regime change is fast approaching. Double- and triple-agentry abounds, with satisfying results.<br /><br />The film also stands out in that it shows a diverse range of opinion within the ranks of the gestapo itself. The Nazis range from psychopathic to sympathetic, and some migrate from one extreme to the other over the course of the film. The members of the Dutch resistance are similarly flawed, which adds to the film's sense of authenticity.<br /><br />On the downside, Black Book does appear to have been made on a limited budget, with substandard film stock and nothing remarkable in the way of cinematography or special effects. The acting is a bit heavy-handed at times, particularly on the part of the main antagonist.<br /><br />That said, I would easily recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a fresh perspective on the War, particularly those who enjoy espionage and underground resistance plot devices. Viewers who are offended by nudity or subtitles should steer well clear.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This type of movie is very rare.  It features a love story between two robots.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'd never heard of Jillian Michaels before I found this DVD; I had just graduated from my university and was losing a free gym membership, so decided to invest in some work out DVDs and hand weights.  I wanted something that would involve strength training, since I had enjoyed a weight training class as a student. I saw that this incorporated strength, cardio and abs and had the added benefit of being 20 minutes long, although part of me doubted how effective it could be.    This workout rocks - Level 1 definitely had me working up a sweat, but it wasn't too long before I made it to level 2. Level 2 completely kicked my butt and it took me months before I made it to Level 3 (which I actually find less difficult than Level 2, so I now alternate between Levels 2 and 3, depending on which part of my body I want to work. I find level 2 better for strength training with my arms and legs, and level 3 is a much more intense cardio workout for me).      I'm usually somewhat unhappy with how I look, even though I used to work out every day at the gym for about an hour and do a lot of biking in the summer, but I've noticed a huge improvement since doing this DVD; my arms, calves and back are toned, my stomach, while still a little poochier than I like (I'm not following any strict diet plan, aside from trying to eat reasonably 80% of the time) has defined muscles, and my legs, while thick because of the biking, are very muscular.  Not only that, but I've noticed that my metabolism is much more resilient; the holidays don't affect me like they used to, and if I do slip up for a few days, usually just a few days of this workout is enough to get me back to \\"normal\\".    Plus, I just feel better, healthier and stronger.  I really appreciate the no-excuses, no-nonsense approach to this workout - it's up to you to make the most of the 20 minutes, something else I appreciate now that I'm working a full time job with a 1 hour commute. I also appreciate that none of the moves are particularly acrobatic, and there is enough variety in the circuits that I don't get too bored like I do in 1 hour workouts.

1904920209|5.0|I first came across Richard Bertinet last February when my wife bought me a place on his intro to breadmaking course in Bath. It seemed tooooooooo easy and it is, to the extent we make our own bread nearly every weekend. The book is easy to follow and well written by a man who is passionate about bread and breadmaking. If you get a chance buy the next one - \\"Crust\\" which is equally good and takes it that wee bit further, or of course you can just keep making the stuff you've found so tasty from dough.  I love the simple white recipe and the olive oil based ones but whatever you do buy the book read and you'll be making bread forever.
031606792X|2.0|The first three Twilight books are charming and create a fantasy world of forests, vampires, secrets, and of course a love that should not be. However Breaking Dawn came along and hacked that beautiful world apart in one long tedious and predictable novel.    There were some parts of this book that were okay, but just as you were enjoying them something stupid or predictable came along. You know exactly where she was going before she took you there, and just before she took you there you were begging her not to. Then when you arrived at that predictable place it was far worse than you could imagine.    This book is a shocking end to the Twilight Saga. I do not mean shocking in the way that \\"fans will be shocked by the outcome\\" but that it's such a deplorable novel it ruins the entire series. I honestly do not know what she was thinking. At least a third of the book could have been edited out to make a tighter and better read.    Breaking Dawn is also poorly written with words left out of sentences, so whoever proof read it should be shot, but what is more annoying is the way the information revealed is illogical and actually makes the the major story lines and fantasy legends in the previous books mute.    But the truth remains that Stephanie Meyer took the beautiful Twilight World that was magical and held so much charm and smashed it into a billion pieces of utter garbage by releasing this disastrous piece of literature. It's such a shame and I so wished I had liked it, I want to love it as much as I do the others, but as I try to convince myself that I did, honestly I was just utterly disappointed.

0061547840|4.0|As the title states, I got exactly what I expected out of this book.<br /><br />It's an extremely easy read, plenty of Trump patting himself on the back, and real-life examples of Trump succeeding in everyday life. The last two examples of what's included go hand in hand.<br /><br />Excellent commentary from Bill Zanker is included at the end of every chapter. Zanker is just one example of someone who applied Trump's idea of 'think big' to his everyday life, and has paid off in spades. His company (Learning Annex) is now worth many times more than what it was before Trump became a contact of his.<br /><br />The end of the book includes many more individuals similar to Zanker, who applied Trump's principles to life, as well as their businesses. This only attributes to Trump's invincible reputation in finance, as well as his unique ability to motivate people to reach for higher goals, and discover what they're truly capable of.

015206396X|4.0|Graceling is not a classic, but it did keep me up into the wee hours reading it the other night.  I couldn't sleep, and this book was an excellent companion.<br /><br />This novel can't compare to more involved \\"adult\\" fantasy (think Tolkien or Tad Williams) but it is entertaining and the characters interested me.  The premise of the \\"graces\\" (a magical skill that could take any form) is a good one, and I like that they have differently colored eyes that set them apart from the normals.  It made for an interesting dynamic and social drama throughout the book.  It seemed quite natural that the lead character is a woman, and that her grace is that she is an unmatched killing machine.  Here internal conflicts about her grace and how it made her relate to others was intriguing.<br /><br />The story and world it takes place is well thought out and solid.  If I had to quibble it would be that the characters never felt fully fleshed out and that we were only scratching the surface of what the world of the Seven Kingdoms, but I guess that is what sequels are for.  It kept me wanting more and in this case, that is a good thing.  I think this book will hit it's demographic of a teen audience squarely and they will really enjoy it.<br />At 37, I did too, though I did see some plot points coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Don't let the cheesy video promo at the top of Amazon's product page dissuade you.  Graceling is a solid fantasy novel and a rewarding read.  If your are new to fantasy and this leaves you wanting more, I suggest stepping up to Piers Anthony's body of work.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams     This series is a must see! HBO did a fantastic job of putting this together. What made this series so amazing is how it flowed so well and kept you on the edge of your seat after each and every episode. This has to been one of the best historical documentaries since the Civil War by Ken Burns in 1990. The appealing thing is that John Adams is in a spectacular narrative formative.  After watching the first episode you will be hooked! If you are a historian or simply love your country this is a great series to add to your collection. I would highly recommend this series if you are looking for a taste of history from 1735-1826. The acting is splendid and Paul Giamatti does a fantastic job portraying the raw and uncensored life of John Adams. Giamatti portrays the character like it were his own identity and all supporting actors and actresses will have you enveloped in this action pact melodrama. This series is creative, compelling, and down right educational. Don't think about it...buy it!

The real surprise was that our three year old really enjoyed it as well and wasn't scared of it.

B000RJO578|5.0|When Sgt. Angel arrives in sleepy Sanford, he is absolutely appalled - the very first night he rounds up \\"most the town, there\\" as underage drinkers, a drunk-driver and other petty behaviour occurs around him, and he tramps them all into jail.  Heralding his own arrival in this manner does not necessarily grant him an easy entrance into the camaraderie that the rest of the force share, especially \\"the Andies\\" (played by Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall), who constantly twit him and smart off to him and generally make his life miserable (and do those guys REALLY talk like that, or were they just making a silly voice for this movie?).  The drunk driver (Nick Frost), yclept Danny, turns out to be the son of the Inspector (Jim Broadbent), and, of course, Danny wants to be just like this \\"big city\\" policeman.  For Danny, watching buddy-cop movies is his passion and pass-time, so he has somewhat skewed perceptions of the reality of police work in the \\"big city.\\"<br /><br />However, shortly after Angel arrives, bodies start to show up.  It certainly appears they are accidental deaths, but Angel - being the suspicious sort - isn't very trusting, especially when it comes to that sort of thing - and begins to get suspicious.  His suspicions are especially aroused by the owner of the local supermarket (Tim Dalton), who is always wandering around making creepy small talk to people; for instance \\"Why, I bet if we took your head off, we'd find all kinds of interesting things inside ...\\"  He becomes even more suspicious as the \\"accidents\\" become more and more unlikely.  Finally, he discovers that things in the sleepy 'burg of Sanford are not at all as they seem ... but is it too late for him?<br /><br />An absolutely wonderful movie, lots of wonderfully dry British humour - the sort of thing you have to just sit back and goggle over, it's so wonderful.  The scene with the woman who owns the nursery is so wonderfully funny that I have to wonder how many takes it took to get it right, because she and/or Pegg had to have been cracking up every few sentences, with so many \\"God rest him/her/thems\\" scattered throughout it.  A fun game to play (no fair looking at IMDB to find the answers!) is \\"Spot the uncredited, hidden celebrity in the extras!\\"  Can YOU find Cate Blanchett?  Peter Jackson?  Steve Coogans?  Peter Wild?  Garth Jennings?  etc. ...<br /><br />So ... get this movie.  Watch it repeatedly until you can quote it at length in your sleep.  Love it like your child.

0060853972|3.0|Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch is a 1990 novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. I am a fan of both authors. The book is a comedy and a spoof of Antichrist/devil/end-of-the-world movies, particularly The Omen. Here, the Antichrist has been born into the world, the powers of Good and Evil are ushering in Armageddon, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are running amuck. An angel and a demon, who are friends and who like humanity, conspire to avert the end of the world.<br /><br />The writing style here isn't what most readers would expect from either Gaiman or Pratchett - it's looser, sillier, and doesn't take itself seriously at all. More than anything else, it's reminiscent of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The character of Death makes an appearance here in an iteration very similar to the Discworld Death, and the humorous footnotes (which are some of the most entertaining parts of the book) are here as well.<br /><br />Good Omens has an extraordinarily large cast of characters, many of which appear only tangentially to the story, and it may take readers half the book to sort out who's who, even with the list of dramatis personae at the beginning. This also means that few characters get spend large amounts of time \\"on screen\\", and so it's that much harder for the reader to develop any kind of real interest in them.<br /><br />While Good Omens is mostly amusing and thoroughly silly, it's just not that funny (they aren't the same thing at all). And the story isn't compelling on its own, in part because nothing is taken seriously, and in part because this antichrist/apocalypse theme has been done ad nauseum already. So a lot of it feels like we've been there, done that.<br /><br />This is not to say that the writing is not clever. It is. With Gaiman and Pratchett, you may be assured that it is clever. But cleverness on its own, without being grounded on any kind of hard foundation (like a real plot, or a few serious aspects of the world the authors have created), is built on sand, and doesn't get you very far. This is, for example, the biggest difference between Good Omens and most of Pratchett's excellent Discworld series.<br /><br />In Good Omens, heaven and hell are equally matched, and the forces of Good aren't all completely good just as the forces of Evil aren't all exceptionally evil. The point the authors make with all this is that humanity can be good and evil on its own, without divine influence. While that may sound objectionable, the book isn't interesting enough to make this worth fussing about to any great degree (also the reader notices from the beginning that the forces of good are all mostly jerks, throws out any connection these beings as portrayed may have to his own spiritual beliefs, and goes on with the story).<br /><br />Good Omens is, on the whole, reasonably amusing, but it's silly without being particularly funny, and it's ultimately a disappointment, especially to those of us who are fans of the authors.d the authors have created), is built on sand, and doesn't get you very far.

0688014291|1.0|This book is definitely simple, but definitely not profound, timeless OR classic.    This is a rather short book -- readable in a single sitting -- and yet it is still mostly fluff. It could easily be condensed to 1/3 of its original length or less without losing any meaning.    My biggest gripe with the book is the format: it is written as a fictional narrative, with a contrived storyline that reads like it was translated from some other language. I really can't stand this style of writing. Why introduce these characters at all in a non-fiction book? Especially if they aren't based on real-world events, aren't developed at all, and don't serve any allegorical purpose?    I, on the other hand, believe that the word is a very large and complex place. Real knowledge can be condensed down to some set of first principles, but over time you only gain understanding by understanding the subtle complexity that underlies everything inside and around us.    The principles in this book are valid -- but almost to the point of obviousness.     1) Set goals with your employees (to communicate expectations and set evaluation criteria).  2) Reward your employees when they do something right.  3) Reprimand your employees when they do something wrong.    Sure, this is a jumping off point for some extremely clueless managers, but it also glosses over a lot of subtle complexity involved in motivating people.    To my mind, one of the single most obvious things you can do to motivate people is to flip the question around: ask your employees what motivates *them*. This is going to be different for everybody. Money is an important motivator, but some people are also interested in job security; some employees want to be challenged; others want to work on something meaningful, and so on. You really need to understand these various sources of motivation in order to have any hope of keeping them productive.    This book, however, presents a binary view of motivation: either you encourage, orelse you reprimand. (I suppose there's a third state suggested, but not explicitly described: not communicating at all.)    As a final nit to pick: for some reason, the unenlightened managers in this book are characterized as having messy offices and calendars that are booked up heavily. The one minute manager, on the other hand, has a perfectly tidy office, and is rarely too busy to take walk-in appointments. This distinction isn't explained in the book at all, but it seems to me to be a subconscious message that one minute managers are also magically transformed into tidy, efficient workers who have a lot of free time to philosophize. Indeed, the student in this book evolves into this one minute manager mold and magically his office is cleaned up, too. I'd love to read a \\"one minute office organizer\\" book. Let me know when they write that one.
0385334206|4.0|This book is terrific satire and a joy to read, however, you must be willing to fore go the need for a single central character or a tidy ending. At the halfway point of the novel the narrative focus shifts from the main characters to the narrator himself. The book becomes some what autobiographical at this point in the novel, as Vonnegut opens up about his philosophy, background and the characters of his novels. It could be argued that this is a more effective technique if the reader is familiar with the Vonnegut oeuvre, however, I don't think it's necessary to read his other books to enjoy 'Breakfast of Champions'.

0440241413|1.0|This book is so horrible and it is incredibly insulting because Becca, the protagonist, is this complete idiot throughout the entire story.  She is dumb, lazy, inept, and has no integrity.  As her world is deservedly spinning out of control the consequences of her stupidity are catching up to her.  Hooray, I thought, this imbecile is finally going to have to face reality.  But no, instead the author makes her into some sort of admirable hero, as if being financially retarded and a complete liar should be paid off with television premiers and a cute man.  I could feel my IQ plummeting as Ms. Kinsella insulted all of woman-kind by writing a book where the main character is spineless and contemptible and then perseveres with absolutely no talent or ingenuity of her own.  Blah!  This is what I have heard disgustedly called \\"Chic Lit.\\" as it is a novel written for stupid women all about shopping and being trendy.  Truly distasteful!

Dense, noisy, but as his best always is, catchy and melodic- even if the latter comes in smaller doses then preferred at the expense of extra buzz paranoia, Reznor was still firing on all cylinders and offers one last layered production before relinquishing certain pressures which apparently effected bottom-line quality.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|When I heard that Rihanna was trying too make her new album like Brandy's 2004 album, [[ASIN:B0001Z4P32 Afrodisiac]], I laughed. I thought \\"there is no way an artist like Rihanna could make an album as amazing as any album that Brandy made.\\" Once I heard 'Good Girl Gone Bad' I completely changed my mind.    I remember first hearing Rihanna when she came out in 2005 with her debut single \\"Pon de Replay\\" and it was a big hit. It was a great party track, but I was worried she might become a one-hit wonder. She disowned that title with 2006's \\"SOS\\" which very heavily samples Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\", and \\"Unfaithful\\" which was a beautiful ballad about cheating. I liked these songs, but I was never a big fan of \\"A Girl Like Me\\" (her second album). In 2007, she came back with the HUGE SMASH \\"Umbrella,\\" which turned out to be the lead single from her third studio album, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad.\\"    The first four songs on the CD are the dance tracks. Tracks three and four are two major highlights on the disc. #3, \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" was one of the many dance hits from this CD, while in \\"Breakin' Dishes,\\" she tells off her man who stays out all night cheating. Rihanna tries rock in \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" and duets with Ne-Yo in \\"Hate that I Love You.\\"    Other highlights include the wonderful \\"Rehab\\" and \\"Question Existing.\\" The three bonus tracks are \\"Disturbia\\" which has a great beat that you can dance to, \\"Take a Bow,\\" a breakup song, and a remix of \\"If I Never See Your Face Again.\\" which is a duet with Maroon 5, who originally did the song.    Overall, this is a great CD that I suggest if you like pop or R&B music.    TOP TRACKS:  1. Breakin' Dishes  2. Disturbia  3. Rehab  4. Umbrella  5. Don't Stop the Music

0307265730|5.0|In the opening review pages of Lahiri's \\"Interpreter of Maladies,\\" one critic wrote that Lahiri's writing style makes one forget that they are reading. I agree with this, and attest it to her absolute skill in her craft. Her work is like literary comfort food to me. \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" can very well be her richest, most mature work yet. Her stories are intimate yet universal, ethnic yet wholly American, stark yet warm, and always told with a firm yet gentle style that makes these characters and their troubles haunt you long after you are finished visiting them. The majority of Lahiri's work here is somber in tone, but her plots and characters are somehow relateable. Her characters are always simply human, and have issues in misunderstandings with parents, children, lovers, and addictions. You want to spend whole characters, but her final three loosely connected short stories are somehow complete, and enough in themselves.     Read and enjoy this book. It is entertaining but will stay and resonate with you. Lahiri makes the reader introspective and heightens their awareness of life and literature. I cannot praise her work enough, and look forward to returning to these stories again as I do with her earlier work. Exquisite stuff.

B001DJ7PNW|5.0|If you read \\"Crossfire   by Jim Marrs or \\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" by Jim Garrison (first hand info), then seeing the film is like watching the books!    This film tackled a lot in it's 3+ hours, but it did not get into the Oswald sightings/impersonations.  I guess that is neither here nor there, but I would have loved to see what Stone's theory on those episodes were.    Now, as far as the BD itself is concerned, the picture is true HD, although it does not look spectacular in the beginning due to artistic purposes, but as the color comes in, the quality also does as well.  The sound IS HD and you can hear the clear different switching from Dolby to Dolby TrueHD.      I am not too crazy about these book cases, but since this film is now almost 20 years old (hard to believe!), the book help to recall some things that were forgotten when this was coming out.    I noticed in the film that the Paines and Johnny Carson were left out of the film.  I assume it has to do with legal matters.  While Costner's performance won rave reviews, it would have been nicer if he tried to mimic Garrion's voice, which seems easy enough to do.    This of course is a must have film, especially if you are into history and while we wait for the government to develop a good excuse for what really happened when they let us know.  It is almost a half a century now, so the US might as well come clean.  We'll see it Obama does Ted a favor...

B001CTA1S4|3.0|DOUBT was a stage play by John Patrick Shanley...a much-revered play.  Great, theatrical dialogue and the opportunity for good actors to really tear into some juicy characters and excellent dialogue.    But you know, not every stage play translates naturally into a compelling film.  You can't act a film at the same pitch you do on stage.  And strangely, dialogue that sounds intelligent, lofty, philosophical and NATURAL on stage can often on film sound intelligent, lofty, philosophical and UNNATURAL on screen.  Much like stage musicals can be tricky to put on screen, so too can \\"straight\\" plays.    Unfortunately, John Patrick Shanley has been allowed to adapt his beloved play for the screen and then allowed to direct it as well.  What he has is an interesting but emotionally uninvolving film that makes me wish I could take stars Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman and see them do this story on stage.  Hoffman sweets and smiles and squirms and emotes with great energy...all to minimal effect.  His performance lacks subtle touches.  Streep falls into the same traps, although her character comes across on screen as even more one-dimensional (although, speaking of one-dimensional, poor Amy Adams, whom I normally think is great, is completely unconvincing.)    DOUBT is set in the `60s in an inner-city Catholic School.  Hoffman is the popular parish priest and the religious center for the kids at the school, particularly the boys whom he coaches in basketball and even engages in discussions about girls.  To the story's credit, none of these activities feel mawkish, and without knowing where the film was  headed, you certainly would not suspect Hoffman of having less than pure intentions with these boys.  He GENUINELY seems to care about them and connect to them.  He develops a tight friendship with the one black boy in the school, a shy kid who needs the father's help to pass through the quiet gauntlet of racism he faces.    On the other hand, the principal of the school is a severe, old-fashioned nun played by Streep.  She clearly resents Hoffman for his popularity AND populism.  Her character is almost unbelievably single-minded and sure of herself.  And when just the tiniest hint that Hoffman may not be altogether pure comes her way, she seizes on it.      So the question is:  did Hoffman commit unforgiveable acts or is Streep simply obsessed with bringing down this pries with modern views she does not approve of?  Adams is the sister who first feels uncomfortable with Hoffman but later regrets the storm she caused.  As the movie wears on, our allegiances change, and this keeps the story compelling.  It plays out like perhaps the best episode of LAW & ORDER ever, where you're never sure what the truth is.    But it is an intellectual exercise.  The acting is so very \\"stagey\\" and theatrical that I was constantly aware that these two film greats were ACTING.  Oh, look at Streep roll her eyes in disapproval.  Oh, look at Hoffman let his jaw hang slack in disbelief.     And while director/writer Shanley has on the surface opened up his film by placing scenes all around the school and even outside, it seldom feels like much more than a play with some really realistic sets.  Scenes are long and generally take place in one room or one small outside location.  It feels, in case I haven't already made this clear, like a play.  I like plays, but when sitting in a movie theater, I like movies that don't feel like plays.    One note about the much-praised performance of Viola Davis.  She plays the mother of the black student, and has one long scene with Streep.  She actually underplays her role nicely, and that, coupled with the fact that her character's point-of-view is controversial and a bit wrenching makes her role stand out.  Her performance is not Oscar worthy...there's no real arch to her character.  But because she outshines Streep, I think folks are jumping on the Davis bandwagon.  I'd sure like to see her do more...but I don't want to see her receive an Oscar nomination.    The film is worth taking a look at because it will generate some heated \\"did he or didn't he\\" discussion afterwards.  It engaged my intellect...but not once did it engage my heart.  And that's why I doubt I'll watch it again.

If you have seen the trailer, you know, before going in, what to expect and what NOT to expect this movie to be.<br />So, in the end, such criticism as 'oh but that's not believable' and 'that's far fetched' are like saying 1 + 1 = 2.<br />In order to fully appreciate this movie, which is highly entertaining, you have got to activate your suspension of disbelief. You have to be dragged into this hightened reality world and let the movie dictate its own rules.<br />If you do that, you'll have a great, fun 2 hours. But if you insist on boring everybody with your 'it's not real' comments, do yourself (and everybody) a favor and keep your distance from this movie.

1400064287|2.0|If you are new to this area, this book may provide motivation for thinking more deeply about this topic, but the coverage is too simplistic and disconnected to provide actual help in improving your skills.  If you have experience with these topics (like me), your reaction may be that you know more than the authors.  I gave up at page 144 (just over halfway) when the accumulated instances of sloppy analysis destroyed the _credibility_ of the book (examples below).<br /><br />The book has been severely criticized in other reviews here for being overly verbose and padded, but this is to be expected in this category (business books).  While this deserves to be noted in reviews, it isn't bad enough here to seriously downrate this book.<br /><br />I agree with the common criticism in other reviews that this book fails to follow its own advice.  The worst violation is that of \\"Simple\\" which they state should not violate \\"accurate\\". The authors acknowledge that \\"Simple\\" should be \\"Core\\", but they decided against the change to keep the \\"SUCCESs\\" acronym.  Similarly, \\"Unexpected\\" is acknowledged as not a good choice (engaging curiosity is closer).  Most importantly, they don't give actionable advice on how to achieve these goals (on pg 57 the point is made that \\"We are THE low priced airline\\" provides usable guidance to employees, but that \\"maximizing shareholder value\\" doesn't).<br /><br />-- Examples --<br /><br />Example (pg 26) on Commander's Intent: The example tasking is contrary to the point being made.  In \\"My intent is to have the Third Battalion on Hill 4305, to have the hill cleared of the enemy, with only ineffective remnants remaining, so we can protect the flank of the Third Brigade as they pass through the lines\\", the _intent_ is to protect the flank of the Third Brigade and should have been stated first--The rest is guidance on how to accomplish that goal.<br /><br />Example (pp 137-139) Credibility: The Power of Details: Although providing vivid details can create the impression of expertise or knowledge, the book improperly applies this to an experiment where people's assessment of a legal case minorly shifted in response to changes in which aspects had the more detailed presentation.  A simpler analysis is that the different level of details were taken as signals from the authority figures about how to weight the various arguments.<br /><br />Example (pg 44) on Dunn Daily Record (newspaper):  This story is probably over 30 years old, raising the question about why they didn't have anything more current and whether this example is still relevant [[Evidence: story quoted editor saying \\"I'd happily hire two more typesetters and add two more pages...\\" Computerization largely eliminated human typesetters by the mid-1980s, but the process had begun in the mid-1960s (see \\"typesettng\\" in Wikipedia for stages). By the mid-1970s, technology that limited productivity to only 1 page per day per typesetter had been almost entirely replaced.]]<br /><br />Example (pg 59) on \\"High concept pitches\\": The claim that the (simple) pitch for the movie \\"Alien\\" as \\"Jaws on a spaceship\\" contained considerable implicit details (character of the spaceship).  This is contrary to what one sees/reads in stories about Hollywood.<br /><br />Example (pg 80) \\"The Mystery of the Rings\\" in \\"Unexpected\\": This misses the important point that opening with a question can be a good way of introducing the _core_ idea, plus identifying the \\"destination\\" at the beginning assists the audience in organizing the steps along the way (pp 51-52 has isolated low-level examples that organizing items improves recall).  The importance of moving the _core_ to the beginning of a presentation is touched upon in \\"Burying the Lead\\" (pp 30-33), but not well connected to the rest of the examples.  The similar template of Problem-Solution is not mentioned despite its widespread use (including in commercials).wledge, the book improperly applies this to an experiment where people's assessment of a legal case minorly shifted in response to changes in which aspects had the more detailed presentation.  A simpler analysis is that the different level of details were taken as signals from the authority figures about how to weight the various arguments.    Example (pg 44) on Dunn Daily Record (newspaper):  This story is probably over 30 years old, raising the question about why they didn't have anything more current and whether this example is still relevant [[Evidence: story quoted editor saying \\"I'd happily hire two more typesetters and add two more pages...\\" Computerization largely eliminated human typesetters by the mid-1980s, but the process had begun in the mid-1960s (see \\"typesettng\\" in Wikipedia for stages). By the mid-1970s, technology that limited productivity to only 1 page per day per typesetter had been almost entirely replaced.]]    Example (pg 59) on \\"High concept pitches\\": The claim that the (simple) pitch for the movie \\"Alien\\" as \\"Jaws on a spaceship\\" contained considerable implicit details (character of the spaceship).  This is contrary to what one sees/reads in stories about Hollywood.    Example (pg 80) \\"The Mystery of the Rings\\" in \\"Unexpected\\": This misses the important point that opening with a question can be a good way of introducing the _core_ idea, plus identifying the \\"destination\\" at the beginning assists the audience in organizing the steps along the way (pp 51-52 has isolated low-level examples that organizing items improves recall).  The importance of moving the _core_ to the beginning of a presentation is touched upon in \\"Burying the Lead\\" (pp 30-33), but not well connected to the rest of the examples.  The similar template of Problem-Solution is not mentioned despite its widespread use (including in commercials).
0786888628|4.0|Neither a comprehensive  history of what the author calls \\"a black hole\\" nor a focus on the winter of 1950-5 which was a nadir of American military fortunes.  Rather, it is a somewhat rambling, yet carefully constructed account of \\"the forgotten war\\" with its heaviest emphasis on that coldest winter.  He begins in media res with the first warnings, in October 1950,  that the Chinese were entering Korea, warnings that MacArthur ignored as they intruded on his conviction that the North Koreans were finished.   MacArthur is the chief villain of this book, followed closely by his loyal subordinate (lackey would be a better word), Ned Almond, and then by Charles Willoughby, MacArthur's so-called chief of intelligence.   The prostitution of intelligence data by the high command in Tokyo, the blatant disconnect between authority's pronouncements and reality led to the disaster that was the \\"big bugout\\" of November and December of that coldest winter.   Halberstam jumps back from the October days to before June of 1950.  There is a great deal of political history that precedes the North Korean incursion.  In a rambling section, the author provides a context that includes biographical analyses of the major political and military players.  He follows the brutal fighting around the Pusan perimeter, the decision to go into Inchon, and the race northward.  Not until one is almost halfway through the book does the \\"coldest winter\\" segment begin.  The failure to heed the October warnings of his general on the ground (Walker), and insist on an all-out drive to the Yalu with no thought of establishing any backup defense line across the narrow waist of Korea, was due to MacArthur's intransigent belief that the war was won.  After all, MacArthur was the sole architect of the brilliant turning movement at Inchon, so who in Washington (or Korea) could gainsay him?  Halberstam documents many other failings of the generalissimo.  He never spent a night in the field in Korea, he split hisforces to create X Corps, independent of Eighth Army, largely to justify three stars for his favorite courtier, Ned Almond.    The great bugout is encapsulated in vignettes about the near-decimation of the 2nd Division in the west, and the Marines spectacular withdrawal from the Chinese ambush in the X Corps sector. Marshall and Ferenbach have written better accounts, but Halberstam's aim is not military history, but to highlight the arrogance of MacArthur and the mendacity of his high command.  Believing that Inchon completely intimidated Mao from any intervention,  he referred to the Chinese as \\"laundrymen\\".  And any pronouncement from the great man was accepted without doubt--dissent \\".... would have been questioning an announcement from God.\\"   The shambles resulting from the big bugout were slowly cleaned up by Matthew Ridgeway who succeeded the unlucky Cassandra, Walker.  MacArthur openly lobbied for a wider war--\\"unleashing Chiang\\" and bombing mainland China--despite Truman's determination to keep the war localized.  Finally,  Truman had enough of MacArthur's insubordination and relieved him from command in April 1951.  Why did the ouster take so long?   Largely domestic politics.  MacArthur had been an American icon since the bad days of Bataan (where, according to Halberstam) he never spent one day.  His gross lapses in preparing the Philippines for the Japanese onslaught even after the unmistakable warning afforded by Pearl Harbor and his mismanagement of the defense of the  islands were overlooked because at that time, the United States was sorely in need of a hero.   MacArthur returned from the Far East still a hero.  He was received with a ticker-tape parade, he appeared before a joint sitting of Congress to give his valedictory, and was taken up by the right wing as a possible presidential candidate.  Veneration of MacArthur has continued to this day, even though his role in the Korean War has been thoroughly dissected, and has been found wanting.  Andit is with the firing of MacArthur that Halberstam that effectively ends this book.  There was still much hard fighting ahead, and the agony of the armistice negotiations.  But Halberstam had accomplished his mission--the demythologizing of Douglas MacArthur. Book has extensive notes and the sources are mostly secondary works and oral histories. Also, a serviceable bibliography.
0345479092|5.0|I borrowed this while I was pregnant with my first child and found it to be a  more middle of the road version of Babywise. It follows the same type of cycle (eat, wake time, sleep) but seemed to allow more flexibility for different babies' temperaments. Our daughter loved her crib from day 1 and slept beautifully through the night by 2 months. She still loves sleep and loves her bed.     I thought I'd remember all the principles when daughter number 2 was born, but quickly realized that I had forgotten most of them. At 7 weeks, she slept well at night (waking only for a 2 am feeding), but WOULD NOT sleep in her crib during the day. As soon as her peaceful, sleepy head hit the bed she would lose it. I bought the book a few days ago and skimmed it, heading straight for the sleep advice. I implemented the author's suggestions yesterday morning, and she took 3 long naps in her crib with almost no tears (and no crying it out). Same thing today. She also slept better at night, going 5 hours between feedings. I'm sold on her idea that a predictable routine during the day makes for a happy, well rested baby. And mom...
0307269191|5.0|I don't even run but I loved this book. Murakami is a truly gifted writer who manages to draw his reader into his work and keep them entertained, interested and challenged by his writing. This little gem of a book gives us a small insight into the man himself and how a little part of his psyche works. For the runner or the non-runner like me, well worth a read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow! I have tried lot's of workout DVD's and this is by far a top on my list! You really do feel like Jillian is in your living room. She knows just when you want to give up and she tells you to keep pushing. I am sore every time I do it. I can already feel my body changing form and I have lost a couple of pounds in just a week. That is pretty exciting.
0307269752|5.0|I've had this on the shelf for a while, decided to give it a whirl and I've got to say this is a totally compelling read. You start off with an court case involving a journalist, then you move on to a missing persons case from the 60's, then another layer of corruption and abuse is added and finally you end up with something you just didn't see coming. Fantastically written, it is just a shame he died after his third book was finished. If 2 and 3 are as good as this I will be very happy
B000053VAF|5.0|Yes, you will want to be open minded when you watch Dogma, but as someone who grew up in the Catholic Church it gives a darkly satirical look at many of the things that typically baffle a preteen trying to understand the Baltimore Catechism. Be sure to watch the added features.
B000244FDW|5.0|I saw this when it was originally screened and i've got to admit it's the best version of pride and prejudice i've seen. Fay Weldon's screenplay sticks very close to Austen's original. Elizabeth Garvie is Elizabeth Bennett the way she behaves and how she talks, she gives an excellent performace. David Rintoul gives a great performance as Mr Darcy, his aloofness and manner are as you imagine Darcy to be. The cast as a whole do a stirling job and if you haven't see it i would recommend buying this dvd, i was over the moon when i saw it was available, i have waited years to get hold of this version. i just wish they would release the bbc's version of Rebecca with Jeremy Brett, i think it was made around the same time.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is probably the only romantic comedy that just happens to have zombies in it. And NO, this is not a parody of zombie films. Pegg and Wright are big fans of George A. Romero's works, and they wanted to creataed a zombie film of their own. And what they did was give it their all. This film as black humor, suspense, gore, rock music, electronica, romance, drama, horror, and cricket paddles! Pegg and Frost make a great duo as they knock out every zombie that gets in their way. Everything, the music, the editing, the cinematography, EVERYTHING works here. Another classic in the \\"living dead\\" genre.<br /><br />Grade: A

B00001NFCY|4.0|I know that the band Creed sounds a lot like Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots, but it still made some good music in the 1990's. The album \\"Human Clay\\" is just as good as \\"Core\\" and \\"Vitalogy\\". Songs like \\"What if\\" and \\"Say I\\" can be best described as awe-inspiring, with heavy and melodic guitar riffs throughout. \\"Faceless Man\\" is lyrical, and is my favorite song in the album. The singles \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and \\"Higher\\" sadly don't do justice when compared to the other songs. I don't know why; they just sound so sappy. \\"Never Die\\" and \\"Wash Away Those Years\\" sound terrible; the melodies are flat-out irritating. Finally, the closer called \\"Inside Us All\\" makes for a perfect ending to this album.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, it's still a good album. And Creed is a good band; just not as good as Pearl Jam & Stone Temple Pilots.<br /><br />Grade: B+

Odessa has been reviewed and re-reviewed yet it transcends all human fallacies and conjectures; this is a masterpiece unmatched in any way. Grandiose album that proves that by the time Disco was in The Bee Gees were semi retired geniuses that just felt like joining the party not knowing that they would end up becoming its illustrious DJs. Time to pay your respects, the Kings of Pop have built their castle on an iceberg that happens to be floating somewhere close to you: don't miss the view and try to jump on board and you will definitely enjoy the ride...

0810970686|5.0|Jeff Kinney scores big, again!<br /><br />Kids, teachers, and parents alike have all been anxiously awaiting the third installment of the Wimpy Kid series.  If you were worried the third book of Greg Heffley and his wimpy ways would be watered down, worry no more.  In DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: THE LAST STRAW, Kinney maintains his fresh, unique humor that easily connects with adolescents or anyone who still remembers his or her adolescence.<br /><br />As a sports enthusiast, I particularly loved how Greg's father Frank thought getting Greg active in sports would toughen him up. The sports world creates a number of interesting settings and story lines for Greg's awkwardness to shine.<br /><br />Anybody ever been affected by the threat of military school?  Well, you will relate to the fear that Greg must endure.<br /><br />This book follows the same successful formula you loved in the other books (It is not like the Do-It-Yourself book) and you will have plenty to laugh about and discuss with other Wimpy Kid readers.<br /><br />Enjoy.  I sure did.
B001KVZ6C0|5.0|You know you've seen a good movie when a packed theater audience simultaneously rises to their feet and applauds for several minutes at the end. This is exactly what happened when I saw this film near Christmas. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I've never seen a response like that for any film, much less a mid-budget production with no A-list talent. SLUMDDOG MILLIONAIRE is that good. It deserves the 4 golden globes it has already won, and should be a strong contender for Best Picture in February.<br /><br />A straightforward premise guides this film: Jamal, a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, has successfully answered all but the final question facing him. One more correct answer and he will win the prize of 20 million Rupes. Before he can answer the show ends for the night and he is arrested under suspicion that he is cheating to win. It turns out that Jamal is a 'Slumdog,' a former resident of the largest and nastiest slums in Mumbai. Because of lack formal education the police are convinced he must be cheating to have had so much success on the game show.<br /><br />He is taken in for interrogation, complete with torture, to force him to admit he is cheating. The rest of the movie consists of Jamal explaining how he knew each answer, which are shown in flash-backs of the events in his life which taught him the answers. The scenes with the police are very well done and are reminiscent of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Jamal, sullen, tired, and unusually honest, explains his life and current circumstances with a gripping urgency that correlates well with the vignettes from his past. We learn of his escape from the slums, his survival buy whatever means necessary, and of his great love, Latika.<br /><br />The film starts with a wild chase through the slums, Jamal and his older brother Salim running from the police, afraid and yet taunting the them at the same time. This intro is sheer genius, painting the boy's environs as well as their personalities with deft strokes. We learn that Salim is a risk taker, that Jamal follows his older brother's lead, that the slum is a horrific place to grow up, and that despite that, it is filled with the vibrancy and hope of human endeavor. Danny Boyle, in an interview on the NPR program FRESH AIR, said that originally they shot the opener in English, but that it just didn't feel right. Only after switching to Hindi did the scene successfully convey the slum and its inhabitants.<br /><br />There are several remarkable things about this film. First is that because it is comprised of many flashbacks, there are three actors each for Jamal, Salim, and Latika that portray them at different ages. All of them nail their roles. There is no let down at any point. The viewer never doubts the continuity of the characters. Each actor delivers a powerful, believable performance that resonates with the viewer.<br /><br />Another high quality element is the carefully assembled plot that never becomes predictable, despite the ending being fairly obvious from the beginning of the film. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is shockingly original, and sometimes just shocking. The film is gritty and frightening, and doesn't shy away from the harsher realities of growing up in a slum or the consequences of bad choices. The characters are believable, the sets are perfect, and the dramatic moments as intense as the well done action sequences.<br /><br />Finally, near the end of the film when the various themes of the movie are being woven together, the viewer is allowed to see the full impact of Jamal on the world around him. As 60 million viewers tune in to see if he will be allowed to answer the final question, we see Jamal as much more than a Slumdog with a chance to become vastly wealthy. He is the embodiment of hope. Hope that we can escape the grimness of our circumstances, hope that love can overcome desperation, and hope that even people that seem lost can find redemption.<br /><br />If you've seen [[ASIN:B00103584Y Run Lola Run]] you might understand what I mean by saying this is a movie that requires the viewer to believe that hope is more than a just feeling. It is equal parts force of nature and destiny, and something worth contending for. It is also similar to RUN LOLA RUN by featuring a soundtrack heavy with electronic dance music that somehow fits the film perfectly.<br /><br />The closing scene is very well done. Without ruining it, the director shows a restraint that makes it poignant. As it unfolds, I was thinking \\"if only Boyle is smart enough to end it here, the film will be perfect,\\" and then he does. CASABLANCA like in impact, there were few in the the showing I attended who were not moved.<br /><br />An epic, beautiful film that will move you, this is the best film of 2008. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is wonderful, right down to its credits which feature a fun nod to Bollywood (from which most of the talent came). 5/5 Stars. A must buy for virtually anyone.and what I mean by saying this is a movie that requires the viewer to believe that hope is more than a just feeling.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|Appaloosa is a great, crowd-pleaser of a western that contains most of what makes modern-day westers so good in the first place.  Ed Harris directs, co-scripts, and stars as Virgil Cole, who along with his longtime partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) come to the town of Appaloosa to be new lawmen, and to take down a slippery, murderous rancher (Jeremy Irons).  Things get complicated by a shady widower (Renee Zellweger) who catches the eye and heart of Cole, and every other element combines to lead up to an inevitable showdown.  While it never reaches the level of greatness that James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma did, Appaloosa doesn't try to either.  Harris' take on the western is a tried and true portrait that delivers the goods that viewers would hope to find with the film, and it delivers them quite good to boot.  Harris and Mortensen in particular are perfect in their respective roles, while Zellweger and Irons deliver solid turns as well.  With gorgeous cinematography and supporting work from Lance Henriksen and Timothy Spall, Appaloosa is a treat of a western that every fan of the genre will find something to admire about it.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|There is a point when revamping a character for a new audience is necessary, and the Bond franchise reached that point after Pierce Brosnan did what he did to the bond legacy. It was high time to bring Bond into the new millennium. Casino Royal did just that, and aside from some card play what might seem a little dated once America gets over its Texas Hold Em' fetish, Daniel Craig was and is an interesting, convincing Bond; I've no complaints with him.<br /><br />The real problems with this film have less to do with Bond's lack of discernment when it comes to spirits, or the shaky camera work, or bland car chases that seem cliched before they even begin. The real problem is that Bond is only as good as his antagonists. He cannot capture the audience regardless of how ruthlessly he takes out baddies when his ultimate opponents are all physically unimpressive and even meek.<br /><br />Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Green might go down as the lamest Bond antagonist ever. With Bond now a physical specimen, it would make sense to pit him against an antagonist with similar physical prowess. This is doubly irritating because while CASINO ROYAL is a better move, it too features a weakling antagonist. The guy cries blood for freakin' sake... Where is the modern take on Jaws? Where is someone who can give Bond a run for his money in a believable way? Instead we get Dominic who can't even run a secret terrorist organization without masquerading as an Environmentalist!<br /><br />And speaking of that, what the bloody-heck is the Quantum of Solace anyway? Unless they're planning to make a hackneyed 'trilogy' of films in which the Quantum is explained only in the last installment, I've got to say that the Quantum of Solace made me want to find a bottle of Advil. Secret societies are so History Chanel. Can't we get some proper terrorists that don't want to play dress up and attend Operas? (Although I have to admit that the Opera sequence is the best of the film).<br /><br />Its pretty clear this is a movie 'informed' by the Jason Bourne films. The cut-happy camera work of the car chase, the roof top chase (so very reminiscent of the roof top chase in THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM) and even Craig's Americanized bad-boy Bond are all strikingly similar to those superior movies. This isn't a bad thing at all if they also take to heart the lesson that Bourne or Bond are best served hot: give Bond some real villains to take out, not whiny environmentalists or dudes that cry tears of blood.<br /><br />QoS left me scratching my head. I had just seen a Bond film, but it felt more melodramatic (all of Ms mothering of bond was over the top) and flat than what I expected. Craig's got the potential to be the best Bond since Sir Sean Connery. Here's hopping that the next installment forgets all about the QoS and instead takes on a new antagonist with the same level or ruthless physicality of this version of Bond.<br /><br />2.5/5 Stars.

B000002VCU|5.0|This is perhaps one of APP's best. This is where the orchestra and the band begin to combine to bring sounds that are timeless and powerful. The recording felt like being at King Henry VIII gathering.  This is one Eric Wolfson's best recordings he has completed for APP.  Some outstanding highlights:      I Don't Wanna Go Home  The Gold Bug   -   An Enticing Medieval Instrumental  The Turn Of A Friendly Card (Part 1) - A classic Wolfson's tune.  Snake Eyes - A classic APP tune.  The Ace Of Swords  - A powerful and one of my favorite Instrumentals.  Nothing Left to Loose- A nice ending.    Other tunes were almost as good making the release fulfilling. Overall can't go wrong in doubling down in Turn of a Friendly Card, one of my favorites.
0439023483|5.0|I am a middle school English teacher, so I spend my life reading young adult fiction.  This is my new favorite book!  It now tops my list over The Black Book of Secrets, Unwind, The Giver, and Twilight. I admit I was already a Collins fan from the Gregor books, but getting my students to read them with the Twilight books out there is almost impossible.  The Hunger Games, however, is THE book of the year in my opinion.  My students bring it back after 1 night and ask where is the second book.  Boys love it and girls love it!  My daughter had just finished Eclipse when she picked up The Hunger Games and pronounced it the best book she had EVER read!  This is a plot that is twisted, frightening and awesome all wrapped up in one.  There is unexpected death, relationships that are not what you want to believe and much more.  I was rooting for Katniss from the moment I met her.  I am absolutely on edge for Book 2....I just hope it can live up to the first one.  Thank you Suzanne Collins.

B00000427L|5.0|After reading a number of the reviews, I'll 'chip in' my 'two cents'.<br /><br />Frankly, I find that Ashkenazy demonstrates that he is a master technician when it comes to his approach to the 4 concertos featured on the CD.  I therefore make the following declarations:<br /><br />1. Does he sound 'mechanical' as if he's just going through the motions? Yes<br />2. Does he seemingly plod through sections of the music and speed his way through others? Yes<br /><br />A final point:<br /><br />Is Ashkenazy human?  Yes<br /><br />Folks, we can sit up here and break this man's work down atom-by-atom, it ultimately comes down to the following:<br /><br />Rachmaninov didn't play Rachmaninov like 'Rachmaninov' every night.  It takes energy - and a toll.  Ashkenazy does a fine job.  Give the man his due and appreciate the music for what it is.  Are there better single performances out there?  Of course.  But this is one of the few packages where you will find all 4 concerti together at a good price!<br /><br />I rate the package: 5 stars!

B000002KHH|5.0|I've always been a fan of Metal in general and Black Sabbath in particular. So it was no surprise that my friends and I would one day form our own Heavy metal cover band, Satan's Coccyx. We've had some local success and now we're going to tour the great Mid-West, spreading the Word of chaos and destruction, and fabulous guitar licks.<br />  Just yesterday we had the last addition to the most bad-@$$ cover band ever. My good friend Jabber's mother, Mother, is joining us as a groupie. That's right, she's stressed out from the rigorous life of substitute teacher and Jabber caretaking and wants to go on the road with us to blow off a little steam, among other things. She certainly has the backround for it, as in the 70's she toured with the Grateful Dead as their official \\"Brownie Maker\\" and then spent some time touring as a solo Heavy Metal act known as Satan's Doorknob. So she's leaving her tyke Jabber in the stern yet knowing hands of Father O and climbing aboard the Skin Missle , which is the name of our tour bus.<br />  Mother is a very caring woman so don't judge her. She just needs a break. As a matter of fact we are dedicating our first song of every evening to her son. In all honesty we probably will get tired of playing\\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" every night, funny as it is, but if it will keep the ol' Doorknob happy then it's worth it. We'll probably play this entire album as well. It's one of BS's best.
B001C46P2A|5.0|Almost three hours and I loved every moment. The music was haunting and beautiful; the story funny, sad, sweet, and romantic; and for a person who has never been to Australia, the scenery is breathtaking. The acting of Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman was wonderful, there was definitely chemistry between them, and the boy who plays Nullah pulls you in with that bright smile and those big brown eyes-and for never acting before, he did a great job. After watching Hugh Jackman on youtube, I think he is one of the most versatile, talented actors there is. And yes, he is certainly dreamy to look at. You would have to be dead not to notice. I went with a group of friends (28-45) and we all thought it was a grand film. We have all seen it twice.  It is definitely one of those movies that you need to see on the big screen.
B00168HARG|5.0|This series will suck you in.  I felt involved with the characters' lives from the very first episode.  The creators did a great job gaining and keeping my interest in both the storyline and each of the characters.  It's also hard to imagine a better cast for this series.  Great job Fox!
B001E5FYS8|4.0|One would think with a title like this we were discussing this week's blockbuster release, THE DARK KNIGHT. That's not the case. No, this week's film is a treat that flies under the headlamps of most moviegoers. Its a little film called MAN ON WIRE.<br /><br />The film is a documentary about Philippe Petit, the wire walker who daringly crossed by wire from one building to the other of the World Trade Center back in 1974. Don't let the fact that it's a documentary scare you. The film is filled with tension, laughs, thrills and pure joy.<br /><br />A young street performer, Philippe tells of how he went to the dentist one day and saw an article about the construction of the World Trade Center buildings. He knew then and there that he had to conquer them, that he had to walk from one to the other. With his goal in sight, it would be several years before he could fulfill that dream, mainly because the buildings weren't built yet.<br /><br />We get to know Philippe and his friends through the interview footage of the film as they discuss the process that went in to planning and carrying out this daring maneuver. Footage shot while they made preparations is used as well as recreated scenes. It is put together well lending you a sense of being there as the plan moves forward.<br /><br />In preparation for his fateful day, Philippe and crew journey to Australia where they tie off a line between two towers on top of a well traveled bridge. Creating a stir, as well as a catching the eyes of traveling motorists, it gives Philippe the first glimmer of hope that his dream might be possible.<br /><br />The film changes from a look at his life and those of his cohorts to an almost caper type film. Rather than focus just on Philippe, though he is the centerpiece, we are brought into the fold as we watch them plan out just how to accomplish their goal.<br /><br />They begin with the logistics of how to rig the cables from one tower to the other. It's not just a simple line from one building to the other, but a wire that will need to be anchored down to keep it taught while Philippe walks. Once the rigging is designed, its how to attach it.<br /><br />Trips with espionage like quality are taken by Philippe to get shots of the rooftops. He checks out all angles in an attempt to decide just the right way to hook up the wire from one building to the other. Then it becomes a question of how to get the equipment to the rooftops.<br /><br />Lastly, how will they get the cable from one building to the other? The uses of a bow and arrow with filament wire (which they have to rig to unspool properly) that will be used as a guide for their rope is tested until it works. Now all it takes is having the patience to get to the rooftops and make a go of it.<br /><br />The film offers a joy for life in the essence of young Philippe as he overflows with enthusiasm for the task at hand. He not only wants to do this, he feels that he MUST do this. The thought of his falling never enters his mind until the time comes to cross.<br /><br />The second most inspiring item of this film is the World Trade Center itself. Shown during construction, it is an eerie sight to see those famous panels from the front of the building being erected since the last time seen we saw them beneath a ton of rubble. Having lived through non-stop shots of the buildings falling, it was inspiring to watch as they were built from the ground up.<br /><br />Shots of airplanes flying in the background while the building was going up make for an uneasy feeling as do animations of planes flying from France to New York. But in the end the love of the buildings by Philippe Petit shines through as does his love of life.<br /><br />Called crazy by some, genius by others and artist by many, Philippe Petit will offer you an inspiring look into his life and times, his desire and inspiration. And in watching his tale, perhaps just a little bit of that magic will carry over from the screen to your heart.<br /><br />You may find yourself looking at a figure flying over the streets of Gotham this week. But if you neglect the sight of a man somewhat soaring over the streets of the real life Gotham, then you're missing out on a treat.But if you neglect the sight of a man somewhat soaring over the streets of the real life Gotham, then you're missing out on a treat.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|Christian Bale does a decent Bruce Wayne, but Batman was awful in this movie.  Everything about Batman, from the costume to the voice (especially the voice) is pathetic.  However, Heath Ledger's Joker easily makes up for any and all of Batman's disappointments.  Overall, the movie has a good story, although slow at times, and an okay cast.  I recommend renting this one before buying it.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This was a christmas present for my daughter and she really enjoyed it. She is a big FRIENDS fanatic and has been watching all the episodes during her christmas vacation. The price and the shipping was excellent.
0810979772|5.0|First of all, you have to at least read the 1st book in the series, which is a hilarious story of a middle-school boy's life illustrated with his own comic drawings.  It motivates boys to keep the same kind of diary!  This book is a perfect way for boys to find their creative outlet and express their feelings.  Of course, they would never actually call it a DIARY.  But even if it only becomes a book of drawings and comics, what a treasure would that be to save.  I suggest getting the hard-cover.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I always loved this series and the backgroud music and depth of heart and teaching is second to none in ALL the movies regardless of ratings. You have to see the heart of Mr. Miyagi and the director in all of them. I cried in all of them because the feeling of how you connect with what is being portrayed is important to this series.
0060574216|1.0|I'm not one to usually say \\"me too\\", but I wanted to just pile on with the other 1 stars to make sure people understand how wrong this book is.    It offers advice of not being completely open and honest with your partner in order to maintain the relationship.  If a relationship can't maintain honesty AND still be interesting it isn't a relationship.    Talk it out, take the time to listen, and honestly attempt to understand your partner.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I never really do reviews, but Portishead is my favorite band, so I thought that I would write one, even if it is a little bit late.    Each Portishead album has a different sound, but there is definitely something that connects all three. I believe that \\"Third\\" was the appropriate direction for the band to take. It is no longer 1994.    The lyrics are amazing, and the music is amazing. This album is one of my favorite albums of all time, along with the other two Portishead albums.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Being a fan of American history, I found this DVD to be very entertaining and educational. Growing-up in the Boston area, I was facinated by the depiction of Boston in the 1700's. Being from this area, you take for granted the vast amount of history that is all around you.    The movie is incredibly well done and the acting is as close to perfect as you can get. Paul Giamatti is a gifted actor as is his counterpart, Laura Linney. Casting, set design, costuming, script were all exceptional (You will swear that David Morse IS George Washington). You will get engrosed in this film and form a bond with the characters, which makes Part 7 so heartbreaking.    It makes you appreciate the trials and sacrifice that our forefathers endured to give us the freedom and luxuries we enjoy today. It's a painful excercise to compare the politicians of today's world to the men of character, sacrifice and honor that founded this country. I pray that they do not look down upon us in disbelief and sorrow.  As is stated by Adams in the last scene: \\"Oh, posterity. You will never know how much it cost us to preserve your freedom. I hope that you will make a good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in heaven that I ever took half the pains... to preserve it.\\"
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I got this product on time and in great condition as advertised. I love it! Thanks!
B001CWOCV8|4.0|I purchased the DVD format which has very poor sound quality. More like 2.0 rather than 5.0. The Blu Ray is truly 5.0!!! If you have surround sound, do not purchase the DVD, or you will be extremely disppointed as I was. B-ray is the way to go! This is a must have for Commodore or LRichie fans.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I bought two pairs of these because I really liked how they fit and how good the sound quality was.  Unfortunetly both pairs broke within two weeks.  The first pair one of the cords ripped right out of the ear piece, and the second pair, one of the ear pieces doesn't have any sound now.  I'm really disapointed that both pairs broke because I really liked them while they lasted.
B000UX6TRK|4.0|I purchased the DVD also and was very disappointed. It's not even 3.0...more like 1.5.  The Blu ray is really 5.0...Buy the Blu ray version and it's a completely acceptable experience for the surround sound perfectionist!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift and he loved it.  The blue ray aspect is superior.  Even though these are 'old' movies, you could not tell in the graphics at all.  It was impressive.  I found a new appreciation for Rambo after watching these. ;-)
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|It was sealed in plastic wrap, brand new when I received it. I was very satisfied that it work wonderfully with the Sony blue ray player. The quality look exactly like in the theaters and it's better now since I could watch it at home.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|By now I imagine most people are familiar with the basic plot of TROPIC THUNDER, spoiled actors filming a war movie who are dumped in a real war zone by their fed-up director. For me this comedy suffers from very peculiar pacing, with jokes being presented and dismissed with such speed that it seems like viewers are being coddled like children with short attention spans. Many times I thought to myself that I would have laughed at some humorous bit if it had only been presented more skillfully. The entire role of hip hop icon, turned brand mogul turned actor Alpa Chino is dealt with so quickly one feels there must have been drastic pressure to limit the film's running time.<br /><br />The long-running gimmicks, with Tom Cruise in a fat suit as a brutal Hollywood producer and Robert Downey Jr. in blackface speaking African American Vernacular English generally prove the most memorable. Cruise's role is far from the walk-on cameo many might have expected, and especially towards the end his role really dominates the film. The actor might be able to save his career if he focused on more comedic turns like these.<br /><br />I don't think TROPIC THUNDER will show the kind of longetivity of Stiller's earlier film ZOOLANDER, which still charms new audiences years after its theatrical run. See it if it draws you, but you won't miss much if you skip it.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I really liked this movie in theaters and wanted to get it on DVD, but now I could get it in blue ray which is even better! The quality is great and I thought the cover was very neat. It's a good movie to get for your home entertainment. :]

0375826726|5.0|I wouldn't have liked it that much, but the action and the new sword concept were great. Yes, it could have been darker, but it was great enough. Also, the story could have ended in this book, since this is basically a filler. But if you think about it long enough, there NEEDED to be a filler. the final war can't come all of a sudden! So basically it was awesome. Eldest was better. This was better than the first though.
B000002B49|5.0|A magnificent piece. One of my early explorations in Ambient World Electronica, it remains among my highest rated. I also own Deep Forest III, Comparasa, but return to Boheme more often. Great for fans of the genre; the vocalizations may stretch your current paradigm. Also a great experience for people looking to expand their musical preferences.
0810970686|5.0|What a smart and funny book! I kept laughing out loud. I thought I only did that with Dave Barry books.<br /><br />Like the earlier books, this latest installment of the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" series is formatted like an actual diary of a boy in middle school, with lined paper, hand-written text and doodles. There are no conventional chapters, but rather dated entries in chronological order.<br /><br />The diary belongs to Greg Heffley, the self-professed \\"wimpy kid\\" of the title. He is much more than wimpy: he's articulate, self-centered, smart and very funny. In other words, he's a lot like middle-schoolers in general. It's no wonder this series is so popular with kids that age.<br /><br />The Last Straw starts off with Greg getting lame Christmas gifts: a lot of clothes, a book called Math is Rad to help him with algebra, and deodorant. Later Greg tries to convince his frustrated dad not to send him to a military academy.<br /><br />But really, talking about the plot is beside the point. The heart of this book is in the everyday things that happen to Greg, from him getting a melted Easter bunny all over his pants on the way to church -- \\"I must have sat on an ear or something\\" -- to being called a nerd for winning the Perfect Attendance Award in school.<br /><br />I was charmed again by the cartoonish illustrations. These loose black-ink drawings are scattered throughout the text, at least one per page. Many pages have multiple illustrations. Greg draws what he talks about. The familiar cast of characters includes his family -- smart-aleck teenager Rodrick, tiny gnome toddler Manny, often-clueless parents -- and assorted friends, crushes, enemies, neighbors, teachers and relatives.<br /><br />It's surprising how much emotion and subtlety can be conveyed by rubber-armed figures that talk with balloons over their heads.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is now, or has ever been, a middle schooler. Everyone will be able to relate to it. We've all been there. Who hasn't felt like they've disappointed their parents, or didn't know how to talk to a cute classmate, or were mortified by some embarrassing incident in school? This book is for anyone who has not lived up to expectations.<br /><br />As you laugh you'll be nodding your head in recognition.<br /><br />The other Wimpy Kid books are:<br />[[ASIN:0810993139 Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]<br />[[ASIN:0810994739 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]<br />[[ASIN:0810979772 Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself Book]]parents, or didn't know how to talk to a cute classmate, or were mortified by some embarrassing incident in school?

B000FIMG68|5.0|The real identity of the bruised and longsuffering \\"Henry Gale\\" the bug-eyed mystery man allegedly from Minnesota might've been the best storyline of this season, but there was a lot else going on during Lost's twenty-four episode sophomore outing. Season two saw the mysterious hatch opened, introduced new characters and explored in greater depth who the people lost on the island were. Then there was the tail section gang, headlined by the tiresomely ill-tempered Ana Lucia, but including the fascinating Mr. Eko, Libby the \\"clinical psychologist\\", Bernard---our old friend Rose's husband---and a couple dozen more, all of whom inject fresh content into the series and many of whom....meet interesting and sudden ends. Season two might arguably be the best so far in Lost, and it's certainly the one in which the most seems to occur. There's the countdown, the hatch, the cursed numbers, the Others, Desmond, the tail section people, some truly significant flashbacks, and a cliffhanger conclusion that must've brought sheer torment to those waiting for season three to start---lucky us, we only have to put in the next DVD. Special features on disc seven are \\"hosted\\" by none other than the Dharma Initiative's own Francois Chou, and include bloopers (which I don't like to watch, but that's just me) location shots, a dictionary of all things Sawyer-ism, and deleted scenes. Season two is my favorite season of Lost, and it's well represented on this collection.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|What can I say about the abbreviated fourth season? (Gee, thank you, writers' strike...) It was good, yes, at times very good, and yet....I wish it hadn't come down in exactly the way it did. A time or two I found myself internally screaming with frustration and walking away from the TV, only to return to the media room later, dying to know how things turned out. I'll admit this was my least favorite season of Lost, but it was still better than virtually anything else on commercial TV in this plot-deprived \\"reality television\\" decade. Making bold use of flashforwards (think of a flashback turned in the other direction) and showing bit by bit how these revealed moments were reached, this season ships in a boatload of real jerks who bring destruction and mayhem to everybody's favorite island, but it also introduces us to four outsiders whose stories intrigued me as little else has on Lost since season two. The fallout between Locke and Jack is tragic but Sawyer's long-building  redemptive moment on the helicopter with Hugo was sheer brilliance and proves for the hundredth time how evolving Lost's characters continue to be. And then there's that as yet unexplained final shot that reveals exactly who the furtive Jeremy Bentham was, though not why he came to be lying dead in a coffin. Not even Benjamin Linus' shadowy middle of the night confrontation with the sinister Charles Widmore rivaled that in sheer impact. The special features for this season didn't hold my attention as the ones in past DVD anthologies have, with \\"The Right To Bear Arms\\" coming off as downright misplaced on a Lost collection. I enjoyed the deleted scenes, though, the investigation into the conspiracies surrounding the downed flight, and the bit that showed how Lost's excellent soundtrack sees the light of day. There were also maybe the coolest Easter Eggs on this season's DVD's than in any season so far.<br /><br />Season four ultimately contained an inner weakness that was almost unavoidable because of the limitations of its shortened run-time, and because of its existence as in many ways a signpost directing us toward the as yet unaired season five. Whether in retrospect it comes to be regarded as brilliant in its own right or a stepping stone that bridges the old and new remains to be seen. One thing I will say without hesitation is that it's worth owning and it's worth watching.the limitations of its shortened run-time, and because of its existence as in many ways a signpost directing us toward the as yet unaired season five.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|Season three of Lost sees the series travel far from its roots as a show about a small group stranded on an island after a horrific catastrophe. The thing is, the plots in this, \\"the captivity season,\\" are so fast-paced and enthrallingly good, it's not only forgivable, it's a great ride! Answering the season two cliffhanger's burning question of what the heck happens now, the third season takes off like a rocket with Jack, Sawyer and Claire captives of the sinister \\"Others\\" whose brief onscreen moments in seasons one and two never hinted at the extent to which this society is entrenched on the island, or how advanced the Others are. Season three travels in many directions and for once answers more questions than it raises: a rarity in Lost. It is also possibly the most tragic season, with the loss of one particular cast member somehow hitting harder than any of the many deaths in the show to date. The introduction of Juliet Burke, the quiet, unflinchingly pragmatic fertility doctor and oft-dubbed \\"scariest person ever on Lost\\" was probably the highlight of the season, though the fault lines developing among the loyalties of the original Oceanic survivors brought out a soap operatic quality that was one more reason to tune in. Among the special features, the most winsome is probably Evangeline Lilly's behind the scenes moments with the numerous vital but seldom seen crewmembers whose labor brings Lost to the screen. (They all seem to have such a good time together, don't they?) Season three...packs a punch!
B001KL3GWM|3.0|Warm, soulful, bluesy, relaxed: this describes the vibe here. Yet, this is the least Derek Trucks-like the guitarist has ever sounded. The focus has shifted onto the songs and their vocalists; Mike Mattison, Susan Tedeschi, and Doyle Bramhall III, abandoning the more interesting jamming of the past. Mostly, Derek takes a back seat, only really letting loose on three or four cuts. Gone are the elements of Jazz and World music associated with 2006's \\"Songlines\\" and other albums. All told, this outing is pleasant enough, yet most fans will find it overly restrained, if not a little stale. Upon repeated listening it simply lacks the payoff of Derek's earlier albums. It seems to be crafted with a more adult-contemporary, or mainstream, audience in mind. It suffers as a result.

0316017922|5.0|I liked this book better than his other two books. The other two seemed more about theory and abstractions: how intuition and cause and effect work in everyday life.  This one, on the other hand, is about people with obvious success based on talent and skill or opportunity. How did those things happen?   Outliers is an antidote to those who think talent and success is innate, or if only you are clever, smart and hard working enough you will succeed.  This is a general popular book not written for psychological study, but it provides plenty of angles to think about the effect of culture on life.   And NO, emotional intelligence is not what the book is about. In fact proponents of EI say it is innate. You are born socially emotionally adept or not. Gladwell is stating the opposite -- people's success and social graces are culturally determined from a young age.   Is it an obvious idea? No it's not. Otherwise we wouldn't be bombarded with \\"anyone can be a success if they tried hard enough stories\\".  It also brings up the idea of fate and free choice even though the topic is not addressed directly.
B00133KFGW|5.0|As an visual artist, I found that this movie really resonated with me. It is a movie about creative genius: What is the creative process? Where does it come from? The story line is not extraordinary, but the poetic, spiritual and philosophical explorations of the nature of the process are--whether the expression is musical, poetic, visual or mathematical, I would say.
0142000663|5.0|EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK! I believe this book has changed something inside me I just cannot explain right now. The wounds are too fresh.

I ask you as you read it to put yourself in their shoes! What would you do, and how would you react?<br />I can honestly say I am of no political persuasion so it was easy for me to relate to the Joads' frustrations of identity.

B0000019HU|5.0|\\"Spiderland\\" is a fitting name for this excellent album.<br /><br />With its dark jangly guitars, whispered and shouted vocals, and unconventional melodies, this album is a world entire, a creepy place where there's something unexpected around every corner.<br /><br />You can liken it to other music by other bands--the aforementioned vocal tactics call to mind the Pixies, while the artfully dissonant guitar noise made me think of Sonic Youth. But this is one of those classic albums that is more than the sum of its parts and greater than the average of its influences. The songs are mesmerizing and chilling, fragile and strong; the guitars and vocals are bipolar, moving without warning between depression and aggression. And when you're done with them, they're not done with you--they come back again and again, like demented spirits haunting your psyche. (And it's usually the guitar parts that get stuck in your head, so you'll be muttering \\"Dih-dah-dih-dah-dih-dah-dih-dah-da-na-na-na\\" under your breath all day until your co-workers start looking at you funny and you end up putting on your headphones and listening to this again because it's already playing in your head.)<br /><br />But it's not like that's a bad thing. \\"Spiderland\\" may be a strange place, but you won't want to leave.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I'm sure if anybody paid attention to lists I made when I was a lot younger on this site, I'd get one heck of a backlash for giving a Katy Perry album 4 1/2 stars. Of the lists I have made, they're about metal music. Course these were written 'back in the day' when I was too young to really care about writing extensive reviews on a product. Oh, silly me and my youthful ignorance.<br /><br />Pretty much any teenager in this world has heard a Katy Perry song, whether it's 'I Kissed a Girl,' 'Hot N Cold', or 'Ur So Gay', and have loved them. That is, if you're one of the people that can appreciate different genres of music, and a lot of these emo/goth kids definately aren't that way. Katy Perry would be, if anything, a guilty pleasure to them.<br /><br />Well, it isn't that way here.<br /><br />I will openly admit, and without shame, that I love Katy Perry's debut album. I know, that takes credits off of my record for fans of straight up metal, but I really don't care- I like what I like and you like what I like. You still want to give me crap, you're better off doing it somewhere else, because I don't care.<br /><br />Like I have said before, I am a metalhead. My favorite bands are Sonata Arctica (who's symbol I have tattooed on my arm), Ensiferum, and Moonspell, but there's something so lovable about Katy's album that makes it hard for me at least to resist. It's actually not that hard to explain, but I will come through with that in a bit. What does matter is that I do thoroughly enjoy what Katy brought to the table here, which is straight-forward pop with a twist.<br /><br />We have the radio numbers, of course, as with any pop rock band. The singles 'I Kissed a Girl,' 'Hot N Cold', 'Ur So Gay', and 'Thinking Of You' are all killer tracks from this album, if not among the best. 'Ur So Gay' is a complete departure from the norm of the album, not really employing the electric guitars but going for more of a Queen feel, with the use of strange instruments and melodies. Granted, Katy comes nowhere close to the genius that is Queen, but she does the best with what she has, and she does a damn good job at it.<br /><br />Then again, there isn't really a truly weak cut on this album. They all have their own distinct flavor, with some of them being truly downtrought to others being straightforward upbeat songs. For downtrought, we have 'Thinking of You' and 'I'm Still Breathing' (which is a song that usually gets me through my days), and for rocking songs we have 'Hot N Cold' and 'I Kissed a Girl'. But that is not all! We have the experimental song 'Ur So Gay', which will work for some people and won't for others. Then there's the lesser known tracks like 'Mannequin' and 'Fingerprints' that are truly powerful even though they were left off of the radio lists. Every song on this album has some sort of sweet appeal, especially the more than catchy and wonderful 'Wakin Up In Vegas.' How do you go wrong with a title like that?<br /><br />The problem with this album is that it's hard to take seriously. Sure, when songs like 'Thinking of You' (which is a totally moving song) and 'I'm Still Breathing' come on, it's not hard at all, because pretty much anyone can relate to them, men or women. But how many men can relate to 'Ur So Gay'? I know Katy didn't write that song for men, but it's hard for her male listeners (the straight ones, at least) to fully grasp the depth of that song. I am straight, and I still understand what she meant, but most straight males don't feel the same.<br /><br />But overall, there truly IS something for everyone on this disc. The problem is, most people won't give it a chance if they don't like this type of music, and that is a damn shame.he genius that is Queen, but she does the best with what she has, and she does a damn good job at it.

B0006ZE7G2|2.0|I'm a fan of the wall.  I was hoping for a good 5.1 transfer.  The 5.1 sucks!!!  The stereo version is much better sounding.  They funnel all the vocals in to the center channel speaker.  It sounds out of place,they should of kept the vocals true to the orginal recording(L&R).  I would not buy again.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I've been waiting, watching for the Two-Disc Director's Cut to show up, not some nine dollar item after all these years. These discs promise to be the best studio release of Barbra's work. The color, sound, etc. will be excellent and so will the experience of seeing Yentl in widescreen.<br />  Academy Award winning musical score by Michel Legrand and Marilyn and Alan Bergman is devine. Thank you MGM/UA for finally sharing Barbra's work with us!  xox, clc
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I love this show. It's smart, funny and quirky. The dialog is just great and the pop cultural references are always entertaining.

6305971935|5.0|Along with winning the award for worst hair, EVER, the 80s were also obsessed with time travel, as it housed some of the stalwarts of the genre (Back to the Future), but in addition to the cinematic classics, were some filmmakers with a creative imagination, but cheesy execution. Stewart Raffill, creator of uber-cheesy E.T. knockoff, \\"Mac and Me,\\" with the help of producer John Carpenter, takes on the old urban legend and makes a time travel movie out of it. Two sailors from the fated ship fall through a wormhole created by the experiment, and end up in the 80s.<br /><br />The concept and action keep it afloat with some surprising cinematography, and entertaining action sequences dictated by it's chase elements. Of course, the real cheese comes towards the end, with a somewhat forced romance, a little bad acting, and a climax that could have been better. Of course what do you expect with a small budget in the 80s. What you do get is a prime candidate for a remake, and a creative cult classic from the 80s.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This was and still is a great movie!  Plenty of laughs!  Buy it, you won't regret it!
B001K98MFU|5.0|The Dreamworks release of this film is notorious for its flub on the \\"subtitles\\", but that isn't the only issue I have with it. But all has been made well with this Bandai Blu-Ray. The visuals are even more staggering, the subtitles have been fixed, and for those more comfortable with an English soundtrack, it's here. Even the cover art has been changed, and is a significant improvement. Thank you, Bandai!<br /><br />This is a complex film, and rewards the viewer with multiple showings. It CAN be \\"talky\\" at times, but I consider that a plus in a genre that too often devolves into giant robots and overly-endowed women. Watch it once for the images, and then sit back and take in the story.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|What can be said about a soundtrack from Howard Shore?  Not only does this one surpass the other Lord of the Rings (Complete Recordings), but it offers a wider variety to listen to.  The Rohan theme that was prevalent in the Two Towers returns, but it is far surpassed by the magnificent, honor-driven (yet decaying) Gondor theme that becomes the centerstone of Gandalf and Aragorn's themes.<br /><br />However, the soundtrack had a few things that were bothersome.  Whereas the other two complete soundtracks had the songs in the order that they were heard in the movies, the Return of the King had several that were out of order.  Also, some songs were mixed together and that made it harder to envision the scene they were described.  Not that these are all that irritating (not even enough to remove half a star), but it was mildly annoying to someone who likes the Lord of the Rings so much.<br /><br />Overall, the variety and the pure music wonder Howard Shore composed is a very epic soundtrack, with music befitting the scenes and easy to listen to even if you have not recognized the movies.  A must for anyone who loves LotRs.
B000065V41|5.0|Very good I loved this movie because of the songs .  I gave my copy of it to my daughter when she moved to Hawaii so she could have some Christmas shows there...
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This is a great movie,  a classic. I can't believe I had never seen it, even on tv. The movie has twist and turns all throughout with a surprise thrown in to boot. I liked the mix of the bohemian spirit and the innocence.  It is a girlie girl film for sure and a great girls \\"night out\\" movie at home.  Buy this movie for a keeper if you like frivolty, bohemian life styles and zany old fashioned movies now and again, just for the enjoyment. It is fun seeing the late George Peppard so young along with Audrey Hepburn in her youth. Great, silly, funny, and romantic...all in one! LM
0321344758|5.0|From the school of minimalism, Steve Krug goes through point by point the smaller (and larger) touches that can turn a website into either an annoyance or exactly what the user is looking for.  While the examples in this edition are slightly outdated, the information remains.  Similarly, it remains broadly applicable to other aspects of design, such as software or complex system user interfaces.<br /><br />I found this in certain fundamental ways to be quite basic, in that he doesn't expound on practical limitations of large site development.  But by the same token, its reductionist charm left me feeling like I really could implement simplified site mechanics while solidly reaching one of many targeted userbases.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0015OKWL2|4.0|Lambasted by the critics, \\"Righteous Kill\\" is actually a good movie with a clever story.  Granted, I figured out who the real killer is early on, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this is a suspenseful cop thriller.<br /><br />Perhaps the critics savaged \\"Righteous Kill\\" because of its politically incorrect dialogue, specifically in regards to women.  In any case, it doesn't matter.  What matters is this movie has an interesting story, top-notch actors in Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, and hard-hitting action.  I give it three and a half stars.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Fete of Death\\"
B000000OAC|5.0|News of the world was Queen's 6th album and another great one, and put them on even another level of popularity with the songs 'we will rock you' and 'we are the champions.' NOTW doesn't get the respect it should by rock critics with songs like 'sheer heart attack' 'it's late' and 'spread your wings' being so brilliant.  Also, 'my melancholoy blues' is one of my personal favorites. Queen were on fire in the 70's.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|The Derek Trucks band continue to develop into an entity in and of itself, not just a solo offshoot of The Allman Brothers Band. Everything about this album is inspiring, starting with the cover itself. I sense a very intentional theme of rising above the fray of life, and the ridiculousness of life in America in 2008/2009. It's a very forward thinking album, and looks more to the horizon than to the past. \\"It's always darker before the dawn\\" reads a line in \\"Maybe It's time.\\" It's as eclectic as Songlines, and only time will tell which one I'll come to like better. The cohesiveness of this band is very apparent and you get a sense of brothers of the road making music that feeds the desires of their souls. Songlines have been an obsession of mine ever since I first heard it, and I have been waiting not-so-patiently for the follow up ever since. This band takes their music in the direction I wish music in general would go towards in the last part of this horrible, failed decade that has started out the new millennium. Overall, the music scene in America has been an embarrassment for a very long time. But real art in the form of music is starting to make a come-back, and I only hope it overwhelms the mainstream to replace [...] like American Idol, 50 Cent, Hinder, Nickelback, and the endless supply of generic manufactured bands that has helped destroy America's soul and intellect. The age of the \\"mega rock star\\" is over, or so we should all hope.
B00009Z576|5.0|Back in college, I had this album recorded in a tape and I listened to it on-and-offly the whole year.

0743270754|5.0|Goodwin's book--published in 2005--got new attention when Barack Obama chose some of his opponents in the Democratic primaries for high positions in his administration.  The surface parallels are interesting, particularly as Lincoln, like Obama, picked his chief rival for Secretary of State.  It will bear watching whether Hillary Clinton will be for him what Henry Seward became for Lincoln:  his closest confidant and greatest supporter in the cabinet.  Of more significance, however, is the way that Goodwin portrays the complexities of the time and how Lincoln was perceived by many of his contemporaries as temporizing and sometimes vacillating.  As the author shows, these were not weaknesses in Lincoln, but signs of his superb sense of what could be accomplished.  Goodwin is an unabashed admirer of our sixteenth President, and she makes a very convincing case for his wisdom, modesty and compassion.  One of the few weaknesses I have found is is that, having over 700 pages of text and over 900 pages in total length (with extensive notes and a somewhat limited index) this is not the kind of book that is hard to put down, but the kind that is hard to pick up.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|The ending of the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" TV show left some threads dangling -- for one thing, the Ori were still threatening the world with conversion or death.<br /><br />Fortunately that particular thread is decisively tied up in the direct-to-DVD movie that followed: \\"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\\" While it doesn't quite have the unique flavour of the TV series -- and the Ark seems like a rather pat quickie solution -- the movie does bring back all the favorite characters in a satisfactory ending.<br /><br />\\"The Ark of Truth\\" is an Ancient device that brainwashes people -- and SG-1 is searching for it, where they run into Vala's ex-hubby Tomin (who ends up teaming up with them). But soon they have a lead on where the Ark might be, and head for Celestis in the hopes of finding a bloodless method of stopping the Ori once and for all.<br /><br />Unfortunately they have a slew of new problems -- Ori motherships are approaching Earth with the intent to convert or destroy, a nasty IOA rep has created and loosed a very familiar enemy on the Odyssey, and Vala's malevolent daughter Adria has gained godlike power. Fortunately SG-1 has a powerful ally of their own.<br /><br />Since \\"The Ark of Truth\\" is basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as such they're not quite as satisfying as the television show was. Unfortunately it sometimes feels rather rushed and has a somewhat out-of-the-blue solution (hello magic fix-all!), as well as a subplot involving ANOTHER superpowerful villain race that seems likely but a bit misplaced.<br /><br />But as half of the series finales, it's a solid piece of work -- lots of action, space battles, mysterious artifacts, and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. Fortunately that budget doesn't mean it jettisons the intriguing twists (Adria has an unexpected new position) or the moral dilemmas raised by the Ark (and the question of fighting evil faux gods vs. their followers).<br /><br />It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, \\"Star Trek\\" homages, witty dialogue (\\"Well, you don't expect me to remember.\\" \\"With the fate of two galaxies hanging in the balance, yes, I expect you to remember the essential clue!\\"), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts.<br /><br />And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder does a good strong, slightly quirky soldier. Christopher Judge gets to shine in  as a powerful, wise warrior, and Black gets to be both funny (\\"I have broken every nail\\") and emotional.<br /><br />While it's a bit rushed and contrived, \\"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\\" is a solid enough finale to the Ori storyline.

0689853637|3.0|After seeing Sabuda's Chronicles of Narnia, I have to say that this book just isn't nearly as impressive.  Good, but not as good.
0307454894|4.0|I had this book in my shelf for years.  Only when I realized it had been made into a movie, did I pull it off to read it.  I wanted to have the full details before seeing the film.  At any rate, it was a good book.  It's short, well-written, and I think, brings up a lot of food for thought.  One of my favorite quotes is:  The Truth of What One Says, Lies in What One Does.<br /><br />It was actually a sad tale that brought up questions about whether we really know a person.  And if we fall in love and discover that the person is not whom we thought, do we continue to love them, or can the horror (if that's the case) of what they've done, erase what one feels?<br /><br />I think the book is good and worth a read.  It won't take up too much of your time.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Chris & Chris make a great pair!  Christopher Nolan, director, does a great job in this film.  Christian Bale, actor, complements him perfectly.  He was the right pick for the role.  This movie definitely makes my Top 100!

They're light weight.  The sound is wonderful which I didn't even realize until I was desperate and bought a Maxell set that were simple awful (it had a tin sound).  I specifically like them because I just can't keep those cute little ear buds in my ears no matter how many tips I've tired.  The only minus is I wish the cord was a bit longer because in the winter I have my CD player in my coat pocket and during all the other times it is in my back pack.

009917331X|5.0|I severely dislike biographies and autobiographies. Biographies are just hearsay and gossip. Whereas, Autobiographies are rarely inspiring, with most of them being self-absorbed and boring. There are many exceptions I allow in Autobiographies, since there are quite a few good ones, but rarely have I found interest in a biography.    But as always I love anecdotes from the famous people themselves. So this wonderful book by Feynman is autobiographical but not an autobiography. Just like my previous acquisition of President Eisenhower's anecdote collection - \\"At Ease: Stories I tell my friends\\", this one too gives a thrilling look at the daily lives of people that changed the world.    The book is divided into 5 parts - His childhood home to MIT, years in Princeton, the bomb and military work, Cornell, Caltech and Brazil trip, and finally his life as a physicist.    Each of these parts have wonderful episodes from his life and the people he met. He explains his interest in science, the luck he has had, the thoughts he pondered, the things he tried, the life he led.    A man with varied interests, he was a physicist in the time when no one knew what a physicist could be employed for. He faked speaking Italian, played assorted pranks on his neighbouring children, he behaved as himself in MIT as well as the British themed Princeton. His interests are as diverse as in biology, philosophy, safe-cracking, mindreading, human sense of smell compared to a bloodhound, Japanese culture/ etiquette, Las Vegas, bar-hopping, playing in a street band in Brazil's carnival, painting, painting nude women, Jewish and other religious beliefs, dislike of celebrity life after the Nobel prize, Mayan codex and math, providing music for a ballet, out-of-body experience, playing drums, etc, etc, etc.    This winner of Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 and team member under Los Alamos atom bomb scientists has had an incredible and adventurous life.    I would say his insatiable curiosity about hisworld is what made him a great scientist, an adventurer and popular with every professor or peer or student.     He spoke his mind, irrespective of speaking to illustrious people such as Einstein or Pauli or anyone else. Because when he spoke of physics he always gave his best theory and deductions.    My favourite chapters? It would be very difficult to say. Like in \\"You just ask them\\" a bargirl and her husband tell him that if he wanted to bed a woman, why doesn't he simply try and ask them. Various other social experiments ensue. In \\"I want my dollar!\\" and \\"An offer you must refuse\\" he tells about how the scientists at Los Alamos sold their ideas and patents to US Government for a dollar (formality) and how he managed to claim his dollar; with the latter chapter telling us how he saw honour in work and teaching rather than earning easy money.     \\"A different box of tools\\" illustrates the value of self-learning and how he managed to find new ways while everyone else tried to solve things by what they had been taught as the correct method.    His daring mischief is brought out to the forefront in \\"Uncle Sam doesn't need you!\\" when Feynman plays around with the team of psychiatrists evaluating him for fitness for Military enrolment. \\"Who stole the door?\\" in the first part of the book shows you how Feynman has always been mischievous and gets away with most pranks.    But if you were to ask me of one chapter alone; if you as a reader had time for nothing in the book except to read one chapter alone; I would highly recommend you to read the very last one - \\"Cargo Cult Science\\".    This last chapter is easily the very best advice a scientist or teacher can give eager students of science. It shows clearly how education is supposed to train you to solve rather than train you to imitate.    Feynman clearly led a fulfilling and enriched life. The fact that someone could have such a rewarding diverse life experience (that too back in 50s 60s) makes me want to crawl undera rock and die in shame.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a retired Ford Assembly Worker, living in the Detroit neighborhood he has called home for decades, is one racist man. Archie Bunker would turn red and blush if he were to hear some of the things coming from Walt's mouth. But this is what makes Eastwood's performance so interesting and believable. Because Walt is so unapologetically racist, he gets involved with a number of people and in a number of situations that he would normally have shied away from. But these same situations and people start to give his life new meaning and new purpose. That said, the best thing about \\"Gran Torino\\" is that even if Walt becomes more accepting of his neighbors and their customs, he doesn't stop being racist and sort of uses it as a crutch to remain a little detached from them.<br /><br />Walt's wife has just died and he is not happy to see his grand kids show up at the funeral late, in completely inappropriate attire and playing with their game boys and cell phones. At the wake, back at his house, his grand daughter hints/ asks him who might get his mint condition 1972 Gran Torino when he dies. He scowls at her and walks away. He scowls at his son, a Toyota salesman before the family drives away, relieved to have completed their family duty for the day. After the wake, he sits on his porch with his faithful Lab, drinking Pabst, watching his neighbors, scowling at them. He sees a bunch of Asian faces where there used to be nice, Caucasian American families. Families that kept their houses neat and tidy. He watches a bunch of people entering the house next door and we soon learn that Sue (Ahney Tor) and her younger brother, Thao (Bee Vang) are living with their mother. Sue is smart and doesn't take any crap from Walt, trying to educate him about her family and her people. Soon, Thao is forced into an initiation prank by one of his cousins, who is eager for Thao to join his gang. They want Thao to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Walt puts a kibosh on the effort, scares the young man and forbids Thao from ever stepping on his property again. But Sue and her mom insist that Thao has disgraced them and must work off his shame. Walt puts him to work in a unique way and he grows a little fond of the young man, recognizing that he needs a male influence in his life. But the cousin's gang is becoming more persistent and Walt decides to put a stop to this.<br /><br />There are so many elements in \\"Gran Torino\\" that shouldn't work, that don't have a right to work, but in the hands of Eastwood, one of the most competent and reliable directors working today, these same elements seem to be slight obstacles, leading him to a better film, a more interesting film.<br /><br />Eastwood is basically the only 'name' in the film and this could be problematic. But in a way, it proves to be a smart choice, very smart. Because Eastwood is surrounding himself with a cast of largely unknown actors, he diminishes himself and makes Walt seem more real. Yes, it's Clint Eastwood playing the role, but he blends into the woodwork more when people who just look more normal surround him.<br /><br />Walking a little slower, speaking in a low surly voice, we get the picture of Walt very quickly. Walt spent many years on the Ford Assembly line and takes great pride in the work he did and in the work he still does around the house. For this reason, when he scans his neighborhood and sees paint peeling or missing roof shingles, it breaks his heart a little, causing him to feel a little more defeated each day. It's also a huge disappointment that his grandkids aren't more respectful and that his son makes a living, a good living selling Toyotas. So, when the Asian people begin to move in, he stares at them with a sneer, never bothering to say hello or offer his name. They are one of the many problems leading to the downfall of his neighborhood, which contributes to his sadness.<br /><br />But Walt is also tough and isn't about to let some punk kid steal a car he himself helped to build. He scares the kid off; Thao didn't want to do it anyway, feeling pressured into the prank by his cousin and his buddies. But Walt also recognizes that Thao needs some help, some guidance. He's basically a good kid, so Walt agrees to let him work off his shame. As he does this, doing many tasks around the neighborhood, Walt seems to delight when the neighbors start requesting Walt send Thao to their house. He also recognizes that Thao needs some guidance, to stay away from the gangs, to stay out of jail. So, he takes on the project.<br /><br />As Walt becomes more familiar with Thao and Sue, their mother and grandmother, his world begins to expand. Thankfully, this is a slow and laborious process. He initially eschews the gifts the neighbors bring him after he helps Thao and Sue, but when Walt gets a taste of the food, he starts to accept it, the Mung ladies of the neighborhood showering him with enough food to make him fat.<br /><br />But the cousin is also persistent and his gang won't take no from Thao, so they become more violent. Initially, Walt is able to simply beat them up, but they have guns and egos and return. With each return, the level of potential violence increases and Walt soon realizes he has to do something or these two kids won't have a chance.<br /><br />The two kids who play Sue and Thao are both good and complete unknowns. It was smart of Eastwood to cast these new actors in these roles, making their performances seem more lifelike and interesting. They could be playing themselves for all we know. Perhaps they have experienced similar circumstances in their already young lives. Maybe not, but their performances give no hint to professional training and each seems perfectly natural.<br /><br />The young gang members are the showiest and therefore the most theatrical. They are right on the verge of becoming caricatures, but Eastwood pulls them back just enough and there is a hint of the insecure kid in each of them which prompts them to join a gang in the first place. This very insecurity is what leads them to try to recruit Thao, they watch as a very similar car of Latino gang members bullies him.<br /><br />It seems like a lot of the movie is spent watching Walt sit on his porch, drinking beer, watching the neighborhood as he silently stews. This should help contribute to a boring film, but because we are watching Eastwood, our eyes never leave the screen. As he sits and watches, we can almost see the thoughts going through his mind; why did Mrs. Panacek leave the neighborhood and sell her house to the Asians who are no unable to mow the yard. This used to be such a nice neighborhood. I remember playing catch with my two sons on this street, in the middle of the street, waving to the neighbors as they return home.

It seems like a lot of the movie is spent watching Walt sit on his porch, drinking beer, watching the neighborhood as he silently stews. This should help contribute to a boring film, but because we are watching Eastwood, our eyes never leave the screen. As he sits and watches, we can almost see the thoughts going through his mind; why did Mrs. Panacek leave the neighborhood and sell her house to the Asians who are no unable to mow the yard. This used to be such a nice neighborhood. I remember playing catch with my two sons on this street, in the middle of the street, waving to the neighbors as they return home.

0525951113|4.0|Billionaire computer game creator Matthew Sobol left a surprise for the world when he died of cancer.  He created a computer program that would be unleashed upon his death that would create chaos and reengineer society.  Sobol's unlimited wealth and pure genius allows him to create a program that reaches out from the internet to murder people, gain control of corporations and co-opt the lives of the living.  In short, Sobol's Daemon program has the potential to take over the world.    Mr. Suarez does a tremendous job of making this premise sound plausible.  The only things keeping me from giving this book a five-star rating are the extended passages that describe video game play and the action passages that just sound like the synopsis of someone playing a video game.  Perhaps Mr. Suarez was writing these action sequences with trap doors, gunplay, explosions, fast cars,  and motorcycle chases with the movie rights to \\"Daemon\\" in mind.    Video game constructs play an important part in this book, but some of these game-like sequences seemed to go on and on.  Still, \\"Daemon\\" is a fun book with some interesting ideas.
B001676320|4.0|This was a perfect gift for the person who has an upgraded home theater system and enjoys music concerts on DVD.  The picture and sound were amazing.  The item was shipped promptly and very well protected.  Thank you for your service.
0810970686|5.0|Fantastic - as much fun as the first three.  I was a real-life wimpy kid and I did end up at West Point so this installment was even more fun for me.  My daughter loves this series.  Jeff Kinney delivers again - the \\"Diary\\" is so funny and fast-paced that even \\"reading wimps\\" can't put the book down. The format of fun cartoon drawings and true-to-life stories that kids & adults alike can relate to make this a must-buy for your young reader. (Or adults that didn't totally grow up)
B001CW7MFQ|5.0|The title of this review is taken as excerpt from the lyrics of the opening song \\"Land of Sunshine.\\" I find it appropriate in that one of the best albums of the early nineties is back (in limited edition gold-disc remaster.)<br /><br />After the commercial success of Faith No More's \\"The Real Thing\\" they followed it with a very Mike Patton influenced and eclectic album that is \\"Angel Dust.\\" Though there were songs very worthy of air-play on this album, it seems the band decided to make a \\"less radio-friendly\\" album. The results were amazing. Gone was the nasal tone of Patton's \\"Epic-\\" chorus vocals replaced by a more sinister and variable styling.<br /><br />While \\"The Real Thing\\" was indeed a very influential and original work, this one showed a side of FNM that can not even be duplicated by the bands of today that wish to feebly emulate it. (Marilyn Manson shamelessly aped the chorus of \\"Be Aggressive\\" in his song \\"Mob Scene.\\" Korn, Disturbed, etc. all try AND fail.)<br /><br />Be all of that as it may, this particular release will likely only appeal to the collector and self-proclaimed audiophile. If you wish to rip this to a portable player (ie; iPod or Zune,) you'd be better served to just buy the original release. They took the volume down on most of the mix for this limited (10,000 numbered copies) re-release. This will not bode well for those seeking an MP3 listening experience. However if you have high-end audio equipment, you may hear a difference as a result.<br /><br />The 24-Karat gold disc is a nice touch. I doubt it makes a real difference in playback readability but it looks pretty cool. As a note to vinyl fanatics, this album is also re-released as a record.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|I loved this movie in the theaters and if one has a big screen TV - this DVD is perfect.  The scenery in this movie is great - feels like you're in Greece.  So, buy it - enjoy it,over and over!!!  They even have a version where the lyrics are on the screen for one to sing along!  Enjoy!

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|My husband and 3 sons thought this was the best movie ever!  They especially loved the ending because Batman does the selfless thing and allows people to believe and hope.  I highly recommend this movie.  It has a lot of food for thought.  Great plot!  Acting was great.  Awesome!

I could identify with many of his adjustments and changing situations. I found it helpful to understand him and his personality as we welcome him, his family and his administration to Washington. I continue to be in awe of his intellect and ability to express his ideas.  Mary Liz Bauer

B000FP2OPY|5.0|A cross between \\"Route 66,\\" \\"Friday the 13th-the Series,\\" and the late, lamented \\"X-Files,\\" \\"Supernatural is one of television's best dramas.  Blending horror, sci-fi, religious overtures, and dysfunction in the family, the show deserves a wider audience.<br /><br />Basically, even with its \\"monster-of-the-week\\" format, the show centers around the brothers Winchester and their quest to rid the country of demons, werewolves, and other little \\"beasties.\\"  Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles are very good in their roles as the brothers, playing so well off each other that it's hard to not think that they are related.  The creators of the show have given Ackles - as the elder \\"Dean\\" - the chancee to be the more sardonic of the two, making a balance to Sam's (Padalecki) \\"innocence.\\"<br /><br />If the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences weren't so biased against the fantasy/sci-fi genre, the two young men would've garnered \\"Best Actor\\" nominations for this landmark first season.<br /><br />The writers also place the pair in situations that rely on both their physical strength and mental acumen in order to defeat the things that go bump in the night, of which it seems that the country is plagued with.<br /><br />The show's Vancouver locations add to gloomy and dark story lines, although they are sometimes not quite as believable when trying to pass them off as mid-America.<br /><br />The third star of the show is the black 1967 Impala that transports the boys to their \\"jobs.\\"  However, if the boys try to be inconspicuous, that car isn't the one to blend into the crowd.<br /><br />Also, the pair must have deep pockets in order to travel around the country, with no visible means of financial support.<br /><br />This compilation should win additional fans to a show that already has a devoted following...of which I am one.

B001BN1VIA|5.0|When the Japanese do things they tend to do it right and the whole issuance of these Mini-LP-CD's has been a blast from the past with true care for the sound of the album.  While ordinary CD's can sound quite nice at 16 bit, there are HDCD's High Definition versions which use either 20 or 24 bit recording technology adding 25 to 50% more musical information to a CD. This results in warmer and fuller sounding music from the disc and most modern CD players have the technology built in.    Here the offering is 24 bit and with 50% more of the music information filling in all those little holes, making this cd is a joy to hear. After listening on my pretty good sounding system I took it to my friend's house to listen to on his basic $25K plus audiophile system and it has definately been a blessing to hear. Sweeter, warmer and a fuller sound than your regular CD's.      Side One  Aqualung / Cross Eyed Mary / Cheap Day Return / Mother Goose / Won'dring Aloud / Up to Me     \\"Side Two\\"  My God / Hymn 43 / Slipstream / Locomotive Breath / Wind Up    Presentation is superb as a Japanese Mini-LP-CD instead of the jewel case the CD is presented as a miniature of the original vinyl album was released, so here there is a mini gatefold album cover the linernotes and an extra sheet in Japanese of the album's information.  It also has the Miniature OBI the slip of paper that is around the one side of the original album that is a Japanese tradition. (As a Side Note: Japanese pressings are pretty much audiophile for vinyl albums to begin with and so the audiophile guys look for the Obi as proof of origin and quality.)  This is why the listing while on one CD shows the original yinyl album song line up for sides one and two.    Those not old enough to have heard this album may not realize that the entire album was FM radio fodder and just about every cut is really something to listen to musically and for the meaning of the songs.  It deals with \\"bums\\" low class people who are destituteand are doing what ever to get by, the lack of care for them, and how it seems the organized religion does not help but is a place of pompusness. He rails against not Christianity but against those that control the religion.  It is a quintesential phase of Jethro Tull music to have in your library if you like Tull.  It has some of the charming presentation of the early stuff, but is not as much hippie music as a more hard rock mix with classical to Renaisance Fair to Mideval undertones and remains a musical tour de force.  It is very \\"English\\" but it was really well received by the US listeners and the Hits from this release Locomotive Breath, Cross Eyed Mary and the title cut Aqualung blasted Jethro Tull into a higher fame plane of orbit here in the US market.    Other albums worth a listen ARE: Thick As A Brick which has a similar musical outlook, and then Warchild which has some changes in delivery but is very interesting. If you like Hippie styled music the early stuff is fabulous too like Stand Up.    So if you have a low end stereo or do those horrid MP3's - don't bother with the good copies from Japan, it's a waste of the HDCD technology, get the regular CD.  But if your stereo of Home Theater is in the good / better / best type and you'd like to hear a fine version but don't need to deal with an SACD or DVD-Audio version, these Mini-LP-CD's are the ticket.    Happy Listening!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Daughter asked me to buy this dvd, I rented the movie to see what all the fuss was about and it turned out to be a good movie. So I bought both Step-Up movies for my daughter.
0441009425|4.0|First and foremost, this novel rewards those who stick it out.  There's a big idea at the center of it and the story is built around the Fermi Paradox (which in a nutshell asks why the galaxy isn't teeming with thousands of interstellar civilizations - or in other words, why can't we easily find them).    It takes awhile to begin to understand what the novel's about however, and it's not helped by the way the author starts from three separate points of view in three different time periods, all of which come together about midway through the book.  Additionally, there are numerous references to other events even further back in the past, which have a huge impact on the future.  Even though I don't require plots to be extremely straightforward, I feared I'd be lost or forget crucial information when it was necessary.  Fortunately, the author 'summarizes' a lot, and does so in relatively natural ways (usually characters talking to each other).  One nice thing about the three different starting points is that it shows the effects of relativity in a very clear and easily understood way, without actually going into the physics of it.  For someone who understands the basics of relativity, and how velocity can affect time, it's well done, but if someone doesn't understand relativity they might be a bit confused.    One thing the author did which always drives me a bit nuts, is to have a character suddenly understand a lot more than the reader, but the reader is still left in the dark.  One character, at one point obviously gets let in on a major revelation but the reader doesn't hear the explanation related.  This character later tells another character, and again the explanation is not directly relayed to the reader.  I understand that the author wanted to make a big reveal later, but this kind of thing annoys me to no end.  Fortunately, the book itself was good enough to overcome this problem.    The 'revelation' at the end does tie the main story up quite neatly, although there are certainly one or two fringe loose ends.  It even makes things characters do earlier in the book have a bit more context.  It's clever but not really mind blowing.    The writing style is well done, pretty straightforward (except for the jumps in time), and evocative.  The characterizations are pretty good but somewhat on the 'generic' side.  The universe appears to be an interesting one, but that's not really the point of the novel.  The author probably knows his universe inside and out, but only tells us the bits important for the novel itself, and I like that style a lot (certainly more than the 'Gotta make sure the reader understands everything about the universe even if they only need to understand 1% of it for the plot to make sense' method that other writers use).    All in all, it was an enjoyable novel.  It asked the kinds of questions I like to ask, and came up with reasonable answers to them.  The structure makes the book a bit difficult to get into, but the author makes sure you never forget the important details.  Definitely recommended.
B000M341QE|4.0|Excellent movie. What would you expect with Matt Damon, Norton, Decaprio, Wahlberg and Nickolson. Great action, good story line and suspense. The love scenes could have been more believeable but other than that pretty entertaining.
0375842209|5.0|This book truly was a great story.  Beautiful and dark at times.  I would highly recommend this book!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Great movie for the kids (although not historically very accurate) or a relaxing evening at home with your Wife.     Typical Disney story with a happy ending and great music!!! Good story for the whole family.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought a Nikon D40 to take pictures of our new son, and wasn't happy with the way flash pictures looked: too harsh.  I bought this unit for its bounch flash capability and have been very happy with it.  It's small, light, and uses two AA batteries.  It communicates very well with the Nikon: for example, the camera knows when the flash is aimed up, it does can do very nice redeye reduction, and the user can control the power of the flash.  The recycle time is just fine.  I wouldn't recommend it for shooting big groups of people in a very large room with high ceilings, but it's perfect for shooting inside a house with standard-height ceilings.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This entire CD is amazing....Adele has talent well beyond her years and a voice that will blow you away! Very Blues bent with a contemporary twist
B001LPWGE6|5.0|This along with Die Hard and Lethal Weapon are the only Trilogy's that I would buy again in Blue Ray. All Three movies have it all. Action, suspense, bad guys who need punishing and a love story. Damon is a very good actor that delievers in spades. I will not belabour this but again all three movies are excellent.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|The movie- Body Of lies.  First of all Leonardo DiCaprio does agreat acting job, the review stating he looks extremely silly and only 14 years old is so way out!, he looks as usual a hunk and delivers a strong image of the character that he portrays.  Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best news stories to come out of U.S.A, DiCaprio comes across a strong positive man, who will only give to his character roles his best work.  As for that reviewer! I would love to put him in a Kangaroo Pouch and send him on his merry way, after all the movie is full of terrorism, espionage, and detrayal, dont worry mate the CIA will find you.
B001I82RVS|5.0|Inevitably, this will be compared to the Machine Girl in most reviews, but that's a bit unfair to this film because despite all the gore and bizarre plot points, this film is a LOT different than that film... and it's also a lot better.     No matter what anyone says, The Machine Girl was really just an overblown gory comedy; this one, while boasting some really clever and hilarious parts (gotta love the fake television ads, including one with a killer Wii game!), is way darker and more serious and actually has a way more involving storyline, especially in the 2nd half. It is also bit slower and more character-driven; while this approach may turn off some people,  it makes this film feel more real, more vibrant, more cinematic, and makes it way more rewatchable. None of it is boring in the least, of course -- in fact, this is one of the most entertaining films I've EVER seen.     Surreal and ultraviolent, and special mention has to be made to whoever did the soundtrack.  A great film for any occasion. I loved it. More energy and great, original ideas than most any film I've seen come out in the past 5 years or so. Highly Recommended!
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn left me with that good feeling a reader looks for in the end.  The Twilight series is packed with suspense and emotional impact.  The author builds the reader up with a few solid expectations.  There's no disappointment in this exciting conclusion.  I can see how some might feel shocked, and actually react negatively, when expectations ARE met - (it's funny how some readers become critical when we receive what we long for); but I truly enjoyed Stephenie Meyer's choices in this last book.  They're lovely.
B000P2A256|5.0|Great album the boys do it again...stays in my car, just can't get tired of it
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Clint Eastwood has played some very memoriable characters and derected some great movies but this one has it all. Walt Kowalsky who is a decorated korean war vet, has just lost his wife and found himself surrounded by a mitt full of other cultures in his neighbourhood. Cultures who he faces in a pretty racist way. But beneith this harsh exterior is a disallusioned soft heart who takes the time to stop a kid from being beat up and a girl from being raped. I went to this movie with my wife and about 300 other souls who looked to be around my age. You could hear the laughter and see the tears rolling all around you. I did the same because this movie touches you on so many levels. Even with the ending this movie is one of the top 5 that I have seen in my 50 years of watching movies. If I could give this a 10 star I would. If you go see just one movie this year make it this one. Academy Award?? I think so.
0525478183|4.0|From the family's 14-year-old John Green fan:<br /><br />Paper Towns by author John Green is a not so guilty pleasure for teens to adults. While the books targeted audience is young adults, after reading the book I found it had a very modern way of introducing deeper ideas that even an adult would enjoy.<br /><br />The wording of the novel projected realistic and hilarious characters. The one negative thing I could say about the book is that while the main character's personality was quirky and I could relate with the character, the other characters didn't have as much to offer substance wise. However, the situations and perspective are well thought out and the descriptions fit well for the imagination.<br /><br />The story encompasses many different journeys. On one side, it's a teen romance, on another side, it's a comedy, on another side, it's a drama, and on yet another side it's a mystery. John Green brings together many great thoughts and ideas without over-wording or forcing them down your throat.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that Paper Towns is an intriguing read that projects very well the more quirky and interesting side of youth.
0452289963|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is interested in discovering power within. It explains how and why one should stop thinking so much about useless ideas and such! It has changed my life. Now, I spend less time worrying, more time laughing, and really joying life around me! That's the whole point of this book! It's great! I highly recommend it!
0307265730|3.0|Having read all of Ms. Lahiri's books, I felt a little let down by this one.  Most of the stories were run of the mill, even a little jaded.  The one exception is the last story  - this brings together all the main themes that run through Ms. Lahiri's very imaginatively, and caps the story with a great ending.    Overall, a good read, but not a patch on the \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\".
B00005JKED|1.0|I repeat the Worst Movie that Denzel Washington has ever made. And He has been in some of the best I have ever seen. As a former police officer I was insulted and repulsed by his portrail of this so called dectective. Enough said.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for two people and received it myself.  Everyone I sent it to loved it.  The music is beautiful and, like most of Enya's music, magical.  I highly recommend it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Great! Didn't leave you hanging at the end like most do (which I hate). Looking forward to getting Season Three on DVD.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I found this tape very boring and very basic beginner level - but a decent workout. It is only 20 minute workouts - I had to do 2 in a row to feel I got enough work in. Great for the really out of shape - boring and too short for higher fitness levels. Plus too much talk!!! I like her on TV - but wasted my money on this dvd.
B000LXH0AY|3.0|I got this dvd and then I realized that it couldn't work in my zone, 'cause it's for being played in USA, not Europe.  I tried to cancel the item but it wasn't possible because it had been already shipped. So I wrote to amazon's help and they told me to refuse the item when it came to my home and my money would be returned.    I'm really grateful to amazon for helping me with facilities.    That won't happen to you if you make sure that you've read all the information about what you're buying! :)
B0017APQ1K|2.0|I was disappointed and confused with the plot. No direction, or real story line. Just to gangs who want to rule New York. Wopty Do.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|I am usually a big fan of Ben Stiller.  Loved Meet the Parents, Dodgeball, even Envy was not that bad.  But this movie tried to do too much.  And Ben Stiller's style of comedy is starting to wear thin (kind of like Will Farrell's).  He should try something different.  And I'm not talking about something along the lines of Simple Jack.  I think maybe he should have a chat with Jim Carey about what to do next.    Robert Downey Jr did his best to try to keep this one going, but even he wasn't good enough to save this turkey.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|This DVD is not a patch on the original VHS release. The camera angles are different, with some of the VHS shots and angles cut out altogether. The sound quality is also pretty poor. One expects to get the same film on DVD as on VHS if the title etc is the same. Bitter disappointment!!
0307269752|4.0|My wife really likes this book.  It took her a little bit to get into it but now, she is hooked.
B000001BZT|4.0|I got this album for my father for Christmas. The only song he had heard on it was Copperhead Road. However, he loved many of the other songs as well. After I listened to it, I had to borrow it too.    Steve Earle isn't one of my favorite artists, but this is still a very good album.
1416955070|5.0|When I first read the summary of City of Bones, I wasn't overly intrigued. But after reading just one page, I learned just how wrong I was. Cassie Clare has created a brilliantly enthrawling and believable story, starting here, with City of Bones.        The book focuses mainly on the almost-sixteen-year-old Clary Fray, whose only friend is the lovable, loyal, and sarcastic Simon, who happens to be in love with her. Within the first few pages, she is thrust into a world she never knew existed. A world of demon slayers (aka shadowhunters), vampires, werewolves, warlocks, and faeries. A world that she may be more closely connected to than she could have ever dreamed.         When she meets the sexy, arrogant, brooding, and angel-faced Jace Wayland, everything in her life changes. After a demon attack, Clary's mother simply dissappears, leaving Clary alone with Jace, and his \\"adoptive\\" shadowhunter siblings, the mysterious and hot-tempered Alec, and the beautiful and confident Isabelle.         From supernatural parties hosted by warlocks, to vampire fights, to the revelation of the infamous villian, Valentine Morgenstern, City of Bones is extraordinarily entertaining.        Jace is easily the most intriguing character in the trilogy, and is very fully developed. All of the characters are multi-dimensional, and described in great detail throughout the novel. From Jace's \\"tawny eyes\\" and \\"golden hair,\\" to Clary's freckled face, small frame, and bright red hair, to Alec's blue eyes and mop of dark scraggly hair. None of the characters are flat, by any means.         There isn't a cliche nerdy girl who gets picked on by cliche mean girls. No. Each character has originality and depth. It is also refreshing that the characters are not simply filthy rich, spoiled, or annoyingly whiny. Each character shows true emotion! The characters also stay consistent, and do not repeatedly seem to change personalities as you may see happen in many other, not as well-written, books.I have gotten so sick and tired of the stuck-up group of girls who think they're cooler than everyone else, and sadly they seem to exist in the majority of YA novels, even fantasy ones. I felt as if this story was very original in this sense. Books such as Blue Bloods, The Morganville Vampires, and House of Night all have the typical witchy girls in them. This is what makes City of Bones so unique (along with many other things, too).         Clare gives superb desciptions of everything, so that I was easily able to picture everything that was happening, and almost felt, at times, that I was there myself. There are no huge chunks of time cut out to save time. It's all real. We know whent the characters are hungry. We know when they are dirty. We know when they're sad, mad, or glad. We know when they're tired, and we know that they are just like you and I in those ways. Most of the characters are also likable one way or another, and therefore are even more easy to connect with.          Clare does not give too much description, and I am, in turn, not forced to skip through boring parts...There simply are NO boring parts to skip through.         This book will keep you interested all the way through with its not stop action, funny yet realistic dialogue and plot twists. Anyone who likes urban fantasy should give this book a try.     I wasn't bored for even one second, and had real trouble putting this book down. In fact, I got so caught up in this book, that I even had dreams about it...which was a first for me. Even after finishing the book, I feel as if the world Clare created still exists, as do the characters. Writing like this can not be replaced, and should not be ignored.           Do yourself a favor, and pick this book up. Read the first page. Then you'll be completely and helplessly hooked!
0545128285|4.0|I loved this book.  My sister loved it.  She read it in like a day she loved it so much.  But that is the problem.  It has some great stories but it is short.  If you were expecting much more Harry Potter you will be disappointed.  But you still should buy it if you love Harry.

006088732X|4.0|Imagine you are BFF with the most popular girl in school. Everyone else wants to be you. Of course you love the power you have that so many people are envious of you, but secretly you truly wonder if being her BFF is a blessing or a curse. Now imagine it's the start of the summer between seventh and eighth grade and you and your BFF are celebrating by having your annual summer sleepover. Things don't go quite as planned and the two of you end up fighting and she walks out of your house. The very next morning you hear from her mom and you just know something terrible has happened. Suddenly days turn into weeks and before you know it the summer has ended, school has started and still no word from your BFF. She just simply disappeared off the face of the earth. Although you do not wish her any harm, you have to admit, there's a part of you that's relieved that she's gone. You start to feel freer and less burdened because all the secrets she knows about you, have vanished along with her. Horrible to think, some might say, but if they knew what she knew about you, they might feel exactly the same.    This is how it is for Aria, Spencer, Hanna and Emily. Alison, Ali, disappears during their slumber party. After her disappearance, the four friends gradually drift apart until no one can even recall they were once friends. It's now three years later and the teens are about to start their junior year. Spencer is very anal, in competition with her older sister about everything (and a certain someone); Hanna is now the new \\"it\\" girl, but carries a terrible secret about her drastic makeover; Aria is back from Iceland with her family and has a crush on a new boy, unfortunately she just found out he's her new English teacher; and Emily is the all-american good girl doing what she can to please her parents, that is until she meets Maya...    All four have secrets, secrets that they want to stay buried. Secrets that only one other person knows about: Ali. During the first week of school, each start to receive texts about their secrets, threatening to expose them. Each text is simply signed \\"A\\" and naturally the girls think Ali is back. But is she? Not only does \\"A\\" haunt them with their past, \\"A\\" knows what they are hiding now. It's as though each girl is being watched.    I really enjoyed this first book of the series and devoured it in one sitting. It's fast-paced, with short chapters and you just want to keep reading to learn more about what each girl is hiding. The story goes back and forth between past and present, but it's not confusing at all. After each girl receives a text, the author will go back to the past to explain its relevancy. Actually, I thought it added to the suspense.    Although this is a young adult novel, I have reservations about preteens reading it. There are mature themes discussed in the book and if younger children read it, I suggest the parents read it as well and have a conversation about these topics.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|If you are problems with your disc, call Disney at 1-800-723-4763. They will send you a prepaid envelope so you can return your disc. They ask what kind of DVD player you are using so that they can send a disc that will work for you. I ordered my first disc through the Disney website. It skipped, so I returned it. They accidently sent me two copies as a replacement. Both of these copies skipped. I found the 800 number on the internet and am awaiting the arrival of my pre-paid envelope.     In my experience, with 3 discs, the packaging does not scratch the disc. We looked them over carefully. They look perfect, but they still skip. I read on-line that it is a formatting issue, not a scratch issue. My electronic copy works great.     I gave the movie 5 stars because it is an awesome movie. At some point, they will resolve the disc issues. I would hate to see people pass on the movie because it got a bad rating due to disc problems!    We weren't sure we wanted to see this movie at first. It looked so bleak! We decided to chance it because we love the Pixar films so much. It turned out to be a very uplifting, hopeful film. We were all touched by it. I have three sons ages 8, 4 and 1. The one year old actually says \\"Wall-E\\". All of us love the movie.
6305907145|1.0|As an Austen purist, this movie actually made me angry. It is an odd, loose mixture of Mansfield Park and Austen's own biography with some very disturbing imagery thrown in. I found the director's style to be unnerving with Fanny constantly making eye contact with the camera and several quite vulgar sexual references and images. It was Austen in the gutter, in my opinion. I truly hated this movie. I teach high school English, and I give the students the option to watch films like this as an assignment, and the only ones who ever watched this version said it left them confused and vaguely disgusted. Don't waste your money.
B000VS6R26|4.0|Product arrived in a timely manner, however, the dvd was loose from its holder, which made it necessary for me to open the plastic wrap to make sure it was okay.  Not too bad a problem, except the fact that it was to be a gift, and I hope they didn't think I just gave them an old, used one!

0800141660|5.0|From the very first scene, it's obvious that the script has been expertly crafted. To condense a wonderful novel into a wonderful film can't be easy, and Emma Thompson did the best job of adapting an Austen novel into a film script that I've ever seen. Each scene is carefully written to tell the viewer exactly what she needs to know. For example, the opening scenes of Fanny and John make their relationship to each other and their eventual (mis)treatment of the Dashwood sisters painfully evident. And it doesn't hurt things that the cast is wonderful. Emma Thompson (though technically too old to be Elinor) is, as always, wonderfully expressive, and Alan Rickman does a great job of evoking sympathy and respect for Col. Brandon. The only weak spot I found was Hugh Grant. He seems extremely uncomfortable in 18th century clothes, and I found his mannerisms distracting. But other than that, this movie has mined much of the emotion as well as much of the humor from Austen's novel, and I highly recommend it.

0765316897|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this last edition of the Mistborn trilogy. On the one hand I have enjoyed the series and the innovation it represents in terms of magic systems and worldscape. The characters are very interesting and the story compelling. This final book really brings it all together - answering all of the questions that come up in the reader's mind over the previous two.<br /><br />My problem with the book, however, is all of the internal dialog. I'm not generally a huge fan and feel like its bogs the story down quite frequently. It's been a feature of the whole series, of course, but mostly it was confined to just a couple of characters. In this book I can think of five off the top of my head.<br /><br />If you can get past that, though, the story does offer quite a few very interesting twists and turns at the end to make it worth the read.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is great! If there is an action film better than this let me know? One of the best movies I have seen, it is rate up there with Born Ultimatum if not better! You have to love batman and the joker is classic.
0452289963|3.0|I wasn't able to get through this book because it was just too abstract and dense.  And all the stuff about \\"not thinking\\" seemed too wacky.  I did not find it as life changing as Oprah did, that's for sure.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|We bought this movie without ever seeing it before (our son was about 2 when it was in the theater).  He has  loved it from the beginning, which is rare.  Movies have to have constant action for him to remain engaged and though this does not necessarily have that type of action, he loved it!  Enjoy!!
0312383320|1.0|Okay, I've been a fan since day one of Evanovich.  I've bought books for friends, I've gone to signings, I've sang praises from the rooftop, HOWEVER....the last few books, while amusing, are not as good as the first few.  Those were the best of the best. This one?  I can't even get through it.  I hate the monkey bits, seriously, a mashed potato eating monkey fed by a big strapping hunk?  Every description is in the first fourteen books and by now, old.  I'm sad that my favorite series has lost it's serious, suspenseful tone and been replaced by ridiculous comedy.    I also, will not be buying another Stephanie Plum novel.  Until, at least, I hear the standard has been raised once again.
193413712X|5.0|I will read 1,000 more books because I hope that one of them will be the equal of Tinkers. This is poetic prose at its finest. It took me a long time to read such a small book, because I read every sentence twice, thrice, pausing to gaze off into the distance after each unbelievable paragraph, astounded that the author was writing about me, who is, of course, every man and woman. I will read it again, and again. I am most proud that my son gave it to me, because it touched him so. I will in turn give it to my daughter, and special friends.
B000J103PC|2.0|I didn't love the book, but this movie barely even resembles it. As someone who just finished the book a couple weeks ago, it was impossible for me to watch the movie without constantly noticing things that were shockingly different. With the exception of Andrea herself, every single character in the movie was either changed completely or simply left out. Miranda's more sympathetic, Emily's less sympathetic, Lily has her life under control, and the security guy who makes Andrea sing doesn't exist. Andrea doesn't buy Starbucks for homeless people or smoke cigarettes whenever she gets a chance. Even her boyfriend has a different name and career. Andrea's life seems a lot more pleasant here.     Meryl Streep is very good in this, but I wished she acted more the way she did in the book and not as the kinder, gentler, and ultimately more sympathetic version of Miranda that's in the movie. \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" hardly even seems like a fitting name for this since Miranda doesn't seem all that bad. Yes, she asks her assistants to do a lot of things all at once, including some things that are ridiculous, but that's a typical executive assistant job. In the book, not only was Miranda much more horrendous, but Andrea wasn't exactly the perfect employee either. Overall, this movie is much \\"nicer\\" while losing the angrier edge the book had.

B001GKJ2FC|3.0|This movie was entertaining but a little too unrealistic. I know movies are meant to help us escape reality, but I like to have a touch of reality with my movies. As a marksman and 15 year veteran of the military, I had a really hard time with the curving bullets and people hitting targets without aiming. A little bit too unrealistic for me but otherwise entertaining. There was an excellent plot twist at the end that caught me off guard.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I only watched \\"The Queen\\" tonight because I recall it won an Oscar a year or two ago.  That isn't always a guarantee of a good film but \\"The Queen\\" is a reminder that often it IS.  I really didn't know what to expect but I was drawn in quickly.  Whomever decided to make a movie about the warm, loving side of QEII gets my vote for the Oscar for Best Original Idea.  This movie actually works very well and I found myself cheering for the old gal.  The rather recent history was also a big plus as I suspect most of us find ourselves being drawn back into the shocking event of Princess Di's untimely death.  I'm sure that there were plenty of people like myself who never really followed the Princess yet were drawn into the communal sadness that followed her fatal accident.  I recall the British uproar over the lack of any emotional expression from Queen Elizabeth II and, admittedly, her inaction seemed pretty cold at the time.  I actually feel better now about her and a lot of other things.  I was engrossed in the portrayal of the official yet caring relationship that the new PM Tony Blair was developing with her majesty.  I'm sure much of this is creative but the frequent use of newsreel accounts seems to draw us into a sense of complete reality.  I don't know when I last saw a movie that got me so involved with such an aloof character.  Maybe this same production crew will rejuvenate Senator John F. Kerrey next. (Substitute VP Dick Cheney if you don't see the humor in my first suggestion).
B000HBK1RE|3.0|must be here last album before she made her complete change. it's a shame she chose to become such a pop star wannabe as she is now, trying to sound like celine.I used to like her, admire her a lot but not anymore, now it isn't much about her music but about her being he new sex kitten, before that she was interesting and made some decent songs, now she is just becoming a nothing sating  pop singer like so man others. I hope she will change back to the real her one day and make a decent album again, and hen maybe she will get some of her old fans back and not only having those completely upsets fans, also called, the delta force.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Unless you speak Icelandic, you won't understand the lyrics, but that doesn't matter - the music speaks for itself.  This is not to say that the lyrics are meaningless - far from it: they are very evocative and uplifting (you just don't know what the words are).  It's peaceful, thumpy, sweet, driven, and changes from song to song.  I can listen to the album a couple of times a day without getting bored or the music stale.  It's very different, but very wonderful.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|i just got this today in the mail...and this is a real sweet product...i was confused between the fiio e3 and e5...as the former is almost $[...] less than the latter...and i didnt want to spend a lot of money in getting a real expensive amplifier(already spent all i had saved to buy a pair of shure se530)  due to the extreme clarity and reproduction qualities of the shure's i have to say.....i do hear a lot of hissing sounds when i use them,but nothing too distracting,and hardly notice it once your music begins to play(maybe i dont notice it because i listen to trance/house...which already has a lot going on in the background...so the hissing is kinda muffled,but i have no issues as i listen to these genre's)  but i have to say.....its one sleek looking thing...looks just like the shuffle,well finished product and has a sturdy feel to it..the bass booster does its job pretty well....and i am satisfied with the overall feel of the product...i dont know how it would perform with other earphones...but i am guessing...if the shures like it(the shure se530 is very picky about the source from which it receives its music...and amplifies even the slightest bad recording)...every other headphone should like it....i would suggest an amplifier if you really are  an audiofreak...and really serious and picky about the quality of the music...    but for $[...]....it doesnt hurt the pocket that much either....i mean....if you spend anything upwards of $[...] for your headphones....another $[...] wont hurt that much...you will notice considerable differences in the audio....again depending upon your source and headphone that  is reproducing it....    good product....could get a lot better somewhere else...but then....you might have to pay a lot more too....  good for the price its going for...
630587493X|5.0|Even though this is an older, lesser known movie, it is wonderfully done.  Robin Williams does a excellent job with this role.  This subject has been visited by a couple of different venues (Star Trek TNG: Commander Data) but I think this movie portrays the robot/android's point of view very well.  It also has some great comedic moments.  A very good movie!!
B00005JG6Q|4.0|REVIEW: Despite the fact that Japanese cartoons had gained a small foothold in the American market (i.e. \\"SPEED RACER\\", \\"BATTLE OF THE PLANETS/GATCHAMAN\\", etc.): it wasn't until the advent of this film that the floodgates were opened, and the anime genre became a force to be reckoned with here in the United States. The reason why is perfectly clear from the first few minutes of \\"AKIRA\\": as this is quite simply one of the best looking animated flicks ever crafted. The stunning backdrops; non-stop action; and apocalyptic, blood-and-guts mayhem made for a very different cinematic experience that most western viewers had no idea existed. The story begins in \\"Neo-Tokyo\\" thirty-one years after World War III has turned Japan into a raging hell-hole fueled by political corruption, military crackdown, student uprisings, failed demonstrations, anti-government terrorist groups, rampant crime, and rival biker gangs (or in the words of the Colonel in the film: a \\"garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools\\"). By accident one of these biker gangs (led by a jovial punk name Kaneda) stumbles upon a covert government operation when their friend Tetsuo is kidnapped and forced to become the latest guinea pig in a scientific experiment that seeks to enhance an individual's psychic powers (so they can be used as a tool for the powers that be). Unfortunately for everyone concerned: their latest \\"test subject\\" IS this out-of-control, put-upon teenager who ignites a wave of destruction against his old enemies, his friends who were always treating him like a \\"little kid\\", and the government who messed with his mind and turned him into a \\"freak\\". \\"AKIRA\\" can be a very difficult film to watch: not just because of the wall-to-wall violence (although not the bloodiest anime: it does have its nauseating moments of gore), but because the plot takes a couple of viewings before the audience can really get a handle on all its complexities. The film also suffers a bit simply because there are so few really likeable characters (although Kaneda and his buddies turn out to be more heroic than their gang-banging/violent behavior anticipates, and the efforts of the revolutionaries Kei and Ryu are certainly commendable in the face of such overwhelming evil); but the dark, downbeat nature of its story may (oddly enough) be more \\"realistic\\" in its depiction of apocalyptic doom than most end-of-the-world pot-boilers. With intimations of an anti-Christ, political corruption run amok, and destruction on a widespread scale: this could almost be read as a Japanese/eastern take on the book of \\"REVELATION\\" (albeit with no second coming of Christ, no happy ending, and no thousand years reign of peace).be tampered with unless you are prepared to face the tremendous physical, mental, and spiritual (as well as lethal) consequences that such tampering will bring about. But director/writer Katsuhiro Otomo uses this bleak storyline as a hopeful catalyst to a better future that (as one of the characters observes) \\"we can choose\\". Thus there is a moral center to all the madness depicted. But because of the violence, pervasive harsh language (although mostly mild: God/Jesus' name is taken in vain a couple of times, and there are a couple of f-words written in graffiti on the walls of an underground bar and at a reformatory school), one scene of attempted rape, and several drug/alcohol references (as well as the downbeat nature of it all): the film should earn a mild OBJECTIONABLE rating for its content.
0307269191|1.0|This acclaimed novelist has written a very shallow and sadly vacuous book about what he calls running. Really the book is a paean to the author's \\"iron will\\" (there's an attractive quality) and is likely a cash grab to trade on his fame. Runners will find little of use here - Murakami's ideas about training and tactics (even for a very modest athlete) are deficient and unproductive. His experiences, which are very smooth by most running standards, are uninspiring. He often sounds spoilt and peevish, and is consistently humourless. He seems to have little in the way of a family to assist him in his education about himself - to make him laugh or puncture his huge ego.  From a runner's point of view, however, the big disappointment is his lack of the true runner's experience - the beyond the world forgetting that comes with distance. My training tip? I think that he should take off his headphones and listen to himself.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I love every part of this movie. The action scenes were just awesome making it the best martial arts movie of the year. Movie also filled with hilarious scenes. Money well spent for blu-ray buyers like me. A must have!

6305882592|5.0|Although it had its supporters, most critics viciously attacked the 1971 HAROLD AND MAUDE.  Vincent Carnaby, influential critic for The New York Times, described it as \\"creepy and off-putting;\\" Variety was equally dire, saying it \\"has all the fun and gaiety of a burning orphanage.\\"  The public was vocally appalled by the marketing, which presented movie as a love story between an old woman and a teenage boy, and stayed away.  It was one of the biggest crash-and-burn debacles of its decade.  And more than twenty years later it was placed in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as artistically, culturally, and historically significant.  It seems fairly safe to say that it was movie twenty-five years ahead of its time.<br /><br />The basic outline of the story is extremely well known.  Harold (Bud Cort) is nineteen, and heir to a family fortune, and entirely under the thumb of his relentlessly proper mother (Vivian Pickles.)  Disillusioned, disgruntled, and desperate for attention, he attempts to torture his mother by faking on suicide after another; he also buys a hearse and begins to attend the fuenrals of people he does not know.  It is here that he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a seventy-nine year old woman who every bit as eccentric but in an entirely opposite way: instead of embracing death, she embraces life, determined to have a good time--even if it means throwing caution to the winds and flying in the face of all that is considered \\"appropriate behavior.\\"<br /><br />The outline of the story doesn't do it justice.  Although the humor of the film arises from relentless irreverence, its power arises from Maude's determination that Harold should at least try living before he so firmly embraces death--a choice that she herself has secretly made, electing to end her life before she becomes a victim of old age.  Maude teaches Harold to take chances, to fight the good fight and not count the cost.  Yes, HAROLD AND MAUDE really is as wild, wacky, far-out, and off-beat as you may have heard.  But it is a great deal more than that.  It is also a lesson in living without undue respect for the prisons of conventionality.<br /><br />It is impossible to imagine the film working without Ruth Gordon and But Court, who make the entire thing--all the way from faked suicides to stolen cars--seem entirely plausible, and who offer a depth of character that might have escaped other actors.  Vivian Pickles also scores strongly as Harold's controlling mother; the entire supporting cast is equally fine.  Harold Ashby, who also directed such later films as SHAMPOO, leads the material with a sure touch and quick pace; cinematographer John Alonzo films everything with an attractive touch.  And any review that failed to mention the Cat Stevens score, which has the effect of tying the various episodes so firmly together, would be horrendously amiss.<br /><br />Although the film could stand a remaster, my only serious complaint about the DVD release is that this is indeed a film that deserves a release with all the bells and whistles--but there isn't a single bonus to be had.  Not everyone will like HAROLD AND MAUDE.  Many continue to agree that the film is indeed \\"creepy and off-putting\\"--and in a world where conformity is over-valued, they always will.  But forget such small-minded hobgoblins: HAROLD AND MAUDE is both wickedly funny and deeply touching, and I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewers you may have heard.

B000S88JTS|5.0|I have heard about this movie for over 25 years and decided to finally buy it and watch it. I found it entertaining, informative although somewhat dated. In fact the age of it actually made it even more enjoyable for me.  It brought me back to the days before Motocross and Supercross etc, to scrambing in the 60's on dirt back in Middleboro.  The movie's appeal should be universal as it does not focus on only one aspect of cycling.  Steve McQueen is his off screen self and I recommend it to anyone interested in the world of two wheeling.
1416914293|3.0|Overall I think City of Ashes was a great book. It had a couple of prose problems and there is a shocking love triangle that continues from the first book (I may not appreciate what the author did with those characters but it did not stop me from reading it!!)But the love triangle is the reason I give it 3 stars because I do not think its fair for the author to play up an impossible romance.    On the positive side, the book was action packed and less predictable than its predecessor. The characters are interesting and colorful. And the hints of the characters secrets keep you reading and wanting more. There are also a few minor plot twist which I think should set the third book up to be very interesting!
1416562605|4.0|The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga is a novel in the tradition of Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground and Ellison's Invisible Man. That is to say it is not your traditional Indian novel, but one that presents the hero as the outsider, a man who is both literally and figuratively underground and invisible.  The novel is narrated by Balram Halwai, \\"The White Tiger\\" who over seven nights shares his life story in the form of a letter to a Chinese official. In Balram the author has created an anti-hero who, with both charisma and charm, shares a very dark story about corruption, death and escape from the most extreme poverty into the wealth of successful entrepreneurship. The author uses the metaphors of light and dark to help us understand his traversal of a side of India seldom seen in most tales of that country. The theme of naming/identity also plays an important role as Balram takes on different names as he grows and changes from the simple munna to his eventual magisterial identity as \\"The White Tiger\\". The author has created a sort of modern journey, much as Ellison did where the hero overcomes his beginnings, and the corruption he finds everywhere, to create a new life for himself. It is, however, a new life that is strangely cut off from society so he remains an outsider to the end. The brilliant conception of the author impressed me as he presented believable characters, the realistic details about the best and worst of Indian society, and a clear depiction of the nature of the hero at the center of the story. There is black humor that is sometimes excruciatingly funny alongside true regret, and underlying it all hints of a fear (of the past) that cannot be completely eradicated. The author's voice is original and challenging as he takes you on a journey that, while seemingly straightforward, has many layers of meaning and leaves you with questions to ponder. Genuinely deserving of the Man Booker Prize of 2008, The White Tiger is both an engaging enjoyable read and a thought-provoking meditation on life.

B001EYGOG0|2.0|I was disappointed in the C.D. I did not love the songs although I have another older Christmas CD of Tony's that I do like very much.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm not going to bore you with a long review because this album has too many already.  I remember liking this album when it first came out and listening to it over and over again.  I hadn't given it a full listen in years until the other day while I was driving in the Colorado mountains.  I own all the Muse albums but this is, without question, their best effort.  I love all the Muse albums but wow! This album is amazing from beginning to end.  I would tell anyone new to Muse they should purchase this album first and give it a few spins before making a judgment.  Muse has a way of bringing atmospheric & theater rock to the masses without sounding over the top and campy.  The fact this album still gives me chills after not hearing it for years says something.  Purchase this album and enjoy the atmospheric sounds of Muse.
B001GCUO4I|5.0|It was the best movie i have ever seen. Watch out and prepare to die not! or maybe? You decide

0545128285|3.0|My daughter, who is 10, is crazy about Harry Potter. She read this book in an afternoon and tossed it aside.  Asked how she liked it, she said, \\"It was okay. It didn't have very many stories\\".
0694016756|5.0|I bought Goodnight Moon for my 16 month old granddaughter for Christmas.  She just loves this book and carries it around with her.  She doesn't like to have books read to her before going to bed, but whenever anyone comes to her house she hands them her book.  She knows what everything is in the book.  Her grandpa wanted to buy her some new books because he said he is tired of reading this one.  She already has other books.  She just prefers this one.
1402714580|5.0|I was looking for an unabridged copy of Little Women, with only Louisa May Alcott's name as authoress.  I purchased this book for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  The book was brand new and was exactly what we were looking for.  The illustrative artwork was a complementary addition to the novel.  It was also shipped in a very timely manner.  I had it in plenty of time to give for Christmas.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|I saw this film when it first appeared in the 1950s.  I've been a movie buff all my life.  This film is as entertaining and packed with surprises today as it was then.  But one does notice the changes in the roles of women since then.  A five star movie for sure.
B0001I562I|5.0|Wholesome family fun.  Imagine how a kid can suddenly wake up 8 years later, and not be any older than he was the day before!  Follow the main character as he experiences culture shock and how he RISES to the occasion!  Still loving the movie after all this time.  Product was new and received in a very timely manner.  Would buy again!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|What a great movie. Probably oone of the most entertaining movies of '08. This DVD is a must have for any movie fan
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Though this movie has been around a while, it's still fun to watch.  This is something the whole family can see.  The product was new, and received in a very timely manner.  Would buy again.
B00011F5DK|5.0|we play w/two - rules - start out easy then gets agresive then goes to strategic - satisfingly unsatisifing if those are words - surprising how much thought it takes and still finish with unused pieces. We keep a tally sheet in the box for each game played, didn't know we would take this \\"game\\" so serious. He plays chess-I don't - better than chess! So much fun the grown kids and our 10 year old granddaughter recieved a game of blokus for Christmas and they were still excited when the box was unwrapped!<br />Sorry it took us so long to find this game. Thank you for our pleasure.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never purchased a workout DVD before, so to be honest, I just stumbled upon this one, and I am so glad I did.  This workout is incredibly challenging, but in only two weeks I am seeing real results.  The downside to this DVD is that you have to listen to her 5 min narration at the beginning of each workout, so that gets a bit annoying and is totally unncessary.  Also, I am not sure I would recommend this DVD to guys because the workouts seem geared towards women.  The rest of the DVD is great.  The level one is incredibly challenging, and I am soon to begin level 2, and that has me both excited and nervous.  This was a great purchase, and I just recommended it to my girlfriend who is getting married in a few months...if she follows this, she will be wedding-ready in no time.
B001J4E1D8|4.0|\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" is one of my favorite books, and Tess is I dare say my favorite literary character. I loved the 1998 adaptation of \\"Tess\\" as soon as I saw it, and I was really excited to see if this newer, longer, (hopefully) fresher adaptation could possibly improve on an already beautiful version.  At the same time, I was preparing myself to try not to dislike it.  Happily, I can say: though it's still not a definitive adaptation, this version definitely holds its own.     Things \\"Tess '08\\" got right:    1. A great Tess  Gemma Arterton makes this character her own.  While Justine Waddell's Tess was delicate and sensual, Arterton plays Tess with more bite.  Both are valid interpretations of the character.  Both, however, also excel at the highly emotional scenes.  Tess is a sympathetic and brilliant character and Arterton definitely does the role justice    2. Very strong supporting cast  Though I still like the supporting cast of the '98 version more, I loved this version's portrayal of Tess's friends Marion and Izz. Tess's family members were also well chosen, and everyone at Talbothy's diary was great!  Hans Matheson's portrayal of the morally ambiguous Alec d'Urberville is particularly noteworthy.    3. An extremely strong last half  While it has its rough spots, the whole movie is worth it for the last hour.  It's an emotional rollercoaster.  I challenge you not to get an ache in your heart.      A few things that did not please me:    1. A disappointing Angel Clare  Eddie Redmayne just did not do it for me.  I was never convinced by Tess and Angel's romance, and the actor who played him was just...dull, and seemed slightly dim-witted.       2. Extremely changed scenes and awkwardly filmed scenes  Hello, \\"it's too late\\" scene, anyone?  It was almost unrecognizable.   Sometimes, throughout the movie, the dialog got a little strange, or the pacing seemed a little off. Either too abrupt, or too drawn out.      Some final words:     This 2008 version had many good things going for it, particularly Gemma Arterton as Tess, and it had some great scenes in there, most notably the mausoleum scene and Stongehenge scene.  But a weak Angel (Waddell and Milburne were sizzling together) and some awkwardly filmed scenes prevented this from being a terrific adaptation.  Basically, the last episode redeemed the entire series; I can't gush enough over how good it was. BUT, overall, this was a weaker adaptation compared to the '98 (my personal opinion of course!) because of the pacing issues, added/changed lines, and imperfect casting choices.  The fourth episode was by far the strongest, with Part 1 and Part 3 following.     I really enjoyed watching this mini-series, though, and I appreciate the effort to stick to the story and stay true to the characters. Now, if only one of the adaptations would include the pheasant scene!
B00006CXSS|4.0|The shipping was a bit slow, but it was the XMAS season, so that probably accounts for the delay.  All in all, the purchase was great!
B000RIHBIE|4.0|I never hated this, never loved it. But, suddenly I started really listening to it non stop. It's actually a very good album. Granted it does tend to go down hill after track 5. They also sound a lot like green day. That explains why I didn't give it 5 stars. Originality is not their fortay. I must admit though track 3 is all killer and no filler.
0061150142|5.0|This book is excellent and written in a way that leaves you wanting to read more. I couldn't put it down until I found out what really happened! I had a hard time keeping all the names straight at first... but realized all the \\"M\\" names go together... Michael and Melanie are married and \\"Em\\" (Emily) is their daughter. I gave this book to my sister as soon as I was finished so she could read it too.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|The \\"Making of\\" portion of the special features was as interesting as the film iteslf.  I recommend you (1) watch the movie, (2) watch the special features, and (3) watch the movie again so you can understand the depth of work that went into creating this film.    No, this is not your high school Beowulf, but I believe the film is a cinematic masterpiece.    Thank you.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I very much enjoy this set of DVD's. I like history and we all could use more understanding of what our forefathers went through to our benifit. This mini-series is the best yet!!!
0684857219|5.0|This is a great book whether you want to get into professional bodybuilding or just get into shape. It's broken down very well into sections on training techniques, nutrition, mental preparation, as well as fully detailed descriptions of individual exercises for each body part/muscle group. It also includes a lot of posing techniques and competition advice, which i personally haven't looked into, since i'm not planning on becoming a professional bodybuilder soon. Overall, this book is an amazing value. This is a must have, whether you want to get into bodybuilding, or just get into shape and build a strong healthy physique.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This girl has written some catchy and very amusing songs!  Definitely a must if you enjoy a good beat!  She also writes interesting poetry (one of her works is  featured on the CD insert).
B000WGWQG8|5.0|An excellent mini-series with outstanding acting, settings, and historical perspective.  Should have won even more Golden Globes
B000MXQO1O|5.0|This was one of the greatest batman movies i ever seen prior to the dark knight. At first I did not think I was going to like it. I mean afterall I always thought no one  can do batman as good as Micheal Keaton.  Christian Bale  proved it he  can do batman  in his own way.  I reccomend everyone to watch this and  the sequel to it The Dark Knight.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|When are they going to get this movie on Bluray?  It will make a perfect bluray.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Usually sequels suck. But this one  blew me away. When I first heard of Heath Ledger doing the Joker in the movie I was like no one can top Jack Nicholsons joker. Well  Heath Ledger topped him.  Even if Heath didnt die I would still say it. You dont even reconize the actor being Heath ledger the acting is flawless.  Christian Bale was the strong point in batman begins but is the weak point in dark knight which is due to the great acting by the late great heath ledger and the flawless acting by harvey two face dent played by aaron eckhart. out of all the batman movies and i love batman i have watched this more than the rest.
0765348276|2.0|From the first page, I was hooked. I was with the man through the beginning of his journey, but things went down hill in the middle. I didn't think I was reading the same book. The build up of the relationships, along with John Perry entering his new body in the first half were the best part of the book, so much so that I felt it whenever he recounted the deaths of the Old Farts, as they called their little group.     Here's what threw me in the middle.     1.) As a veteran, I didn't buy the boot camp scenes at all. Drill Instructors hate all recruits, whether or not they made an ad that saved their life, and not to mention Master Sergeant Ruiz wasn't believable, just a figure filling every Drill Instructor cliche in the world.    2.) The gun. Give me a break. A solid block of nanites can become any kind of ammunition? I can buy a weapon that uses a single mass of ammunition to form different kinds of solid projectiles, but grenades? Guided missiles? A flame thrower? The last one I found wholly unbelievable. Science-fiction needs some kind of rational base, otherwise it's just fantasy with a technical veneer. And I'm a little wary of this whole magical nanite trend I see going around.    3.) Where's the artillery? Where's their supporting fire? Armored vehicles? Power Armor? Battle suits? I would imagine that these new bodies they are given are expensive, not to mention the cost of getting the old people to the station, the medical tests, the large amount of staff to screen and prep them we're introduced too. You'd think they would invest in protecting these assets, like providing, oh, I don't know, a helmet! There were two very obvious instances where soldiers would have lived if they had had this ancient invention. The body armor they wore, high tech as it was, seemed the bare minimum. Maybe the author should play Crysis or something. Overall, the author seemed to rely more on military cliche and common image than to think of something new (foxholes are useless, even counter-productive against an enemy that burrows underground). Another reviewer said that they used WWII-era tactics; I think that's an insult to our WWII vets, honestly.    4.) The aliens. Why do so many species have to find humans as good eatin'? This seems more of a weak attempt to shock or scare the reader into believing the need to fight, rather than tackling any complex issues of war, peace, and diplomacy. And don't get me started on the Covandu. One inch tall? Give me a break. That part read more like a gorefest version of Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It would have been pure comedy if the rest of the book didn't take itself so heavily. I nearly put it down then. And, there were just too many races. Give me two or three, really well-developed species rather than dozens and dozens of two sentence, weirdness-filled descriptions, all with the same motivation.    5.) The premise for the book was putting old people into new, young and heavily modified bodies to fight a war where their experience and maturity would benefit their forces. Yet, their experience never comes to bear. In fact, we're beaten over the head with the fact that their experience means nothing as they've never experienced anything like what they're about to see; see Master Sergeant Ruiz.     It picked up in the end, and the left hook he threw in there actually turned out to be pretty thrilling and got me going to the end. The prose is easy to read, a nice change nowadays. The Consu stand out among the aliens, and they turned out to be pretty cool with a differing motivation than conquer, kill, eat, repeat. But still, the glaring problems which I have illustrated here prevent me from calling it a favorite.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I downloaded this movie and Ironman, and both of the downloads have terrible lighting contrast ratios.  Maybe it's Amazon's media player that is faulty, but it doesn't adjust well.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|see something different and subtle in every episode each time you watch it. great tv series
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Wow!  I was blown away as to how this miniseries was put together.  It accurately depicted the historical facts while bringing to the forefront, the relationship between John and Abigail.  It rightfully deserves the awards it has received.  Well worth the hours to view it.  I recommend it to everyone who wants to feel as though they're observing history as it's being played out in front of them.  You'll be transported!
1881273156|5.0|This is a great book for married people of all ages. Unfortunately for me I found the book when I was 60 years old and it was too late for me. My wife had found someone else to fill her needs that I didn't know were lacking.  Please read this book in your 20's or 30's while you can still make a difference.  Excellent writer.  Also a test at the end of the book to identify what your and your spouses needs are.

0061655546|5.0|This is a story of a corporate takeover that reads like a thriller. I guarantee you, you won't put it down.<br /><br />The book strikes a great balance between educating the layman about the intricacies and details of a Leveraged Buyout (LBO) and communicating the personalities and timeline of one of the key deals of the late 80s on Wall Street. The heart of the book documents the battle for RJR Nabisco by KKR and Shearson Lehman - the largest buyout at the time, coming in at over 20 billion dollars.<br /><br />The authors follow the deal step by step, documenting each bid, the reactions of each party and the high testosterone environment in which it was conceived and executed. A captivating, educational, and a very rewarding read.
1400032717|4.0|This was an unusual book written in the perspective of a young man that presumably has Asperger's syndrome or Autism. It's a British novel, so a few words/phrases are unfamiliar to me as an American. But in general it's a wonderfully sweet, simple story, although depressing at times.
0143034545|5.0|An overlooked follow up to the now famous \\"Getting Things Done\\". In this book, David Allen builds on his earlier work and fills in many of the missing pieces - more examples, more reflection, more ways to improve your day to day workflow. If you've been referred to this book and haven't read GTD, I would strongly encourage you to do that first.<br /><br />Both the most vital and the hardest part about the entire GTD process is a state of continual improvement. First time you read GTD you'll be struck by the obvious, then you'll pick up a few habits and to your amazement later reread the same tome again to find a completely different set of ideas. \\"Ready for Anything\\" is a book for moving yourself beyond the core GTD and into the \\"black belt\\" territory: strategy vs tactics, mind as water, focus and relaxation, organization and creativity, doer vs visionary, and many others.  This is a book I will be revisiting many times in the future, highly recommended.
0446618306|5.0|I loved this story.  It is a story about love and how it doesn't always turn out the way you want it to or think it is going to.  A wonderful story with a bitter sweet ending.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|I've never read the book before, and this was my first time watching a film adaptation of this story.  Its funny because I accidentally started watching it, but within a few minutes I found myself captivated by this movie.  By the end of the first two hours I found myself hating Alec for what he did to Tess.  However, near the end I almost started liking him, which really surprised me.  Even though he was a bad person his character was a tortured soul.  He cared for Tess as much as he could care for anyone.  He even tried to make things right by marrying her.  I actually felt sorry for him as she kept rejecting him.  I knew that he had never changed, but I felt that he really did care for her.  Perhaps it was more so lust than true love that he had for her.  I also felt sorry for Tess.  I felt sorry for both of them if that is possible.  I didn't quite understand the whole mistress thing though.  I came to the conclusion that he wanted to marry her, but he couldn't because she was legally still married to Angel.  She was his only lover though, so in theory they were married, but just not legally.  Perhaps Alec didn't deserve death either.  He told her that her husband wouldn't come back, but even Tess thought he wouldn't come back.  I didn't think he was coming back either.  I understand that she was exacting revenge upon the man who had essentially ruined her life.  However, she also played a part in her own destruction.  I felt her biggest downfall was telling Angel about her past.  I suppose that was part of her characteristic purity.  Angel was not as effective of a character as Tess, or Alec.  I didn't hate him, or like him much.  He was a wet mop of a character.  His weakness was interesting though because it almost made it seem that Alec was more in love with Tess, or at least more passionate.  Fate played a large part in everything else that happened to Tess.  It seemed as though the murder of Alec was her way of finally taking fate into her own hands.  Anyway, this movie had me crying for quite a while.  The ending where she recreates the May Dance scene was also tragic.  The only way for her to have had a happy ending would have been if Angel had fallen in love with her before she fell from grace.  I took peace in the fact that at least she was set free in the end.  In any case, this is a haunting story that lingers in the mind.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  If you're expecting a proper dubstep or garage album then you'll prolly be disappointed, but if that's what you need then there's already piles of that out there.  If you want an entirely unique and ethereal musical experience then you'll be in love with this album from the first click.    The beats on Untrue sound like dusty old clocks clicking away somewhere in the metaverse.  The atmospheres are as haunting as any I've ever heard.  It's very cinematic in that sense.  I get the sense that I'm wandering in a foggy, dimly-lit, snowscape.  The vocals are used to great effect although they're never quite full-on.  They're more used as an instrument that directly turns out an emotional response, and moreover the vocals are what makes this album ultimately an urban sound rather than a techy atmospheric one like some of Aphex Twin's ambient music.    I find that it provokes all sorts of imagery that I can really feel.  I've listened to it mostly on the NYC subway and walking the streets at night and it's really brilliant.  How can you not feel this sound?  Anyone who doesn't like it is probably void of soul so feel free to use this as a litmus.
1594481938|2.0|I was intrigued by the premise of this book which started off strongly enough but faded greatly and ultimately left me disappointed. So I give it 2-1/2 stars. Hornby is a fine writer with a gift for creating distinctive, likeable characters. He also has a knack for clever plots. With this book he managed to concoct a fine beginning and decent middle but failed to deliver a clever and/or memorable ending.
B0018CMJSU|3.0|I had seen the longer version of The Godfather and had hoped it would be part of the Director's cut.  I missed the missing parts.  I was looking forward to seeing the movie including Genco's funeral and why Tom Haden became the family consiglieri.
0312427573|4.0|This book really draws you in. The plot is intriguing, the pacing is flawless, and there are a great many insightful observations about society to be found between the pages. Too bad they did such an atrocious job with the film adaption.
B001EVPBY4|5.0|Cadmus and Hermione is the first French Opera by Quinault and Lully.Lully, born in Italy and close friend to Louis the XIVth and \\"intendant\\" à la Cour is known to be first French Opera composer.  Louis enjoyed Dance,Music and Lyrics together and probably encouraged Lully in this way.  Vincent Dumestre already performed \\"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\\" by Lully and Moliere but unfortunately the DVD is very poor quality because badly filmed.This is a pity because the work of Vincent Dumestre is Extraordinary.  I must admit Cadmus and Hermione DVD is far better.  By the way both performance on stage are very professionnal.
B001I1OHHC|4.0|A lead character one will not soon forget in a delightfully peculiar tale. The story of the author is heart breaking. The story of how this book came to be published and the eventual acclaim it received is fascinating. The book itself is simply wonderful.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Saw this movie in the theaters and owning it is what I wanted.  Ordered it before the release date and receive it immediately following the release date... WITH the best price.
0316776963|3.0|A highly enjoyable read. The early chapters were particularly hysterical, causing me to laugh out loud numerous times as Sedaris described growing up as an effeminate boy with a frustrating lisp. I'm not a big memoir reader, particularly those of people who are most famous for writing a memoir, but word of mouth led me to give this one a shot and I'm glad it did. I didn't find the entire book quite as hysterical as the first few chapters but it did make for a pleasant read and I continue to get a kick out of the catchy title.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Had to order this movie for my collection.  A must at christmas time.. Movie was excellent...
159448385X|4.0|This was a wonderful book. I enjoyed it every bit as much as the Kite Runner. While reading it I was reminded of the style of Pat Conroy, another master of the family saga. Also brought to mind was Alice Walker's The Color Purple, another well written novel filled almost exclusively with loathsome male characters and long suffering women. Such books make a guy feel a bit guilty for having a [...], but unfortunately they are inspired by the behavior of real life jerks throughout the course of history and societies that have allowed and even encouraged such abusive inhumane treatment to flourish. Khaled Hosseini does a masterful job of weaving history lessons of his homeland into dramatic tales of people with the odds stocked against them whom the reader comes to strongly feel and hope for.
159448385X|5.0|I loved this and kite runner.  This book was a page turning and I found it uplifting.
0312944926|2.0|2.5 stars. This author's non-Robert Langdon narrated books such as Digital Fortress and Deception Point definitely lack the sizzle of his mega-hit The DaVinci Code and the almost as entertaining Angels and Demons. That doesn't make them bad. They're equally easy to read, but simply not nearly as memorable.
B000VJAICK|1.0|I can't believe they made a movie this bad, and worse yet i sat and watched it.In the 1950's this would have made my all time monster list when i was 10 years old.The best part is when they showed Finn Cater bare legs.By the why i found myself rooting for the worms.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Honestly, if you're considering buying this then you probably already know what it's about, so I won't bore you with details. I'm only going to say this:<br /><br />1) It's even better than you think.<br />2) It looks amazing on Blu-ray and the extras are honestly more than we deserve.<br />3) It's honestly worth a lot more than the asking price ($50 when I bought it).<br /><br />I can't recommend it enough.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Get ready to be swept away by the next installment of one of the most loved and watched sci-fi movies of all time... Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.     Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.    Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurtstoo much to speak his name.     Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.     Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.      Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue. For any one who isn't a fan of Star Wars or enjoys solid movies with a plot feel free to pass on this popular yet boring movie.
0201633612|5.0|Great service! Purchased the book as a gift.  Gift receiver asked for this book and is working through it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great watch.  I appreciate what this generation of Americans did for our Country.  The extraordinary will of these soldiers as told in each episode's story, from a different soldiers viewpoint.  Works for me.
B001DHXT20|5.0|After seeing the Bill Bixby Hulk episodes on DVD, I've formed a new appreciation for the genre! Bixby was a great actor. But, even if he was still alive now, he'd be 75 years old! Not really fit for the show.<br /><br />But I still think, if the ESSENSE of the old series is captured accurately and if the episodes are studied carefully, the HEART of these old episodes can be recaputred and become a bigger hit than the original in the 70's!<br /><br />One thing we'd have to guard against is allowing all kinds of stupid \\"hipster clich&eacute;s\\"to infect the series. That happens when directors and producers take their eye off the ball (which is the heart of the storey line), and lose focus of essence of the original 70's series. Also, when was his name changed from \\"David\\" to \\"Bruce\\"?<br /><br />Now, granted, the hulk in the 70's seems rather tame, so I think more rage, carnage, and chaos is due.<br /><br />Here are some casting ideas:<br />Dr. David Banner: Eric McCormack or Michael C. Hall (darkened hair, & thinner, science type), in case Ed Norton doesn't want to do a series.<br />Jack McGee: Some thin, persistent, wiry, pesky-reporter type<br />The Hulk: Any male weight lifter, wrestler, or body builder who can carry the role, maybe Tripple-X?<br /><br />One question I'd have is how would Dr. David Banner be able to change his name so often (ex: David, Brown, David Barton, David B[whatever]...), and stay so unreachable to avoid McGee, etc. for so long in a 2010-2014 (or however long) live action TV series? There are a lot of gadgets we have now that weren't around 30 years ago: the internet, cell phones, aptops, blu-tooth, i-pods &mp3 players, smart phones, GPS, TSA Security check points, etc.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Part of the fun of listening to this CD is to hear Albert talking to a young Stevie Ray: the old guy \\"passing the torch\\" to one of the new blues greats.  Vaughan went on to live up to King's predictions but, as you all know, died in a plane crash seven years after this 1983 concert.    Nonetheless, music lovers have been given a real treat, thanks to this 1999 CD release. We get two blues greats, having fun and providing wonderful music a great session in which boys guys sounded on top of their games.  You can feel the love and respect these two men have for each other and their music.  Albert is awed at this young guy's playing and Stevie is awed to be playing with one of the all-time greats in blues. I know B.B. King is the \\"king\\" but, for me, I always liked Albert better.    The two seem to bring out the best in each other here, and what a pleasure to hear them sing and play. Five of the numbers go for at least eight minutes each.  If you are a fan of either man, this is a CD to own!
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|This is a riotous, outrageous British comedy.  It does take an open mind.  We gave a copy to a sick friend and he enjoys it every time he needs a lift.  Prepare to laugh.
B001EO748M|5.0|Okay, there is some pretty good acting too, and the production and costume design are hard to beat.    Yes, this is definitely for more mature audiences, as there is some fairly graphic sexual content, along with some stunningly realistic torture and execution scenes.  Beheadings abound.    Rhys Meyers appears to have improved his acting skills from the first season, while Natalie Dormer, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and the others all do a wonderful job with their characters.    I won't get into the historical accuracy issue, as it's not my specialty.  It is quite a lavish production and there is never a dull moment.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|this video provides a wonderful way to view animals in the wild living and being as God intended for them to be.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is an  amazing  account  of the true heroism found in our US Armed Forces.  I  was unable to stop  reading Luttrell's description  of SEAL training, but was mesmorized with his account of the battle and survival.  A reminder that these brave men and women do what most of us could never imagine.  They are due our gratitude and not the treatment received by thre media and liberal govt.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|The \\"Quo Vadis\\" film (i just finished watching it awhile ago) will help good student historical viewers on their Church history/ Roman history and it could challenge some spiritual and faith issues. This is one of the great film for all seasons.

0030565812|5.0|I just finished reading perhaps the best autobiography I have ever read. The narrative is heart-wrenching. I cannot believe that it I hadn't read it before. From the moment I picked this book up, it was exteremely difficult to put it down. I felt like I was beside Mandela every step of the way as he narrated ever so beautifully his life from his childhood in Transkei, in college in Fort Hare, as a lawyer in Jo'burg, and as a prisoner at the infamous Robben Island. I was sad the book ended so abruptly soon after Mandela was released, for these were the most trying moment for South Africa.    If there is ever a book that anyone must read before they die, this is the book. Absolutley wonderful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This kind of DVD is exactly what I needed. It has strength training and cardio in the same DVD and I feel it is great to have this and a few similar ones at home and not pay expensive gym fees. I am so glad I got it!

B001KZI7FO|5.0|Exactly what I was expecting.  This is the Hardcover edition of the Polar Express and includes a audio version on both cd and casette tape?  The set also contains a souvenir bell, this item is actually pretty cheap, buy another bell to include would be better.  Overall my children exjoy this set and would recommend
B0018CWEYY|4.0|I have been a faithful viewer of Lost since its beginning. I own all four seasons DVD's. They are all great AND SEASON FOUR IS NOT EXCEEPTION.  I look forward to the start of season five on the 29 and the special showing of the retro season the 22nd. I would have rated this collection as a five star, but have not viewed it in it's entirety.
0843178078|5.0|We bought several of the books in this series for our son. Lots of action on the pages, a fun read.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|With it's captivating cinematography, gripping storyline, and fantastic character interaction, I daresay that \\"Sunshine\\" may well be the \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" of today.    \\"Sunshine\\" positively blew me away upon first look. This masterful film manages to blend detailed science with engaging fiction perfectly. To those of you who argue about the timeline of the Sun's waning...take it as an alternate scenario to the status quo--IF this were the situation, then \\"Sunshine\\" is how it might play out.    The cinematography is beautiful and captivating. As always, Danny Boyle manages to pull his audience in to his film and keep them locked in. Never before have I seen such an amazing and awe-inspiring look at our System's center, short of NASA footage.    Cillian Murphy plays a great role, both stoic and complex simultaneously. Chris Evans manages to pull away from his earlier \\"pop\\" roles (\\"Fantastic Four,\\" \\"Not Another Teen Movie\\") long enough to play a very strong character in the film, playing of Cillian (and vice-versa) perfectly.      This is a must-see for the science-fiction fanatic. This is a must-own for anyone who considers themselves to be a connoisseur of cinema. Get this film.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My BF loved his gift. He thinks that Wall-E is amazing! He's watched this movie like twenty times since he got it!!!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|A wonderful, 10 minute or so game.  Can be played with 2,3 or 4 players/  a great game for multi-generations to play together.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|My BF just loves Heath Ledger's work and he thinks that Dark Knight was his best work ever! He keeps watching this movie over and over again.....
0545128285|2.0|I guess the real judge of this little book, which is about five popular wizard fables, is where you stand on the Harry Potter Series:  If you loved the series, you'll really dig this book. If you were neutral or only slightly a fan of the series, you'll think its a waste of time or money. I don't know anyone who read all seven books and hated the series, so I'll leave that option out.    Basically, the tales are cute and short, ideal for smaller children if not for their graphic content. However, as another reviewer noted, Grimm's fairy tales and other fables often are violent and dark tales of morality. In this regard, I appreciate what JK Rowling does in being true to fables of old. And even better, she ties them into her Wizard universe nicely with Dumbledore's quotes and historical tidbits.    That being said, I will not give the book more than two stars since I can't say I am a Potter devotee. Unlike some of my obsessed friends, Harry Potter is an original series and has its exceptional moments, but overall I wouldn't say it is my favorite fiction series of all time. Therefore, I felt that this book was not worth the money, and I am glad I bought it at WH Smith in London Gatwick airport as a discounted book (only $7 USD!).  For that price, it was worth picking up for the completion of the series. However, the full US price ($15) is a bit steep for what this book is: a nice appendix to a piece of trivia from the original series.
0312427646|5.0|Light-hearted and funny, this is a wonderful quick read. The Queen, amusingly portrayed, begins to neglect her royal duties as she discovers the delights of reading. But not everybody approves...
B00003CX95|5.0|My literature class has just finished watching Braveheart, and until now, I'd never seen it. Man, was I missing out! I think this is one of Mel Gibson's best movies, next to the Lethal Weapon series and his cameo in South Park: Imagination Land. The story was compelling and emotional.  It even managed to make me tear up a little bit, especially during Merril's death scene. The battles were realistic, and the acting was well done and believable. Only Mel Gibson could pretend to be brutally tortured and make it look SO real.     William Wallace is an epitome of romantic heroism. He personifies all of the requirements to be a romantic hero; the strength he shows in battle is a youthful quality, his respect towards women (he didn't even KISS Merril until they'd gotten married) is an example of how he was pure of purpose, and his intuition and honor based on a standard other than that of society's were steadfast and unshakable as he worked toward Scottish freedom.    The film may not be accurate to a tee, but what does that matter, what with all of the inaccurate substance-lacking crap  that people go in to theatres all the time to watch? In response to Halda, I agree with you! If I wanted some serious historical accuracy, I'd go watch the History Channel. The film is raw, brutal, and Mel doesn't hold back. Watch it, enjoy it.
0977326403|5.0|I purchased this as a request from my son for Christmas. He said he enjoyed reading the book.
1577314808|5.0|This is my first time that I wrote a review about any book I've read. I was start to read books in personal development one years ago, starting from the 7 habits, Getting thing done, Science of getting Rich, Science of getting Well, the Secret, and some psychology books. I recommend this book to everybody who is looking for happiness and full control. Who is looking to walk his talk as we said. Also, it will be very helpful to read it in a silent place without any external noise. Read it once, twice, or more, until you are fully engaged with the idea and the magic it contains. I have to say that if you apply what is in the book, you can overcome any psychological problem such as phobia, anxiety, and fear.
1878424319|5.0|I love this book.  I felt that this book was extremely insightful and in some ways life changing. I have given it to three people as gifts.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Perfect transaction, fast, fair, courteous, great quality, great conditions, excellant price.  Will be back for more.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Kung Fu Panda is a great movie for all ages. Jack Black is great and all the characters are funny. My husband and I have already watched it twice.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|I am a great fan of sci-fi movies. I usually do not miss a single sci-fi film or TV show. Torchwood captivated me from the beginning, and I was looking forward every night to watching an episode. I liked the characters, though I did find them a bit shallow, unintelligent, stubborn, prone to mistakes, and unwilling to learn from their mistakes. In the real world, such mistakes would lead to criminal prosecution, and in the very least, an immediate discharge. For example, one character (I won't spoil it for you by giving his name) disobeys orders and opens a rift in time that puts the whole planet in danger. No big deal, he is forgiven! A little far fetched, don't you think?    What really put me off is finding out that the lead character, and hero of the series, Jack, is a homosexual.  OK, we live in a world where this is acceptable, but why show intimate kissing (with open mouth and tongue) between the same sexes? Are the writers trying to tell us that this is completely acceptable? Is this series about space aliens or sexual morality? Won't children be watching this series?     I would have easily given this series a five star rating, but because of the sexuality, I give it a three star rating, and I definitely do not recommend it to children!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|this was one of the most interesting and intriguing books i have read in a long time.  the amazing storyline and development of characters locked my attention and kept me reading at every free moment.  highly recommend this book
B0016PM722|5.0|Very cool product for any StarWars Fan!  You`ll love it, as well have it for yrs to come and enjoy as an collectible.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Walked out of the Living Room Theater in Portland and couldnt stop talking about this near flawless motion picture. This is why we go to the movies.<br />Nuff said.
B001F0TM5I|1.0|I really like Tarentino films, but this one is a dud.  Blue Ray is great, but I can't imagine it making this stinker any better.  I would only recommend this movie to someone who can borrow it (for free), and you must be really, really bored.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|If you were ever a little child, if you've ever loved a dog,if you've ever lived in more simple times, this movie will bring tears. Three generations in my family watched it and we all shed a tear. The range of feelings the movie elicits is broad yet honest. Disappointment,loneliness,guilt, sadness,desire for acceptance,joy,friendship, first love,fun- they are all here in this simple,believable tale of a young boy growing up.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I was worring about this order as this is the first movie i have ordered off the internet. well it was a great movie. it was in perfect condition and shrienkwrapped!! i was very impressed and would recommend this seller to anyone!

B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is a deliciously amusing series by comedic genius John Cleese. If you enjoy British Comedies such as Absolutely Fabulous or Keeping up Appearances, then you need to get this DVD set. John Cleese and all his supporting actors/actresses do an amazing job in this series.    A must have for anybody that loves John Cleese and/or British Comedies.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this soundtrack. The delivery was very fast considering the holiday demands. I would definitely buy from them again. The cd was also cheaper than anywhere else I had checked.

B000001EYO|5.0|T-Bone Burnett's musical archaeology is deservedly legendary, and in this particular instance, as in all the soundtracks he's done for the Coen Brothers, it's almost as good as the film itself.  Who else could bring Yma Sumac together with Captain Beefheart and Kenny Rogers?
B00005JO9J|5.0|Ordering was easy --- Product arrived promptly --- Returned it unopened, because it was a gift and I found out the recipient already had it.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I don't know why it's taken me so long to watch this series, I guess the high price kept me away.  I picked it up for less than $30 and feel that at THIS price it's a must have!  It's not one of those, watch every few months kind of DVD's but an annual weekend review is already in the works!
B0015AARJI|5.0|awesome price for this brand name controller, beats best buy and walmart by a long shot!!!
6302158095|5.0|I think \\"Fantasia\\" is the best video ever produced by the Disney Corp....a great presentation of classical music, to be enjoyed by ALL ages!  This video was ordered as a gift for our 4-year-old Grandson, so, he would have his own copy at home.     Once, when he was visiting us, I pulled this tape out of our collection of 'oldies' to play in the background while he was involved in other activities.  As it turned out, he stopped what he was doing, and sat, completely engrossed in the 'Fantasia\\" video.  It soon became one of his favorites.    The animated scenes, tied in with the beautiful musical arrangements, are spellbinding, from the saga of the dinosaurs to the mythological scenes.    I would recommend this video for just about anyone who loves music.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars but the first half is pretty boring but the second half makes up for it, during the first half they needed to make us care about the people more, if someone gets killed it's more of an impact if you like them.
B000NOKERM|5.0|Buy this version, people. It has the extra tracks, and the DVD. Don't miss this one.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|one of the firs blue rays, but not the worst, at the contrare, lots of audios, specials, subtitles, and extras, if the movie is amazing itself, this blue-ray whort a lot, and have a special value for the fans.
1416594884|3.0|First off, this is a European spy novel by one of the masters of the genre, John le Carre, known for [[ASIN:0802714544 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold]] and others.  It is set in Hamburg Germany and involves a Muslim Chechen refugee who has escaped torture, Issa, who is the bastard son of a Russian General/gangster and is the heir to a rather large fortune.  He wishes to use this money to aid Chechnya and other Muslims places and while trying to do this becomes ensnared in intelligence operations involving Germany, the US, and England.<br /><br />An excellent premise but the novel then leaves the action and goes on and on about the flawed personalities, not of the spies, but of a banker and lawyer caught up in the mess.  Not a single character is particularly likeable and they all seem wooden.  The first half of the book is too slow and goes on and on about inter- and intra-service jealousies of the spies.<br /><br />The second half of the book revolves around the moral complexities of imperfect people and then ends with the foreshadowed emergence of the big, bad Americans as the only truly bad guys (and stupid to boot)in the book.  And so what should be a morally ambiguous thriller becomes one more Euro-weenie anti-American vehicle.  Admittedly, I enjoyed the second half for its setting up of the various levels of betrayal at the end.  But I was really hoping for a difficult-to-put-down page turner that wasn't political in nature.<br /><br />So overall three stars with the good and bad as noted above.
B00005JGAB|5.0|God Bless You, Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, Tommy, Marky, et al...You guys saw what was happening to \\"rock music,\\" and you actually jump-started it back to its original glory. I mean, @#$%!: disco - and groups like \\"Gallery\\" or ELP?  NAH......and ANY album with songs like \\"Beat On The Brat,\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement\\" deserves to be put on the shelf alongside \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"Grand Hotel,\\" \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" etc.  And Rest In Peace, Joey, Dee Dee, & Johnny.  You guys are sorely missed, and I'm glad you weren't around to have to deal with stuff the \\"new millenium\\" has inflicted on the rest of us.
0525951113|5.0|This book is the most exciting story I've read in a long time. I could not turn the pages fast enough. I certainly don't know if any of this could actually happen, but the excitement and thrills Suarez gives us are simply full of technology and suspense.

B000002A46|5.0|Not normally a Mariah Carey fan. But heard the song \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" and had to have it. The whole CD is great.
B0009MAO46|5.0|The danger with being on the cutting edge of technology is that something that looks really cool one year can look horribly dated by the end of the next year (I'm looking at you Tron!)  The only way to avoid being relegated to the technological scrap bin is to make the story and characters the emphasis, so that you forget what you're watching.  When Toy Story first came out, it was impossible not to talk about how it looked.  That's not the reason people continue to watch it, though.  They continue to watch it because it's funny, heartwarming, and genuinely entertaining.    As every child knows, Toys are living beings, and have their own lives when not being played with.  Sherriff Woody is Andy's favourite Toy, and thus the leader of Andy's toy chest, which includes a neurotic T. Rex, a know-it-all piggy bank, and Mr. Potato Head.  Into the mix is introduced the new cool toy: Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear, and Woody is supplanted as Andy's favourite.  One thing leads to another and soon Woody and Buzz are Lost Toys trying to find their way home.    The key to the film is the performances (both animated and voice).  Pixar was smart enough not to try to make a full-length film until they were ready: their computer models can fully express emotions in the face, in body language, and most importantly in the eyes.  Adding in the supurb voice talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and these animations come to life.  Allen and Hanks were minor actors  when they supplied the voices of the two main characters, but they were supurbly cast (pre-Home Improvement and pre-Philadelphia, respectively).  Supporting voices by John Ratzenberger (in full Cliff Claven mode) and Don Rickles make the voice acting in this film among the best of any animated film ever made.    At the heart of the film is a standard buddy story (starting from a point where the main characters hate, or at least cannot understand, each other).  Plotwise, there's nothing new here.  But the execution and the attentionto small details give this story a fresh look, just as computer animation was giving a fresh look to animation in general.  Many (including myself) are very disappointed in Disney for going completely to computer animation - Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, etc. are ultimately better looking than any of the Pixar films.  But with Toy Story, the style of animation fits so well that I cannot imagine it any other way.    This 10th anniversary 2-DVD set is a nice value.  There are some neat extras, not the least of which is a detailed directors/writers commentary.  There are also some reflections on the film made 10 years later, as well as some deleted/altered scenes, which are always interesting to see.  Most interesting is probably the storyboard presentations of two alternate beginnings - an Andy fantasy of a shootout with Woody, and a version of the beginning that eventually became Toy Story 2's opening sequence.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Relive the memories with this set!  I highly recommend it.  I love, love, love it!
B001EO2UKO|2.0|The CD has no edge, it just goes from one song to the next without much definition, might work for easy listening or elevators. Maybe the producer should have pushed a little harder.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Besides being a fun show, with wonderful music and characters, the storyline has meaning while retaining humor.  A la \\"Dark Knight,\\" the idea that \\"heroes\\" are all good and \\"villains\\" are all bad is turned on its head, and it's obvious that though the means are unconventional, the one working outside of the law can be trying to make society better, while the one loved by the people is doing them no good.    An amazing movie and soundtrack!
1400082773|5.0|The best book on race that I have ever read - and I have read many!
B001FB4W16|4.0|I agree with everything in the previous reviews, especially the Tara/demon  and V-fantasies subplots. I got hooked on the series from Episode One and bought a boxed set of the books since I didn't want to wait for the new season to start. There are TONS of differences between the books and the series, though the series is able to stand on its own. I think the differences are good since you don't know exactly where the HBO series is going to go from here.  I think Anna makes a wonderful Sookie and Stephen Moyer is a perfect Bill. However, I think Alexander Skarsgaard falls short of Eric. Sam Trammel does a great job as Sam Merlotte and I love how he and Anna are able to portray the intense relationship between the two characters. Of all the relationships between the characters in the books or the series, theirs is my favorite.  I did have difficulty with the series finale. Bill stepping into the sunlight to try to save Sookie was very romantic and incredibly unbelievable. Not to mention, if they are going to follow at least some of the plot of the books, it sets up a problem later in the series when Bill's reasons for coming to BonTemp are revealed. And Tara's car accident and rescuer will make season two interesting as to how they bring it all together with the plot line of the book, or if they even try.  I do have to say, I love the series-all in all. The acting is incredibly good and the story keeps you interested except for the few errant sub-plots that I watched once and then skipped over on subsequent viewings (thank God for Tivo). Sookie's shock at her Grandmother's death and everyone's reactions to that were extremely well done.  I have had some people react negatively to all the sex scenes in the series but I believe they are an essential part of the books and the series. They give you alot of insight into the characters and how they interact with the world and each other.  So, 4 stars-if I could give it 4 1/2 I would and I will keep waiting for season two.I just hope they make it all the way through the series. If so, we have quite a few seasons ahead of us.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|For any Lost junkie, just having the shows to watch again is great.  It's all the bonus features that make the DVD set amazing.  From the audio commentary to the deleted/extended scenes to the production/behind the scenes, the bonus features really get you immersed in the show.
B0011HOEYY|3.0|The movie is great but the Box which I really like breaks after the first days use. The box does make the collection. It would have taken little to fix the issue if thought about by the maker. The corners split open at the bindings side.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Excellent movie, my kids loved it.  Have already watched several times.  Wouldn't encourage young viewers though.
B001GKJ2DE|1.0|This movie was to the point of \\"unbelievable\\" that it was uncomfortable to watch. I tried desperately to forget years of classes in physics and engineering in order to enjoy it. But I could not forget common sense and thus the movie was unbelievable to the point I did not enjoy it.<br /><br />Parts of the movie (Including the beginning) are some sort of take off of the Matrix - jumping through glass window to 'fly' across to another building's roof top, and \\"tricks\\" with bullets. \\"Bend the bullet\\" - Really? flint lock \\"sniper\\" rifles hitting something more than 25 yards away, let alone over a mile? Preposterous. And the movie attempts to pass off blatant bizarre fiction as the truth which offends me. I prefer my science fiction to be obvious science fiction, with aliens and spaceships and ray guns when the laws of physics are going to be trampled.<br /><br />For the viewers that want a special limited edition collector's gift set, more power to you. But you are not buying a clever movie, a movie with an interesting plot, or a movie with good writing. You are buying the giftset of a movie with mediocre special effects, laughable acting, and Angelina Jolie (the only thing on the screen worth paying attention to). If you \\"enjoyed\\" this movie, you'd be better off buying \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" - similar action and theme, and \\"believable\\" enough for a person to watch and enjoy.
0793544610|5.0|If you are a Hendrix fan this is definitely a book to have.I question wheter some of the written vocal melodies are accurate but the guitar and bass transcriptions are pretty good and can take you deep into rainbow realms of Jimi`s genius.
0060833459|4.0|Reading this book in the least will cause you analyze and self scrutinize the way you manage your time and efforts in your career.  It is a wealth of information and should be slowly digested.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Similar in structure to 1992's \\"Chain of Desire\\", a little-seen film about a circle of New York lovers connected by sexuality, a club scene, and a music score, ( and to a much older film called \\"La Ronde\\"), \\"Shortbus\\" is upbeat, optimistic, and post-AIDS hysteria (while still being conscious of safe sex) whereas \\"Chain of Desire\\" hinged on that dark thread connecting its ill-fated characters.  Mitchell's second film is quite mature, and remarkably sweet. It's nice to see a film where people strive towards being conscious and kind; it's also nice to view something where straight, gay and every variation in between mingle with respect and regard to each other without the usual American 'tee-hee-hee' around sex, and money-machine ogres of Falwell and Warren hanging around to cash in and give guilt.    Central to the film, and quietly integral, is music from Yo la Tengo, and several songs including \\"Upside Down\\" and \\"Far from the Sea\\" and \\"Language\\" are quite catchy and memorable. These pieces color the film emotionally and supply a pad for the crises depicted amongst its protoganists, played so well by Sook-Yin Lee, Paul Dawson, PJ DeBoy, Julian Bond, and others.  Mitchell has coaxed remarkable performances from actors who also contributed to the script. I found myself quite endeared to them all and wishing I knew them personally.    If the low-budget endeavor has any flaws at all, it is Mitchell's sometimes obvious hand at making things fit into the structure, but this is a minor gripe since the film is almost a musical-of-sorts, and one expects some suspension of so-called 'reality'. Moreover, Mitchell is to be commended for his resoluteness is staying with this project for so many years, enlisting so many who believed in it and took career and emotional risks to make it the sweet, non-pornographic experiment that it is.    The film does make one pine, in a fashion, for these years between 25-35 if he or she has already passed through them, when clubs are crucial toone's life, when one is so desperately trying to anchor oneself in a meaningful style of living and loving.  I will be anxious to see what kind of Film Mitchell makes about his Forties.    Highly recommended. As for the sexuality, well, it's hardly pornographic, except to a sick mind, and handled quite beautifully. And even though the droll, den-mother Julian Bond quips at one point in the film as he watches the rosy-lit orgy with the enchanting Sook-Yin, \\"It's like the 60s, darling, but with less hope,\\" one senses there is, indeed, hope amongst this generation that plows ahead towards authenticity in the wake of prior generation(s) - some members who survived and many who didn't - who rose above the excreble muck of Anita Bryant, Falwell and the rest who sought to control the bodies -- and minds -- of Americans with fear and shame.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Although the first two episodes at least have \\"cheesy\\" elements, the video IS Dr. Who and fun.
0307265730|5.0|Lahiri's book is brilliant.  Her first person prose is delightful and brings you to the time and place of the action.  There was only one chapter that I did not fully enjoy because the characters were a bit flat but even this story did enough to fill in the holes to move on to the next chapter, which was truly wonderful.  Overall, a great read and a wonderful gift for someone who enjoys Lahiri's style.
B00005JNX0|5.0|My toddler son loves this movie and will watch it over and over again. It's still his favorite DVD and worth the money to keep him happily entertained.

1905492073|5.0|There is a saying, \\"The more you know, the longer you live.\\"  Seldom is it that dire in diving. [However, I do know of someone who died thinking that dive tables were \\"fine tuned\\" and made a bad deco choice.]<br />This book explains that fine tuning is not the case, and it does so in an easy-to-read fashion.  Divers will do themselves a favor by reading this very interesting volume.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|love this movie my best of all the batman i grew up watching adam west the joker was wonderful sad because of his death but i rate the movie 5 stars    please bring more movies like these could not move out of my chair while i was watching Batman\\"                   alma                                           N.Y.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I will concede that this was one of the best pictures of the last year. It is a great Batman movie, though perhaps it has received more praise than it deserves as a \\"philosophical statement.\\" Primarily it is a great action movie that does not cheat characterization and motivation of the characters.     My comments here are on the technical quality of the DVD visuals. I watched on a 900x1440 monitor, and while some scenes looked very good, on other scenes there was easily visible quantization noise (mosquito-like noise) and detail was washed out in some background items like buildings -- i.e. they looked a bit blocky. This looked like a careless transfer to DVD to me, compared to other hit movie DVDs I've seen.     I have not seen the Blu-Ray, but from all accounts it is very good. Based on what I see, I will probably wait until I have a Blu-Ray player before I purchase this movie, unless I can pick up a used DVD copy for a few bucks.    It's a five-star film, but the DVD is average, at best, in transfer quality. So let's make it a four-star rating on the DVD package. By the way, it needs to be mentioned that the DVD has been mastered with built-in data corruption (in the name of anti-copying measures) which may cause some computers to balk at an attempt to view it. (My PowerDVD6 OEM was able to manage the disc just fine.)
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Awesome film. I loved every minute of it. Yes, Heath Leger was amazing, but Aaron Eckhardt was amazing too. I loved it. I had to buy it as soon as I saw it for the first time.
031606792X|4.0|I loved this book! The condition was great and I received it in a timely manner. And the price was awesome!
B001KL3GWM|5.0|I've listened to DTB for a while and love this album already.... Love the vinyl option, cover, album artwork, and such a deal at $10!!!  Worth way more...
B0001US62I|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies of all time. lisa bonet is wonderful in this movie as is the entire cast. well worth your time and money.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent series which gives an enlightening insight into the pre and post- revolutionary war period. The two leads, Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney , won Golden Globes for their portrayals of John and Abigail Adams.  A must-see for anyone remotely interested in our American heritage!
0312370849|2.0|Worth reading to discover the sad but true story of the Roundup of Jews in Paris under the VIchy government.  An easy read, which is the unfortunate part.  High school level.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for the young and the young at heart. I already owned a copy of this and we bought this copy for our grandson this past Christmas. He loves it so much he has already watched it at least six times.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Item in great condition and arrived in a very timely manner. Amazon was most helpful.    Thank you
B000FC1K66|3.0|I liked the book, it was well written and touching. It's just that I kept reading every chapter expecting a resoultion or something to happen differently, but it didn't ever come. It kind of just leaves us hanging and doesn't tie it all up for us in the end. I just wish things would have ended without the despair and doubt. Does it make it a book that shouldn't be read? Of course not, it is worthy of anyone's time who likes to read. However, if there is something out there you've had your eye on and want to read then get it and read this when you just need to kill some time.
159448385X|5.0|This book is amazing!  Yes it is very sad - but the story is so gripping - I could not put it down.  I had to read it all in a 24 hour period. The story however teaches about lasting friendship and endurance.  I felt the desperation and sadness that the mother felt at many points.  Yes I think we American women have a blessed life when compared to the lives in this book. I had to go kiss my children after reading this. Very moving.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible is hilarious and the songs are amazing.  I'm hoping for a full TV show, or at least some sort of continuation in the webisodes!!
B000002J03|5.0|Okay, Led Zep II........quite simply a masterpeice! Brilliant arrangements,vocals,amazing guitar work(oh those riffs)and tremendous bass. Oh did I mention they have the best drummer of all time (sorry moon and pert)I mean really ,the drums are thunderous. If you want to be a drummer....listen to this. Moby Dick is just stupid good. I cant say enough about this cd or Zep in general but if you are actually having to think about buying this, do yourself a favor, you wont regret buying one of the top ten albums/cds of all time.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller
B000QUCNP4|4.0|This is a movie about an evil serial killer who was never caught.  How can you go wrong with Jake Gylennal, Mark Rufalo and other good actors.  Very good movie.
B0002JP4L4|4.0|Footloose is a bit of a classic, and still fun to watch. Great 80's dance tunes that take me back to my high school years. It's great to see the film in its original aspect, but there are a few scenes/shots, especially towards the beginning, where there is some noticeable artifacting or lack of resolution in the video. Not terrible, but enough to warrant the four-star rating instead of five. Still a good buy. (This review pertains to the Special Collector's Edition DVD).
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie will blow you away. If Heath Ledger doesn't win some sort of award for this movie then I will have lost all faith in American film critics. Don't miss the opportunity to check out this movie!
0375826726|5.0|The third Installment was pretty good a bit jumpy as far as making revisions to previous understandings, such as Eragon's father, the menoa tree, the ra'zac and so forth, over all it was a good book, very exciting, and keeps me waiting for more, I was a bit disapointed that the end battle wasn't as big and decisive as the last two books, but I digress.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Saw this DVD on Amazon for around $18 when it first came out and put it in my whis list. I should have bought it sooner because it went up to $26.Still a great buy, it has a digital copy and special effects disc that will keep any fan of HELL BOY entertained.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I had seen previews for the show for some time and thought it'd be fun to watch so i tivo'd it. Once Tara went off in the beginning of the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The show is so hilariously raunchy and totally addicting, it's hard not to love it. I couldn't wait until sunday and now i am counting down the weeks until it comes back. i recommend it to everyone!
0151013837|5.0|I am writing this review before finishing the book as I  will never be as captured by the story as now.  The brilliant painting of pictures in the mind of Pi are reflected in the stunning illustrations.  Deep struggling  descriptions by Pi captured my intellect and emotions.    I am reached on all levels by the impossible interaction  of Pi with Richard Parker and the elements of sea and sky.  Spiritual, mental and physical connections are amazingly  well portrayed in clear, simple yet poetic style.    It is sure that the events of this remarkable story will remain with me for a long while.
0312383320|4.0|I have been a fan of JE for quite some time.  I have read (and re-read) all of her books, not just the Stephanie Plum series, many times. However, I had been disappointed with number 14 and the last between the numbers book, Plum Lucky.  However, I think that JE redeemed herself with this book somewhat.  I like Diesel and agree with other reviewers that he should have his own series.  I think that the moments with Carl were fairly funny.  I think that too many readers try to take this too seriously.  Come on people, it's a book about \\"unmentionables.\\"  It's not meant to be taken seriously.  I think that the supernatural parts of the between the numbers books might work better than the regular books because it really forces you to suspend all logic and reality.      Overall, I enjoyed this book.  I especially love the image of big ole' Tank carrying around pictures of his cats in his wallet!!  How perfect!! I think that Janet is redeeming herself.  I hope she continues this upward trend on book 15.
B00004S5RK|5.0|This is a stunner of a movie.  I have seen it many times, but had to buy it for my home library.  Michale Douglas, Robert Duvall are always good, but the acting talents of minor characters like the white supremist played by Frederick Forrest is stunningly good!  (Forrest you may remember as Blue Duck in Lonesome Dove and also as \\"Chef\\" in \\"apocalypse now\\").  You find yourself rooting for the \\"bad guy\\" (Douglas) not knowing he is the bad guy, he is avenging the everyday evils that face the average city dweller each day: traffic, crazy high prices in stop and rob stores, muggers, beggars who won't leave you alone and obviously don't need the money, poor service in fast food joints/stores, etc etc.    Eventually working his way up the ladder to socio-economis inequalities, private golf courses, overpaid medical professionals etc.    At some point, he realizes \\"So I'm the bad guy?\\"    Duvall plays his solid role, he always amazes me in one movie he looks so young and the next so old...either he is great at makeup or just a heck of an actor!  Get this movie or rent it...great stuff.
1400082773|5.0|This autobiography was written right after Obama graduated from Harvard Law, and long before his run for the White House. In it, he tells the story of \\"the making of the man\\", how he thinks about race, nationality and class and and most important, the women and men who gave him his most deep-seated values and ethics.      I have read this book twice and often delve in at random to hear the voice of a clear-thinking, intellectually curious and very moral man.  It was our  Christmas present for all this year.
B00151A6TI|3.0|There are those who prefer the slightly more jam/schitzoid tendencies on Sane Day so this will come as good news, but for me, I liked the more song oriented, stoner rock approach of Sleeping In Traffic Pt 1. Yes, this album, like Sane Day, flirts with fusion and funk ala Zappa, as well as canterbury by way of Gentle Giant (so a collaboration with Tangent isn't farfetched). But this album also leans toward the jammier side of progressive rock, with jazz trappings reminiscent of The Flower Kings, which it stands to reason that TFK would be some influence on Beardfish, being they both hail from Sweden. But I prefer Beardfish more in their AOR incarnation than the somewhat forced sounding prog mode here. Not that anything here is too intricate or inaccessible, but they do indulge themselves prolonged jazz/prog exercises, ala TFK, and they seem to have ditched the blues based underpinnings of Pt1, an aspect of '70s prog that fails to get translated in the neo-prog of the '80s and beyond. Some of their instrumental workouts, while shorter, are quirky and angular ala '80s King Crimson, but sound like incomplete ideas stuck here and there, and seem to exist solely for the sake of a quick change of pace or break, whether they fit or not (if these breaks are improvisational, then more power to them I suppose). They also indulge in some '80s-Zappa-like humor, with a story based song, not unlike their Gooberville Ballroom Dancer from Sane Day, but this song goes on a tad too long and winds up way on the silly side, and well, not all that clever an ending for those who stuck it out the entire song.    We'll see if their collaboration with Andy Tillson (The Tangent) steers them into new territory, but another Sane Day Pt3 won't interest me. Sleeping In Traffic Pt1 sounded way more focused to my ears, and while the jammy stuff might sound fun live, I liked Pt1's cohesiveness, and its conciseness. I also miss the underlying blues-rock motif that permiates Pt1, but is absent on Pt2,making Pt2 sound much like every other Swedish prog band weened on old Kaipa albums.     Not saying this album is a total bust. There are moments of cerebral splendor here and there, as a few songs touch upon the theme of Pt1, and of course, the musicianship is solid. As jammy as they are here, they still play with a healthy restraint (they don't really show off), nor do they take themselves too seriously, as the recurring humor shows. But I'm less impressed this time around, as I feel I've heard it before.
B00005JLIU|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!  Very funny even my 13yr old loved it. I would suggest this to anyone that likes musical comedys
0307269752|5.0|I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. Very well written. Tough to put down.
1436149606|5.0|Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, I just don't trust you.  I know, I've violated the rules so I'm doomed.<br /><br />First of all, the book came before the film and the film came before the DVD.  Unfortunately, I saw the film before I saw the DVD and that was before I \\"heard\\" the book on CD.  I love them all and will see/hear them again and again.  If you have neither seen nor heard nor read the novel, I'd recommend the novel first because the raw form of the words and their arrangement is the original creation of the characters who drive this world before they are interpreted by the filmmakers who translated the words and story to film.<br /><br />I am like the Narrator, a consumer who is aware of the strangling hold of tangible things, but I do not feel the need for a revolution to rid myself of my belongings, be them from Ikea or other suppliers of goods.  I rest comfortably but he cannot sleep, which leads us to wonder if he dreams about an imaginary Fight Club, only to question that non-reality when he is recognized in his travels.  What is real and what is conjecture?<br /><br />The film was intriguing, the DVD offered a hidden frozen frame alluded to in the novel but the novel was the best of all.  Prepare to lose a little something in order to gain a little insight and don't be disturbed by the ending.  Like in fatalistic philosophy, whatever happens occurs for a reason and we must accept it, sort of like Fight Club.  It's not a bad thing, it's simply the way things are.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is pure AC/DC at their best.  I know people who don't like AC/DC, but love this record.  One of the best for sure.  If your thinking of buying it, go for it.  You'll love it.  It's way better then the new one Black Ice.  That one is horrible, but that's another story.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|As a child, I think I would not have been scared of animated rats in the kitchen.  Mice made the most entertaining cartoon characters.  Despite my understanding the magic of animation and being that I did indeed have an unwelcome rat in my kitchen a couple years ago, the notion of rats running through the food, let alone cooking, nauseates me beyond any level of comfort and I found myself cringing throughout \\"Ratatouille.\\"  Each time I saw the Little Chef on the head of Linguini, I thought it as creepy as the scariest of horror films, particularly since they resembled each other in profile.  I couldn't erase from memory the vision of a three dimensional rodent I photographed running across my balcony.  Nevertheless, I think this film is an outstanding representation of an imaginative story that was successfully translated to film via the collaborative efforts of creative artists.  Mickey Mouse and Mighty Mouse never frightened me as did this film, so I can only assume that had I retained the innocence of youth, I would have been thrilled with the success of the film's heroic underdog, er rather, rat, and not repulsed.  I think kids will love this film.
0810970686|5.0|Not since the last Harry Potter book has the tween world so eagerly anticipated the arrival of the next installment in a series.   Jeff Kinney's tales of Greg Heffley have become must-reads for middle school kids, especially young boys who are attracted to Kinney's skill at presenting young males in all their snot-nosed glory.   An added bonus is the \\"rebel factor\\", as kids know that many parents and educators don't approve of the disrespectful antihero.      In the third installment, Greg's father takes an interest in dewimping his son, forcing him to play sports with bigger, tougher boys and threatening to make Greg \\"be all he can be\\" by shipping him to a military school.    Surprisingly, Greg's reactions to his father's demands are as much genuine and poignant as they are crude and sarcastic.   Camouflaged by the humor built from the central figure's insolence is honesty that highlights author Kinney's ability to remember the fear and loathing of adolescence.      Although Kinney has developed a common template in his series, he does fill each book with fresh ideas.  Like a good episode of The Wonder Years or a reflective moment from My Antonia, the Wimpy books hold an appeal not just to the young, but also to any of us who used to be young.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]    Absolutely amazing photography and information.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|I was moved and inspired by this story of an ordinary man who felt a call to end slavery, and achieved his goal by simply not giving up. The inner struggles of William Wilberforce are clearly portrayed by an understated and often humorous performance by Ioan Gruffoad, as well as the difficulties of gaining success in this (at the time) most unpopular mission. The rest of the cast are as superb as we \\"over the pond\\" have come to expect from British period dramas, and Albert Finney is absolutely brilliant as John Newton, repentant former slave trader and author of the hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\", who acts as mentor to the often discouraged Wilberforce.    But the film itself is a beautiful work of art, with exceptional sets, costumes and uniquely stylized editing, which might be confusing to the lazy viewer, but pulls together beautifully for the stirring and heart-lifting climax.    Some have criticized this film for not showing more of the plight of the slaves or their point of view, but it seems to me they miss the point. Wilberforce was in a battle for the hearts and minds of a population who for the most part had no concept of slavery- except to enjoy its financial rewards- or empathy with the enslaved. The filmmakers take for granted their audience has a different perspective, and endeavors to make them realize the complete ignorance and apathy, as well as avarice, against which the hero struggles. The scene in which Wilberforce leads a \\"pleasure cruise\\" of wealthy and influential people past the docks of slave ships, is particularly telling. An excellent film.
B000XK7P7S|4.0|she was talented b4 she had the big hair and all that..! this album is less ground-breaking than her 2nd, but still very good. \\"amy amy amy\\" is my favorite, you can hear the style of the next album in it. the rest of the songs are less \\"retro\\".
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I could not have had lower expectations before I heard this album. Like everyone else I had only heard snippets and The Day That Never Comes before it came out and that wasn't enough to judge the album by. When I did finally hear the whole album I was VERY pleasantly surprised. A new Metallica album and I'm enjoying it! I didn't think such as a thing was possible as the last time that happened was in 1991. Now this album is not a total return to form and honestly doesn't even come close to their 80's material but it's a LOT better than I thought they were capable of anymore after three bad albums in a row. All in all though it's a very good Metallica album and even more surprisingly a good heavy metal album. Only drawbacks to me are James' vocals he needs to go back to his AJFA/TBA style this \\"singing\\" thing he does now doesn't really work too well and the mixing on this album is as bad as it gets with constant clipping. If you can track down the Guitar Hero 3 version as it sounds about a million times better.

Its innovative with its humbleness.<br /><br />You can hear the tracks above, but the songwriting with Harper is always steller.  the sleeve and lyrics are printed on 100% post consumer waste recycled paper.<br /><br />It was recorded as mentioned before in France, and so it fittingly has a beautiful instrumental tune called Paris Sunrise.  This is, and I hesitate to say it, my favorite Ben Harper album.<br /><br />Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals never disappoint me - but I really like the feeling of this album.
B001GCUNYO|3.0|[[ASIN:B001GCUNYO Taken]] is a new movie starring Liam Neeson as a former security specialist who has relegated himself to the civilian sector to be closer to his daughter.  When a simple trip abroad puts his daughter and her friend in danger, he must swing back into action.  Visually, the movie is very well shot and will be a pleasure to watch in standard definition or Blu-Ray.  But the weak story holds back a movie that could have been much better.<br /><br />This film deals with kidnapping and human trafficking, very serious problems which have become overused in films of recent memory.  This film is entertaining as an action movie, though somewhat predictable.  But as a movie about human trafficking, the script is filled with numerous holes and inaccuracies that make it less than believable.  The less you know about the topic, the easier it will be for you to suspend disbelief and enjoy this as surface level entertainment.<br /><br />As Bryan Mills, Neeson attempts to channel a composite of Matt Damon's character from the [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] with Denzel Washington's character from [[ASIN:B00005JN0W Man on Fire]].<br /><br />Bourne's odyssey and skills are easier to believe because of the economy of dialogue and the way the back-story is slowly fed to us.  In addition, the script of the [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] was clearly well vetted and researched.  Here, Neeson's character says and does things that no trained security professional would ever do, like warning the villains that he is a trained security professional and that he is coming for them.  He is clearly no Bourne.<br /><br />In comparison with Denzel Washington's character, Neeson is not given nearly as much to work with in terms of emotion and dimension.  Denzel was given a character we could relate to through his human frailty.  But Neeson is given a wooden role with one-dimensional motivation.  One can even think to Russel Crowe's role in [[ASIN:B00005BCKF Proof of Life]] as another point of comparison.  It's easy to see how little Neeson is given to work with here.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good, and includes Famke Janssen as Neeson's ex-wife.  However, there is a rather lengthy back-story that attempts to develop Neeson's character.  We get to meet his former security buddies and get to see how he interacts with his ex-wife and how much he sacrifices for his daughter.  By the time we get to the heart of the film, it's clear that much of that back-story could have been told in half the time to better effect.<br /><br />About half of the early cast could have been cut.  Similarly there are a lot of supporting scenes that could have been trimmed to maintain the suspense at a higher level.  The result is a movie with choppy pacing that drags on and feels longer than it is.<br /><br />The irony of that is that there is already an extended \\"harder\\" cut set to be released on Blu-Ray.  I will suspend disbelief till I see the extended version, but it's difficult for me to imagine making this movie better by adding scenes.  It seems like much of what was included could have made this movie better by being pared away.<br /><br />**** MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD -- STOP NOW TO AVOID ****<br /><br />As with any action movie, there are a number of fight scenes where Neeson seems to gain super-human dexterity, unlimited strength and omnipresent knowledge of all of his enemies.  Believe it or not, I can somewhat accept his ability to defeat any number of opponents as an action movie standard.  The fight choreography is actually very good as a whole.<br /><br />However, it gets worse. The numerous errors in the supporting sequences make it difficult to suspend disbelief.  With almost no information, he is able to ID his adversaries from some imaginary database that could only exist in the mind of a Hollywood producer and would never work in practice.  It's hard to believe that Neeson goes to Paris, after having been retired from overseas duty for several years, and somehow all his contacts are still there in roughly the same roles ready to provide him lodging and resources.<br /><br />Of course, everybody in Paris speaks English to him with pleasure.  Did any of the writers actually go to Paris for research before this movie?  It's difficult to accept that he could wander into a crime den masquerading as a French security agent while speaking English.  Then again, considering the same people he confronts have already gotten a visual ID on him, it's absurd that he isn't immediately shot.<br /><br />But then, to insult our intelligence even further, once we get to the climax scene and witness the people actually engaging in the human trafficking, we are shown a scenario that makes [[ASIN:B000UNYK3A Hostel]] seem plausible.  I don't want to give too much away.  But if you do get to see it ask yourself, \\"would people breaking the law do so in this way?\\"<br /><br />Once again, if you can suspend disbelief some of those many things will not bother you as much.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This movie is OK, hence my average rating.  It's a good way to pass the time, and those who love foreign thrillers and action movies will enjoy the fight scenes and top notch camera work.  But the predictable plot and factual errors undercut what could have been a much better movie.  Neeson is a very good actor, but he can't make up for a script that needed to be vetted by several fact checkers before the final cut.<br /><br />Judging by the enthusiastic foreign response to this movie, I can only hope that a completely separate cut was release for the European market.<br /><br />This is worth seeing for mindless entertainment, but if you're expecting something as good as [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] you will likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy.ere in roughly the same roles ready to provide him lodging and resources.

B000VWE5OY|1.0|I wanted to like Torchwood, and was well disposed to after Jack Harkness and the Torchwood organisation/s were set up on Dr Who.    But this is rubbish.  Everything about it is disappointing: the writing, characterisation, continuity, acting, directing, editing, music, sound editing, lighting, and special effects. Perhaps the producers were too ambitious for their budget, or perhaps they felt they could rely on the cheap-and-cheerful plastic rocks and rubber monsters that populate early Star Trek and most of the Dr Who series and not bother with essentials like writers.    Everything is wrong with this series, so I shall only discuss the writing.    The characters are inconsistent, irresponsible, shallow, immature and stupid.  Their dialogue is often stilted and inane; there were only a few moments in the entire series when a line stood out as being at all insightful or witty.     The relationships between the characters are also shallow and unappealing, and the focus is, as many reviewers here have stated, mostly crude sexual opportunism.  I have nothing against depicting sexual relationships on tv, but the immediate rush of first kisses is not the interesting part. But that's all we get in Torchwood; the writers don't bother to explore the relationships in depth, to develop compatibility or explore the consequences of infidelity and rejection, or bother to maintain a credible emotional arc.    The stories are just a loop of plot devices, emotional wallowing, long harangues declaimed most theatrically, and silent movie era over-acting.

B00005JNJV|5.0|One always thought that the original \\"Batman\\" movie of Michael Keaton was the most descent in the series in terms of storyline and it's closeness to reality, and this Batman Begins comes to kick it off and reinvent the hero, giving him more depth, darkness and colour.The best thing about this movie is that it both invested time in showing us how the hero has evolved from the abandoned child in the alley to the masked justice warrior, and justified each and every detail of the gadgets Batman gets. This gave the movie a far more human depth and an unmatched closeness to reality.    2 thumbs up!    PS: this is not longer a children movie, children were actually screaming and crying in the cinema, some scenes are considered disturbing for children.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|I purchased a Saitek Cyborg X joystick (the name has since been changed to Mad Cats F.L.Y. Stick for PC - though I'm told it also works with Apple computers)for use with the excellent IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 combat flight sim, also purchased from Amazon.com.  It's a great joystick, with only a few small shortcomings.<br /><br />First the good stuff--there are a total of 12 programmable buttons, a programmable rotating trim wheel just below the weapon switches,  a rudder control operated by twisting the stick, and a dual throttle lever that can be locked for single engine use.  There is an eight-position hat switch in the middle of the four weapon switches at the top of the stick, and two LED's that illuminate the weapon switches, hat switch and trim wheel from above.<br /><br />On top of all the controls, the Cyborg X is highly adjustable.  The top head including the trigger and weapon switches can tilt fore and aft, the length of the stick can be adjusted with the push of a button, and the stick itself can be adjusted fore and aft.  A tabbed hex key used for most of the adjustments stows in one of the three joystick supports.<br /><br />As for smoothness and ease of use, I really like the way Saitek centers this joystick.  A spring seats a shallow cone-shaped disk inside another cone when the stick is at center.  When the joystick is moved off of center, this makes for very smooth action in all axes, unlike the joysticks used in radio control transmitters.  There is about five degrees of slop evident in the stick when it is centered though, due to play between the screw adapter the stick attaches to and the joystick base arm. (The joystick comes disconnected from the base as packaged.)  It wouldn't hurt if the manufacturing tolerances were a little tighter here.<br /><br />All this adjustability comes at a slight price.  When you press any of the four weapons switches, the top of the joystick flexes, making them feel somewhat imprecise.  The weapons switches also don't close as crisply as the trigger switch does.  The last fault I found with it is that, when pushing the joystick far forward, the base can tip forward too.  This is because while there is a base leg to the rear of the stick, there are none forward.  The two front base legs are mounted laterally.<br /><br />These are minor quibbles.  The Saitek Cyborg X is the best joystick I've ever bought.<br /><br />Update: After a few years I did have some problems with wires being pulled off of their solder tabs inside the joystick, and two wires broke as well.  The wiring inside my Saitek joystick is extremely thin.  I don't know if this has been fixed since I bought mine or not.  I was able to solder the loose wires back on, and fix the broken wires as well.  But I may rewire the joystick with thicker braided wiring in the future if I continue to have problems.  It makes no sense to me that Saitek used such tiny wires, since they flex when the joystick is moved.  The rest of the joystick is well made.switch does.

B001GXY92U|4.0|I have numerous recordings of these famous Bach concertos, and the young French pianist David Fray's is a fine addition to the field.     Although only on his third album, it seems from reviews here on Amazon and its European sites that Fray is already something of a divisive character, perhaps because his album cover glamour shot invites comparison to classical lite artists, or maybe because of his eccentricities at the keyboard (which recall Glenn Gould, a very \\"love him or hate him\\" figure). But no listener of classical music-- casual or hardcore-- should dismiss Fray, a serious talent with star potential in a field badly in need of some stars, especially those who don't simplify the repertoire.    Fray conducts from the bench, and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, one of Europe's finest chamber orchestras, sounds subtle and superb. The meeting of Fray and the Kammerphilharmonie is chronicled in this album's accompanying documentary, [[ASIN:B001HKM8HA David Fray: J.S. Bach - Swing, Sing and Think]], which captures the musical synergy that emerges here despite the tension between David Fray, acting the highly emotional artiste, and the veteran musicians of the Kammerphilharmonie, who smirk a bit at the young Fray's fire but amiably attempt to follow his alternately vague and flowery instructions.    The specter of Glenn Gould hovers over Fray and these concertos, or as Fray describes him in the liner notes to the documentary, \\"that rascal Gould, who has stamped his indelible mark on them.\\" The documentary director Bruno Monsaingeon writes, \\"in other words, it's a matter of finding a way of playing Bach after Gould.\\"     Fray's way is a generally romantic approach, an overall effort to trace the emotional journey contained in Bach's music. In contrast is Murray Perahia's much-praised renditions, [[ASIN:B00006310M Bach: Keyboard Concertos Nos. 3, 5, 6, 7]], which similarly teases new colors from certain passages but comes across as overly mannered. Fray, on the other hand, applies his romantic vision to the pieces in their entirety, so that when he does bring unique phrasing to a passage it does not seem so self-conscious. Again, it is Fray's consistently emotional approach to the music that distinguishes him. Most importantly, it's an approach that pays off-- Fray and the Kammerphilharmonie sound great and the music is beautiful. If you need only one recording of these works by Bach, this album could easily be it.      It's worth comparing Fray's with the Bach Concertos recently recorded by the young German pianist Martin Stadtfeld, [[ASIN:B000JJSRYS J.S. Bach: Piano Concertos]]. Both are charismatic young Europeans of almost the same age (born 1980 and 81), hyped in their home countries, big on Bach and among the few young pianists worldwide with exclusive big-label recording contracts. Stadtfeld and Fray have radically different approaches. Stadtfeld is all about speed and clarity: Bach speeding by with the gas pedal down. Fray does much the opposite: a journey through Bach's landscape that stops to smell ever rose. To speak in sweeping generalization, Stadtfeld takes a very German approach, Fray a very French. Not that classical music is a competition, but Fray presents a more cohesive overall vision of the music than his contemporary Stadtfeld and emerges, in this round at least, as the more impressive talent.

B0019M06JS|5.0|After Something For You, the very nice tribute album to Bill Evans, Eliane Elias releases Bossa Nova Stories, another all-singing album resembling the concept of Dreamer (actually Dreamer contains a very touching instrumental version of A House Is Not A Home as the closing track). Not all the tracks are Bossa Nova tunes but they are interpreted in such a style.     Her singing is surely in top form, but the music lacks the magic slightly as compared to Dreamer. One of the reasons may be that the jazz trio element has been suppressed. Meanwhile, Elaine Elias' idiosyncratic \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" type solo lines are mostly missing. While she redoes a number of Jobim tunes in this album, the results are not as tasteful as her previous attempts. Take Chega de Saudade for example, the treatment is much fresher in her earlier album Three Americas.    Listeners who would like to experience the best singing of Eliane Elias, I strongly recommend Dreamer (check comments from the Amazon reviewers), Kiss of Nature (her best album so far in my opinion), Eliane Elias Sings Jobim, and Three Americas. I give 5 stars to all of these albums. Despite saying that, the present album is at most 10% off to her best work. My rating is still rounded up to 5 stars.

1591841984|5.0|One man revolutionized computers in the 1970s and 80s (with Apple II and Mac), animated movies in the 1990s (with Pixar), and digital music in the 2000s (with the iPod and ITunes).  \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" is part biography and part leadership guide.<br /><br />More than 100 million iPods were sold by November 2007, and it's on track for 300 million by the end of 2009.  Sony's Walkman, the current biggest hit, sold 350 million in its 15-year reign.  Ninety percent of all music players sold are an iPold, and the iTunes online store has sold 3 billion songs.<br /><br />Disney bought Pixar from Jobs in 2006 for $7.4 billion; it made the first fully computer-animated movie (Toy Story) in 1995.  Yet, Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985; had taken it public in 1980.  After leaving Apple, Jobs founded NeXT, with the purpose of selling advanced computers to schools and putting Apple out of business; he also bought the struggling computer graphics company from George Lucas, and propped it up for a decade with $60 million of his own money.<br /><br />NeXT hardware failed to catch on - sold 50,000 units in 8 years, so Jobs concentrated on software for niche customers like the CIA.  This software became the foundation for Mac OS X when he was invited back in 1996 as a consultant.  After Apple market share from 10% to 3%, Jobs became CEO again.<br /><br />Jobs began with a product review aimed a cutting its confusing number of products, replaced most of the board, resolved a bitter patent lawsuit with Microsoft (dropped charges vs. Windows in return for Microsoft continuing to develop Office for Mac), killed production by clone-makers, cut the number of suppliers while getting better deals, and cut the number of hardware and software products.  (The latter also allowed dramatic inventory reductions.)

B001GM28HO|4.0|This is my new go-to cd for the treadmill. All of the songs (with the exception of \\"Brown Eyes\\", which kinda sucks) have a good keep-you-moving dance beat. They're catchy tunes that stick in my head long after my workouts are over, and Lady Gaga's voice is better than most dance-pop artists. I do have to say that the lyrics on this cd are definitely lacking (my reason for only 4 stars). They go into all-out stupid territory sometimes. For example: \\"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick,\\" from Lovegame. Or, \\"...'cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin,\\" from Pokerface. Oh, and the phrase \\"cherry-cherry boom-boom\\" is in, like, 3 songs for no reason whatsoever (her trademark, maybe? Maybe at 27, I'm just too old for this stuff). Still, it's a fun cd, and who listens to this type of music for the lyrics anyway?

0312383320|2.0|I've waited a long time to make this review to get my thoughts together. I do think this book was better than 14. But then, I thought the Sears ad in Sunday's paper was better than 14. This book has some humorous moments in it, and I think it sounded more like Janet's \\"voice\\" than the last couple of books. I don't expect the Stephanie Plum books to be great literature, but I feel like I progressed beyond fart and monkey humor many years ago. But while I found some humorous parts, what really got to me the most, and ruined the book, was the use of domestic abuse as humor. There is nothing funny about cheating spouses, the courts and morgues are full of cheaters gone bad. The fact that Janet would manipulate Morelli into manipulating Stephanie into talking his SIL into taking back this abusive spouse because \\"it's what Morelli women do\\", is neither funny nor acceptable in my world. So while I'll give this book two stars because it was a step above 14, it's not anything that will ever have a place on my bookshelf.

B001KQ031Y|4.0|Tropic Thunder takes an absurd, behind the scenes look at a blockbuster Hollywood production while satirizing the war film genre. From tongue in cheek jabs at great war flicks like Platoon and Apocolypse Now, to prima donna actors, to Tinsel Town power brokers (Tom Cruise's best performance of late), nothing is sacred. Stiller's humor is over the top and razor sharp, Jack Black does what he does best, fart jokes and physical comedy, and Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />The special features include the standard behind the scenes featurettes and deleted/extended scenes, but hidden among them are two gems. Rain of Madness does for \\"Making of\\" documentaries what Tropic Thunder does for Hollywood blockbusters. Also included is the sketch from the 2008 MTV music awards showing Stiller, Downey, and Black trying to come up with a viral marketing video. The clip had me laughing as much or more than the feature did.<br /><br />If you are into satire and silliness, Tropic Thunder is a solid fun movie.
0312370849|5.0|De Rosnay's novel riveted me from the beginning.  In this story, chapters alternate between two time periods, 60 years apart, 1942 and 2002.  For the first half of the book, the reader is compelled to wonder how the two stories intersect.  Is is just location?  Does it get personal?  Where do the alternating chapters intersect?      The two stories and the two time periods, focus on the Vel d'Hiv', one of the largest Nazi roundups of Jews, carried out by French soldiers. The two main characters, Sarah and Julia, intersect in a creative twist of history and research.      Sarah is 10 years old in Paris, 1942 when there is a pounding on the door in the middle of the night.  She, her mother, and her father end up being brought to the Velodrome d'Hiver, but Sarah thinking that they would be right back, locks her brother in their secret hiding place. Julia is a  45 year old American living in Paris in the year 2002 and is covering the 60th anniversary of the Vel' d'Hiv.  What she doesn't know when she starts the project is that the family she has married into also has a connection with the Vel' d'Hiv roundups.    Both Sarah and Julia rely on the kindness of strangers to make it through their individual ordeals.  The minor characters that are introduced are well done, in that the reader can easily take to liking or dis-liking a character.      I found myself creating more time to read, as this novel and de Rosnay's storytelling was truly compelling.  To say Sarah's story was sad would be an understatement.  Julia was dealing with her own issues at home and within her family, and this research gave her a true north with which to work toward.  What moved me most deeply was the ending.  With all this emotional chaos for both characters, I felt like it was a victory for Julia to come into her own and Sarah not to be forgotten.
0061122416|5.0|I could relate to the story in this novel. It is an inspiring story about a boy who follows his dream. Even though the story inspires us to abandon our comfort zone and follow our dreams, it is realistic in the sense that it does not promise us that the path to our dreams is easy.<br /><br />Some cynics (and I consider myself to be a cynic) are going to hate it, because it talks about fluffy stuff. However, remember that the author talks in terms of metaphors. You do not need to take his words literally. You can use your own interpretation of the metaphors. For example you can take the omens he describes in the story to be literally signals from God or more realistically, clues or signals based on actual reality. Also a warning to the atheists, don't read too much on the mention of the word \\"God\\" or you will miss out on very valuable insight.<br /><br />In any case it is not a huge investment in terms of time to read this novel. It is a short, so go ahead and take the chance to read it; it may just prove to be a good omen!

0446677450|5.0|I've read over a few negative comments that people have posted in regard to this book. While they all have valid claims I believe they miss the big picture. Nowhere in the book does the author make the claim that this book will make you money, quite the contrary in fat. He tells you to learn how to make money. This is a not a guide to making money but it definitely changed my outlook on the way I view money. It was an eye opener for me. Before reading this book I felt like others about investing \\"its too risky\\" \\"I work to hard for it\\" etc etc. This book opened my eyes and pointed out that if I fail, the worst thing that will happen is that I will have a debt on my shoulders, and let's face a large majority of Americans have debt and they didn't even try to make money. Now granted I'm young and can afford to take a hit or two, but it is true that we learn from our failures and this book inspires you to get over your fear. But I repeat Robert Kyosaki does not claim that this book is the only book to read, he encourages you to learn about money yourself and then attempt to build your fortune. This book inspired me to learn more and that is what I'm doing right now.

0312360266|1.0|I read this book because someone in the Twilight comments suggested it. I was looking for something kind of like Twilight because I liked so much. But it is really bad, and I wasn't expecting it to be as good as Twilight but also I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. It has vulgar language (which doesn't work for me) and I think is too Teenageish, I know is meant for young audience (I'm 26) but still, Twilight was also about teenagers and it was above the vulgar language and just the story was not that good. I just read this book, not gonna bother with the rest of the series.

B0018CWEYY|3.0|i am a big fan of lost, and lost 4 is great...the problem is with the dvd itself. disc 3 sticks at the beginning. amazon was great and made good, but it seems the problem is widespread. truth be told amazon has xlnt customer service.
B001GKJ2FM|2.0|I'm sure the movie itself was fine, but there was a huge rip in the shrink wrap when the movie arrived.  If I wasn't giving this as a Christmas gift it would not have been a big deal, but since I did not have enought time to return it, I went ahead and gave it as is, hoping the actual movie was not damaged.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I purchased this CD after seeing her on 'Ellen' and have listened to it several times. Like an interesting and intricate movie, the more you listen the more you hear. The pieces that first appear simple become multi-dimensional - first because of her clear and sweet-yet-gutsy voice - but also because you can't put a name to her style. She is a definite throwback to the mid 60s a la Petula Clark, but close your eyes and she's got soulful and earthy qualities. Hard to describe but whatever it is, it is a joy to listen to. She doesn't over-play her strong voice, she doesn't push notes out or put unnecessary edges or endings in her work - the trademark of someone confident in her gift and knows who she is as a singer. Take yourself out of these days of screaming vocalists and 120 piece orchestras and Elvis-endings and go back to a time when a beautiful voice, originality and easiness on the eyes was enough.

B001HZ9ABM|5.0|After forty years, the Gibb Brothers have finally re-released their most classic and eclectic of albums, \\"Odessa\\".  Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen-month breakup, these three musicians, barely out of their teens, produced their only double studio album.  Originally coated in a red velvet cover, this is one of the most extravagant re-releases to date.  Originally seventeen songs, varying from the near operatic, \\"Odessa (City On The Black Sea)\\" to country flavored tunes like, \\"Marley Purt Drive\\" and \\"Give Your Best\\", the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available, including rock, orchestral, country and R&B.<br /><br />Originally slated to be titled, \\"An American Opera\\" or \\"Masterpeace\\", this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity.  In addition to two new studio songs, \\"Pity\\" and \\"Nobody's Someone\\", there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality, beat and alternate verses.  \\"Edison\\", \\"Lamplight\\", First Of May\\" and \\"Whisper, Whisper\\" all are given special treatment, sometimes twice.  \\"Whisper, Whisper\\" is actually Part Two, a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast, rock driven pace.<br /><br />Of the three discs (57 songs), the stereo had been remixed/remastered to absolute, crystal clear perfection, bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained.  The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments, while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material.<br /><br />Fan Joe Brennan of website \\"Gibb Songs\\" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings:  \\"Odessa was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape reels.  Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately, and each might have the input from one or more microphones.  Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places (like New York and London), or erased and re-recorded.  To make stereo, you have to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.  While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be.  That's where the differences come from.  The source is the same 8 track master.  Mono was for old record players, and for AM radio, which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio\\".<br /><br />With three discs, a poster, extensive liner notes, photographs of the group, handwritten lyrics, single covers and reel-to-reel listings, a T-Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box, this limited edition is a fan and collector's dream.ve to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.

B0000501C3|5.0|This is an exquisite disc. As interpreted by Reinhard Goebel and Musica Antiqua Köln, the music of Lully and his contemporaries is elegant, powerful, exquisite, refined and even explosive. It is a superlative recording that make me wish that Goebel would record more French Baroque. But this is not their repertoire so grab this one! Get the movie too, its a feast for both eye and ear!    The French term éclatant, which means \\"brilliant\\" and \\"explosive\\" best describes this astounding recording. Get it!    It ranks near the top of my personal \\"10 recordings for a deserted island.\\"

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Gotham's Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent need super-hero Batman (Christian Bale), just as the mob needs the anti-hero Joker (Heath Ledger). But if the good guy wears black, dispenses vigilante justice outside the law, refuses to reveal his true identity, causes good people to die, and is plagued by doubts, then you have a morally ambiguous plot with a genuinely \\"dark knight.\\" Gothamites wonder, is he more hero or menance? Both the Gotham cops and the crime mob get more than they bargain for when they employ their moral archtypes. The Joker is crazy bad with his stringy hair, purple suit, scarred face, and smeared makeup. He cares nothing for money, and only wants to watch Gotham burn. The technical effects reminded me of a James Bond movie, as did the love triangle involving Batman and Dent. Heath Ledger won a (posthumous) Golden Globe for his role, but I found it distracting to wonder just how much his real life descent into darkness and death was life imitating art.

B001FB55LM|4.0|I went to this film dreading the worst, and came out yes, saying \\"yes\\"<br />quite a bit more often. Bearing in mind the \\"meaning\\" of it, not saying<br />a monosyllable, and taking it all with a pinch of salt (like the<br />self-help guru Terrence Bundley teaches our man in the hospital), this<br />movie is fun, well made, and doesn't pretend deep meaningful questions.<br />Popcorn movie? Yes, but good one! Only once did I feel I was into<br />another formulaic trap. In my case, it was when Carl was riding the<br />super motorcycle. It felt like The Mirror Has Two Faces (Streisand's),<br />which was copied in (among others), \\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\\",<br />etc.<br /><br />Moving to the stuff of life: I love Zooey Deschanel's Allison! Of<br />course, I don't know if I'd stand anything like her in real life, but<br />isn't she lovely as a woman living by her own rules, not wanting to be<br />stereotyped \\"I've got fears, too!\\" near the end, and yes, charmingly<br />out of tune with reality :)? I feel the part suits her perfectly.<br />Unlike another try of Carrey to play something sort of serious: Eternal<br />Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's Kate Winslet, who's just crass, and<br />totally... uninviting :).<br /><br />Bradley Cooper and his other sex addicted friend are fine, the scenes<br />with the old lady are a bit too much to, well, swallow, and<br /><br />Rhys Darby is great. I didn't know the actor, but playing a perfect<br />goof takes guts! I felt pity for old Norman, which is good in such an<br />\\"optimistic\\" film. Molly Sims is cool as a stupid gorgeous<br />materialistic woman. John Cothran Jr.'s voice is good for a boss. I am<br />having nightmares with it :). The joke on cops being paranoid about<br />yes, \\"suspiciously chosen activities\\" \\"Who goes on holidays to Lincoln,<br />Nebraska\\" :)? is fun, if a bit stereotyped Hollywood \\"liberalism\\" as<br />Americans like to misname it.<br /><br />I agree with IDMB's reviewer bopdog from Cardiff, Wales about a) the<br />film being uplifting b) Carrey becoming \\"a bit more human, and a bit<br />more approachable\\". Morale? Go and enjoy uncritically (if you can)!ally (if you can)!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Ben Stiller has crafted a fine, very funny film, and the cast is outstanding. Others were offended, but I'll bet you anything that it's the way Hollywood treats everyone at large. Stiller, Downey, Black, McBride, McConnaughy...all have their hearts in to provide this most insane and hysterical display of people behaving badly. Jay Baruchel is especially engaging, and Nick Nolte looks like he's having more fun that he's had in years. Everyone in the cast is totally buying in to this insanity, and there's not a weak link in the cast.  I only bought the 1-disc version, due to finances at the time. I've watched it a few times, and there are always things I missed the first few times. which can only remind me of the first time I watched \\"Some Like It Hot\\". Very funny, very insane, very enjoyable. I didn't know that it was Tom Cruise playing the crude producer until the credits rolled, most impressive and enjoyable performance. A really committed performance, that I initially thought should be nominated for something. To go down the list of performances, it seems that Robert Downey is getting all the praise, but my favorite was Jay Baruchel. I would also like to see more of Bill Heder, as Cruise's lackey. He was fun. The script, much improvised I'm sure, was no end of revelation and discovery, so very funny. For those who have only seen it once, watch it again. I missed a lot the first time. Also, Matthew McConneghy had a fun part, and his ring-tone didn't strike me as funny until my second viewing. Overwhelming, crazy display of genius. All involved should be commended.
0312383320|4.0|Usually Janet Evanovich gives us a peek at Stephanie Plum and her world as we eagerly anticipate the next numbered book. Evanovich calls these appetizers \\"Between-the-Numbers\\" books.<br />This offering is better than anticipated. The earlier between the numbers books haven't necessarily been loaded with a lot of laughs.These tweeners always feature the mysterious Diesel, a gorgeous, otherworldly sexy blonde guy and has powers that always surprise Stephanie. This time Diesel is chasing his cousin, Wulf Grimoire, who apparently is as evil as Diesel is a good guy. Wulf has bad intentions and makes 'friends' with Martin Munch, who is a scientist and can build bombs. Munch is on Stephanie's skip list, and so the game begins.<br />Oh wait, there's Carl...You remember Carl the monkey? In the last numbers book, Carl wasn't particularly funny, but in Plum Spooky, having been left for Stephanie to care for him, we see apart from the little monkey still likes to give everyone the 'finger', he becomes part of the little group and does his part to be part of the silliness and fun.<br />Is this a laugh aloud book? No - but it is amusing and a good read. Better than I had thought it was going to be.<br />One of the puzzling things these Between-the Numbers offerings has that Joe and Ranger take uncharacteristic back seats, and let Stephanie and co. do their thing - Ranger's main thing is to give Stephanie more rides when she needs them, and Joe is more like a voice in the cell phone.<br />As any Stephanie Plum book, it is amusing and better reads than a lot of wannabee books like the Sophie Metropolis series.<br />I would love for Evanovich to go back to her crisp wildly funny writing and dialog. Perhaps the next Number book will be that one.<br />A good read.
B001FS4ZBG|5.0|It took me a while to watch this film. Mediocre reviews still couldn't keep me from seeing the very reliable Will Smith in a genre that I love. I got the 2-disc \\"Special Edition\\" at a good price. There aren't a whole lot of extras for a 2-disc version, but the 2nd disc is the Unrated Theatrical Edition. Mr. Smith is good, and the premise is certainly intriguing, though not terribly original. I was more entertained by \\"Night of the Comet\\". Still, magnificent special effects and sound effects, and steady direction by Francis Lawrence, made this enjoyable for me. I like sci-fi, and  enjoy a good \\"light-show\\" on occasion. Smith's character is most empathetic, and the brief appearance of Alice Braga is sweet in the midst of chaos.  I didn't look for flaws; rather, enjoyed a fun (?) film made with flair and care.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|We caught just a bit of the original airing in March of last year while we were in a hotel getting ready to go out for supper.  It was so engrossing from the very beginning that we wanted to cancel our evening plans and stay  in and watch!  So I bought the DVD set for my husband for Christmas and what a treat!  One goes from thrilling pride to exasperation to sorrow and back again over the hours spent watching this depiction of our wonderful nation's history....and a depiction of a touching human love story.  This spurred an interest in me to study the founding fathers in more depth.  I am so very proud of what they did FOR US-future generations of Americans-and as one other reviewer noted John Adams' words should be taken to heart:  \\"Oh, posterity. You will never know how much it cost us to preserve your freedom. I hope that you will make a good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in heaven that I ever took half the pains... to preserve it.\\"  Please fellow Americans, cherish our western ideals and freedoms.  They were hard won.

0439023483|5.0|Setting: Panem, formerly known as the United States- now an empty shell of what it was. Set in a future dystopia where the new government is in control of everything and there's a stark difference between the way the rich officials live and the majority of the population of Panem.<br /><br />Barely anyone can afford to eat. There's beggars everywhere and things such as hunting and scraping by for food are the usual state of affairs for the citizens here.<br /><br />In this wasteland the rich officials are holding their Hunger Games competition. A competition in which kids (12-18) are forced to compete with eachother and kill eachother for survival. The officials claim this is done to prove a point about some kind of war/struggle in which the new states came to be but soon you realize they do this more for their own enjoyment.<br /><br />They are the ones with the power and they think they have the right to take people's children and force them into this arena and televise it to their country to watch them kill eachother.<br /><br />There can only be one winner in this competition. The rest die- the winner gets to live in luxury and peace for the rest of their lives if they come out alive.<br /><br />In this book you can definitely sense it's the future, yet it's a very dark future. The stark difference between the way the officials live and the rest of the people is unbelievable.<br /><br />The officials live in a high tech world with everything at their fingertips and the rest of the population lives in a state that is even worse than the depression.<br /><br />The characters in the book held my interest. I found the struggle of the girl chosen to be compelling, along with the fact she knew one of the competitors she was being forced to kill and she liked him at that.<br /><br />This book is a mix of sci-fi, adventure and a sad state of affairs that is set in the future. All around, it's a great book that you won't be able to put down until you find out the final outcome of \\" The Hunger Games.\\"
B00003CXAW|5.0|All the short sighted people that gave this awesome movie only one star obviously missed the premise and ground breaking special effects of Kong.    The movie saved RKO studios from bankruptcy. Rear screen projection had never been seen before. This awesome effect gives the illusion the actors are in the same scene with the dinosaurs. The actors do a great job of making you believe they are in peril. Then there is the star of the movie-Kong. The animators did a wonderful job giving an inanimate object facial movements to convey feelings. Kong really looks enamored with Ann(Fay Wray). You actually feel for Kong when on the Empire State building the planes are pumping bullets into him until he succumbs and topples to his death. In one scene before he falls, we see a close up of his face and he seems to be saying, \\"Why are you doing this to me?\\" with a look of sadness in his eyes.    And in answer to the squeamish reviewers-during the movie a baby is put in danger when Kong rampages through the village, but is rescued by his mother. How many movies today feature kids being killed and monsters eating people? In Kong there is very little blood from the fight scenes. You can't say that about the movies of today. And of course JP has better effects. It's called CGI. Something that did not exist in 1933.    As for the acting, this is 1933 after all. The method of acting has changed a little bit since then. Robert Armstrong portrays Carl Denham, who actually is a clone of Merian C. Cooper. Cooper was an intrepid explorer going to the ends of the globe to make movies.    Max Steiner's theme and music is also very well done.    Summing up, the only way a person could pan this movie is if you compare it the movies of today with the CGI effects we have gotten used to. Doing this robs the movie of it's heart and is completely unfair. King Kong Rules!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|How does one fashion whimsy?  Can nostalgia be created from miles of celluloid film?  Is it possible for the essence of an era never-born to be experienced by those of us unfortunate enough to be stuck in reality?  Could such an accomplishment even be fathomed after similarly-themed attempts--such as the disastrous \\"Down With Love\\"--rocked our collective confidence in the capabilities of human imagination?  Director Kerry Conran both asks and, I believe, answers these questions with \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />Atmosphere is instantly created in the opening scene as a huge zeppelin, the \\"Hindenberg III,\\" soars over the Manhattan skyline--a megalithic representation of how everything will be done in this film.  Things and concepts which grant the movie its own identity are further emphasized by exaggerating their size and overall character, to good effect.  Dr. Vargas departs the airship in a paranoid rush, looking everywhere as if he is a man hunted; of course, a predator's quarry is exactly what he is, and the good doctor's hourglass no longer contains any sand.  We witness the involuntary departure of Dr. Vargas with the concomitant appearance of a gloved hand, crossing his name off a list.<br /><br />Events such as these do not go unnoticed by those well-connected, and Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow, \\"Se7en\\") is the reporter with just the right amount of ambition to connect the strands of this mystery.  She meets with Dr. Jennings in a dark theater, and learns that his is the last name remaining on the list.  He informs her that the danger which exists today has roots in the past:  plans that were put into motion in the twilight years of World War I are still being powered today, thirty years later, by some malevolent force.  This shrouded meeting is interrupted by the blaring of klaxons.  Polly rushes into the streets to witness the chaos which erupts as squadrons of gigantic, flight-capable robots begin their systematic dismantling of the Big Apple's energy supply.  The city responds with its only available weapon--radio towers sound out a desperate call to Sky Captain (Jude Law, \\"Alfie\\") and his group of aerial soldiers-for-hire.  Pushing his fighter to perform aeronautic feats which would impress a Hoth-based Luke Skywalker, Sky Captain manages to trip-up one of the dreadnaughts, prompting the abrupt cessation of the robotic attack.  From there, the movie is quick to reunite the former lovers and establish them on their path as they experience the destruction of Sky Captain's base, the depth of their enemies' plans, and their role in the fate of the world.<br /><br />Fans of comic books or role-playing games will most likely be familiar with the genre this film is set in--that of alternate futures and alternate pasts.  Set in the latter part of the 1940's, \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" mixes past, present, and future technology so that there is both an element of the recognizable and unrecognizable in each scene.  For example, while escaping a winged mechanical monstrosity, Sky Captain crashes his plane into the sea.  Luckily enough, his \\"aircraft\\" is equipped for this insult, and comes complete with an airtight cockpit and ballast mechanics which allow for easy maneuvering in the great blue undersea yonder.  Also filling this wondrous basket of technological goodies are electric coil traps, gigantic assembly lines with mechanized, hovering robotic attendants, massive airships which dwarf today's aircraft carriers, and innominate undersea mechanical leviathans.  It seems that, for Conran, big is beautiful.<br /><br />The ultimate story likewise tracks with the overall theme--the big, bad guy has a big, bad plan.  The final thirty minutes made the movie, in my opinion.  In my mind's eye, I can transport H.G. Wells into the audience and watch his reactions.  The acting might cause him to smirk, the action may result in a yawn, the visuals could make him smile; however, the denouement willresult in Wells giving the movie a standing ovation.

0545128285|1.0|I bought a \\"collector\\" edition for $39+ dollars and was totally ripped off. A book with the same 1st printing edition could be bought for under $12.  I will never buy from that bookseller again.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Move over, Twilight. Some people know that vampires don't sparkle.     I'm not an expert on the vampire genre itself, but I certainly enjoy it when it's explored well. Let the Right on In does that and more. It's alternatively creepy and wonderful.     Alfredson does an AMAZING job as a director - the film isn't overblown with the (seemingly) obligatory \\"scary music\\" nor with over-done special effects. When special effects are used, they're used so subtley that you really BELIEVE what you're seeing. The actors - at such young ages - are so convincingly real that it's still hard for me to believe they're so young. The cinematography is equally well done -- it's simple, relying mostly on the starkness of the landscape to help set up the atmosphere for the film.     The relationship that develops between Eli and Oskar has the depth and complexity that most \\"Brooding Vampire Falls in Love With Human\\" lacks. There are no cliches here. You genuinely dislike Eli for what she is, and simultaneously love her involvement with Oskar. Their relationship is creepy and full of adolescent awkwardness...but touching.     I left the movie blown away and not entirely sure whether I wanted to hide in a church for weeks on end to avoid vampires or go to Sweden and find a vampire of my own.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game was a gift for grandchildren, then I got one for my husband and me. Board games are wonderful in the winter, or any time for that matter. I suppose they're second only to eating together for fun and conversation.
0743454537|5.0|Loved this book!  Can't wait for the movie. I found myself not wanting to put it down.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Really, what can I say that hasn't been said already?? The Dark Knight is a wonderful movie that, definitely, lives up to all the hype that surrounds it. Perfect casting, superior storytelling and a unique take on The Dark Knight makes this movie seem spookily real. I got to admit, when I went to the big screen premiere, there were many times that I contemplated getting up and walking out during the movie 'cause the intensity was getting to me. Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker manages to hit you emotionally as a truly sadistic force that's evil and believable. When I first heard sometime back that Ledger was going to play The Joker; I, like everyone else, was wondering \\"Why him?\\". I've seen several of his movies but never seen him play a demented ruthless killer like The Joker before. I truly thought that he couldn't pull it off yet he more than did. He gave a performance that is definitely Oscar Worthy. The story itself goes a little something like this...Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham city with the help of Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They soon find themselves facing a ruthless criminal mastermind known as The Joker, who only has one intention on his mind...to bring an end to The Batman. The movie itself is supposed to take place mere days/weeks(it's unclear as to which) after the events in Batman Begins.<br /><br />I really love Chris Nolan's take on Batman. It's treated more seriously than anything else that's come before it. That's not to say that I never liked the other movies as I've got my favorites. With Nolan's take, you see how Batman is conflicted with the fact he's fighting an endless battle against crime. He's a broken and damaged person who's trying his best to make sense of what life he's been given. Again, in saying, making it all the more believable.<br /><br />The movie itself stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. It's won all manner of awards thus far from The American Film Institue, The Golden Globes, Broadcast Film Critics Association, The People's Choice Awards, and more. It clocks in at  nearly two and a half hours and is a movie that I'd strongly suggest not letting the younger set watch. There's a ton of violence in the movie that might upset them if seen. Given, there's practically no blood in the movie but there are plenty of scenes of extreme intensity that will get to them, believe me. I've seen all mannner of intense and graphic movies in my time, especially horror movies, and not one ever got to me quite as much as this one did.<br /><br />I, like everyone else, can't wait to see the next movie to follow up to The Dark Knight. Hopefully, we won't have seen the last of Two-Face. Although evidence in the movie points to his demise.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this movie? Indeed, I do. You'll love it as much as I did.

0545128285|5.0|Tales of Beetle the Bard has been advertised as a must read for Harry Potter Fans.  In fact, the title says, \\"A Wizardry Classic From The World of Harry Potter\\".  Does the book live up to the expectations for Harry Potter fans like this nine year old?  Yes and no.  Just like in the Harry Potter books, this book involves wands, mystical creatures, spells and wizardry.  however, compared to the Harry Potter books, which are often several hundred pages long and filled with complex sentences and complicated themes, Tales of the Beetle Bard can be read to a younger audience.  It is made up of five ten page tales with simple plots and even a few illustrations.     J.K. Rowling puts in a little twist though.  At the end of each tale, commentary by Albus Dumbledore appears.  It is written like the five tales were stories known by the students at Hogwarts.  Dumbledore's comments sometimes explain the tales from the point of view of someone from Hogwarts.  Some of the commentaries even tell stories of how Hogwarts students enjoyed the tales.     In conclusion, J.K. Rowling can write extraordinary books that go beyond the imagination.  This book may not be another Harry Potter book but any Harry Potter fan will still enjoy these wonderful tales that only J.K. Rowling can write.
B00011F5DK|4.0|My 4 1/2 year old grandson loves this game.  It teaches him to think ahead and to use negative space.  The game moves fast with 4 players and keeps his attention.  Love it.
B0002HYHSW|5.0|My sons are 3 and 4 and they love it. It is easy and fast. No reading needed, just color matching of the die and the sticks. Really fun. This will make great gifts!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Wow, I really enjoyed this soundtrack, brought back all the scenes from the movie. Although Abba sings the original songs flawlessly, this soundtrack from the movie brings back the feel-good warmth and fun that the movie gave.

B001NE80P4|5.0|High School Musical 3 continues the light-hearted, but sometimes dramatic, story of East High school students trying to understand life and their roles in it. The cast once again does a fantastic job with the triple threat of singing, dancing and acting. At points, you'll almost want to join in the fun. I think this film will appeal more to teens and young adults who will more readily relate to the themes of the film, but anyone should walk away with a good impression of the film. This one is definitely worth your while.
B000K6QIQO|5.0|Finally found this album on CD, but it is not the original...I think. Regardless, it has sentimental value as it was my first beatles album. I love every song. It is a mono mix, and I really think it adds to the feel because it brings back playing it endless times on my little phonograph. The sound is great. The whole thing is so upbeat. It is my new all-time favorite Beatles Album! Wonder why it was never re-released or remastered for CD.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr, the third Book in Paolini's Inheritance Saga, shows an increasing depth of maturity in Paolini's writing, and a slight change of direction from the simpler storytelling of especially Eragon, and the second instalment, Eldest.  Much more of the 'action' takes place internally, and the character development consequently develops apace.<br />For those who love the cut and thrust of good fantasy battles, they are certainly there and recounted in exciting and edgy prose, which had me literally on the edge of my seat toward the end of the book.<br />Brisingr advances the story excitingly towards the conclusion, and left me wanting more - Christopher Paolini can't write quickly enough for my liking!
B000VI6T6U|5.0|If you have never seen Jimi play, it will blow you away. I first saw the movie in the theatre when I was 13 in 1977. I was spellbound. From that moment on, Jimi has been my favorite guitar player of all time. To understand Hendrix, you need to see live footage to appreciate his amazing technique and vibe. Incredible. If you have kids aspiring to be guitarists, I recommend this, although you may want to preview it first.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Movie was just OK, it was the acting of Heath Ledger that makes this a worth while purchase. Mr. Ledger was fantastic! Worth the purchase to see the best Joker ever.
B00000K0DT|5.0|The Usual Suspects is on my Top 10 favorite movies list.  Like lots of Kevin Spacey movies this one has great writing and a really good story.  I didn't figure it out until almost the end.  A few times I thought I had it but then another twist was thrown in.       Looking at it again even knowing the twists I still think they wee well done.  Of course knowing what happens ahead of time does make some scenes seem to reveal more than they actually do.  And I still enjoy the movie anyway.

031606792X|1.0|This was just BAD.  Stephanie Meyer gets rid of all her more interesting plot lines and replaces them with ones akin to the TV show \\"7th Heaven.\\"  I was expecting for Bella to have some sacrifices to go through but Meyer's wraps it up in a neat little sappy bow.  Her characters change so drastically that we don't see an ounce of what we loved from the three first books.  I was sorely disappointed and wish the series had ended with book three.

B0012GMV4O|5.0|This album changed my life the moment I heard it and the way I would think of music there after. I hadn't quite turned 13 yet when it was first released but it wound up being the soundtrack to my formidable years. Being shy and quite reserved, I lacked the personality to acquire the \\"state of cool\\" that every teenaged kid aspires to have. Like all the other kids my age I was beginning to question authority, the status quo in general, and what peer group (if any) I actually jibed with. Once I heard the way Leslie West screamed the words to the opening track Mississippi Queen I came out of my shell. West & company were NYC-bad-and-balls-to-the-wall rock-n-rollers with a no s*** approach that resonated down into my soul.    If you don't know, the bass player and producer of Mountain, the late Felix Pappalardi also manned the controls and played on Creams Disraeli Gears. Not content with being a mere superstar producer this guy wanted to put together a great band once he heard Leslie West play and sing with The Vagrants. He & West put out Wests first solo release \\"Leslie West Mountain\\" (Mountain being Wests nick name). It had a moderate success at which time there were personnel changes and powerhouse Corky Laing, drums and Steve Knight, keyboard were added and so Mountain were born and their second release Mountain Climbing went underway.    The album starts out with the timeless hard rocker song Mississippi Queen and that sets the pace for the rest of the disc. The second song, Theme For An Imaginary Western is a slower number passionately sung by Pappalardi and penned by Jack Bruce, but trust me, Mountains version is the definitive version of this song. It starts out with just drums and then Steve Knights organ jumps in in a way that can only be described as majestic to dominate most of the track. West kicks in during the instrumental and picks, twists & bends a breath taking solo. The crunch on Never In My Life hits hard & heavy like a swift kick to the balls and its no surprise it is still a staple in Wests set list to this day. For Yasgur's Farm is both light & heavy and is a salute to the Woodstock generation with emotive vocals by Pappalardi & West respectively. To My Friend is an instrumental with an Eastern tinge and eloquence that shows why Leslie West is still one of the best consumate guitar players in Rock today. Knight's chunky chords shine all over this album and Pappalardi and Laing are one of the most under rated rhythm sections in rock and this album alone should have put everyone in this band in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.     All in all this album should be a staple in everyones hard rock collection and was recorded  loud and is indicated by the band \\"Made To Be Played Loud\\" on the back cover for maximum effect. Crank it and get your hair blown back by one of the best bands to come out of the Big Apple. R.I.P. Felix.
B00138KCC4|5.0|The reason I say \\"second\\" greatest is because my other favorite is DISTURBED. Despite that, these guys are awesome! Everything, from Zack de la Rocha's hardcore political lyrics to the great innovative guitarring from Tom Morello, their first album is by far their best. I can't think of anything bad about them. Heres is my top five favs starting with my fav.  1.Wake up  2.Killing in the name  3.know your enemy  4.Bombtrack  5.Bullet in the head  This album is what got me into these guys in the first place, now i'm just hoping they will get back together and make another awesome album.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I thought Felicity Huffman did an incredible job as Bree! Bree was my favorite character because you get to know her story and feel sorry for her/him. Bree is a beautiful transsexual who is having surgery next week to get her penis removed, until she finds out that she had a son 17 years ago named Toby. Bree's therapist makes her go and see him. He is a hustler, and bisexual prostitute. Bree wants to take Toby back to his step-dad, but the step-dad did something bad to him a few years back. So, Bree decides to let him stay with her until they get to L.A. Bree eventually takes Toby to her parents' house, and see how they deal with his change, and Toby comes to realize who Bree really is. I highly recommend TRANSAMERICA!!!
B001DDBCUA|4.0|A good entertaining movie but could do without the explicit sex scenes. Somethings should be left to the imagination.
B00004XPPK|5.0|and how! Even steamy Gilda can't snuff the smoldering flame shared by Johnnie and Ballin.<br /><br />So here's the gist: Johnnie (Glenn Ford) is a ne'er do well rolling around in Argentina when he rolls into Ballin's (George Macready) arms. I mean, hands. Johnnie becomes Ballin's right hand man, managing his casino and running his errands. One night, one of his errands becomes babysitting the Lovely Rita, I mean, Gilda. Turns out, he knew Gilda from before and I mean KNEW her from before! Something nuclear must have happened because on the rebound he went for Ballin and man alive he doesn't like Gilda. I hate every bone in your body but mine, he emotes. Things go terribly wrong all over. Turns out Ballin is somehow wrapped up with some Nazis and some tungsten and he hasn't told Johnnie. Gilda sings and taunts and smokes cigarettes. Johnnie does a lot of frustrated smoking as well. Gilda and Johnnie end up thrown together and Johnnie lets his sadomasochistic self loose on the hapless girl. It's all OK in the end, but only when Johnnie's True Love, Ballin, is completely removed from the picture.<br />The homoerotic tension in this movie is unbelievable. I was completely surprised by it. Rita Hayworth is almost a caricature of female lustiness but she is but a little candle compared to the blast furnace of the Johnnie/Ballin romance. As an example, when Johnnie and Gilda are discovered together by Ballin, who chases after the distraught Ballin? His wife? No! It's Johnnie running after him, begging for another chance.<br />I loved it. Five stars.

I mention it because iI go there every year. This book hits home in more ways than one.     I've already recommended this book to quite a few people who are also interested in home brewing.    He hit the nose on the head with this book. To him and to all involved I say thank you.     You all will be the base for a life of good times enjoying homebrew.

B000056HE9|5.0|It seems like just about everyone in America is familiar with Frank Capra's classic holiday movie \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\".  As far as I know it is the only black and white movie still shown on network television.  But there other superb \\"holiday\\" movies.  One that you may not be familiar with is Samuel Goldwyn's 1947 production of  \\"The  Bishop's Wife\\" starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven.<br /><br />Cary Grant plays an angel named Dudley in this film (Dudley?) who all of a sudden appears  in response to the prayers of a newly installed bishop (David Niven) who is at his wit's end trying to raise funds for a new cathedral.  Being chairperson of my church's Capital Campaign I can totally relate to what the bishop was going through.  Anyway,  his fund-raising campaign is not going so well and is consuming practically all of his time.  He is desperate with worry and his responsibilities as bishop are beginning to take their toll on his relationship with his wife Julia(Loretta Young) and his young daughter.  With the Christmas holidays approaching Dudley appears to help the bishop sort it all out.  What neither Dudley nor the bishop could have ever anticipated was that Dudley would suddenly become smitten with the lovely and vivacious Julia. This simply had never happened to him before!  Needless to day the budding relationship between angel and wife wreaks all sorts of havoc.  But as was so often the case in these old classic flicks everything turns out OK in the end.<br /><br />\\"The Bishop's Wife\\"  is yet another movie from this period that my wife and I can enjoy again and again.  \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" was nominated for five Academy Awards in 1947 and would be remade in 1996 as \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston.  Very highly recommended!
B00005JKGK|5.0|I never purchase a movie unless I know I (or my kids) will watch it many times. I love the separate story lines and how they tie together, and I get tearful at the same parts every single time. I've heard this movie called a \\"chick flick\\" but I think it is more about culture and family. I think many people can relate to some part of the story.  It's about some Chinese women and, through flashbacks, how they came together, and how their Chinese American daughters relate to their traditional parents and modern situations. It is about Asian families, but I'm African American and it really moved me.  My 14 year-old is the one who suggested we get the DVD because we had it on VHS years ago but it got lost.
051788710X|5.0|There are countless books on dreaming and I've looked hopefully at many of them. Usually I've been disappointed by the fact that they really have nothing to say and seem to know nothing more than I do about the subject. Mostly, they are rehashes of other people's psychological analysis of what dreams *might* mean. Since we each dream in our own unique symbolic language, such books are not only useless but misleading. This is NOT the case with Moss's books. A useful, accessible, and comprehensive method for learning about dreams and dreaming first hand is laid out step by step, along with ample examples of many different kinds of dreams, dreamers, and dreaming traditions, to help readers avoid the \\"one right answer\\" trap and find their own truth as reflected in their own unique dreams. Dream ethics (ethics, that long-neglected topic!) are also explored.<br /><br />When I was browsing this topic and reading the customer reviews on Moss, not a few of them gave me real pause, claiming he was a fraud who was only out to make a buck on his outrageously priced courses. Well, his courses are expensive, but then it's expensive to go to an ivy league college or study with real Druids too, because what they learn requires them to travel far and spend years of their lives in disciplined practice. The expectation that everything should be free because it comes free from the source is an interesting one. Nothing is free. There is always a price to pay, whether you are paying a person or a travel agency or an institution. If you want something real there is always a price.<br /><br />Moss has provided an easy way to determine if what he is \\"selling\\" is real. His books. And unlike most books by people who offer coursework, which hold back all the vital information, Moss puts it all out there. What he is offering is real, it works, and it's authentic in its claims to derive from native worldviews and practices. These books are called \\"New Age\\" only because mainstream society is afraid to validate anything *new* as authentically \\"native\\". But we are all native to this world. The same source informs us all, if we are open to it. These books ARE the real thing. Along with Caitlin Matthews' books on soul flight, they are outstanding resources for the novice and the experienced traveller. If you have a serious interest, I urge you to treat yourself to something real and affordable.

0896762173|5.0|I've read many books on historical costuming: construction, histories and such. This is by far, the most comprehensive book on the subject. The drawings are detailed and cover the outer look of a particular item, plus the construction, description of fabric and aspects of decoration. I come back to this book again and again to help me sew period-correct garments.<br /><br />Each item is covered on two pages.  The majority of the items are gowns, but there are coats, umbrellas, undergarments and shoes described in detail also. If a particular garment had a design in the weave, it was drawn out. Measurements of items are given.<br /><br />For those persons new to historical costuming, the terminology might give them trouble.  My advice is to look up those terms they might not understand. Using the book as sort of a starting point for a student, the book illustrates terms such as 'cartridge pleating'. Once a person has seen it, it is more easily understood.<br /><br />The book allows the reader a glimpse into some of the most beautiful works of wearable art that have survived. It is certainly worth it's price.
1932907009|1.0|-Read this book if you want to write scripts that don't get produced.  -If you think that movies like Legally Blonde and Miss Congeniality hold more artistic merit than a film like Memento, don't waste time. Buy this book!  -If you want to listen to an egotistical hack talk about the two movies that have been made from his (co-written) screenplays, read Save the Cat.     Blake Snyder pretends to have insight to the screenplay writing business, and maybe he does. What Snyder really cares about is getting paid. His book is formulaic and strips any artistry away from the act of writing. He refers to terms like \\"the hero\\" and \\"the bad guys\\" as if they are crucial to every plot.    For a person so \\"involved in the movie industry\\" you would think that he would know a few things about it.    For example: He constantly refers to the Tomb Raider series as Lara Croft and Lara Croft 2    He states that the middle point of Star Wars is when Luke Skywalker's parents get killed. Not to nitpick but even an average joe knows that it's his aunt and uncle that get killed.     If you want a book by a guy who spends over half of it tooting his own horn about his brilliance, sure buy this book. Actually if you want to do the movie going public a huge favor, buy as many copies as possible and burn them so no one ever has to suffer another \\"Stop, or My Mother Will Shoot\\"    In a nutshell this book will only serve to produce a high concept mishmash of a hackneyed screenplay.     This is absolutely not \\"the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need.\\" That title is reserved for Robert McKee's [[ASIN:0060391685 Story: Substance, Structure, Style and The Principles of Screenwriting]]    Snyder's book on the other hand is the last book you should ever read granted you're on a desert island and you've already got plenty of firewood.
B00005LOUP|1.0|I'm sorry to say that this movie was so silly we didn't watch more tha 20 minutes of it before we turned it off. Maybe it's one of those movies that only a school aged child can appreciate? We were very disappointed with it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Wow. To read and now watch the life of John Adams' adult life is to get a superlative glimpse into the founding of our nation. I think the series is a an appropriate length for the book and a great job taking David McCullough's work that is somewhat narrative and making it more so. Highly recommended. I hope HBO will do more series like this, maybe \\"1776\\"?
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This is a very good remake of the original movie. Like other Dr. Suess stories it teaches anyone watching it some good morals. It's entertaining for the whole family (even my husband enjoyed it). We bought it for our 18 month old grandson and he loves watching it time and again. Carol Burnett did a great job being a \\"bad guy\\" character, and of course Jim Carrey was wonderful as well. I give it 4 stars!

1439130833|3.0|As expected, a book on positive living would have mainly positive reviews. BUT, I have to say this...the book is supposed to fold back so it sits open on an angle, allowing you to review the material over and over as it sits on your desk. But it doesn't \\"sit\\" up at all, it just falls flat. And I can only guess it is designed to pull the pages off each day but as there are no dates, i would like to reuse mine. This has involved a complex set of rubber bands to hold back the previously viewed pages as well as to hold the bottoms of the hard cover together in an attempt to get it to sit up as it shows on the back cover. The material, yes, is great. I just wish more thought had gone into the design.

0743529030|5.0|I bought this book for my husband 14 years ago.  He's always said how much it helped him.  This Christmas I decided to buy the audio version for all the young adults on my Christmas list.  I've already received \\"thank yous\\" from two of the four who received it.  This is a subject that should be introduced to our young people in middle school or freshman year in high school.
B001DDBCUU|2.0|I never watched the show before because I just couldn't get into it. Maybe I'm too young or it just wasn't my cup of tea. Well after everyone kept telling me it was such a fantastic movie (I should have seen the signs since this was coming from single 30 somethings), I finally caved and bought the movie on black Friday. Most of the film is about clothes, clothes, and more clothes. Seeing Carie in her underwear was disturbing since she looks anorexic. The sex scene with the full frontal nudity was definitely not expected. I know its called \\"sex and the city\\" but I wasn't aware this was amateur porn. A rating of NC-17 would have been more appropriate. I want my $[...] back.
B000NQRR1Q|1.0|Okay - I hardly ever bother with a bad review.  Since I'm an amateur reviewer I'm not required to see every film, read every book and since time is at a premium I try not to see bad films, read bad books, etc.  But I wasted more than two hours on this insultingly bad movie, and I wish I had my time back.<br /><br />I was watching one of the movie channels.  This film, which I previously knew nothing about, started.  The credits rolled.  Directed by Roman Polanski... good, good - the guy who directed \\"Chinatown\\".  There's Johnny Depp - great, I like Johnny Depp and all the women at my house aren't going to complain about watching a Johnny Depp movie.  There's Frank Langella - good, I liked him ever since his version of Dracula with Olivier.<br /><br />The movie started off okay, drawing me in with an intriguing story and these compelling actors.  Depp plays Dean Corso, a rare book dealer.  Langella plays Boris Balkan, a rich book collector who wants Corso to track down a rare satanic book. By thirty minutes into the movie I was hooked.<br /><br />Thirty minutes later I thought \\"well, THIS is sure getting boring.\\"  Thirty minutes after that I thought \\"this is really getting bad and stupid.\\"  Thirty minutes after THAT I thought \\"this ending is really shaping up to be bad, but I've invested over an hour and a half in this movie and it is bad almost in a train-wreck kind of way.<br /><br />Then it got REALLY bad.  At the end I sat in the room feeling \\"I've been HAD!  My time has been STOLEN from me.  I can't believe I sat and watched that.  I can't believe THOSE actors and THAT director could have made something so bad.<br /><br />I felt so burned I looked up other reviews.  Roger Ebert wrote that it \\"opens with a spectacularly good title sequence and goes downhill from there--but slowly, so that all through the first hour there is reason for hope, and only gradually do we realize the movie isn't going to pay off.\\"  Berardinelli of Reelviews was less kind: \\"The Ninth Gate has two modes: tedious and moronic, with the two not being mutually exclusive. Then, one-hundred minutes into this seemingly interminable movie (which clocks in at about 2:10), things take a turn for the worse and The Ninth Gate spirals out of control. A jaw-droppingly bad mixture of film noir and the occult, this picture plods and meanders its way through one uninspired scene after another until it reaches an improbable, laughable climax followed by an equally ridiculous denouement.

B001F12J48|4.0|Yah, 3-D technology hasn't advanced as much as you would think for the 21st century, but this movie was a lot of fun, nonetheless.  Our family of five -- two grandkids, 9 & 7, adult son and wife, and me -- watched it with enthusiasm.  The 7 year old had trouble with the visuals and removed his glasses; I think it was too real for him and little scary.  I will watch it again and again, each time in 3-D.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|Director Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole, who with Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen, aptly filling the partner role that evokes Sam Elliott in [[ASIN:6304711905 Tombstone]]), signs on to protect Appaloosa from requisite bad guy, Randall Bragg. Jeremy Irons tempers himself as Bragg, a murderous power broker who dabbles in ranching, mining, hotels and other ventures.<br /><br />Naturally, the movie draws comparisons to [[ASIN:B0018PH3L0 Lonesome Dove]] but that reflects the ease and comfort of the Harris-Mortensen partnership. The movie is closer to [[ASIN:B000GIW9I2 The Proposition]] or [[ASIN:B0006FO5LO Deadwood]] than [[ASIN:B000XR9L50 3:10 to Yuma]].<br /><br />Clocking in at 115 minutes, Appaloosa could benefit by restoring several deleted scenes (Harris has said he intends this if a director's cut is released) without the risk of exceeding the run time of [[ASIN:B0010DR4BO The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]] (160 minutes). Both westerns are essentially character studies peppered with flashes of action but the latter film benefitted from Roger Deakins' luscious cinematography. To be fair, Appaloosa cinematographer Dean Semler, working on a tighter budget and film, creates a dusty, gritty landscape that matches the story's throwback style.<br /><br />To its advantage, Appaloosa has moments of humor that sets it apart from other contemporary Westerns. The story is based on Robert B. Parker's novel of the same name. Parker is best known for his Spenser books that later became the TV series [[ASIN:B0009NSDW0 Spenser: For Hire]]. The witty banter between Harris and Mortensen is toned down compared with Spenser but you get the sense Robert Urich and Avery Brooks shared similar dialogue.<br /><br />Another plus is the depth of quality character actors - James Gammon, Timothy Spall, Lance Henriksen and Tom Bower to name a few. Although, there's one casting flaw that nearly derails the entire film: Renee Zellweger as Allison French. I might dwell on Zellweger's lack of chemistry with Harris or her come-and-go southern accent but neither flaw distracts as much as her face.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to Zellweger, voted by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 2001. She appears here with angry eyebrows rising at 45 angles from the bridge of her nose, her eyes are squinty and dull, squeezed together by blotchy cheeks and a cr&egrave;me-filled forehead that rivals Nicole Kidman's Botox brow. About 10 minutes into the movie I realized where I'd seen that face before -- [[ASIN:B000E5LEXS Jeff Dunham's puppet, Walter]].<br /><br />In summary, Appaloosa isn't a classic like [[ASIN:B00006FDCJ Unforgiven]] but it is solid, a throwback genre fans should enjoy.Harris or her come-and-go southern accent but neither flaw distracts as much as her face.

031606792X|4.0|After reading several of the reviews (and being quite impressed with the eloquence of those reviews), I've decided to weigh-in on this book, simply because I think the; \\"Turn back after Twilight\\" warnings are unfair and mostly unwarranted.<br /><br />I came to the \\"Twilight\\" game late, like many, and ATE through all 4 books (including the unpublished work on her website) within a week.  (That's means I read them avidly & was constantly hungry for more).<br /><br />The irony of this insatiable appetite was how I actually had to LABOR through the first 200-400 pages of books 2 (New Moon) and 3 (Eclipse).  I thoroughly enjoyed Twilight- and immediately got a copy of New Moon.  But trudging through the expository chapters of the book quickly turned into boredom.  ...Until finally I had to look at the page number-- wondering when the story would START ALREADY!!!  And then it would turn.  You know-- that chair gripping adventurous ride that Twilight took you on at the end.  That great ride appeared at the end of books 2 & 3 again, so I was eager to sink my teeth into \\"Breaking Dawn\\" ...albeit wary of another few hundred pages of drolldom at the beginning.<br /><br />That didn't happen for me in book 4.  Right from the beginning, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" gave me what I wanted... what I needed.  The story picked-up right where Book 3 left off and actually progressed right away.  And it kept up!  I had set certain expectations reading this series and \\"Breaking Dawn\\" exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I'm not saying \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is great literature... but I'm pleased with where it left the story.  It was easily as entertaining & satisfying as \\"Twilight\\" and I felt developed the characters more completely.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I watched this on Oxygen, and it is delightfully done and thought provoking.  The tired-of-her-modern-world protagonist yearns for the world of Jane Austen, when she inadvertently goes through a portal in her bathroom to find herself not only back in time, but in the imaginary world of Pride and Prejudice.  This is a wonderful addition to anyone hungry for more Austenmania.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|You don't have to be a Joss Whedon fanatic to relish this labor of love. The first of its kind on-line musical is a testament to the magic that can happen when brilliant minds throw off the studio shackles. Neil Patrick Harris plays an endearing wanna-be villain, Dr. Horrible, who blogs about his attempts to be accepted into the Evil League of Evil, and his hopeless crush on the local do-gooder, played by Felicia Day. Both campaigns are consistently thwarted by smarmy super-hero Captain Hammer, (Nathan Fillion)raising universal questions about the nature of good, evil, and public relations. The dialogue is biting (hey, it's Joss Whedon!) and the songs are complex and well-executed. We all knew Neil Patrick Harris had the chops, but Nathan Fillion surprised us with his ability to belt out a show-tune. The disc also includes a singing commentary by the cast, which is clever but more of an inside joke than a real commentary. And while I love this show beyond description, it isn't something I'm comfortable letting my kids watch.
B000007WK4|4.0|Here we have yet another Chris Rea album that stands the test of time and is a joy to listen to start to finish.<br />After all these years, this is another release that gets pulled once a month and that I never tire of.<br />I find something new every time I listen to this release.<br /><br />All the typical Chris Rea trademarks are found throughout the album.<br />The album starts off with the punchy, guitar driven \\"Square Peg, Round Hole\\"<br />It must be stated that the bass of Mr. Silvan Marc really pulsates and propels many of these tracks.<br />\\"Where do we go from here?\\" is a standout and deserves to be mentioned first and foremost.<br />Rea's unmistakable slide guitar compliments and nourishes Marc's robust bass playing.<br />I can't stop myself from becoming immersed in the aural ride found on this release.<br /><br />At times introspective, at times optimistic, at times determined, and at times forceful, I would highly recommend \\"The Blue Caf&eacute;\\" to the casual Rea listener.<br />If you have some of Chris Rea's work from the 70's, 80's, and 90's and are unsure about this album, take the chance. You will not regret it!<br />Standout tracks? Hmmm Where to start!?<br />I truly miss albums that were strong from point A to B such as this release.<br />There is so much to enjoy and become engrossed in.<br /> \\"Square Peg, Round Hole\\", \\"Miss Your Kiss\\", \\"Shadows of the Big Man\\", \\"Where Do We Go from Here\\",<br />\\"Since I Found You\\", \\"Thinking of you\\", \\"As long as I have your love\\", \\"Sweet summer day\\", \\"Stick by you\\", and \\"The Blue Cafe\\" get better and better through the years.<br /><br />The intro to \\"Sweet summer day\\" almost recalls a \\"Police\\" vibe. Take another listen and you'll feel like Andy Summers, Sting, and Stewart have invaded the proceedings. : )<br /><br />For an artist that has been releasing material since the late 70's, Chris continues to release thoughtful and enlightening music.<br />I highly recommend you pick up this release.<br />It's been a musical feast for my ears. Let it become that for you too!
B0016PM722|4.0|My husband is a huge Star Wars fan, and has wanted a light saber of high quality \\"as close to a real lightsaber as you can get\\" for some time.  I bought this for him and he is very pleased. This is a great collector's piece.  The power up and power down visual and audio effects are awesome.  The other audio effects are inconsistent, but still really cool.  You have to swing it just right to get it to make the sound.  It's supposed to make a sound when it contacts something as well, but we haven't tried too hard to get that one - we don't want to break it.  The blade is plastic and fairly durable, but not meant for real play. It is NOT a toy for kids.  We have it mounted on our wall.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|If this movie wasn't so dumb, it would have been quite entertaining. The action scenes are so improbable it insults the intelligence of the viewer. The so-called dramatic scenes are laughable. The plot of the movie is a unique twist on the original novel by Verne, but misses the mark entirely by hiding a classic story behind bad acting and special effects. Hollywood ought to realize that moviegoers are more intelligent nowadays. We know that this sort of scenario is virtually impossible, but at least try to explain a more intelligent answer to how it could be done. (We know that a free fall thousand of feet down does not lead to a nice gentle landing on a waterslide much less an ability to have a nice calm conversation on the way down!) At least then it would provide some entertainment value instead of a the huge letdown that this movie is.
0316067601|1.0|As like-minded reviewers before me, the intent of this review is NOT to disparage the military or the gratefulness we should feel towards their ultimate sacrifices.  The review is of the book itself, which is HORRIBLY written, is way too longwinded, and I find myself not really thinking this version is entirely credible.  I truly believe all the good reviews of this book are from people who are confusing the message with the tale telling.  I am skimming the last one hundred pages.  It is  a shame because this story could be so much more compelling with an quality impartial novelist.  Blah!  I wouldn't recommend this book.

At first I'll admit I though it was weird... but after really listening to it, what he is saying I enjoy it very much..

0743486285|5.0|I think this book was great!! Usually I would not get into a book that revolves around so much drug use/drug talk but I think Nikki did a great job here.<br /><br />I think the book gives in great detail how painful and horribe addiction can be. Drug addicts along with all other addicts allow themselves to became one with their drug of choice, whether it be drugs, alchol, sex, etc. I personally have never felt bad for a drug addict because I always felt that they were the ones that allowed themselves to depend on the addiction that was in my opinion killing them. This book helped me understand that the drug whatever it may be actually take the person over, as if they have no abilities at all to stop or to help themselves in any way. I feel bad now with how harsh my opinions were in the past on this matter, and I have this book to thank for helping me realize that addiction is hard, painful and deadly.<br /><br />I really like that throughout the whole book all the surrounding people commented on everything that was going on. Whether it be a people that were doing the drugs with Nikki at the time or someone who was trying to stop him from doing the drugs. I think the comments helped the reader see the good, the bad, and the really ugly. The only part that I didn't like was the later comments from Denise Matthews \\"Vanity\\". I am glad for her that she became all holy and what not but damn was she annoying throughout the whole book!<br /><br />If you like Niiki Sixx, Motley Crue or music period you should read this book!!

Young, pretty girl finds herself way over her head in a situation she knows nothing about. Things will get much worse before they get better, and a happy ending is guaranteed. Whether it's obsessive shopping, pretending to be a housekeeper, or spilling secrets to a stranger on a plane, who turns out to be her new boss, these books all follow the same path. Here, main character Lexi, wakes up in the hospital after being knocked unconcious for a few days. Her last memory takes place in 2004, but it is now 2007 in the book. She finds her life is completely changed and has to figure out how she did it, and how to deal with it. Hilarity ensues. Already waiting with baited breath for the next one.

0439023483|5.0|I confess I wasn't wild about the prospect of reading \\"The Hunger Games\\", a novel where the central trope is an \\"ultimate sport\\" type 'arena of death on television'.  This concept didn't sound very original to me.  Suzanne Collins transcends the limitations of the genre by creating a fierce and believable 16 year old heroine in the person of Katniss Everdeen and situating her in a well realized world of subjugation and deprivation that feels very (extremely) in touch with real world relevant issues.  Then she attacks the narrative arc she sets up with terrific verve and pacing.  This is a compulsive page turner.  I read this entire novel in 4 sittings over a 2 day period (and only because I was extremely busy).  It was one of those books you hate to put down and eagerly plan when you can next pick up.<br /><br />Collins' narrative brims with implied relevant social commentary.  There is political and economic subjugation leading to rebellious feelings in the countryside.  There is rampant economic inequality between rich and poor.  There is the moral abomination of putting real suffering on television as \\"reality TV\\" entertainment.  There is coming of age romantic content.  Somehow, Collins doesn't let any of this overshadow either the character content or the narrative action, which always seems to take center stage.  And it's not just the arena action of the blood sport either (although that stuff is awesome - and fills the climax of the book).  Collins has a deft ability to imbue the establishing shots with real tension.  Each scene fits into the plotting tautly - there is hardly a wasted sentence anywhere.  The pace is headlong, relentless, and gripping, while alternating from emotional turmoil to danger to romance and back.  In the aspects of a teenage heroine with tremendous abilities but real vulnerability this book reminded be of \\"Sabriel\\" (high praise in my book); but placed in a sci-fi future world that resembles Victorian England far more than Sabriel's magical realist locale.<br /><br />By the end, Collins makes it clear that this will be a series.  Initially that annoyed me too.  She was so very close to wrapping up all the loose ends in the narrative...  Then I realized that she intends to take on the larger issues of the larger world she has created.  I can't wait.<br /><br />While the violence and romance are handled lightly, there is still plenty of both.  Given that and the oppressive poverty, starvation, and anger of the setting - the general trauma - I'd be reluctant to give to this to any kid who isn't pretty mature.  I'd say 14 and up.  For them - and adults - this book is highly recommended.ealist locale.    By the end, Collins makes it clear that this will be a series.  Initially that annoyed me too.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|Firstly, The Mist was my favorite short story by Stephen King, really more of a novella, this story reads from the outside like a standard creature horror movie  ie. killer monsters, bloody carnage, etc.    Really this is a movie about humanity and just how easily lunacy and paranoia become the watchwords when insane things happen to strip away the facade of humanity.    The end of the story was always something ambiguous that I was very interested to see how it would be adapted for the movie and I will say that for me it was disturbing and left me with my mouth hanging open in shock.    Many will not like the end, too many want everything to be sewn up nice and neat at the end of a movie and that just isn't how things happen but I was quite pleased in how things turned out, truly horrific to end a great suspenseful movie.    The acting is all top notch and the movie flows very well, if you are a Stephen King fan then you will absolutely love this movie.
0525951113|5.0|I've been waiting for a while to pick up this book after hearing a talk about narrow AI by the author, and I wasn't disappointed.  There were a few rough patches here and there, but I enjoyed myself from the beginning to the end.  A great first novel, and I'm looking forward to the next one already, whenever it may be.    Suarez really knows his technology, which made this a great novel for me.  I'm not sure, however, if a non-technical person would get as much out of it.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Brokeback Mountain   Main Cast: Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway    A raw, powerful story of two young men, Ennis a ranch hand and Jack an aspiring rodeo bull rider, are sent to work together herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain, and what had otherwise been anticipated to be a rather uneventful venture, will soon turn into an affair of love, of lust, and complications that will spand through 19 years of their lives. Through marriage, through children, and through the mighty grip of societal confines and the expectations of what it is to be a man.     First, this movie begins in 1963 and during that time, to be gay was absolutely against society rules. Also, if you're hoping that this movie will change your beliefs against people being gay. The movie can't, you must keep an open mind, you have to decide for yourself if you enjoy this or not.
0810970686|5.0|I ordered this book for my Son in November of 2008, and it just arrived yesterday. He was so thrilled, he has read half of it already! He is hoping it is not indeed the \\"last straw\\" though! More please?<br />These books are wonderful. He really enjoys everyone. And re-reads them over and over! the do-it-yourself book is full. ha.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|Too many swear words and sex scenes to be PG-13.  I didn't finish the movie.
B000H7PB4G|5.0|I knew we wanted a Peugeuot pepper mill and this particular mill fit the bill perfectly.  It fits in the hand well and is easy to use.  It doesn't take up too much space and is pretty quiet.  It's a great buy and a great price!  I am very pleased!
B001F7MSFM|3.0|\\"When I became a man, I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\\" ~C.S. Lewis<br /><br />Though he may not share Lewis' faith, there's no one in Hollywood who embodies this quote more than director Guillermo del Toro. His films are fantastical fairy tales for adults, steeped in the tropes of loss, sacrifice, death, monsters (human and imaginary), and love.<br /><br />I'm an unabashed fan of the (admittedly flawed) original film, about a baby demon brought over from The Other Side to fight for the Nazis during World War II. He's instead rescued by American forces, adopted by a professor of paranormal studies (John Hurt), and given the name Hellboy. All grown up, he's part of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.), tasked with fighting otherworldly baddies--and keeping as low a profile as possible while doing it.<br /><br />This sequel opens on a Christmas Eve in the '50s, with Hellboy's adopted father reading the 10-year-old an unconventional bedtime story. It seems years ago there was a great war between humans and faery creatures (elves, trolls, goblins, and so on). The elf king had a Golden Army created--hundreds of automatons that were unbeatable and unstoppable. But the king regretted the bloodshed, so a truce was agreed upon, with humans taking the cities, and the faery-folk taking the forests, with the understanding that neither will encroach on the other.<br /><br />Now it's the present day, and Nuada, the prince of the elves (they're long-lived folk) has decided that humans should be destroyed and the magical creatures should take back what is rightfully theirs. He's trying to assemble the three parts of his father's crown, which will allow him to awaken and command the Golden Army. But his twin sister Nuala, who doesn't agree with her brother's plan, has fled with one of the pieces of the crown.<br /><br />Enter the B.R.P.D., comprised of Hellboy (Ron Perlman), his inflammatory--literally--girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair), and the fish-man empath Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). They're joined by Johann Krauss, a by-the-book, ghostly new commander voiced by Seth Macfarlane. They're trying to find and protect Princess Nuala, and keep Nuada from awakening that horrible Golden Army.<br /><br />Hellboy and the gang first encounter Nuala in the Troll Market, an updated Mos Eisley Cantina filled with amazing creatures--I can't wait for the DVD just so I can explore those scenes some more. One of the things I like best about del Toro is his willingness to use real actors in real costumes, rather than relying on CGI so heavily. This is never more evident than when the Angel of Death makes an appearance later in the film (also played by the amazing Doug Jones). It's genuinely creepy, and more so because we know it's not a computer effect.<br /><br />One scene that definitely does use CGI is the fight with the enormous forest god. It's an interesting struggle, as Hellboy feels he may have more in common with this creature than he does with the humans he's trying to save. Also, whatever the creature touches--whether with its appendages or with its \\"blood\\"--blooms into colorful life. You find yourself feeling slightly sorry for this creature that creates beauty every time it touches something.<br /><br />But the film's not all about fights and monsters. There are plenty of laughs--more than in the original. The fight between Hellboy and Johann Krauss was entirely unique, and a fine bit of physical humor. And the scene where Hellboy and Abe bond as they reflect on their love lives is very well done and funny. I wish there were more scenes like this, where we're given insights into these fascinating characters.<br /><br />One of the most interesting scenes of the original is where Hellboy is tempted to take back his rightful place in hell, and embrace his demon-ness. He's able to overcome this temptation when he holds fast to his adopted father's Catholic faith--and he grasps his father's rosary, which burns an impression of the cross on Hellboy's hand. But aside from a few images of a cross and a rosary, this sequel doesn't have any of the Christian themes of its predecessor. Apparently overcoming temptation once in the original film has eliminated it altogether, as his love life is the biggest problem he seems to face now. My biggest complaint of the film is that there's nothing uniquely Hellboy-ish about it. You could almost have inserted any superhero into the plot and it would have made just as much sense.<br /><br />I'm not sure it's a minor quibble, but it's certainly a forgivable one. I enjoyed Hellboy II -- probably more than the original, all told. But where this movie drops the more interesting questions in favor of more action, take the Hellboy by the horns and work through some of them with your teenagers.lboy's hand.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I think it is a great movie for adults but I find it a little to dark for kids under 17.  A lot of images were very scary and especially on this DVD. The movie is great for anyone over 17. I enjoyed the movie immensely
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|When writer/director Christopher Nolan resurrected the hoary Batman franchise with his amazing Batman Begins, one wondered if he could maintain the high level of excellence. It turns out he was just warming up.<br /><br />As so often happens with the \\"middle movie\\" of a series, this sequel feels darker, denser, and just flat-out better than the great movie it's based upon (see The Empire Strikes Back or The Two Towers for examples). Christian Bale is his solid self in the title role. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are back and wonderful--though in smaller roles. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes in the role of Batman's love interest, adding a more believable feistiness. Aaron Eckhart is excellent as the town's optimistic new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Gary Oldman is back as James Gordon, and the filmmakers have wisely expanded his role and relationship with Batman--he's the sympathetic and human anchor holding these films together.<br /><br />And then there's Joker. It's fair to ask whether the praise surrounding Heath Ledger's performance is being boosted by his sudden death, and of course there's no way to know. But believe me: Ledger's Joker is the villain by which all others will be judged. There's nothing funny about this Joker, but there is something hypnotic about him. It's an astounding performance.<br /><br />Batman and Gordon have been working closely together, and have taken down a huge part of the crime syndicate in Gotham--but that's left a power vacuum. Enter Joker, who at first seems intent on making a load of cash, but later seems to merely want to create chaos. He believes there's darkness in everyone, and that people are this close to becoming just like him. So he revels in creating situations that force people to make the decision whether to cross that line.<br /><br />District attorney Dent is intent on keeping the city together--the white knight to Batman's dark one. He truly believes he can keep the baddies at bay through good people making right choices. But once the Joker turns his twisted gaze on Dent, his idyllic world is shattered, and he's forced to make the Joker's Decision himself, and anyone familiar with the Batman mythos knows how that ultimately ends up.<br /><br />The film's exploration of heroes, and their flaws, is compelling. Batman chooses to bend and break rules to achieve his ends, and we're left wondering if he's making the right decision, despite the outcome. There's light in the darkness, make no mistake. Characters sacrifice themselves, and find a sort of redemption. And despite Joker's belief, people's humanity wins the day. You find yourself cheering as they make the right decision, while feeling that you would have understood completely had they made the wrong one. Nolan walks a knife's edge with these big questions, and the ride is exhilarating.<br /><br />I wouldn't advise taking the youth group to this film--or at least leave the junior highers at home. While practically bloodless, there's violence aplenty here, and scenes of intensity and menace that had me cringing. That said, you'll have no problem finding things to discuss from this movie.<br /><br />Nolan has made the best superhero movie ever, and I can't wait to see what he does with the third film in the franchise.e the Joker turns his twisted gaze on Dent, his idyllic world is shattered, and he's forced to make the Joker's Decision himself, and anyone familiar with the Batman mythos knows how that ultimately ends up.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Two of my favorite things are Pixar movies and science fiction, so when you cram the two of them together into one film, I'm inclined to like it. I didn't; I loved it.<br /><br />Writer/director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) has continued Pixar's recent trend of making riskier, deeper, more meaningful films that kids love, but adults love even more (we should all have a passion as deep as that rat's passion for food). It's a fine line to walk, but they've perfected the art.<br /><br />The film opens with a flyover of a landscape of huge skyscrapers, but a closer examination reveals they're skyscrapers made of trash, thanks to the last inhabitant of Earth: WALL*E. He's a robot, built to take trash, smash it into a bundle, and build skyscrapers out of it. WALL*E may be the best character Pixar's ever created.<br /><br />WALL*E spends his days building skyscrapers, but also collecting bits of detritus and taking it back to his humble abode, to be played with and marveled at later. His prized possession is a tape of the musical Hello Dolly!,which he watches every night, pining for someone to hold hands with. These moments are touching and poignant--quite a feat for a robot. You can use these moments to discuss loneliness with your teenagers.<br /><br />His world is turned upside-down by the arrival of another robot--EVE--who's been sent on a mission for...well, we're not sure for a while, and I won't spoil it. She's sleek, modern, potentially deadly, and can fly-- the opposite of WALL*E in every way. So of course he falls in love with her! And what a love story it is. WALL*E gives up everything to follow the robot he loves, acting selflessly.<br /><br />Once he makes it into space, he meets humanity, but a different humanity than we're used to. These people are obese automatons, more interested in watching an electronic device in front of their faces than interacting with other people. Wait, maybe it's not that different...<br /><br />There's been much made about the film being a subversive political statement about environmentalism, capitalism, and many other -isms. I think that's merely a product of this being an election year, and modern media and the Internet's ability to create conspiracies where there aren't any. Is there a message about taking care of the planet? Yes. Is there a message about consumption run amok? Yes. Is there a message about the dangers of excess? Yes. That's not political; that's biblical. Besides, we mustn't be distracted from the movie's real message: hope and love.<br /><br />It's an amazing film, one I'll be watching for years. It's excellent science fiction filled with excellent characters, told excellently.<br /><br />BTW: Presto, the short Pixar piece shown before WALL*E is one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen. Use the bathroom before you see it or you might just go while you see it.environmentalism, capitalism, and many other -isms.

0060989157|5.0|Just a great book to read. The antics of the band are very extreeme and I enjoyed how it goes through each stage in their career with insights from each member on that time period. I read this in two nights only because I had to work in the morning. If I had started it on a weekend I'd of read it in one sitting. It is that compelling.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|CUTE, CUTE, CUTE!  WHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE THE FIRST TIME I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD LIKE IT SINCE IT'S A CARTOON, BUT TO MY AMAZMENT I ENJOYED IT COMPLETELY!  GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS ALIKE.
0393327345|5.0|I usually tend to expect alot more from the book than the movie as any other reader will be glad to help you with, but when I began to read this book I was certain to be wrong this time since the movie was almost perfect.  Surprisingly the book showed to be a much better experience than the movie and I am absolutely satisfied with this read
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Great song writing plus great musical ability equals a great album.  I have never believed an album deserved 5 stars in all of my 27 years of listening and studying music until now.  Myles Kennedy is absolutely a phenomenal singer, and Mark Tremonti has reached a definite pinnacle in his guitar work.  The drums and bass line hang tight as well and give this album a great rhythym section.  I have continued to go back to this album again and again so it stands the ultimate test; the test of time.  This is truly what music is all about.  Talented songwriters and equally skillful playing equate to a rare piece called Blackbird.
0812932293|4.0|This book gives insight into Mr Branson life - from his school days, dating life, married life ,crazy balloon adventures and how Mr Branson managed to build business portfolio and create a Virgin as brand name.  Overall fun to read, keeps reader interested - this is definitely not a how-to for business or entrepreneurship.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|I must admit when I first heard this album I was completely turned off, but after listening again this reversed. This collection has definitely impressed me as being superior to the first two albums . The artist is maturing and creatively expanding her repertoire of experiences of life. Cant wait for next revelation.

B0015OKWL2|3.0|I'm not a fan of Pacino.  I did like him in this movie.  The plot has a good suspenseful twist.  The acting was pretty good.  This is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was entertaining and worth watching.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a classic game packed full of fun.  This set has nice wooden settlements and roads, but the game tiles are just a cheap cardboard.  It works fine, but setup can be a little tricky.  The strategy involved with this game would make it playable for anyone 10 and up.  Overall, I enjoyed playing it.
1400063515|2.0|I can save you the price of this book-- and the time it would take you to read it-- by summarizing its main point:  Hard-to-predict events are hard to predict, and because they're hard to predict, we often fool ourselves into thinking that we can predict them.  But we can't.<br /><br />Seriously, that's pretty much it.  I was very disappointed by this book, mostly because the reviews were so good, and the author is both a serious academic and a Wall Street star.<br /><br />After spending hundreds of pages explaining that we can't predict rare events very well, mostly because they're rare, the author slides into what I assume he believes is proof that essentially, everything that happens comes down to luck.  Why did Rome fall?  Blind luck.  Why did Microsoft defeat Apple in the marketplace?  Blind luck.  And so on.<br /><br />Of course, over the years, we've developed explanations for those events and most other things that have happened.  The author airily dismisses all such attempts to explain historical events after the fact as \\"narrative fallacies.\\"  Well, no, not always; sometimes those explanations are actually explanations of what clearly happened.<br /><br />The author even offers what he claims is the sole practical way to deal with the Black Swans we encounter in the operations of the financial sector:  We should invest at least 85% of our assets in risk-free T-bills and the remainder in very high-risk investments, such as junk bonds.  This idea is an old one, and computer simulations consistently show that it will return less than the 60% stocks and 40% bonds allocation that most financial planners have advocated for many years.<br /><br />Finally, I didn't care for the tone of the book.  It comes off as smug and almost cutsie at times.  This is a serious subject, and it deserves a serious treatment.  Of course, this is my personal, subjective reaction; others may not be as bothered by the tone as I was.<br /><br />In summary, I found this book to be uneven and disappointing.  Why not one star?  Because the chapters that deal with how we let the bell curve seduce us into erroneous thinking are actually quite good.  If only the rest of the book had been so good...the chapters that deal with how we let the bell curve seduce us into erroneous thinking are actually quite good.

0679720200|3.0|The Stranger by Albert Camus was an interesting read and very thought provoking. It didn't leave me in a particularly good mood after reading it because of the nature of the novel and its subject matter. I sympathized with the main character. It's a wild ride of absurdity and enjoyable if you're in the mood for a philsophizing and thinking.
B0013XW2F4|4.0|This is a Kindle-specific review by AGB.    Value for money: an excellent discount set (but with a few faults) of one of the classics of literature: the 4 long novels and the 5 volumes of short stories.    Presentation and Format: clean and attractive, with the text set fully justified..    Cover etc.: there's a simple, attractive cover, though no further illustrations.    Opening Linked Table of Contents: there's a full Linked ToC to either the beginning of each of the novels, or each of the short stories.  There's an error in the ToC of Volume 6, \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" - avid readers will be surprised at the inclusion of a hitherto unknown Holmes story, \\"Murder in Westminster\\"!  This is in fact simply the second half of the previous, correct story, \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\\" (\\"Murder....\\" is a newspaper headline included in the text of the story...).  (Note: the \\"Linked ToC\\" enables you skip to predetermined points in the file - individual books, chapter openings etc.  Without a good one, a long or very technical work can be tiresome to navigate on the Kindle.)    Metadata   (\\"Metadata\\" refers to some hidden coding that publishers insert into the text file to enable Kindle to list and display correctly the essentials of the book - Author, Title etc. Kindle owners are able to correct indexing errors - which are very, very common - via a 3rd party software program called \\"Mobi2Mobi\\", but is both annoying and time-consuming to have to do so. )    Author: incorrectly set to Index under \\"A\\" for Arthur.....  Strictly speaking, he should be under \\"D\\" for Doyle, though many will prefer \\"C\\" for Conan Doyle....  (General Note: although Kindle displays author names in the form \\"Bram Stoker\\", in order for him to be positioned in the Kindle Author List under \\"S\\" for Stoker rather than \\"B\\" for Bram, the Metadata must be set by the publisher in the form \\"Stoker, Bram\\".  )    Title: it's a quibble, but the set will Index under \\"C\\" for Complete....  I'd prefer \\"S\\" for, say, \\"Sherlock Holmes: The Complete 9 Volumes\\"  (General Note: although Kindle knows to ignore an opening \\"The\\" in a title, it simple takes the first proper word in the metadata title to index the book.  Publishers often include words before the proper title of the book that lead Kindle to place it misleadingly in your displayed Title List.)    Search: works properly.  Lookup: works properly.  (General Note: for reasons I don't yet quite understand, a number of Kindle format books - usually at the less expensive end of the range - don't allow Search or Lookup to work properly.)
0099408392|5.0|`Where the Wild Things Are' story and pictures by Maurice Sendak.<br /><br />Can I say `classic' again?! There it is, said!<br /><br />A delightful story about a boy called Max having a moment of rebellion that ends with him being sent to his room without supper. Instead of sitting there sulking, his imagination runs and his room transforms into a forest with an ocean that he crosses in a little boat to discover a land full of `Wild Things'. These monsters of his imagination are no match for Max, he stares them down and is crowned as their king. His anger, dissolved, Max returns home to find his supper waiting for him.<br /><br />I have strong and happy memories of this book, it must have resonated with something in me as a child! The outstanding pictures, the fantastic `Wild Things', paint a story far richer than might be expected with so few words in the book. A keeper!
0756404746|5.0|I'm not a big fan of book reviews, in general. After all, it's pretty tough to distill the essence of a five hundred page book into five paragraphs (or less). And then you have the inevitable spoilers. I hate spoilers. Reading a book and knowing that something is coming ... it just ruins the experience for me. So, I rely on the recommendations of my friends and, frankly, blind luck to find great new books. My friends introduced me to George R.R. Martin (and for that they deserve my undying thanks). Blind luck introduced me to Patrick Rothfuss.    I randomly picked this book up off the shelf, read the back synopsis, thought it sounded interesting, and bought it. I loved it and couldn't put it down.    Here's the spoiler-free reason to read \\"The Name of the Wind\\": the plot, the characters, and the world are incredible and very compelling. The writing is excellent. The story concept is simple, yet captivating.     If you enjoy fantasy, this book -- the first of three -- will engross you and leave you wanting more.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|As it is regrettably too often the case ... corporate greed prevails over human rights, animal rights or the preservation of the environment. Amazing Grace evidences that fact clearly.     We witness the decade struggle of a decent man fighting incessantly at the cost of his health and sanity for the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom. But in so doing he must face in parliament, wealthy men solely motivated by greed ... sugar cane plantation owners in the Caribbean Islands, who hold their fortune on the back, sweat, misery and death of African slaves.    Intertwined and deeply woven into the fabric of this story, is the tale of a slave trafficking ship captain who upon the peril of his life during a storm, asked God to spare his miserable life.     He promised to change his ways and to become an advocate in favor of ending slavery. His sincere change of heart inspired him to write the lyrics of what would become the most beautiful gospel song ever ... Amazing Grace.    For millions around the globe and for centuries to come, this hymn will forever remain us of the tragic story behind these words and that man can listen to his conscience and replace his insatiable greed or hatred ... by compassion, tolerance, respect and love for his fellow man.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Bowie has done so much and if your looking for a bit of everything you can buy The Best of. In my opinion if you are looking at this album you have found the best of. with tracks like - Changes - Life on mars and The Bewley Brothers etc<br />Favourite track - Andy Warhole.
B000058983|5.0|I bought this solely because it was ranked number 40 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 best albums of all time. I'd never heard of the album, nor of the group, and I think I just wanted to prove their editors wrong. How could it be so great if I'd never heard of it? It must, I figured, be some hippie dippy sentimental pick foisted on the magazine's editors by Jann Wenner.<br /><br />I was wrong. If anything, this album deserves a higher ranking. It is an essential document of American music and culture, and its only semblance of a fault is that it was about two years ahead of its time.<br /><br />There's a common perception that hippie culture found its peak at Woodstock and started disintegrating soon thereafter, with the Manson murders and the stabbing at Altamont heralding the end of the promise of the Sixties. The argument seems to have a lot going for it; looking at the careers of singer/songwriters, for instance, it seems like Bob Dylan's happy trippy tales and delightful upbeat wordplay were being eclipsed around that time by Neil Young's intense Scorpio musings and dark tales of drug deals gone bad. But this album, recorded in Los Angeles in August and September of 1967 (not too far removed in space and time from San Francisco's Summer of Love) gives the lie to that notion. The darkness was always there, waiting to be found. Most people hadn't made that journey at that point, but Love's Arthur Lee was a visionary, seeing what the rest of the culture had yet to discover.<br /><br />This album, his masterwork, sits precariously perched atop a towering mountain of late 60s music; it is an exuberant culmination, but one senses the anxious undertones that would soon send the band and the culture that spawned it hurtling into an abyss of druggy paranoia. There is sunshine and love in these tracks, but waiting in the wings, there's also a jittery dark fatalism. Arthur Lee says he'll \\"face each day with a smile,\\" but sings, too, of \\"sitting on the hillside, watching all the people die,\\" before wistfully noting, \\"I'll feel much better on the other side.\\" And later in the same song, over jittery violins, he proclaims: \\"I don't know if I'm living or if I'm supposed to be.\\" Dark stuff for 1967, or for any decade: thirty-some years before the Flaming Lips wrote \\"Do You Realize?\\", here is Lee singing \\"This is the only thing that I am sure of, and that's all that lives is gonna die, and there'll always be someone around to wonder why, and for every happy hello there will be goodbye.\\" It sounds morbid on paper, but it works incredibly well.<br /><br />The instrumentation, too, is perfectly calibrated to bring forth both sweet and bitter in equal measure. I've sometimes postulated that people can't like both horns and strings equally, and bands can't do both equally well, but this album (along with Nick Drake's \\"Bryter Later\\" and \\"Boxer\\" by The National) have proven me wrong. Excited horns give way to mournful strings articulating an ache that cannot be put into words; later, the horns get mournful and mariachi-like, and the strings become brittle and exuberant. And all the while, Bryan Maclean's stunningly virtuosic guitar playing darts in and out of the mix, so incendiary and awesome that it can only appear in short spurts, lest it consume all in its path.<br /><br />So, there you have it: incredible musicianship backing up compelling lyrics. What more could a music fan ask for, in 1967 or any other year? This is, in short, a perfect album.g all the people die,\\" before wistfully noting, \\"I'll feel much better on the other side.\\" And later in the same song, over jittery violins, he proclaims: \\"I don't know if I'm living or if I'm supposed to be.\\" Dark stuff for 1967, or for any decade: thirty-some years before the Flaming Lips wrote \\"Do You Realize?\\", here is Lee singing \\"This is the only thing that I am sure of, and that's all that lives is gonna die, and there'll always be someone around to wonder why, and for every happy hello there will be goodbye.\\" It sounds morbid on paper, but it works incredibly well.<br /><br />The instrumentation, too, is perfectly calibrated to bring forth both sweet and bitter in equal measure.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie probably one of the best of the batman series I have seen.  Joker is great!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swifts sophmore effort, \\"Fearless,\\" is a great album. Now I am not a big country fan, but I did like some of Swift's previous singles like 'Teardrops,\\" and \\"Should've Said No.\\" However, this album is more cohesive and is probably one of the best breakup records released today. Swift once again proves to be a talented songwriter, opting for meaningful lyrics instead of pop cliche's. Songs like \\"Fifteen,\\" \\"The Best Day,\\" and \\"White Horse,\\" all tell great stories. Then there's \\"Forever and Always,\\" Taylor's breakup song. We all know who it is about and regardless who's team you're on, the song is great. You will not be disappointed with this CD.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Good movie, a little sad at the end.  Its one of those movies that leave you wondering at the end.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|The comedy in this movie was trite and pedictable.  You have your crass old guy in a wheelchair, a fiance hopped up on drugs, a midget with a horrible secret about the recently deceased, and a typical pretentious rich guy.  Barring one slightly humorous awkward conversation I've been to funerals(sorry) that were funnier.    Not much else to say other than I rarely stop movies, but I stopped this one and don't regret it in the least.
B00005JKGO|5.0|After reading the reviews from this site and other sites I didn't have high expectations.  I had read some negative reviews but after receiving this edition of the movie it was FANTASTIC.  Again no one can beat the AMAZON.COM price.  The quality was good and they even have the original filming and the enhanced refurbished version.  They spilt screen it so you can see the difference.  Once again a very satisfied customer.....
0375703764|1.0|This kind of \\"experimentation\\" was already over in the days of Woolf and Joyce.  Not only was D.F. Wallace incredibly overrated and incredibly out of touch, but he's left us a legacy of second-rate regurgitated drivel like this as well.  Thanks, guy.      Whatever happened to telling real stories about real people?
B000A2XC1C|5.0|Having searched for this movie for a number of years in Both New Zealand & Australia I was so pleased when I got told to try Amazon.com. I shared it with my kids and they (even at 12 & 14yrs) really loved it as truly shows the magic behind Christmas and Dudley Moore really makes a wonderful elf. I love especially the details of the North Pole and how everything is elf-made!  The movie tells of how Santa comes to be, how the whole delivery in one night happens and much much more in a truly believable way, then as time passes and today's children aren't satisfied with wooden toys they try something new and a certain young elf learns about being away from the north pole then well the story takes off from there. This is a wonderfule Movie for the whole family to sit and watch togeather!!!
1577312082|5.0|I tried to read the book at first, but it was hard for me to focus. A friend suggested that I try the audio version. I am only on disc 5 right now, (I have 2 small children which limits my amount of quality time to listen) but I have found his messages beginning to penetrate my normal thought patterns. I find myself actually wanting to listen to the CD's (his voice is very calming). When I'm done with all 7 CD's, I plan on listenening to them again. I would recommend this product to anyone who finds it as difficult as me to live in the present moment.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love, love, love this soundtrack. I am a big fan of the books and the movie was pretty good, with a few minor exceptions.  The soundtrack doesn't disappoint though.  Every song is interesting, well-chosen and evocative-not to mention just plain fun to listen to.  Definitely a good buy and a terrific addition to your music collection.
B001KZMGEW|5.0|This show is too good.   The stories combine \\"who done it?\\", comedy, and a GREAT cast.   This is a modern day X Files.
0756404746|4.0|A good combination of quality writing and engaging storytelling make this book stand out from standard fantasy.  The story is told by the protagonist, looking back at his life, but also promises that his story is not yet over through a series of present-day events.  The author is good at creating subtle mysteries, but also at tying up loose ends, which makes the storytelling very satisfying.  Because the author reveals the story slowly, at times the world can appear under-developed, particularly in brief settings.  My only other quibble is that like so much fantasy, the main character's much vaunted brilliance etc. is not always displayed in his actions.      Overall, I highly enjoyed this book, and am looking forward to reading the next one.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This was free on the internet so is it worth buying a DVD? You bet it is! The extras make it totally worthwhile. \\"Commentary: the Musical\\" is hysterical and the ordinary (as if, with this crew) commentary is pretty darn entertaining as well.<br /><br />One word of caution: this is a region free DVD and may not work in some players. It doesn't work in my old DVD player but works fine in my computer. If you only have one way to play it, you may want to make sure it'll work first.
B00005JPAO|3.0|The Queen starring Helen Mirren is a good film about Queen Elizabeth II but I was somewhat disappointed by the storytelling. Thank goodness for Mirren, her delicate performance saved this film from sinking, her Oscar was much deserved. Most of the film surrounds the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth wasn't a fan of hers by any means. I was expecting more of a dramatic film, the Brits really are stuffy. This a mixed bag for me.
0810970686|4.0|and are we glad. The kid considers himself 'one of the best people I know\\". Objectively the reader would disagree, but the author nails the age group perfectly. Good laughs and great drawings. Perfect for all ages.
B00000DFSK|4.0|The Best of 1980-1990 by U2 is an ok greatest hits album but some songs are not included such as One. Bono has a great voice and the band has written some incredible music over the years. All I Want Is You, With or Without You, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, The Sweetest Thing, and Pride are the standout tracks here. This CD could have been stronger for fans, oh well.
0307269752|4.0|4.75 stars!  Even though I am not particulartly a huge fan of mystery thrillers, I enjoyed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo immensely.  The writing was top notch.  The plot was intricate and suspenseful.  The characters were different from the norm and the two main characters (Blomvkist and Salander), extremely complex and likeable.  Most of all, it was a crime novel that didn't involve lawyers, the police, the FBI, the CIA, or the military.  I think that is what made it such a fresh read for me.  That, and the fact that the setting is Sweden, gave it a nice feel for this American reader.  (Spoiler Alert)  The only part that I did not like about TGWTDT was the really, stinking, beyond lame, terrible, horrible no good, very bad and disappointing ending.  I am wondering if that is the way the book really ends, or whether Stieg Larsson died before he could write a proper ending.  Had it not been for the ending, my rating would have been 5 stars.
0316067601|5.0|Of all the military books that I have and read, this is by far the best book. I've read this book over, and over, and over. Marcus...thank you for sharing this tough experience. You not only remind me not to take life for granted but has inspired me to push forward. Thank you!
B001AW9DKK|4.0|I like this better than Four Way Street.  CSN & Y sound better.   It is a good recording.
1594201927|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I purchased this book after hearing an interview (OnPoint). I was expecting a book that was much more concise and consistent. Instead, _The Ascent of Money_ is rambling and all over the place. It seems rather obvious, especially in the chapter on bonds and the Rothschilds, that Ferguson was simply recycling material. Nevertheless, the first 3/4 of the book was still interesting and helpful, and Ferguson's digressions often help to add spice to a topic that might otherwise be dry. I would still recommend reading this book, especially if your knowledge of economic history is minimal (I'd first suggest reading _Naked Economics_ by Charles Wheelan).
B0002XVQNU|2.0|This film stinks. Ben Affleck stinks. Jennifer Garner stinks. The script stinks. And the director's really stinks up the place like a frat boy using your toilet after a particularly nasty chili cook-off and all-night micro-brewery tour. The difference is that this movie can't just be flushed and waved away with a potpourri-scented Glade plug-in. The only thing I like about this movie was the basic costume design and the fight scene in the bar. What's left is something like two hours of awful dialogue, stilted story, nightmarish melodrama and asinine posing. One of the few bright spots in this film, Colin Farrell, actually seems to channel the spirit of a vicious hit man who is extremely eccentric but falls down and hits his head on a toy bullseye from a Lego archery set....over and over and over..... Thankfully, this all takes place before the movie begins.<br /><br />I sincerely believe that everything was taken out of this movie for it's the actual theatrical release was for the betterment of pacing, character and to reduce the embarrassment of all involved. Unfortunately the director after failing to convince the studio to release his cut by throwing a hissy fit, reminded them that releasing another version of the movie might squeeze a few hundred thousand dollars more out of the sad comic book fan market, and so they gave their blessing to the director's cut. Perhaps the studio heads should have considered the obvious threat of eternal damnation of their souls, but I suspect that at least a few of them had already had that part of their spiritual anatomy cut out and used to make CGI sparkles to enhance the next 200 million dollar Will Smith blockbuster. I hope it earned them a few points on the back end.<br /><br />The film tells the \\"story\\" of a boy raised in hell's kitchen who is blinded by radioactive waste being driven through the streets on its way to being buried in drums in an even poorer neighborhood no doubt. Surprisingly instead of a horrible disfigurement and a lifetime of highly increased cancer risk, the boy develops the kind of abilities that human beings have spent thousands of years dreaming of attaining through hard work and understanding of their bodies, minds and spirits. If only those hard-working chumps had developed nuclear waste and gone skateboarding crazily like Bart Simpson through the streets of the inner-city they would have achieved their goals much faster. The boy chooses to grow up and be a superhero. But not just any superhero. A melodramatic, whining, emo chump of a superhero. When Bullseye turns up he at least has the good sense to be who he is without any drama-queen neuroses. One is almost tempted to root for Bullseye and end our suffering, take our hand, and lead us into a much cooler and less self-obsessed movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately in the end of the hero wins. He beats the crap out of the bad guy and finally learns to \\"love himself\\".... at least until the next movie where he will be sure to find new reasons to mope without actually crying, which would probably be too much for the homophobic viewing audience to take; though they seem perfectly content with guys running around in leather outfits, making grand entrances, decorating their apartments with butch implements of war.... You get the picture.<br />In the end we are treated to an invitation to join daredevil leaping across the rooftops of New York City and have our hearts soar with him in triumph. I chose instead to purchase a wood chipper to Frisbee the DVD into with a flick of my wrist, and I must say that my heart did indeed soar in triumph.ime of highly increased cancer risk, the boy develops the kind of abilities that human beings have spent thousands of years dreaming of attaining through hard work and understanding of their bodies, minds and spirits.

B001FB55YE|5.0|One of the best of 2008.  If you buy this, you won't be disappointed!
0765350386|5.0|Great book by Sanderson. The characters are well developed, the writing is creative, and the plot is entirely original. I am finishing book 2, and the quality of the story-telling continues.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Amazon did a great job assuring I receive it on time.  However I thought the movie was certainly not even close to the musical play.  I was disappointed.  I have no idea how anyone could nominate it for an award.  Very disappointed.
1416562605|4.0|I can't remember exactly why I purchased this book but I am glad I did, as \\"The White Tiger\\" is an enjoyable and in many ways eye opening book.  One hears so much about India these days about the growing middle class and all the opportunities.  This novel shows India how it probably really is at street level, forgetting all of the mystical, yoga, spiritual things you hear and read about India.  The White Tiger is a fast, easy to follow read and will probably lead the reader to look for more opportunities to read Indian fiction.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved this movie. It was the first interactive movie experience in a very long time. It was obvious the audience loved it and it got women up in their seats dancing. The enjoyment was contagious.
B0014WSWTY|5.0|This latest set of Period Instrument Beethoven symphonies, the first in some time, is terrific. A relatively smallish orchestra by today's standards, the group nevertheless packs real punch, helped by incisive tympani and (natural) brass.   Acoustics and engineering are excellent, with a forward and present sound image possessing good depth (listen to the double basses in Sym 7's Allegretto). No need to worry about an over-reverberant hall which spoils some recordings.     Rather than point to HIP practice/re-assessment, for which there is an extended essay provided in the notes, this represents simply a first class cycle.  Tempos are somewhat close to the norm pacé a refreshingly quick opening to Sym 6.  And has the first movement of Sym. 8 ever sounded better, more right? The development section is original head-bagger music, and here I find it impossible not to let loose and jam like a heavy-metal rocker at a rowdy concert (I thought my house walls were going to crumble).  Likewise the opening movement of Sym 5 is a whirlwind: what a concise, moody and intense movement this is, superbly realized here!  Strings leave nothing to be desired and there are absolutely no intonation issues (listen to their plangent calls in the funeral march of Sym 3 - wow). At all times the players of Anima Eterna are engaged and engaging, their energy jumping out of the speakers.      The orchestra is enlarged for Sym 9 but the clarity is still present.  Soloists and choir are up to the standard set by the orchestra, and the two forces are nicely balanced.  When the soloists sing in ensemble, they are as blended a group as I've heard in this piece, and that's not so easy to bring off.  The choir is agile and responsive (what those poor sopranos have to do for Beethoven!). The collection is rounded out with a nice complement of overtures and other small pieces, all played with the same dedication and commitment.    For points of reference, my two favorite Beethoven cycles are Harnoncourt (Teldec) and Abbado (Euroarts DVD).  I am ashamed to admit that I've never heard Norrington, Gardiner or Hogwood.  And I need to explore the new recordings of Vänskä/Minnesota which have gotten such rave reviews, and are recorded in multi-channel.  Of course I have other single or multiple discs as well (Wand, MTT, Halász), but this Immerseel set is worthy of your top shelf.  While not every performance will likely be your favorite \\"desert island\\" version and they probably won't supplant your favorites (they don't mine), Immerseel nevertheless provides a coherent vision of Beethoven's style and unique, revolutionary symphonic language that makes these nine, highly individual works which span about a quarter century, all of a piece. I for one wouldn't want to be without them. Urgently recommended.
1591841992|5.0|It usually takes me months to get through even a good non-fiction book. The only time I put this book down was to feverishly draw pictures. If you're interested in a new angle of what you already do everyday (look at the world visually) pick up this book.    A number of the negative comments here focus on Roam using too many words in his book and therefore not making his point re: using visuals to communicate. Totally miss the point. You don't silently draw pictures to solve a problem or to communicate/sell an idea, you talk while doing it. Drawing out a problem helps you see a different perspective and generate ideas. Showing pictures during a presentation gives context to the words you're communicating.     What I found great about the book is that he is talking to you about what you know already (problem solving, sale presentations etc) and using his pictures along the way to help you see those processes in a clearer, more visual way while demonstrating his idea of visual thinking at the same time. Call me crazy but that sounds like practicing what he preaches and is a win for me.
B000J0UD94|4.0|Ridley Scott put together some absolutely stunning footage in this film. The camera work and technical editing are some of the best I've seen.  The storyline?  Well, you kind of know how it ends.  Even so it is predictable in it's drama and characterizations.  Still, it's worth watching even if you have the sound turned off.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|the product was perfectly in tact and arrived early which was a nice surprise to be wrapped for christmas.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD! I was a personal trainer in my 20's, and still train 5-6 days a week at the gym, so many times when I get a workout DVD they can be disappointing.  I was pleasantly surprised at the challenge this DVD presents in such a short period of time. Jillian does a great job of communicating why you're doing a move and why it's effective, and she is great at cueing throughout.  The circuit type training she presents is very effective and you know you are working!  I've always loved her energy and drive.  For me, this is a great DVD to have in my workout library when I can't head into the gym, and want a fast but challenging workout (under 30 minutes).
B0001US62I|5.0|I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it. I have always been a Mickey Roarke fan and this movie truly showcases his wonderful talent.
031606792X|5.0|This is the best of the 4 books. Each book was better than the last and book 4 does not let you down. Full of surprises and best yet it ended wonderfully. I did not want the story to end and would love to continue reading about the characters.    Thank you Stephenie Meyer for this exciting story and for the wonderful characters story.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|1)It is very cinematic-- it's look is a compilation of  visual statements by director Ed Harris in praise of the genre and past directors of the genre,who made the western so American.(Clint,Anthony Mann,John Ford,George Stevens)  2)The town is really good and \\"Shaney\\" looking from a distance,The sets looked authentic.  3)Viggo M. is the best sidekick since Woody Strode in \\"Liberty Valence\\"  4)Ed H. is the best Marshall since Gary Cooper in \\"High Noon\\"  5)Both of the above will shoot at the drop of a hat,good by procrastination.  6)Renee Z. likes men,she's not a whore,she just likes men,and she'll show it at the drop of a hat,what a wonderful girl..  7)a great scene when Harris shoots a couple of bad guys at the of the beginning of the movie.How can you be sure they are bad guys??When Marshall Cole enters the saloon these bad boys are leasurely urinating on the floor of the bar.Good guys don't do such things..  8)Lance Hendrickson--Lance Hendrickson--Lance Hendrickson--great casting--he's right there with L.Q. Jones and Srother Martin in the Wild Bunch..  9)Because the bad guys are so dirty and seedy looking that you'll probably want to take a shower  after watching Appaloosa  10)Because Ed Harris is a fine director who has given us a wonderful western,he must be a very artistic guy, from the moment Appaloosa starts,its hard to take your eyes off the screen.In 2009 it's refreshing ,beleive it or not,to be once again taken out West,to a beautiful land by way of a genre once thought to be done for..and if that's not enough,there's no computer animation,ttrying to show real folks who aren't,or synthetic music,or cartoon animation,or all that fake blood that makes you feel like the filmmaker must think you are just dumn enough to beleive a gunshot is followed by a quart of red stuff spraying all ove the place opposite,or backwards from the trajectory of the bullet.Thanks Ed,you've made a bold film,maybe one of my favorites.   11)because Jeremy Irons,a great British actor,Plays the role of Bragg with such relish that he is almost evil lookingHe's one of those  bad   badguys who drowns kittens on one of his more compassionate days..  12)Because of the excellent script--Good Quote--Cole tells 2 badguys who have just urinated on the floor of the local saloon to put their member's back in their pants because(I love this)\\"I'm goin to walk you down the street to the jail and I don't want you to scare the horses\\"in a minute or two he tells them\\"Either of you pull on me and I'll kill you both\\"These boys are obviously no threat to Einstein because one of them pulls on Cole,he kills them both..
B001ED7C58|4.0|The first soundtrack to a movie I ever bought! The movie was so cool and I loved the music in it. It just fit so well and when I listen to the CD it takes me back to that particular scene. I had heard of Paramore but I wasn't really into them until I heard them on here now Decode is on repeat! I know some people don't like Rob's song but I think it has a bluesy feel to it not my fav but not bad.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell takes a good crack at what makes great people great and comes up with their circumstances as a key ingredient - - - the when and where they were born, the cultural background of their families, the atmosphere of the times, the nature and character of their families, and on-and-on.  He also mentions the innate drive and ability of the so-called outliers (those who rise above the rest of us), but says none of the success would have happened if it were not for the fortuitous circumstances.    Is he talking about chance, destiny, or fate? I have my own opinion about whether how these circumstances arise, and I don't think it is accidental. How many things in your own life, if you think about it, seemed destined to happen? As an example, my uncle was part of the invasion of Italy in WWII and met his future wife there. My aunt and uncle didn't know each other's language and GI's had a bad reputation there for taking advantage of girls; but because they thought he was a priest, they felt he could be trusted around my aunt's family. He wasn't a priest but carried a book that looked like a Catholic Missile used in the Mass. By the time, they were able to communicate well enough (over weeks?), he was trusted and loved. They were married after the War and had children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. The marriage lasted 60+ years until she passed away a couple of years ago.    I've often wondered about the sequence of events that led to my birth, going back centuries. How many fortuitous things went into continuing the family line until it got to me and my siblings?    Bottom line is that the stories of the highly successful folks like Bill Gates, are really as much of a story of circumstances as innate genius. At least, this is Gladwell's take - - - and mine as well.
0553381687|5.0|I first enjoyed this epic fantasy over 10 years ago.  I credit it with bringing to life my intense love of fantasy that has kept me reading constantly since that time.  Through all those years, very few books (maybe 5/500) grabbed me and held my attention so strongly as this one.  I just finished reading it for the 3rd time, and have finally decided to attempt a review.<br /><br />Since that time 10 years ago, I have been voraciously reading all sorts of fantasy and SciFi, looking for something that is hard to find in fictional works, fantasy or otherwise, but something that is plentiful in AGoT.  Whether it's the intense emotion, the brutal reality, the epic scope, the believable characters, or some combination of all those, the something found within the pages of this book makes it one of my favorite novels.  Somehow it is able to draw me in and keep me totally captivated like very few other books are able to do.  I don't usually get very `emotionally stimulated' by books, but while reading this one I do.  Really nothing to criticize about this book; just as good the third time as the first.<br /><br />The setting for A GAME OF THRONES is one of its most admirable attributes, being perhaps the most fleshed out and detailed setting in all of epic fantasy.  Not just geography, history, and culture, but climate, technology, religions, and legends are so well developed that the world comes to life like few other make believe worlds do.  While this really is a character-driven story, the setting is so intensely detailed and believable that the story really come to life.  The skill of Martin to bring the reader into his world is remarkable.<br /><br />Really its the intangibles of GRRM's writing make this masterpiece (as well as his other work) so powerful.  His method of changing POV from chapter to chapter helps bring the story to life such that not just one or two, but eight or more characters become the \\"main\\" character that you really get to understand and empathize with.  The way Martin nonchalantly drops hints of danger to come, without revealing too much at once, stimulates a desperate (but enjoyable) yearning to read the rest of the series.  It borders on maddening the way he is able to ambiguously foreshadow events of the future in ways that keep you speculating even though you know how unpredictable these books seem to be.  You can't help wishing (desperately) for things to turn out the way you'd like them to even though you know they certainly won't.  Martin's almost teasing use of hints and suggestions of imminent doom keep the reader in a constant state of expectancy, something that many readers have become frustrated with in the later books as the story seems to drag on without enough progression, creating an almost tortuous aspect to the story like a session of never-ending foreplay.<br /><br />Unlike most modern epic fantasies, this one employs only very limited and periphery use of magic.  None of the characters are magicians or latent wizards that will learn to control their powers to save the world.  The magic here is a mysterious and dangerous-seeming force of nature that guarantees to shape the distant future of the series, but for now can be safely ignored.  Its elusiveness makes it more powerful and the promise of its being revealed keeps you fanatically turning pages to learn the truth.  While you cannot say that magic doesn't have importance or isn't central to the series, it is certainly secondary to the character-driven intrigue and emotion.<br /><br />One word of caution, which is by no means a complaint, is that I would hesitate to recommend this one to anyone faint of heart.  While I think anyone would get completely drawn in by this book, I don't know if everyone would enjoy or be OK with the intensity of emotion found within.  Rape, pain, loss, unfairness, disappointment, and true evil are described with vivid and lifelike detail in ways that don't sugarcoat or sterilize one bit.  In this book sexisn't pretty, men tend to be filthy and mean, and women are smart to be fearful.  To me, it makes the story more powerful, but I'm just saying that I would hesitate to recommend it to my mother or wife.  I don't think they would appreciate the realness and intensity of scenes of animal cruelty or vulgar and pitiless rape.<br /><br />If you're up for a heart-rending, intense, and beautiful experience, try this book.  Within its pages you'll find characters that you won't be able to keep from falling in love with, in a setting so real and complete you'll never forget it.  Be warned though, by reading this book you will take the chance of becoming jaded with most other fantasy that till now may have seemed like great stories.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a top notch series, that I've seen on History Channel a few times, but never in order.  I wanted the DVD set, because it was a really good deal here on Amazon, over the holidays.  Now I can watch the series at my leisure, and without commercials.    Very nice tin that it comes in.  I wish Spielberg and Hanks would do a Pacific theater WW2 series, just like this.    Highly recommended.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and her husband who have recently moved to Vermont.  They are enjoying (?) their first winter there under a blanket of several feet of snow.  This game claims to be for at least 3 people, but my daughter said that the two of them have been playing every night after work.  By the time spring rolls around and people start visiting each other a little more, they plan to have their skills and strategy honed to perfection.
0679457607|5.0|I re-read this book every couple of years, and enjoy it thoroughly.  When a golfer has studied all the technical swing mechanics books, seen all the lesson videos and taken every tip from every source, he/she still needs to learn how to prepare himself mentally to play the game, and more importantly - improve his game.  This book makes it possible to improve rapidly and to continue improving.

B000W00Y0Y|2.0|This is a great video to have. Great performance by the band and the audio sounds very good when played PCM or other std codecs. However, when I selected DTS-HD High Resolution the audio comes out of 4.1 channels only!!! There is NO audio coming out of the center channel!!! According to the label it is supposed to be 5.1 channels. Both my PS3 and my receiver indicate it's playing 5.1 channels. My system is properly setup and working fine because this behavior only happens with this BD. Hence, the 2 star rating.  Is it isolated to this particular disc or are there others who have the same issue with this BD? If so, it might be manufacturing or production issue. If that's the case, this BD should be recalled and replaced.

B000KRN0AK|5.0|Heavy rock, All of us from the 80's know what kind of metal we love, and this is part of it! Hard Rocking and deep.
B000P7V45S|4.0|Yes, this is a true remaster, but it is also a remix.  Sometimes, remasters don't sound like someone tampered with the individual instrument/track volume levels, and that's a good thing.  Maybe that is prevented, but that's not the case here.  The levels have been changed from the original!  More on that below.    On the good side, the audio quality IS clearer and more pronounced.  There is more clarity and definition to the instruments.  And there are some missing vocal parts not originally heard that now appear.  That's all fine and dandy.  And the bonus DVD of a concert including Steve Hackett and Bill Bruford (drums), is worth the price of this CD/DVD combo.    That said, there are problems with the remix.  The original volume mix has been turned upside down.  Originally, the basic hierarchy of levels (from loudest in the mix to quietest) were: keyboards, vocals, bass, drums, and guitars (with guitars sometimes brought up to third in line).  But now, the order is drums, vocals, guitars, bass, and keyboards.  The keyboards are often buried in the mix, which is outright disgusting since Tony Banks has always played such a big role in the band's sound.  Not far into the first song (Dance on a Volcano), I noticed how Bank's mellotron is barely discernable, and if I hadn't known it was there, probably would have missed it entirely!  This is not good!    I guess the remixing demolition guy loves drums (to put them front and center) and doesn't like keyboards.  The high end of the drums too (cymbals) are also very harsh and grating to the ears.  This can be toned down with equalization, but it's a hassle that shouldn't have to be bothered with.    Still, the DVD is a great component to this.  I'm keeping my old copy of Trick of the Tail (with proper mix), and will only occasionally listen to this altered version....
006109594X|3.0|This book is basically a lifelike narrative of a naval event.  It dots its i's and crosses its t's in a precise fashion.  To enjoy this book, you really should like the navy and be partially familiar with how the navy works.  If you don't, a lot of it will sound like yada, yada, yada.<br /><br />One literary drawback is the multitude of characters.  The tale was swapping characters so often that I didn't really get a chance to identify with any character in particular.  However, to create a story that could be plausible or nearly so, I suspect the character switching was necessary (it gave it a more realistic feel).  If you love literary devices, this is not the book for you.  It's very plain prose with lots of detail delivered in a nearly military fashion.<br /><br />I suspect that the book appeals to techno geeks with at least a little military bent (like me).  John Q Public picking this up on a lark will probably be bored and disappointed.

B0018QOIXU|4.0|What a voice. Adele's use of tonal color, inflection, and embellishment in her singing delivers impressive emotional power. I suspect that I am like many of her fans here in the States who first heard her on Saturday Night Live and were instantly mesmerized by her voice and then endeared by her seemingly genuine personality. This comparison will reveal my ignorance, but Adele's singing draws me in with the same immediacy as, say, Billie Holliday. I was shocked when I learned that \\"19\\" was actually her age when she recorded the album. I doubt that many people have such control over their singing voices at that age.    The writing and composing, unfortunately, is patchy. \\"Chasing Pavements,\\" the most famous track, is very catchy and gets stuck in one's head easily - but, when one thinks about the lyrics, they seem to be an only vaguely coherent collection of phrases that sound good. Listening to the album a few times through reveals that several of the songs' lyrics don't make much sense either. That is disappointing for a short, 40-odd minute CD. Sometimes, the form and orchestration of her pieces can falter, either following tired pop formulas or combining them abruptly with anachronistic departures.    There are indeed some wonderful songs on here - wistful, sad love songs (\\"First Love\\"), hurt, angry love songs (\\"Cold Shoulder\\"), giddy, happy love songs (\\"My Same\\") - come to think of it, all of the good songs are love songs. It seems Adele has had an impressively turbulent love life for her age. But her age still shows: I was sad to see the last track, \\"Hometown Glory,\\" the only song on this album not about a real or imagined boyfriend, fall flat. It starts with a haunting recollection of a conversation on the street: \\"Is there anything I can do for you, dear? // Is there anyone I can call? / No, and thank you, please, Madame // I ain't lost, just wandering.\\" Then it descends into a bunch of unconvincing, disjointed platitudes about the city.    I really hope thatAdele manages to avoid the influences of money-grubbing industrialists and personal vices that ruin so many singers. With a few more years carefully developing her composing and poetry and experiencing new material for good songs, I think she will be turning out classics.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Excellant action movie with a comic book type heros. Nice to see Robert Downey Jr doing well. This is one of those DVDs that will be watched over and over.
B00005R23S|5.0|This is a great DVD.  In particular, the 2nd DVD is great because of the songs included.  The first DVD is the original airing of the HBO special, which only wets the appetite for the Springsteen & E Street Band experience.  The first DVD is only about 1/3 of a full Springsteen show.      Disc 2 contains some obscure gems: \\"Lost in the Flood\\" and \\"Don't Look Back,\\" classics like \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Thunder Road,\\" the complete surprise of the rarely played \\"The Promise,\\" and rave-ups \\"Light of Day\\" and \\"Ramrod.\\"      What comes through loud and clear on these DVDs is how much fun Bruce is having on stage.  The silliness in the middle of \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\" and throughout \\"Ramrod\\" are priceless.  The intensity of \\"Badlands\\" and \\"Youngstown,\\" combined with a great combination of Springsteen standards and rarities are what make these discs great.    To cap it off, there is a 15 minute segment at the end of the DVD which summaries the tour.  Bruce and the band talk with Bob Costas about the experience of reconnecting after a ten year break.  The best moment in this segment is the inclusion of \\"Blood Brothers,\\" which Springsteen performed at the last show, as the last song of the tour.  The viewer can see the emotion of Bruce as he sings about his E Street partners while including a new verse at the song's conclusion.

0061020680|5.0|Much like every book I have read by Pratchett, I enjoyed every page and ever word of this one.  The plot here on these reviews had been done to death (no pun intended), so I will be brief in that aspect.  Death, one of my favorite Pratchett characters, decides to take some time off and selects an apprentice, an unlikely lad that cannot find employment anywhere else, to take over his duties.  So begins the career of Mort, the chosen one.<br /><br />This work is filled with the usual plethora of characters, most new, but some old favorites.  Again we are reading an author who's imagination is almost limitless and humor is quirky, to say the least.  Some of the ideas put forth in this work are rather mind-bending and I certainly could not say for certain that I understood all that happened, but that is a part of the charm of reading this author's books.  The mixture of fantasy and reality skate along a thin line and the satire is both blatant and hidden; to the point of being down right sneaky.  At times you come across paragraphs such as:<br /><br />\\"Harga's House of Ribs down by the docks is probably not numbered among the city's leading eateries, catering as it does for the type of beefy clientele that prefers quantity and breaks up the tables if it doesn't get it. The don't go in for the fancy of exotic, but stick to conventional foods like flightless bird embryos, minced organs in intestine skins, slices of hog flesh and burnt ground grass seeds dipped in animal fats: or, as it is known in their patois, egg, soss and bacon and fried slice.\\"<br /><br />This paragraph is obvious, although I found it quite funny when I read it.  You have to pay very close attention to the one liner though, which the author slips in here and there and must be read in the context of the paragraph or page they are written on.  It is like finding little treasures hidden here and there. Another review used one of my favorite examples of the short, double take statements that Pratchett uses.  Albert, one of the characters, mutters under his breath \\"s*odomy non sapiens\\" and Mort asks him what that means.  Albert's answer is so typically Pratchett, \\"Buggered if I know.\\"  This is one of many, many delightful little gems.<br /><br />One of the biggest draw to these books is the wonderful mixture of silly geography, science, magic and Godly whims that rule Disc World.  Many of the situations make no sense at all; yet at the very same time can be perfectly logical, if looked at from a certain angle.  The author is a master of this.  The author is a Master Story Teller, and I feel that this is what makes the big difference and sets Pratchett apart from so many other authors in this genre.  Now these books and this author may not be for everyone.  I truly feel you have to have a sort of odd outlook on life to receive the full benefit of these reads.  Everyone should try at least one or two of these books though, just of find where you stand in the scheme of things.<br /><br />This is a good read; one of many this author has produced.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkscharacters, mutters under his breath \\"s*odomy non sapiens\\" and Mort asks him what that means.

0765348276|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover.  While I do see the influence of Heinlein in his style, I have to say I find his writing style very refreshing.  His \\"human touch\\" seems to be a little closer to the pulse.  He does pay his respects to the classics though.  I think what I enjoyed most about this story was that the science aspect of the influencing technology never got in the way of good storytelling.  All too often science fiction writers get carried away with the science behind their story.<br />To keep it short and sweet, this is a terrific read on every aspect.  From the story, to the characters and science, I highly recommend it.  Upon finding out that it was the first story in three, I immediately went out to the other three.  Enjoy!

B001INICAI|4.0|I remember when this book came out and I always wanted to read it.  When the movie came out I resolved myself to not see the movie until I read the book.  I'm glad I did.<br />It's a book that hits you on many levels.  I found myself disliking Chris McCandless towards the beginning but as I read further, I found myself understanding him a little better.  By the time I put the book down I'll admit I was really heartbroken by his story but happy that he found what made him happy.  It's a shame he died finding it.  It was a very inspiring and touching story that I'm sure I'll want to read again, just not that soon.  I took a little something for myself from his story and what more can you ask for.<br />Just a simple thank you to the family of Chris McCandless for sharing his story as well as to Jon Krakauer for telling it.
B001G9LVGG|4.0|Beautiful as always, Loreena McKinnett does not disappoint! It definitely has some Christmas music on there; it has a nice holiday tone. However, listen to this album all year long. It's great for relaxation or for when you'd like to fall asleep. This CD is definitely worth adding to any Loreena McKinnett collection.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|I heard a track from this new DTB CD on the 'Blues Deluxe' radio show and the host said that more tracks will be featured on the program. I was SO impressed. Derek Trucks started out really good and gets even better with each new title. I'd recommend this new one to any music fan!
1932907009|1.0|After flipping through this book in a store, I thought \\"Now way.\\" Then it was referenced in a book that I did find helpful, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Big mistake. Primarily, this book is helpful in constructing loglines--one sentence synopses meant to help sell a spec script, i.e. a very brief written pitch. Snyder's emphasis on this is justified, but his own advice makes marketing aspects bleed heavily into craft and storytelling, including making a movie that will fit a good pitch, rather than explaining how to write a good movie then pitch it (he even suggests writers should envision the film's poster to help get a handle on the story).<br /><br />While he professes a love of \\"mainstream\\" movies, I don't think he and I use the term similarly. \\"The Third Man\\" was mainstream, as was \\"Casablanca\\" and even \\"Fight Club.\\" However none of these films could have been made with the absolute disregard for subtlety Snyder professes. When he says \\"mainstream\\" Snyder actually means 'high-concept family-friendly films that turn a healthy profit'.<br /><br />Snyder's system of beats is interesting to consider, but it's even less flexible than Syd Field's constructions.<br /><br />...And you can't just say \\"see Joseph Conrad\\" every time as shorthand for emphasizing a character's place in myth. But don't try selling sincerity and complexity to Snyder. From page 119: \\"The real inspiration for this book started with one simple desire: I had a whole bunch of snappy rules for screenwriting and I wanted to get credit for coining them. There! I said it.\\"<br /><br />It's not that there aren't 'rules' to screenwriting. There are in fact many helpful guidelines. And why there may not be rules you must follow, there are a gazillion you probably shouldn't break. While I did get a few few helpful ideas from \\"Cat\\" (assessing 'Superhero' protagonists on the same level with 'Monsters'), it was not worth the $21.60 I paid. Much of what Snyder writes has the semblance of truth, but I feelother books have put him in the aft of my own learning curve. Instead, try this introductory curriculum:<br /><br />1. Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (with notes by Editor Francis Ferguson, ~$3 used on Amazon)<br />2. David Mamet's \\"Three Uses of the Kife\\"<br />3. Watch Syd Field's instructional DVD (Netflix carries it) - take notes!<br />4. Watch Charlie Kaufman's \\"Adaptation\\"<br />5. Spend a month reading dozens and dozens of scripts<br /><br />That's it. I recommend \\"The Hollywood Standard\\" as a formatting guide (Not \\"The Screenwriter's Bible--it's clunky)<br /><br />Good luck.

I receive it, pop in the DVD-Audio disk into my Marantz DVD player > Marantz amp > B&W 805 speakers.  I was expecting the typical remastered sound, but what I heard was just... wow!  It sounded like something that was recorded with a newer technology than current CDs.  I have been so impressed by this album.  Every songs sounds so real, and not just an old recording.  Out of every CD I've ever own, this is the most impressive recorded CD I've ever heard.  HIGHLY Recommended!

0385333846|5.0|What's wonderful about this book is how Vonnegut launches a head-on assault on the mythology of the 20th century's one Good War. History has decreed World War II a Noble Fight Against the Enemies of Civilization, but Vonnegut says it was a freezing firestorm that made a mockery of our very existence.  My late grandfather was also a WWII vet. He never read any Vonnegut that I'm aware of, but he spoke of the war in the same way. I think it had something to with actually being there. Both Vonnegut and my grandfather were grunts sent out to do a dirty goddamn job. Neither of them crowed about a minute of it ever after. That doesn't surprise me. What surprises me is that they both carried on with dignity the rest of their lives, when they'd both seen the beating black heart of the worst horrors man can render upon man. I've always doubted my ability to do the same, and remain thankful to this day that I've never had to find out.<br /><br />Vonnegut's anti-war screed has, if anything, only gained in prescience over time. (See Iraq, War in.) Makes you wish the Decider-in-Chief read books. At least this one.<br /><br />The strange advice (albeit dished out by aliens who see Time akin to a Rocky Mountain panorama) to ignore what's bad in order to focus on what's good smacks of the reasoning of a man who has reached the end of all reasoning. Who can no longer compose a rationale for man's behavior. The sort of conclusion you might come to, say, if you had survived the firebombing of Dresden.<br /><br />As literature, per se, Vonnegut's light-hearted dalliance with both the English language and the strictures of plot structure cause you to wonder why you spend any time reading books less fun than this. Then you realize that such an ephemeral style washes over you so quickly very little is left when the book is done, other than the sour taste of a moral lesson unwittingly learned. I suspect that was Vonnegut's very point. As a general rule, I loathe literature that attempts to teach me a lesson. But I'll make an exception for Slaughterhouse-Five.<br /><br />Oddly, among all the carnage and contempt, the scene that stood out most in my mind comes near the novel's beginning. The narrator is at an old war buddy's house to discuss plans for his war novel. Old war buddy's wife stomps angrily around the house. Turns out she thinks the narrator is going to write a book about John Wayne fighting the war, when in fact World War II, like all wars, was fought by children. The narrator assures her John Wayne will not be making an appearance in his book. Vonnegut dedicated the book to her.<br /><br />I originally read this in high school. Promptly forgot it. (Ah, youth.) I'm very glad to publicly rectify that oversight right here.'ll make an exception for Slaughterhouse-Five.

The Motion Smoothness usually freaks me out cause it makes movies seem real.  But with this concert, it was like being right there in the crowd with Shakira.  The concert is awesome!  Her performance is great!!!  Even when she's not singing, her character is so likeable.  It's impressive to watch this blu-ray and be able to see all the crowds' faces.  Great show, great BD disc.  If you like Shakira, buy it!
0679721037|5.0|John Hersey's Hiroshima is an excellent book that every person should read. It describes very clearly the horrors of Atomic Warfare. This book is not for the light hearted reader, it is very intense. There are many gory descriptions of the affects of radiation and severe burns, and death is everywhere on these pages. Wherever you stand on the question of weather or not America should have dropped TWO atomic bombs on Japan, you must acknowledge one thing. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were murdered by the bombs. The slaughter of innocent is never diplomatic or peaceful, no mater how you coat it.     I highly recomend this book to anyone curious about what Hiroshima was like from the average Japanese citizen's point of view. Also, every person should read this great book to learn about the horrors of atomic bombs. Please, if you don't learn history, then you are doomed to repeat it.

I highly recommend this video if you want to get the most bang for your buck in a short workout time.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|In today's world, there are not many ways we have come up with in terms of communication that does not include WORDS. In fact if anything, our society have come up with the most high tech, intriguing ways of communication using words such as Facebook, the I phone, and text/instant messaging. Saying this I must admit, that after watching Wall-E, I was more impressed with this film and it's achievements than any other film I have seen in the last few years.<br />Without language, Wall-E achieved emotion, quirky personalities, and the development of friendship and love. ALL WITHOUT WORDS. Quite an amazing feat. I was in tears at the end of this excellent Pixar film and could not believe how incredibly attached I had become to Wall-E and Eva, the two main characters. I was astonished.<br />Pixar has created a masterpiece that will be remembered as a true breakthrough in animation and I am so thrilled that children of today and tomorrow will be able to watch a film that has such vitally important messages about how to live, respecting Mother Earth, and being conscientious about your environment and community.<br />Within this thoroughly entertaining film, there is such a unique message of hope for all of mankind. All the men, women, and children of the world have an effect on this incredible planet that we all depend on. It is a delicate balance that we must respect and continue to teach the next generations of how important it is to do our part, no matter how small - Recycling, turning off all the lights before going out or going to bed, donating used clothing and other products to organizations like the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The treasured plant in the shoe that Wall-E finds and keeps is a symbol of how blessed we are to have such a beautiful and wonderful planet. The different vegetation and flowers, the animal kingdom, and the beautiful landscapes that differ from the golden deserts of the Sahara to the lush, tropical jungles in South America, to the beautiful blue-green of the Mediterranean Sea. These inspiring and realizations all came to me after watching this film. A+reen of the Mediterranean Sea. These inspiring and realizations all came to me after watching this film. A+
0385339585|4.0|I would rather give you my recommendation than tell you a book report.  Life's motto of today is \\"the lastest and greatest is the only way.\\"  Well, THE TESTAMENT is another classic Grisham novel.  It is a true example that his legal stories will move anyone even ten years after its publication date. It is not THE RAINMAKER, but it is still a great book. I highly recommend THE TESTAMENT.  Enjoy!
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I have been waiting for this film to come out on blu-ray. It is an amazing tale of adventure, romance, and magic. Don't forget an amazing performance from michelle phiefer who still looks amazing. It was one of the most unappreciated movies of last year. Once again PLEASE PUT THIS MOVIE ON BLURAY ASAP!
1439102813|5.0|This book has a great mix of facts, sentimentality, and even humor. The author, Genova, takes us into the mind of Dr. Alice Howland, a brilliant Harvard professor, who over the course of the book gradually looses herself to early onset Alzheimer's disease. This is one of the few books that have captured my undivided attention from beginning to end.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|I have loved Keane since the first time that I listened to their music; in my case, it was \\"Under The Iron Sea\\" first, and I was so captivated by the album that I ran to buy \\"Hopes and Fears\\" which continued to blow my mind; to this day, both albums remain as the best examples of music perfection.  For me, the combination of genius piano playing, together with remarkable drumming sequences and Tom's incomparable voice is what worked on the first two albums.  Boy, they were not kidding when they said they were trying new things on the third album!!!  \\"Perfect symmetry\\" is an ok album; I have listened to it just as much as I have the previous ones, and although I like it I regret to say that the new album lacks the Keane magic.  The melancholy is gone; the piano is simply not there anymore along with the beautifully complicated drums; I even miss the way Tom used to inhale so loudly when he sang the first two albums.  So they took a chance - something certainly worth mentioning; however, sometimes new is not necessarily better.  In my opinion, they already were a complete band without the synths and guitars.  Hopefully, they got the experimentation out of their systems; I am confident that they will go back to their genius beginnings in their forthcoming albums.  I still love Keane and I will still listen to their music in the future.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I get this every year for my daughter for Christmas because we don't get the CW network so it is a major deal for her to see all the episodes in one shot.  And yes she watches it in one shot. Always fast shipping and great price. Thanks Amazon!
0545128285|5.0|A fun read for any fan of the Harry Potter books, although a LOT shorter than any of her other works. Only includes 5 tales. I actually enjoyed the \\"commentary by Albus Dumbledore\\" on each tale more than the fairy tales themselves.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I've been listening to Pat Metheny's music since the late 80's and this is certainly another master piece that the group has managed to create.  The individual performance of the musicians is amazing and incredibly well armonized.  As I say to others when I refer to this CD:  \\"When I die, I want that music to be played at Heaven or Hell, wherever it is where I'm going.\\"
0743298039|5.0|I though that the tale was well written and I couldnt put it down. Very interesting perspective. The twist was unexpected. Can't wait to read more books by this author
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Why Jolie and Morgan Freeman lent their talents to this thing is a big question. This was non stop nothingness - no plot and the talents of Jolie and Freeman were badly wasted.It doesn't even rate 1 star..it might rate 1/2?? Why aren't there more choices - like l/2 or NONE.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|There's no doubt that the Gibb brothers are masters at writing timeless music with great melodies, catchy lyrics and perfect 3-part harmony, but delving deep into their vast catalog of music finds, \\"Odessa\\", the grandest of them all. Coming off three hugely successful albums, with the most recent being the joyful \\"Idea\\", The Bee Gees set out and created an album with many varying styles, with grand orchestration and moving epics such as the title track, Odessa (City On The Black Sea) and beautiful ballads such as Melody Fair. There were several choices for singles such as \\"Never Say Never Again\\" and \\"Marley Purt Drive\\", but the first and only single was ultimately \\"First Of May\\", a wonderful choice in its own right.   The packaging on the Deluxe Edition is first rate. The original red velvet cover has been restored as well as track by track details, plus several photos from the period. The bonus disc \\"Sketches For Odessa\\" gives us a glimpse into the evolution of these great songs as well as some unreleased tracks that were left off the original album. This is a must for any Bee Gees fan or any fan of 60's baroque pop.
031606792X|5.0|Awesome book, worth the wait. Not that I appreciated it coming after the holidays but I at least I expected it. The book was in great conditon. I love the Twilight Series Books. I would read them over again. I hope they end up filming the rest of the books. Great story line at the edge of my seat book.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I use it on my baby jogger city mini (single).  It fits PERFECT!  Can even fold my stroller with it on.  Fits sippy cups, water bottles, coffee, keys, phone etc etc.  Fits a surprisingly a lot, and it's so cheap!!!  Love it- perfect for walks and the mall :)
B0007TKNII|5.0|I bought this title for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved it. Need I say more?
0385340990|5.0|How can letters of correspondence make a novel? I found the letters but transcribed the facts in my historical fiction (Forbidden Loves, Paris Between the Wars) which takes place between the two world wars; however, these two authors have conceived an original framework weaving correspondence into a moving, historically based tale. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is, in my opinion, compelling, creative, and highly recommended reading.
B000K09OL6|5.0|When my wife suggested this for my son for Christmas, I was pretty skeptical. After all, why not something more exciting like a race car set, flying dragonfly, Play Station? Well, I was wrong. Totally wrong. This is totally awesome. The key to success to the Kapla bricks is the preciseness of each piece and that allows you to build fantastic structures that challenge your imagination. There is no warpage, no splinters (and it smells great!). I found myself spending hours building arches, bridges and buildings, applying basic structural engineering principles that I've learned in school. Oh yes...it is my son's Christmas present..we've build dogs, houses, chairs, bridges together. Lots of fun, very highly recommended indeed.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|We bought this movie for our boys (6months, 2 and 1/2, and 4).  They all love to watch Wall-e! Even the baby! I think they watched it about 3 times in a row after opening it. It is a wonderful movie, even without all the dialogue.  Of course the kids don't understand everything, as with any other Pixar movie, it has stuff that adults get and the kids don't.  But the kids still manage to love the movies anyways.  Pixar did another great movie, just like Cars, Toy Story, and Finding Nemo. This three-disc set is great, and a great price! Get it!
B0015OKWL2|4.0|Could this subject matter have been a bit more challenging?--   Innovative?--Worthy of two of the last half century's   greatest actors?--Hell Yeah!!  But for this particular genre of film, I still found it entertaining.  Of course, everybody was licking their chops when word of   another De Niro/Pacino pairing was announced, having been   properly teased by them in their way too breif (but nonetheless)   powerful two scenes in 1995's \\"HEAT\\", which is the stuff of   modern movie legend!    Bottomline, I still think this is a pretty good movie   and I think the subtlety of both Pacino and De Niro's performances   in it, supported admirably by John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg's   parts and the other cast members give this film substance.  I think that when people hear De Niro & Pacino, their minds go   up 10 levels above what they expect from other actors,   which is a testimony to both of these great thespians body of work.   But never forget, THEY ARE ACTORS!!---And they will be as dynamic   or as subtle as the subject matter requires!    So to the naysayers of this film, I say look at it again   and you'll discover that less is vastly more!  I think this film will be appreciated in another 5 ot 7 years.
B00000J7SS|5.0|REVIEW: Unprecedented, groundbreaking, and intoxicating: \\"BITCHES BREW\\" is the first full-blown jazz fusion masterpiece; and it is a staggering tapestry of tape snippets, sound collages, spliced together performances, studio wizardry, and (of course) a plethora of first-class playing. I can imagine what a furor this album caused in the jazz community upon its release: considering its take-no-prisoners assault on the very nature of what the genre IS and (more importantly) what it could become once freed of it's self-imposed restrictions. Just to hear the musical drama and interplay on the extended cuts \\"Pharaoh's Dance\\" and \\"Bitches Brew\\" is like visiting another world: a world filled with endless possibilities and ideas. Finally it was conceivable to not only deal openly with rock music, but also to incorporate the wild guitar extravaganzas of Hendrix and the funk rhythms of James Brown and Sly Stone into the mix. \\"Miles Runs The Voodoo Down\\", \\"Spanish Key\\", and \\"John McLaughlin\\" balances both of these extremes very well; and yet for many it is the closing ballad \\"Sanctuary\\" that is the true gem of the collection. Here Miles' gentle trumpet plays off the melodic crescendo of his band until the soaring middle and outro brings the LP to a shimmering close. \\"BITCHES BREW\\" is simply one of the greatest albums ever released: not just in the jazz genre but in ANY genre. And it still retains its position as an All-American classic, and as a must-have addition to any record collection.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 35.  HIGHEST BILLBOARD JAZZ ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 1.  HIGHEST BILLBOARD R&B ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 4.      HIT SINGLES: None.      GRAMMY AWARDS: Won for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|Michael Buble is a talent.  This is not a voice that can be duplicated.  There are not a million, a thousand, or even a hundred singers in the world that have the richness of tone and the depth that this man can bring to a song.....so why is it that a standard can end up sounding....well, standard?  It's the arrangements, for starters... sure a song's tempo can be changed, but the music remains a backdrop for belting...there's nothing \\"interesting\\" about that backdrop, and Buble is left to carry the cut all on his own....something he has demonstrated the ability to do....but aren't we ready for something more?    Reviewers that indicate that \\"Everything\\" is the best cut are correct.  It is.  And it's an example of how Buble can stretch to something newer that harkens to yesteryear.  The hook works, and Buble isn't required to overperform the song for listening ears to perk up.  It works because it is, without a doubt, the smoothest entanglement of song and singer on this or any of his other albums.  He works with the music, and the music works with him.  The result is a song that is more than catchy.... you can listen to it a hundred times and still feel like there's something fresh.    When Buble puts together an album of Everthings, he will no longer be just another standard.
0312383320|4.0|I am a HUGE Janet fan. But by chapter 8 I was about ready to take out Carl the Monkey myself. Enough with the monkey giving everyone the bird! I did not find it funny when he keeps doing it over and over and over.  Carl a side... I love the Plum books.  I do not look at the Between the Numbers books as \\"real\\". I think of them as Stephanie's dreams. They are not realistic for a reason. There is a \\"magical\\" tone in them. Diesel just popping in out of no where and such...like magic.   These are NOT like the number books.   Not that the number books are realistic either but they are not like the in betweens. I hope this makes sense. I think some people think they are the same when I read their reviews.   Take the in betweens for what they are. Entertainment while we wait for the next number book to be released. As fun as ever! ENJOY!  Something that has me upset is the book should be a small version book like the other betweens and not a full size edition. It looks like the font and spacing are to big for the book. I feel like they just wanted to get more money out of the readers. They are really pushing it by saying this is a full sized book. It was not worth $16 for the amount of reading material.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|I saw this in theaters with family and friends, and I could not wait to watch it again at home. I pre-ordered this item to be sure that I would have to wait as little as possible. I love the level of communication that is achieved through non-verbal sounds. I ended up falling in love with the characters as well as the story. I like the underlying message that the movie sends as well. It is truly some food-for-thought. This is a movie that I look forward to watching with my future children and grandchildren.
0783233477|5.0|This remake of the original, \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\", is impeccable in its attention to the flow of the story. All the actors played their part perfect. Claire Forlani is gorgeous in her innocence. Brad Pitt stunningly plays the part of Death. Anthony Hopkins brilliant as the chosen one. Its 3 hour length allows the fullness of the story to unfold.  I highly recommend watching it.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Born to be a king, little Prince Simba finds himself a guilt-plagued outcast when his uncle Scar puts his plot to overthrow King Mufasa into action. With Simba believing his father's death is his own fault, he lets his family think he is dead too and grows up in the jungle with new, carefree guardians Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. Meanwhile, selfish and heartless Scar proves himself to be a terrible and cruel ruler. Luckily, childhood friend Nala discovers Simba's secret, and now that he is grown, Simba will have to decide whether or not to take back his birthright by challenging his murderous uncle at Pride Rock.    Released in 1994 at the peak of the \\"Disney Renaissance\\", \\"The Lion King\\" was a tremendous success in every way. It featured Disney 2D animation at its finest, with stunning African visuals and beautifully blended CGI used only when necessary, glorious music from the likes of Sir Elton John, Tim Rice, Hans Zimmer, and Lebo M, perfectly designed imagery to balance the fantasy aspects with the harsh realities of life, a star-studded cast that was chosen for the right reasons rather than name alone, and a story that proved animation didn't have to be entertaining only to kids (why you have to beat that into some people's heads I'll never know; MANY still don't get it and never will). Masterfully directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, \\"The Lion King\\" won 2 Academy Awards and 3 Golden Globes, and has often been declared the high-point that marked the end of Disney's Renaissance period. Personally, I don't agree with that. Disney created many masterpieces since then, both small and large scale, such as Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, Pocahontas, Lilo and Stitch, Treasure Planet, Tarzan, the Emperor's New Groove..., but the Lion King IS a tough act to follow. Myself, I certainly consider it among the best Disney features ever made, and I think the most powerful aspect is the phenomenal soundtrack, though voice talent like Jeremy Ironsas Scar, Nathan Lane as Timon, and James Earl Jones as Mufasa, to name a few, doesn't hurt either. I still gotta give overall best animated feature to \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" though, but maybe I'm partial to pretty girls and fairytales.     Yes, the Hamlet-inspired \\"Lion King\\" is a complete masterpiece in every sense, and it deserves nothing less than this 2-disc Platinum Edition DVD release from Disney. Too bad the follow-up Platinums have never matched the first release, \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\", in quality and seem to aim more and more supplemental features towards Disney Channel-watching kids, but despite the many complaints about this particular Platinum release being one of the weakest, it remains a decent 2-disc set.     Disc One features the film itself, of course, and there are two versions to watch (naturally, in glorious enhanced widescreen). You receive the original version of the film and the headliner of this DVD, the special edition. That means the version with the newly animated song, \\"Morning Report\\", which is sung by the hornbill Zazu in one of the early scenes and is seamlessly added into the film, though I kinda don't care much for it myself (unlike the addition put into \\"Pocahontas\\" when it came to DVD which pretty much FIXED that film for me and made me see it in a whole new and better light). Still, it's interesting to see this new musical moment inspired by the Broadway show. The downside is that the \\"original version\\" of the film included is not 100% legit. According to websites online that post comparisons as proof, a few scenes did get reanimated for the IMAX presentations allegedly to show more detail (and in the case of one crocodile shot, inexplicably), and this IMAX version is actually what we have received as the \\"original\\" version on the Platinum DVD. However, if you're not the type to really notice quick and tiny details, you probably won't even notice these alterations. But that don't make it right. A third way to view thefilm, besides with the new 5.1 enhanced home theater mix audio, is with the audio commentary from the 2 directors and producer Don Hahn. Yes, there IS an audio commentary, but you may not know if you don't look for it among the audio setup. It's a great commentary too. Highly informative and enjoyable. Also among the meager and confusingly organized (but not as confusing as disc 2) extras of Disc One is a Disney Channel \\"Circle of Stars\\" music video and \\"making of the music video\\" featurette for a new version of the Lion King song \\"Circle of Life\\". Mature Disney fans always complain about these videos, this one featuring cast members of Lizzie McGuire, That's So Raven, Even Stevens, Proud Family, and Kim Possible (hope I didn't forget anyone). Sometimes these aren't unwatchable though, and thankfully this one features Hilary Duff prominently, even if she keeps doing those annoying hand motions some singers do way too much (That's alright Hil, you can do annoying things around me all you want). She looks amazing here too, because it's before she got so skinny.    More Bonus Features on Disc One are a Sing Along Track, which I think just means you can have the lyrics come up while you watch the film whenever it's time for a song if you activate this extra, and some set top games. There are three games, a fun personality profiler (see which Lion King character you are), a boring grub grab game (worked much better on the old Sega Lion King game), and a pretty fun animal sound identification game. I usually don't care too much for these set-top games, but once in a while there are good ones. In this case, 2 out of 3, that's not bad. Also on Disc One is a behind the scenes look at \\"Morning Report\\" and three deleted scenes in storyboard form. The deleted scenes are pretty neat to check out!    Disc Two is where the bulk of the extra features are supposed to be, and they are, though they are fewer than they look. There is some annoying repeating done by the organization format. You can view bonus features labeled under continent headings or down at the bottom under titles like Film, Music, etc... and sometimes you'll find stuff in the continent headers that is not in the bottom headers, and visa versa, but even among the same group of headings things get repeated! So, you get the idea when exploring them that there are a lot of bonus features, but you eventually catch on that a lot come up more than once as they are bundled into \\"journeys\\". I know that all sounds confusing, but believe me, it IS confusing trying to navigate this stuff. I've actually seen worse though. So, basically there are a bunch of pieces of documentary-type material (filmmaker interviews and so on) that combined would add up to one pretty good documentary. It's a shame these DVD makers feel they have to chop everything up and spread it around to look like there is more. A nice, long documentary that is easy to find and plays everything in succession would be much more appreciated. Still, point is, you do get your behind the scenes featurette type material here on disc two, spread all over the place, covering the story, music, art, the artists' trip to Africa, live-action referencing, effects, and everything else, EVEN the Broadway show! I wish I'd gotten to see that show! Disc Two also has video lessons on the real animals from the film, alternate scenes, a fun pair of \\"virtual tours\\" with Timon and Pubaa, 2 music videos from Elton John, and one from Jimmy Cliff and Lebo M, multi-language reels, and, of course, galleries. I always love the character design ones myself.     So, all those extras are well and good, though badly organized to obviously make us think we are getting much more, but it is sad that there are no interviews with the voice cast, no trailers for the featured film itself (what is up with that, Disney?), and as I often say, why don't you include those great Disney Channel \\"Making-Of\\" specials? They would be better than most of the new stuff thatis included on these DVD releases.      All in all, while this set is not ideal, it still has a lot to see and the movie is unquestionably a must-own. Full of drama, beauty, comedy, love, action, adventure, inspiration, and magic, \\"The Lion King\\" spawned two pretty good direct-to-DVD sequels, a fun animated series, a hit Broadway Show, a spin-off soundtrack (Rhythm of the Pridelands), and a lot of stuff at the wonderful \\"Disney's Animal Kingdom\\" theme park (which is promoted a lot on this DVD set too). It is a true piece of cinematic and artistic history, and music history, and probably other kinds of history. It is just a Masterpiece and everyone should have it in their DVD collection. Truly a beautiful thing!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I received 3 new albums this Christmas.  I received the new Metallica, the new AC/DC and the new Nickelback.  Of the three, the only one I enjoyed was Dark Horse, by Nickelback.      This album knocked me senseless in the first three songs and just wouldn't stop the entire way through.  \\"Somethin in Your Mouth\\" is has some of the best word play and just smokes musically.  \\"Burn it to the Ground\\" is the perfect rock song lyrically, musically, and in every other way.      I am scratching my head a bit on the contradiction between \\"Just to Get High\\" and \\"This Afternoon\\", but I think their is a distinction being made between marijuana and hard drugs in terms of what is destructive.  I loved the line: \\"We got weeds in the back yard 4 feet tall/Cheech and Chong would probably have smoked them all\\"     And as a final comment: The guitar playing on this CD is smokin!  There are several times that I found myself back in 88 or 89 while listening.  Ryan Peake has certainly grown as a musician.  His licks are spot on, creative, and still knows how to throw back to the metal we all loved back in the day.

B00197POXG|4.0|I've just received the megaset. I would like to share a few things which could be of interest:  - For international customers: Though the megaset doesn't come with any dubbing or subtitles whatsoever, I am thrilled by the fact that it is NOT limited to the American region code 1. It will play on pretty much all DVD players worldwide. Thank you, A&E Home Video! If you order, please be aware that you might have to pay extra V.A.T. (MwSt.) and/or customs fees (They charged me an extra of approx. 30.-$).  - Any customers: If you order because of the \\"faux-leather\\" look etc., please don't. The packaging is functional and looks nice enough, but I wouldn't want to put it on display. If you buy for the content, you'll be very happy with the megaset. I think it's a great price for what you get, and they did a very beautiful job in designing the DVD menues.  I am looking forward to many happy hours!

0385751532|5.0|I wasn't expecting much about this thin book, but after reading it, I can say it was one of the best books I've ever read. Holocaust stories are usually painful and as harsh as it really happened, but through the eyes of a child (just like \\"The book thief\\"), it's so different and amazing.  It's a book everybody should read.
B0012GMVLM|5.0|Pyramid should bore me to tears because Alan Parsons Project should bore me to tears.  This should be the most boring band in the world to me.  They should be a band that writes music to help me fall asleep.  They should be pleasant background music and nothing more.  However, they're NONE of those things.    Alan Parsons Project, while sounding a LOT like Pink Floyd on several occasions as far as atmosphere and songwriting goes, manages to escape the boredom feeling most similar artists fall victim to and somehow, perhaps with amazing talent and an ability to write vocal melodies, Alan Parsons is quite the underrated musician.  In fact, he's much more underrated these days, in a world where people insist on remembering Pink Floyd and forgetting the imitators.  Nonsense.    Pyramid isn't quite as good as I Robot in my opinion because the songwriting takes one step back.  However, one step back isn't exactly breaking your mothers back, har har.  I mean, one step back isn't exactly a MAJOR step back.  I really enjoy just about everything on Pyramid.  It's *always* important for a band like this to remember to write solid vocal melodies and luckily the band remembered to do so for this release.    The album even ends on a pretty sad note.  Listen to the lyrics on \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\" and you get the feeling someone in the band was seriously depressed.  Maybe not, but it sure sounds that way.  \\"One More River\\" sounds like Al Stewart to me.  \\"Pyramania\\" is just flat out awesome.  I remember this song as a small child.  The memories never escaped my mind!  It's like carnival music with a really really high atmosphere.  What a swirly little melody it has though!      That one instrumental near the end is quite melodic and enough to declare it the best song on the album with its intense outerspace flow and feel.  The other instrumental is more about pyramid-related atmosphere with a slow, quiet build-up, but it's good too!    Overall this is another solid one ladies andgentlemen.  Pick it up soon.

B001LRJH0K|5.0|Man, I wish they made more of these \\"high-class\\" westerns today. They are really, really good.    What I mean by \\"high-class\\" are the production values.  The sets in here are fantastic, really historic stuff.  The story is interesting, the acting superb, and the dialog really top-notch, especially between the two leading actors: Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. There really is nothing bad I can say about this film, and it's a pleasure to watch on Blu-Ray.     With a story centered more on dialog and suspense (you're never quite sure what these edgy characters are going to do next), this movie reminded me of \\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\\" in that it showed you don't need much violence to make a good western.  Kudos for Harris, too, for his directing efforts.  This is a wonderful movie.

B000002AP1|5.0|Suposedly Iggy doesn't know how to remaster the album he himself wrote according to certain reviewers.  Crap on that.  This mix is super agressive and \\"in the red, the prooofs in the pudding.\\"  If Iggy would've done the mix to begin with, nobody would be whining.  Or, if Bowie would have done the remaster and Iggy the original, the same people would be crying about how Bowie \\"ruined it.\\"  This recording is essential whether you have the vinyl, the 1st cd recording or Iggy's mix, or even better, all three.  Granted this is RAW POWER folks.  What was he supposed to do, let it rot in the condition that Bowie left it or step it up and make it more primal?  This is what so-called punks would have sounded like if they actually had balls.  So if you even think you're a rocker, metalhead, punker, what have you, you've got this or at least you know the importance of this bad mutha!  If not, just buy it and learn.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|\\"Commentary: The Musical\\" is pure genius. Worth the cost of the DVD for that alone.<br />The 5.1 surround sound is fantastic.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Fine acting, great camerawork, senic locations, period correct clothing and weapons - it is a pity that the script veered off into wonderland at about the halfway point. It would be bad enough for the hero to trade the bad guy for his kidnapped girlfriend when he could have gotten her back by gunfire, but to let the bad guy go without getting her back was insane. This was followed by the bad guy heading for mexico rather than back to his ranch and his 20 loyal henchmen.
B000LXHK22|3.0|This movie is a great chickflick. I purchased it for my daughter who is 16 and likes Russell Crowe.I liked it as well. Wonderful scenery of the Provence, makes you hungry for French summers and great food and wine as well as the Southern European way of life. Have fun watching   Ruth :-)
B0019M06JS|4.0|Eliane Elias is my favorite jazz artist, but I almost did not buy this CD.  Although \\"The Girl from Ipanema,\\" \\"Chega de Saudade,\\" and \\"Desafinado\\" are all classics, I have been there enough times, including with her.   Also, she offered no original compositions.  Still, aside from Stevie Wonder's \\"Superwoman,\\" the rest of the music was unfamiliar to me, including four other Brazilian numbers, and I decided to check it out.    As in some of Eliane's other recent CDs, there is orchestral backing, here on half of the tracks, including \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" and \\"Desafinado.\\"  The orchestral sweeps combined with other good musicianship make \\"Girl\\" one of the best versions I have heard; Eliane, with her richer, warmer voice, sings it better than Astrud Gilberto.  Both \\"Desafinado\\" and \\"Chega de Saudade\\" are also performed nicely.  But the best track is \\"Estate,\\" of Martino and Brighetti, two Italian Brunos.  It has a gorgeous texture complemented by Toots Thielemans' soul-searching harmonica (Toots also toots his horn a la Stevie in \\"Superwoman\\").  \\"Estate\\" would have fit into the texture of Eliane's CD \\"Dreamer\\" and been the stickout there as well.    For the rest, things are not quite so great.  As always, Elaine's singing and technical proficiency on the piano do not slip from the mark.  However, the inclusion of five old-line popular American songs (from George Gershwin, Johnny Mercer, and some lesser known folks) brings into question the validity of the CD's title, \\"Bossa Nova Stories.\\"  I am aware that this sort of music contributed to the development of bossa nova.  However, I desire original and modern, sultry and exotic, from Eliane, in contrast to the \\"happy\\" but plain older-line songs.  Granted \\"Dreamer\\" had some popular stuff, but the U.S. material was prettier and more crisp \\"pop\\" than old-line \\"popular.\\"  Helped by good production work, it fit into \\"Dreamer.\\"  The popular sound here calls for a title change, even with some aspects of bossa nova rhythm infused into it.      Still, there are other good moments, most notably the speed-up in pace of Joao Donato's \\"Minha Saudade\\" and \\"A Ra.\\"  Eliane's straight-ahead piano magicianship and the bright beat of the Brazilian rhythm keep things interesting,  yes...exotic.  \\"Estate\\" and the other strong material make this a CD worth having, and those whose tastes are so suited will enjoy the U.S. popular material as well.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|The saccharine flows a bit too thickly here. It's not enough to have a huge ensemble of couples all rushing toward the inevitable happy endings. The director has to mix in Christmas schmaltz on top of it all. Beware. Only for the rose-colored glasses set.
B001HN6972|4.0|I read [[ASIN:0307454894 The Reader]] about two years before seeing the movie and I was deeply moved by the book. I was glad that it was being turned into a film. A film can never compare to the book but, this is a film that does the book justice. It enhances it as it gives the story further life and still remains faithful to the novel.<br /><br />Michael, a 15 year old boy, has an affair with an older woman, Hanna, in post-Nazi Germany. One day she just disappears. Later, as a young law student, Michael enrolls in a seminar and attends the trial of SS women guards. There he finds Hanna, who is on trial for her role as a guard for the SS and he holds the key to a secret that could help her case. Will he help her or just stand by (like the generations before him)?<br /><br />The book deals a lot with the idea of German guilt and the resentment of the post-Nazi generation towards their parent's generation who they view as conscious accomplices of the Nazi regime. The movie does as well, but the movie also focuses on the idea of morality and law and their differences. It also deals with the idea of standing by while wrongs are being committed. The film also explores the relationship of Michael and Hanna as it morphed through the years. These two people needed each other but dare not be open with each other.<br /><br />The film is not really about the Holocaust, it is about the aftermath, about these two characters who have become isolated from the world and each other. Ebert said it best: \\"The enormity of her sin far outweighs his, but they are both guilty of allowing harm because they reject the choice to do good.\\" The film and the performances by Winslet and Kross were gripping. It was a moving and excellent film.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is a really good movie that keeps your blood pumping.  The blu-ray version looks amazing!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|\\"Let the Right one in\\" is a vampire movie that takes the idea of vampires seriously. Oskar is a 12-year old lonely boy; he is bullied in school, his parents are broken up and seems to have no friends. Oskar carries around a knife and he fantasizes of using it and taking revenge on his bullies. Then, he meets Eli, a girl that just moved to his apartment complex. Eli is special: she walks barefoot in the snow, doesn't wear a jacket and smells funny. She also has been 12 for a long time and only comes out at night. She is also capable of great violence to satisfy her hunger. Despite these things, Oskar moves past her strange qualities and they become friends. They become each other's life lines and feed the hungry loneliness that surrounds them.<br /><br />Eli is protective of Oskar and although at one point Oskar is upset about her nature, their friendship is strengthened by each passing moment. The movie is really good. It is dark, gothic, raw and at times disturbing but, it also has humor and tender moments. The nature of Eli's vampirism is somewhat explored but the main theme is that of loneliness and how Oskar and Eli complement each other. The film is beautifully shot and the end result is a great, poetic and amazing scene.

0312370849|4.0|For a first-time novelist, Tatiana de Rosnay really has the goods. SARAH'S KEY is extremely well-written and engaging, shedding light on a little-known aspect of the Holocaust. The story is told in alternating chapters, switching back and forth between a present-day American magazine Writer (Stuck in Paris with her jerk of a Husband....) and Paris in 1942, where young Sarah Starzynski is about to grow up in a hurry.....     The book, as I said, is extremely well-done, but I found the flashback sequences to be much more interesting than the scenes set in the present-day, and when the flashbacks end, so did much of my interest in the book. I just wasn't as taken with the modern characters.....That said, SARAH'S KEY is one hell of a good read (I finished it in a little over one day, so you KNOW that I really enjoyed it!), and I have no problem recommending it.

B001GKYBXA|1.0|I realize there are millions of people out there who will purchase the great Paul McCartney's material, even if it was 45 minutes of the man's recorded snoring.  After all, it's Paul---greatest living songwriter, former Beatle.  But please---come on.  We should hold the man to a higher standard than this.  This stuff is just awful.  Virtually unlistenable, at least in my opinion.  Of course Paul is laughing all the way to the bank.    Want a decent, recent release by a former Beatle that is pretty good?  Get Ringo's \\"Liverpool 8\\".  At least Mr. Starkey is having fun, and releasing music you can actually listen to and sing along with.    And that's my Electric Argument.

B000O76T8Q|1.0|This is infuriating:    There are how many -- a half dozen -- \\"different\\" editions of \\"Abyss\\"?  Several are single-disk, and several are double-disk.    But no matter which of the many one looks at, one finds the exact same reviews on all of them: single-disk, double-disk -- no difference.     So how is one to determine which will meet one's needs, thus which to buy, if there is no information provided that would help one do so?     One fact is certain: until Amazon gets its act together -- keep the reviews for separate versions and \\"editions\\" separate -- there will be instances, as with this one, that I won't buy that which is immersed in a swamp of unnecessary confusion.

B001I82RVS|5.0|most of the time, gore alone does not make a movie's atmosphere.  i'd rather re-watch alfred hitchcock's 'psycho' for the zillionth time than endure the latest 'my bloody friday the hostel chainsaw massacre' sequel. or remake. or relaunch.  or re-imagining, or whatever synonym for \\"same old s***\\" is in vogue this week.    that being said, some of my favorite films are EXTREMELY graphic and bloody, and manage to do so while adding to the genre as a whole and NOT sacrificing either intelligence or creativity for the sake of another few gallons of red-dyed karo syrup.  the japanese, for some reason, are more likely to 'get horror right' these days than the americans are, and the two movies mentioned in this review's title are prime examples.    miike's 'ichi' and tsukamoto's 'tetsuo' represent evolutionary leaps forward within this rarefied genre, and each launched its director's career (or at least brought them a certain level of fame/notoriety).    'tokyo gore police' is another such film.     comparisons fail me, as watching t.g.p. is such an over-the-top experience: i preferred it to 'machine girl,' 'meatball machine' and all of the other recent japanese gore offerings; i also thought it left the much-hyped 'poultrygeist' (by us-based troma films) in the dust.     there's little else i can add to what others have written about this movie without either repeating them or giving away one \\"did you see THAT?!\\" moment or another; let's just say that this dvd holds a place of honor in my collection right next to 'ichi' and 'tetsuo.'      if you appreciate this kind of movie like i do, that should come as the highest praise.  go buy it; go buy it NOW!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I did this dvd for the first time this morning and all I have to say is WOW! I did the level one, and it is great! I looked through the entire dvd last night and was impressed by what I saw. I have been in and out of the gym for years, and the most specialized training I got was with a trainer whose workout was almost exactly like Jillians and I lost about 15 lbs! What most people have to understand is that you have to eat right and I would say do some straight cardio on alternate days.    Jillian is a great trainer, she is straightforward and simple. This workout works! I was dripping with sweat and my legs wobbly afterwards!:)  I use 3lb weights which give just enough resistance for level 1, hopefully I will move up to 5lbs in about a month!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I loved this series when it was on TV (Through DishNetwork). I received it in high definition and was enthralled with the beauty, clarity and WOW! of much of the content. Often, I was saying \\"How in the world did they get this shot?\\". This is why I got the series on BluRay. The BluRay disks have even better clarity and color than the broadcast version.  I have shown it to a few people and they have had the same entranced reaction to it that I did. For any one that loves nature pieces (even some that haven't enjoyed them to this point) this is a must have.

The partnership of Madonna and William Orbit produced a unique sound that dominated the sound of popular music at the end of the 90's.<br />The extra track, \\"Has To Be,\\" on the Japanese album is good, but probably not worth paying more than double the price of the US release for just one track.

B001KL3GWM|4.0|I had been waiting for this album to come out for a long time, hoping that it would be worth my anticipation. It has certainly lived up to my expectations. You can definitely tell that this was an attempt by DTB to reach more of a mainstream audience, and is almost exclusively a blues/blues-rock album.  I am partly disappointed about that, however, being a long-time fan a DTB for its style in mixing jazz, jazz-fusion, blues, soul and world music.  That fusion aspect of the band is certainly lost in the record. That was most likely by design.  Having said that, I think, for what the album is, is very good.  A few of the songs do verge on boring, I feel.  \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\" and \\"I Know\\" are easily my favorite songs on the record, already being partial to them because I had heard DTB play them in concert already.  Also I think that the addition of Susan Tedeschi and Doyle Bramhall II on a few of the tunes adds a certain dimension to the record.  As most may know, this album was recorded in Derek's home-built studio, and I think that home-grown aspect of it really shines through when you listen to the record.  You can tell that everyone was very comfortable when they were recording, because you just get a vibe of relaxation.  Derek's miraculous guitar playing is another common denominator in this equation. It really ties together the record and has a certain brightness to it that is exclusive to this album of DTB's.  Great!
0802714544|4.0|I'm not sure why I never read this cold war classic, but until recently I hadn't.  It's a very good novel, with a refreshing economy to it.  At just over 200 pages it tells the story of a British spy who agrees to one final mission behind the Iron Curtain before he retires and `comes in from the cold'.  As one might expect of the genre, not everything is as it seems.  This is not a novel filled with explosions, high speed chases and witty exchanges.  This is espionage of the cerebral variety, where all the players are making moves and anticipating counter-moves at every turn. The spy game is completely convincing and the characters are fully realized, flawed human beings.  Le Carre gives us a hero who is pragmatic, tired, and bitter.  A far cry from the superficial slickness of James Bond and Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a smart novel with an uncompromisingly brutal ending that will resonate with the reader.  This is undeniably a benchmark in the spy fiction genre.  Highly recommended.
B001LRJH0K|4.0|Being raised on the Western/War genre in a family whose Dad didn't  get to sleep without seeing one on TV, it was fun to see films like \\"3:10 To Yuma\\", and now \\"Appaloosa.\\"  I am a big fan of Viggo, and he again is connected to his role as if he WAS \\"Hitch.\\" I have a problem with actors directing themself...its a quirk of mine, but Ed was good.  The action is worthy of the \\"oater\\" label and there is relativly little offensive language which; in itself is a miracle.  It is a fine film of fun and suspense, \\"shoot 'em up!\\"  It DID NOT end as I was assuming it would, which always makes me want to see it over and over. The BluRay is exquisite.  My kids loved it too.  Oh yes, a great film to see quality of attention to the period and re-creating it for the audience.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|I realize that many Trekkers and casual fans don't care for Enterprise and I readily admit it wasn't great but I do by and large like it.  I always felt it had the right \\"feel\\".      I've been a Trek fan since the mid-1970's, watching reruns of TOS and while I liked Next Gen, I personally felt TNG was a little too liberal, too \\"pc\\" and antiseptic.  Deep Space Nine was pretty good; Voyager was my least favorite Trek series.  But DS9, Voyager and Enterprise weren't bad; they simply suffered from too much Trek.  Over-exposure.     As others have said, Enterprise and Star Trek in general, suffered from over-exposure.  Too much of a good thing is not necessarily a good thing, as we all know from life experience.      I like Enterprise's more low-key \\"look and feel\\".  A little less preachy and idealistic, such as TNG. Also, the characters in Enterprise seemed more down to earth (pardon the expression, for a space series!) and realistic instead of \\"super heroes\\".  I like the characters in Enterprise.      All in all, as you can tell, I like Enterprise.  Not great but it was alright in my book.
0439023483|5.0|One of the most fast-paced, keep you on your toes books that I have ever had the pleasure to read.

B0013LL2Z2|4.0|I remember seeing this movie with two buddies on consecutive nights back when we were teenagers, long ago in 1976.  It was the opening night debut of Logan's Run.  As I said, we went back the next day to see it again.  That's how starved we kids in the 70's (pre Star Wars) were for decent sci-fi.    I still like this movie as does my wife.  It's all very futuristic and technical and cold and sterile in the first half but the second half of the movie is quite warm and human.  A good mix; I like both parts.     If there's a message to this sci-fi flick, it's a common one but worth repeating:  An omnipresent government which does everything for you and robs initiative and individual liberty (shades of B. Hussein's socialist \\"sacrifice\\" for the good of the state?).    As Thomas Jefferson once said (I'm paraphrasing) - \\"A government large enough to give you everything is also large enough to take everything away.\\"  Words to remember.      Kudos to York, Agutter, Jordan and the rest.  Nice job.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|The movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (60th Anniversary Edition) has been beautifully done: the colors are vibrant. The performances of the stellar cast are superb. The message of the movie is lucid: your life matters!    Too often, we mortals equate life with the acquiring of material possessions. And we realize, with the gaining of possessions, that the real value of life is not to be found in possessions. To have a wonderful life is to have dynamic relationships with people - not possessions. Things can never say \\"thankyou,\\" - people can. To the degree we pour our life into other people, is the degree we will find value in life.      The greatest point of the movie is often missed: our relationships with people will only take on significance as we find a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. It is the living dynamic relationship with God that provides us a foundation upon which we can appreciate relationships with people.    The movie is not preachy!  Get it, and enjoy \\"A Wonderful Life1\\"
B001EO748M|3.0|Unquestionably the most politically influential queen consort in England's history, Anne Boleyn has had her story retold many times in film and video form, but never in the sort of detail the second season of the Showtime miniseries THE TUDORS accords. This story is so great that it's really a treat to see it detailed as closely as it is here; unfortunately, the recipe for the mini-series seems to be \\"DALLAS at the Palace,\\" so the retelling of historical events is so altered here as to be sometimes unrecognizable. The producers' bizarre decision to star tiny, tight-bodied Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the famously tall and corpulent Henry VIII makes even less sense than the previous season, particularly given Rhys-Meyers' incredibly limited acting range (he seems to be able to portray only three emotions: lustfulness, sulkiness, and fury). Shouting out a large proportion of his lines, this Henry VIII gnaws the scenery instead of a giant turkey leg, and he seems barely capable of growing a tiny dark peach-fuzz mustache and goatee. Because Rhys-Meyers is so young, the producers and directors decided to put him in as few scenes as possible with his eldest benighted daughter the Princess Mary, which is a terrible mistake since she's about the only person you can possibly feel sorry for in this version of the story.    Natalie Dormer fares much better than her co-star as his doomed wife, Anne Boleyn, and is genuinely beautiful and seductive; however, as with Rhys-Meyers, it's practically impossible to believe her as one of the leading intellectual lights of the English Reformation. But she is genuinely excellent in the season's fine final episode, where the condemned Anne is purified beyond fear and finally accepts her fate with the grace and dignity becoming a queen. Even better is Maria Doyle Kennedy, who does not have enough to do as the rejected Katharine of Aragon except pine and look unhappy. Most of the actors seem to have been chosen for their beautiful bodies; you will never see so many washboard abs in a gym as you do at this Tudor court. The costumes, as always, are beyond sumptuous, as are the lovely matte paintings of the royal palaces and London.

B0011NVC98|3.0|There is a feast going on in 6th century Denmark. King Hrothgar speaks to his thanes and throws coins to his men to celebrate the victory and share the loot. Suddenly a wind blows out the lights. A monster invades the room to attack and kill the warriors. \\"What was that?\\" \\"Grendel.\\" How can they rid themselves of this monster? A ship lands on the shore. Beowulf and his men have come to kill the monster. Others have tried and failed. The king offers a gold horn as a reward for killing Grendel.    There is a knock at the door. Grendel bursts in and begins to kill the warriors. Beowulf finds a weak spot, then tears off an arm. Is this the end of Grendel? The fallen warriors are put in a barge and pushed out to sea. But Grendel's mother takes her revenge on the men. Beowulf is given an ancestral sword to slay the monster. The glow of the gold horn lights the way. What does Grendel's mother offer to Beowulf? Beowulf returns without the sword and the gold horn. King Hrothgar declares Beowulf to be his heir. Time passes, Beowulf wins battles but ages. One day the lost gold horn is found in an unholy place. What does it mean?    Then a dragon attacks a village and burns it. Beowulf and his warriors must defend the land. Beowulf goes to the dragon's lair. [The CGI special effects are amazing.] Beowulf kills the dragon in a spectacular fight. But he too is killed in the fight and is buried in a blazing longboat. What will happen to his successor?    I don't know how closely this story follows the saga from the Dark Ages. Often the book is better than the film. Given that the economy then depended on subsistence agriculture, where did the gold and iron for weapons come from? \\"The persons and events in this motion picture are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons or events is unintentional.\\" Just so you know.
B0013ND30M|5.0|It was a gift for my niece. She loved it. It was she wanted for Christmas.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This is the best so far in the Batman franchise. Excellent movie. One of Heath Ledger's best..may he rest in peace.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|You'll wonder why you spent so much money on speakers, once you've listened through these headphones.  I bought them to plug in to a Yamaha keyboard so that I could practice without provoking the household.  The sound through the headphones is shockingly good!  The nuances that you hear though these were not heard through the keyboards built in speakers.  Before buying these, I had never heard the \\"digital\\" reproduction of the vibration of the piano strings when the keys are played hard.  Simply amazing.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|It is a great movie.  I was very pleased with your service.  I received the movie on time as promised.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|I only recently discovered Edguy and am very impressed with their ability to shift from pure power music to enjoyable ballads. I wasn't sure what a solo effort from front man Tobias Sammett would be like. This CD rocks and uses several talented and recognizable vocalists to enhance the overall enjoyment of the music. The title song alone is worth the price. Jorn Lande sings with Tobias on several songs and his deep powerful voice adds a great dimension to an otherwise excellent CD.  Everyone that I've played this for loved it. I find myself listening to this CD more than any other recent purchases. Outstanding power metal with a couple of well written ballads. Highly recommended !!!
B001NXBRJG|5.0|I really love this movie.  Great concept and great innovation in the process of shooting the film from a technical perspective.    I do have to wonder WHY \\"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\\" is NOW available but \\"The Matrix\\" individual film is not out currently.  I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that the second and third movies were crap!  I was really disappointed with the sequels.    I believe the only reason that \\"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\\" is out first is that is the only way they would sell the second and third movie.    I just want the original...
0066620996|5.0|LOVE this book! I cant stop recommending it. This book helps to recallibrate your thinking in the business world. The standard school of thought can almost be thrown out as the author takes you through piles of data and research to then draw a logical conclusion on how to move from good to great. These concepts are not isolated to the business world either. There are many pearls that transfer over into relationships, personal growth and development. Enjoy!
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and loved it.  walked out feeling so up beat and decided to add it to my movie collection so I have it to play when ever things start to get me down.  Meryl is wonderful and the young women who plays her daughter can really belt out those songs.    Never much of an ABBA fan but the music works perfect with this show.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Everything worked without a hitch.  The DVD arrived in a timely manner and in new condition.
B001J53X9U|5.0|The dark knight limited edition with the batpod makes the  perfect gift for any body who just loved seeing the movie but also having all the extras that comes with it in the blu-ray format which makes the quality of picture and sound just perfect.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This DVD was great to watch.  I loved the special features as well.  Only problem was that I thought I ordered the Blu-Ray version, not the DVD.  Oh well, the up-converter did a pretty good job anyway.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I loved Dr. Horrible when I saw it online.  I had no idea that NPH could sing, but he is wonderful!  The storyline is simple but so very Joss.  When I saw it was being released to dvd I had to get it.  The commentary on the dvd is great but the musical commentary had me rolling!  I highly recommend this dvd, as it ads more to the already great sing-a-long blog!
B00005LK94|5.0|This film is so magnificent and beautiful, I don't know where to start. Fly Away Home is filled with love, hope, and paints a picture of utter simplicity--if you open your heart to care about all living things, It gives your life a purpose and direction--miracles happen. with love, all things are possible, and this is a true and inspiring story of the power of love and a dream. This story has really touched me, and my mom too. The Father-Daughter connection is so beautiful, I know that that honesty and freedom....is a gift.The father is so loving, and he really loves his daughter--together, they fly away home, and do the impossible: Flying with the 13 geese to a safe habitat. What I like best is that this is a true story--I think that the message of living in the passion of life, trying with all your heart, and believing in your dream, wearing your heart on your sleeve--is truly timeless. anything is possible with love, and only love can accomplish what some see as impossible. The connection between the girl and her dad, and how much she wants to see them fly home--Inspiring, uplifting, and gave me a lot of hope, to dare to dream.
B0010ZR160|5.0|I'll join the applause for this Affleck, Freeman, Harris vehicle. The drug addled mum of the kidnapped girl also gives a stunning performance.The twists and turns were enthralling enough right through to the vulnerability of the head cop. I've watched it a few times and still have trouble with the diction though; not attuned enough to catch all of Affleck's murmuring, and right off the map with the drawl of the head gangster(but the intentions are manifest). The cinematography and camera work are first rate. The sets and dirty realism, totally commanding. The choices each protaganist makes throughout is the nub of the investigation, and the one Affleck has to make at the end may cost him his closest ally. Yes, together with the Robert Ford outing, Affleck has made a big statement in my head these past 12 months and is one to watch for. The film is an excellent accompaniment to,'Mystic River', written by the same author.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Ok first off as bad as it may be I never write reviews on products so the fact that I am writing a review is a testament to how much this workout video meant to me. All of my life off and on I would get into a workout routine and then fall behind and then start again etc.  I have done dvds from yoga, pilates and taebo and NEVER felt as good as I do after one of Jillian's workouts. I also own her boxed set of \\"the biggest winner\\" dvds (which I highly recommend as well). I often read about working out and the most effective ways to lose weight/exercise and all the stuff I read about Jillian does and recommends so I really feel like she is really good and knowledgable at what she does. I will never do another dvd that does not have her on it. I highly recommend all her products! In a world where laziness and instant gratification rule, she makes you get to work to earn your reward and you are the better for having done it. :)
B001M5UDGS|5.0|When I first saw this for sale on Amazon, I said to myself \\"What the **** is that?\\"  A quick trip to YouTube brought up the videos and I was pulled in and hooked.<br /><br />It was so bad it was great!  I have \\"Freeze Ray\\" going through my head as I write this.  Watching was a lot of fun and brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible has the irrational exuberance of \\"Rent\\", mixed with the fantasy of \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" washed down with the camp silliness of \\"Urinetown: The Musical\\". If you have ever heard Steve Martin's version of the Beatle's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" from the 1978 Sgt. Pepper's movie, then you get the idea.<br /><br />I loved it!  With the economy the way it is, we all need a little levity.<br /><br />Watch it on YouTube or Hulu before you buy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
1405500662|5.0|TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE by Mitch Albom is a short, inspirational book based on Albom's interviews with Morris \\"Morrie\\" Schwartz, a Brandeis University sociology professor who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease).  Albom was Schwartz's student in the 1970s; he later lost track of his teacher, whom he had called \\"Coach,\\" while successfully pursuing a sportscasting career.  After seeing Schwartz interviewed on \\"Nightline,\\" Albom reconnected with his \\"Coach,\\" and began a series of weekly visits that Albom describes as his final class with Schwartz, and which produced this book, his \\"final thesis.\\"<br /><br />Books that attempt to convey the meaning of life usually express simple truths, e.g., that love is key to everything.  Most or at least many people learn these truths growing up, but as we mature and lose our innocence, we tend to push these truths to the back of our minds until, if it happens at all, some force pushes them back out again.  For some people, this force is religion; for others, it's learning that one is about to die.  This book conveys the truths about life from a man--clearly a man who lived a good life--who has learned that he is going to die.<br /><br />If you want to cut to the chase, the number one truth, according to Morrie Schwartz, is that you learn to live by learning to die.  We tend to avoid thinking about dying; our mortality is one of those things we tend to push to the back of our minds, perhaps feeling that even thinking about death makes one susceptible to its inevitable pull.  But that's just it: it's an unavoidable part of nature.  We free ourselves to live authentically by first acknowledging that we die.  Three other truths that are central to Schwartz's view of life are that you should (1) devote yourself to loving others, (2) devote yourself to your community around you, and (3) devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.<br /><br />That wasn't a spoiler.  Most all of us know that these are good things to value.  But our lives are so busy, we just don't reflect on these truths.  The purpose of this book is to make you focus on these things through another person's experience of dying.  Generally, I tend to avoid books like this, books that drip saccharine or that seem written to generate tears.  All I can say is that this book, by and large, works.<br /><br />If you obtain the audio version (the book is read by the author, who does an excellent presentation), you will get, in addition to the book, some of the original recordings made by Albom of his dialogues with his \\"Coach.\\"  These recordings are intrinsically interesting, not least because you will note that the actual dialogues sometimes differ from Albom's recounting (listen, for instance, to the recording in which the Lou Gehrig speech comes up).  Was Albom embellishing?  Simply recollecting the story differently from what actually happened?  Although it doesn't bear directly on the truth of the book, the mostly minor disparities between Albom's accounts and the recordings of the discussions provide food for thought on the topics of memory and literary suasion.are good things to value.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|DVD arrived in record time, even though it was very close to Christmas.  It was packed well and arrived safely.  Even though I wasn't able to easily locate the exact DVD in stores, it was readily available on Amazon.com.  I was very pleased with every aspect of this transaction.
0743298039|5.0|The pacing of this book was perfect.  The book starts at a rather normal pace and may even feel slow to some.  However, there are hooks dropped early on that start gently tugging you further in to the story.  You can put the book down with little anxiety within the first several chapters and return to your regular life without being constantly tugged back to the book (at least I could!).  Then in the middle of the book, the tugging gets stronger.  You can still put the book down, but it is harder.  Pushing the story from your mind becomes more difficult as the mystery becomes more and more intriguing.  In the final third of the book, be prepared to be glued to the story until all of the mysteries are unfolded and all of the secrets are bared.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  The characters were wonderful and the ending was entirely satisfying.
031606792X|5.0|This was by far my favorite book of the series. It truly is a modern fairy tale ending; a happily ever after.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|The 6 disc set truly only has 4 with  episodes for the OBVIOUS reason.. THE WRITER\\"S STRIKE. !!!    That said, how those writers jammed so  much into the fewer hours  is reflected in  quick  well tied details. Worth watching with subtitles not to miss  anything.  The added bonus  commentaries vary but do fill in concepts and a few  teasers for the next season.  Well worth the time to watch.
141690977X|4.0|I'm a 28 year old guy.  I'd been dating this woman for about three weeks (who by the way I was/am really into) when near the end of one of our dates I told her that she should call me sometime.  You see never once had she called me, it was always me calling her and quite frankly I was wondering if SHE was that into ME.      She gave me this... I'll call it shocked... look and point blank told me that she would not call me.  If I was interested in her I would continue to call and if not then \\"I wasn't that into her\\" and we could move on.  Haha.  Yep that's how it went down alright.  Eventually she revealed that she had come to this epiphany via Greg and Liz in the book yon review is being written for.      So thinking this behavior to be a bit odd but nevertheless being pretty interested in her I checked this book out from my local library.  Here are my thoughts.    First the Good.  Generally speaking the books advice is pretty sound.  Although I feel most of the advice is common sense, I've seen enough people mired in bad relationships to know that it's not quite so obvious to everyone.  As a guy I can attest to the fact that once we get the ball rolling (ie have exchanged numbers and started dating) if I'm really interested I'll call her and if not, well then I won't.  So Chapter Two is pretty sound.  The rest of the chapters are pretty obvious stuff to me (if he's not dating you, if he's disappeared on you, if he's having sex with someone else).  Duh.  We need a book to tell us this?    Now the bad.  The first chapter states that if he doesn't ask you out, (i.e. make the first move) he's not that into you...  sorry Greg but you're a suave, handsome, articulate player by your own admission.  Quite frankly for me (and a lot of \\"good\\" guys) approaching a woman who you're into can be pretty darn intimidating.  Now if I'm acquainted with the woman in some way it's easier but even so I wouldn't advise the ladies of the world to just sit back and wait for the men to flowin.  If you're interested in a man it won't hurt to make the first move or at least nudge him in the right direction.      I also don't agree with idea that \\"if he's not proposing within a year he's not that into you\\".  Marriage is a pretty big deal and I've seen a lot of people rush into it.  I'm not sure I'll be proposing to \\"the one\\" within a year of meeting her...       Second off, in the dating world both men and women should think about what they're bringing to the table.  Greg and Liz basically tell women that they are all 8,9 and 10s where as the men out there are on a 1-10 scale.  Ummmm... not the case.  Their message to women seems to be \\"even if you're not so attractive and could stand to lose 20 pounds and can be a b#### sometimes and once canceled a date because a better offer came up with your girlfriends, you can still expect a prince charming who conforms perfectly to Greg's ideals to ride in on his white horse...\\".  Well not so much.  My opinion is that ladies, you shouldn't put up with a jerk, but the stuff in the book is definitely a two way street.  Just keep that in mind before you \\"throw the bum out\\".      So although the cons took up two paragraphs and the pros one, I think the advice contained in the book is generally sound.  As with all advice books, read it, temper your opinion of it based on your own life experiences, and move on from there.  We humans are complex beings and no 150 page large font book will be able to give us a silver bullet answer to an issue as complex as the emotions involved with life on the dating scene.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|So its 1968 and Robert Stigwood decides that his young charges, The Bee Gees, need to make a big musical statement and the way to do it is with a double album. Heck, it worked for The Beatles, Bob Dylan; even The Mothers of Inventions debut was a double.<br />Thus \\"Odessa\\" was born.<br /><br />When originally released, it was a 2 record set in a red flocked cover (you can still find decent used copies for cheap) but unlike the previous studio albums there was more of a feel of sophistication in the music and in the songwriting. Side one begins with the line \\"14th of February 1899, the British ship Veronica disappears without a sign\\" which is a clear indicator that the album is treading into \\"conceptual\\" waters but there really is no concept per se. The concept seems to be how much more orchestration can be added to the songs. And the beautiful thing is that it works.<br /><br />This has to be the Bee Gees most varied album up to this point. With country numbers like \\"Marley Purt Drive\\" and \\"Give Your Best.\\" Conceptual pieces like the title track, straight pop like \\"Melody Fair and the orchestral interludes \\"With All Nations\\" and \\"Seven Seas Symphony the group shows just how far they have come since their debut to an international career in 1967. And all before Barry turned 21. But then this is also the album that caused Robin to leave the group and caused a schism between the Brothers Gibb that would last for 2 years<br /><br />This set is deluxe re-issue of \\"Odessa\\" spread over three CDs and contains the following:<br /><br />CD 1 contains the original stereo mix of the two record set.<br /><br />CD 2 contains the original mono mix of the album, which has its debut here in the U.S. since the album was only released in the stereo format on this side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />CD 3 is titled \\"Sketches for Odessa\\" and contains early demos, alternate mixes, un-dubbed tracks, as well as unreleased material as well as the tracks \\"Nobody's Someone\\" and \\"Pity\\" which was recorded for the album but did not make the final hurdle<br /><br />The package comes in a red flocked box (just like the original vinyl version) and contains a poster, a Bee Gees decal, and a booklet giving track-by-track annotation and session information. Unfortunately, neither Barry nor Robin was interviewed about their thoughts about the sessions, which is probably because of the growing rift between Barry and Robin at the time.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I purchased this game without knowing exactly what it is about, only knowing that I keep hearing people (game designers especially) rave about it.  Now that I have it, I can definitely say that it deserves all the praise.  This is a fantastic game.    Besides any specifics about the rules/gameplay, what impresses me the most is how well it scales to different skill levels.  For beginners or those looking for a light game to pull out at get-togethers, this game is quite fun and perfectly workable using just the rules from the first page of the manual.  The first couple times my family played it, we didn't even bother with the cards (think like playing Monopoly without the Chance cards.)    On the other hand, the game provides plenty of in-depth additional rules that can be layered on by more experienced players looking to enrich the gameplay.  This game provides plenty of room for every sort of player.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|My oldest daughter played this at a party and loved the game so we got one for her at school and then bought one for home. Everyone, adults to kids, loves to play this game. I would say it is somewhat like RISK, but a little more friendly. Watch out though, my 16 year old son wants to conquer the who kingdom!
0123694965|5.0|This is such a fantastic book, packed with wisdom, that I expect I'll be re-reading a few times in order to absorb everything.  What I especially appreciated is how the book discusses the creative process in a high level way.  While obviously all the discussions are slanted toward game design, much of the wisdom is applicable to any sort of creative endeavor, not just game design.  There are wonderful insights into how to motivate yourself, how to evolve your own ideas, and how to collaborate with others.    One warning is in order though: for the most part this book is fairly abstract.  That is, the material in the book tends toward high-level broad concepts, as opposed to tutorials on how to use any specific game development tool.  Personally I prefer that and find it much more illuminating (game design is an art not engineering,) but to anyone looking for concrete lessons on how to implement any specific technology, well this book isn't that.    To put it another way: this book is about what game design really is, not what most beginners tend to fixate on.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time, hands down. The flow and style of the album from start to finish is what many self-proclaimed great \\"The _____\\" bands wish they could produce. This album is a significant improvement on their first album.    I would highly recommend this album to any rock fan.
034547581X|5.0|If you read only one book in your life time, make it this one. I got so much out of this book. The experience was so complex. I enjoyed the story, felt guilty because it was such a sad story in places, read what great leadership is and shared that through lessons in my work place (Command and control), I laughed, shook my head and some times just felt sad. You actually 'live' this story through this book. It will leave something behind in your psyche. His second book \\"We are Soldiers still..\\" is the perfect conclusion to this powerful and enthralling book. This is a respectful, appropriate telling of a terrible battle, without glorifying War and actually teaching you something.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I can't add very much to all the other raves given to this delightful film, but I will echo what others have said -- it has it all!<br /><br />It's got romance ... adventure ... action ... special effects ... and DeNiro doing the absolutely most hilarious bit in recent movie history!<br /><br />The only small thing I could possible find fault with is simply the absence of SDHI (subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired).<br /><br />If you are hard of hearing, you can't get closed captioning on a high def tv and the regular English subtitles are those big fuzzy yellow letters that are distracting. So, you either have to strain to hear or read horrid lettering. But that is a fault in almost all newer DVDs, so it's not specific to this movie.
