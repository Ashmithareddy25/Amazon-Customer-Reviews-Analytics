B00003CWPL|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I've seen some weird stuff at 24 frames per second, everything from Dead Alive to Pi to Primer to Koyanisqatsi (or however it's spelled), Faces of Death to Dolls to Trainspotting, and I have yet to view anything so profoundly disturbing and surreal as Eraserhead.  Granted, my parents brought this movie home when I was about 8, so my perspective is a little different than most, I think.  In fact, this movie probably traumatized me for some time, and I know I'll never watch it again.  I remember running out of the room the second time my stepdad put it in the VCR, and closing the door and putting my head under the pillow, and STILL being able to hear the soundtrack.  I had nightmares for weeks about the horrible little screaming baby and eraser-heads.  Over 20 years later and it still creeps me out.  I love Dune and Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet and Lost Highway, but this one will always be too much for me.  I'm sure it's a brilliant film (for grownups anyway), but I'll never believe it's funny.
B0000E6XKF|5.0|I have seen many amazing performances in my lifetime - including other RHCP - and from some of the other greatest bands in the world.  But, the performance by John, Flea, Chad, and Anthony (in no particular order, except I am a guitar player) is what musicians in every genre of music strive for - harmonic perfection.  It touches your soul to see this concert.  All of these grown men have endured tragedy, addiction, pain, and suffering, which only made them stronger.  Their music is out of love - it is the bond that makes them all incredible parts of a majestic whole.  Close your eyes and simply listen and feel the music first - and then open them and watch the visual, which only adds another layer to what has already touched you.  This 'band' is held together by something far greater than a recording deal or f*$king reality TV show - it is the bond of human compassion, mutual respect, and brotherly love. In their music, it is a harmonic convergence - resonating at a frequency that only our inner souls can connect to, not our conscious self.  I cannot describe in simple words what this music has done for myself and my family - it is simply and truly magical.  My beautiful 2 year-old son (the smallest, yet biggest RHCP fan) falls asleep to it in my wife's or my arms every night...and will not accept anything else.   <br /> <br />On a personal note, thank you for choosing to live John - your soul was destined to rise again and grow from your pain and touch others at the depths that they cannot understand.  We are all blessed to hear your beautiful energy through each note you play... <br /> <br />To all of the RHCPs - shine on, and thank you so, so much...
0300108834|5.0|I actually bought the audio version and listened to it on a two-day drive.  I was riveted to my book.  The miles just slipped past me as the beautiful simplicity of Gombrich's writing took me on a glorious tour of our world.  For the first time in my life, World History was One Story, not a series of many stories. <br /> <br />I plan on using the audio version of this book as a supplement to my World History curriculum this fall.  I plan to purchase the printed version so I can find associated clip art and media to show the kids as they listen to excerpts from the chapters. <br /> <br />My nine-year-old son and my Engineer husband both love this book, too. <br />
B00005JO20|2.0|The movie director in the movie had two facial expressions . . . and neither fit the movie. His acting is incredibly bad. Naomi's acting is OK, and she can be pretty when the lighting is just right. But as an actress, she should be limited to small parts doing pub scenes. The way she wins the monkey's heart is absolutely absurd. Don't get this movie to see attractive people; there aren't any in it. There are maybe two or three extras that are passable, but that's it. The movie is way, way too long (about 3 hours), and uses the cinematic style used in \\"Lord of Ring.\\" It doesn't work here. There are lots of slow-mo shots, but not one of them works. They could've shortened the movie by a half-hour by taking the slow-mo shots out. The movie is in sepia, which appropriately rhymes with insipid, which can be applied to about 90% of this movie. The computer-animated creatures are computer-game quality. At least the ones I saw were bad. I kept fast forwarding the DVD to bypass the bad stuff, which was a waste of time because the whole movie is bad. Get a \\"Jurasic Park\\" movie or the Kong flick with Jeff Bridges.

B00007KWHN|5.0|The year is 1971, and Atlantic records has reached a critical, if unspoken, decision in regards to the promising British band Yes: If the band's third studio attempt follows in the wake of the past two, then the label has no choice but to drop the band.  This sort of ultimatum abounds often in the music business, as bands fail initially to meet sales expectations.  It happened with Kansas after their third album, 'Masque' (1975), much in the same way it happened with Yes earlier in the 1970s.    Luckily, neither band surrendered to the tremendous pressure generated by their precarious contract positions, and both bands produced successful albums when it really counted.    What follows is a description of Yes' triumph, 'The Yes Album.'    Something clicked in the group between the previous 'Time and a Word' release and this one.  That something, many believe, was the exodus of Peter Banks and the inauguration of supreme guitar talent Steve Howe.  The lineup, then, stood as follows: Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and Chris Squire on bass, with Howe and Squire contributing their backup vocals where needed.  Howe brought to the table something the band sorely lacked: a lead guitarist.  Banks was decent at what he did, but he was not strong enough by any means to carry the band.  Steve Howe, however, was a master of his instrument, and it really shows on this album--previously almost unheard, the guitar takes the center stage as the solo instrument par excellence on 'The Yes Album.'    On top of his game also was every other member of the band.  Tony Kaye, while never even close to Rick Wakeman (who would succeed Kaye on the following year's 'Fragile' release), evolved into something of a competent keyboardist on this album.  At very least he left behind the cheesy, dated, '60s style organ registrations in favor of the timeless, distorted Hammond sound that defines classic and progressive rock.  Bill Bruford stopped playing like a typical, generic drummer, and began asserting himself for the truly innovative magician he is.  Chris Squire finally dropped once and for all the psychedelic wah-wah effect, turned up the treble on his Rickenbacker, and what do you know: The celebrated, trademark Squire bass sound was born.  And Jon Anderson sang better than ever, both clearer and with greater tonal accuracy.  Also, and perhaps most prudently, Anderson made the transition from writing pedestrian lyrics to painting images with words and poetry, while relying on the music itself to complete the pieces and affect the flow.  This high-brow, esoteric lyrical content--the meaning of which is completed by the instrumentation--is one of the defining qualities of Yes, and is one of the many reasons why Yes is both a musicians' and an intellectuals' band.    That having been said, the \\"sixth member\\" of the band, producer Eddie Offord, really saved the day on this album.  He sculpted what we now identify as the \\"Yes sound,\\" that extremely clean and precise timbre that is unique to the band.  Everything that needed to be warm and analog (Steve Howe's guitar and Jon Anderson's vocals, for example) is presented richly, and everything that needed to be well-defined (Bill Bruford's drums and Chris Squire's bass) stands out in the mix.  And everything that was there just for accompaniment (sorry, Tony) was parried into the mix nicely, where it is neither swallowed nor oppressive.    The music on this release is a departure from anything the band had ever attempted before it.  Gone is any shred of the Beatles, bereft is the album of any covers, and we can all fondly say goodbye to the awkward arrangements and poor final production that plagued the previous releases.  This album sets the stage for the prolific and magnificent work the band would produce through and including the 1977 'Going for the One' release.  On 'The Yes Album,' the band had finally found its core sound and its comfort zone.  'The Yes Album' is dominated by four long epic suites, which are all structured in a similar manner.  And yet, within each distinct work, there is myriad experimentation and instrumental musing.  However, there is an underlying structure that keeps the work from passing beyond the realm of interest.  The two shorter works, including a showcase by Steve Howe, serve as intermissions in a sense between the larger, grander works.    Now for a detailed description of each track:    1. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" - Right from the onset, with the bass/drum pattern, one knows he or she is hearing something grand and spectacular.  This pattern is repeated twice, and then the distorted Hammond organ overlays this bass/drum pattern as it perpetuates and modulates keys.  Enter Steve Howe, with his trademark guitar, which those listening to the album in 1971 heard for the first time.  He plays a virtuosic passage right over this growing bed of instrumentation, and in that instant a band is born.    The piece meanders gloriously through numerous vocal and instrumental escapades, never waning in interest or intensity.  There are quiet passages, long solo passages, and intense, layered vocal passages.  The lyrics seem to mean very little, even after one listens to the song many times, but there we have the magic of Yes: The lyrics don't have to mean anything at all, so long as the bond between them and the music remains sound.  And Jon Anderson was a master of engineering this bond, and the results are positively beautiful.  Ladies and gentlemen, this music is the definition of progressive rock: It transcends the here and now and the mundane, and transports the listener to a world where the rules don't always apply, and where all that matters is the music.    2. \\"Clap\\" (NOT \\"The Clap\\") - This is Steve Howe's showcase tune.  It's a live track, recorded in a very warm-sounding and reverberant location.  I am not a guitarist, and by virtue, I tend to become bored with these sorts ofthings.  It is the same with \\"Mood for a Day\\" on the next release, 'Fragile.'  It is such that I am not qualified to really evaluate this song musically, though of course in the technical sense it is dazzling.  Steve Howe, in my opinion, is one of the two greatest guitarists in the history of the art.  Therefore, he has every right to be rather annoyed that people keep calling his song \\"The Clap\\" (even the record producers!).    3. \\"Starship Trooper\\" - This song is structured a little differently from the first epic.  This piece comes in three distinct movements, \\"Life Seeker,\\" \\"Disillusion,\\" and \\"Wurm\\" (Wurm is a glacial valley in Europe and might be the genesis of the name of this movement, the instrumentation of which indeed conjures images of fjords and such).  The tale is again told through cryptic poetry bound to its music, and the first movement is anchored by Squire's trademark bass and Howe's indispensable electric guitar.  The second movement begins abruptly with Howe's frantic acoustic guitar strumming and a different vocal melody.  An innovative bridge returns to the first theme before the final movement, an instrumental, begins.  This movement gains in intensity before a truly phenomenal, forward-miced Howe solo rips into the open musical space and crowns the fadeout.    4. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" - This is the infamous single from the album, and behind \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Roundabout,\\" it is probably Yes's most well-known song.  A double-movement work, the song begins with the skeletal sounding \\"Your Move,\\" possessed of an insistent thumping double-strummed bass note, anchored by the bass drum.  The heavy vocal harmonies that begin this piece are a capella, and the instrumentation is mostly acoustic (there are even recorders).  Just before the climax of this movement, Tony Kaye plays what is probably the most significant passage of his entire career with the band when his massive, distorted Hammond enters perfectly on cue to produce a positively gravitational effect.  At the end of this sequence, there is a swell on the organ until it seems as though one's head might explode, and then a ringing silence.  Then begins the second movement, an energetic rocker called \\"All Good People.\\"  The same words, \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way,\\" are repeated over and over again, the music building in intensity, until the final fadeout, where the band--complimented by that blasting organ--sings the phrase in a continually descending tonality each time until the fadeout is complete.    Despite this rather orgasmic description of the song, of the four epics on this album, this one is my least favorite.  I will always remember it affectionately as the first Yes song I ever heard and wanted to own, and that is perhaps why I don't like it so well as I did in the past: I believe I am simply tired of it.  And of the four epic tracks, this is the only one you will ever hear on the radio anymore.  And so progressive rock dies a little more by the hands of the media conglomerate who have, since about 1974, acted in concert to achieve just that end: the death of progressive rock.    They will never succeed.    5. \\"A Venture\\" - This is the second shorter track from the album, and another I am not really qualified to describe.  It could be because I really don't like it very much that I am unable to comment.  Certainly this would contribute to an explanation for why I don't even remember how it goes, only that I never liked it.  I vaguely remember that it had a pastoral feel and that it was piano-dominated.  Kaye actually wasn't a bad keyboardist overall, and in any band other than Yes he would have seemed very good.  When among giants, however, a mere mortal--no matter how tall--just doesn't measure up.  A good effort, nonetheless, on a rather substandard song.    6. \\"Perpetual Change\\" - This is the sixth and final epic on the original album.  It basically follows the same formas the others, and includes many of the same elements that make the other three great.  The beginning is a very intense introduction, akin to the one on the later \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on `Fragile.'  Then, in an almost jazzy fashion, the actual sung part of the song begins very softly, building gradually to the words \\"perpetual change.\\"  This pattern repeats several times throughout the song, and then a completely new section (the chorus) begins, with Jon Anderson singing up in the stratosphere as he usually does, the melody triumphant and uplifting.  After this sequence from the first theme to the chorus is repeated twice, a totally new section begins in stark juxtaposition.  This section, an instrumental, makes use of some advanced panning and other studio trickery, and it brilliantly weaves themes from the entire song together.  A return to the pattern from before, and then a unique fadeout sequence complete this piece, a very strong finish to a very strong album.    The bonus tracks don't really add very much, but contrary to the bloody murder some reviewers are screaming, they don't take away from the album, either.  After all, compact disc players all have a wonderful little button called \\"Stop.\\"  Perhaps this review will enlighten some of those other reviewers, who seem not to have discovered this revolutionary advance in consumer control on their disc players.    This particular edition of the album (the 2003 Rhino release with bonus tracks) enjoys a negligible increase in sound quality over the 1994 Atlantic/Joe Gastwirt remaster.  Basically, after the fashion of all modern remastering, the volume level has been maximized.  Overall, the tracks are more consistently mixed than on the 1994 release, and of course there are bonus tracks.  My inclination is, if you have the Atlantic release and don't particularly care about the bonus tracks, it's up to you if you want to upgrade or not.  I can't make a definite argument one way or the other.  Generally maximized volume output is always a good thing (try hearing the 1994 release on a boom box in a noisy room somewhere and you'll see what I mean), and especially if you're buying the album for the first time, don't hesitate to get the 2003 Rhino release.  But if the volume output is not a concern of yours, then it is entirely up to you whether or not an upgrade is a good idea.    Overall, this is where I would recommend new Yes fans to start with the band.  Everything you need to get a solid impression of what the band was all about is right here.  And yet, this album doesn't have training wheels; there's nothing less impressive about this album then, say, `Fragile' or `Close to the Edge' (all right, nothing really compares to `Close,' but that's a given).  Basically, this album is the most accessible of the first three classic Yes albums, and it's where the band really found its characteristic sound.  It's always a good idea to start at the beginning, so I would start with `The Yes Album,' then go from there.  And, on a broader scale, I would recommend this album to just about anyone in the world, really.  There are some things that were just destined to be classics.  `The Yes Album' is one of them.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This movie is by far the BEST movie I have ever seen.  It is so ingeniously flawless.  I have watched this movie like a million times (no exageration) and it never gets old.  I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.  Now, it is weird, but like the most awesome weird you will ever get in a movie.   <br /> <br />If you love Donnie Darko, I recommend (for the horror buff): BloodRayne, Hostel, High Tension, Audition, anything Indie or old school.  I also recommend Almost Famous, which is really cool for a rock and roll fan. <br /> <br />Well, I'm off.  Happy movie watching.
B000005IU1|5.0|Rock and roll just doesn't get any more REAL than the Stooges.  For coping with life in a world that just plain drives you crazy, the Stooges provide the antidote.    With this 1969 debut album, the Stooges took such obvious influences as the Doors, Velvet Underground, and the Rolling Stones, and kicked things up a notch or three.  Iggy Pop's primal, on-the-edge vocals are still a wonder to behold; ditto for Ron Asheton's blazing guitarwork and Scott Asheton's pounding drumming.    There's been some debate as to whether or not John Cale (formerly of Velvet Underground, of course) was really the right person to have in the producer's chair for this album.  In retrospect, the totally unhinged power and fury of \\"Fun House\\" does make \\"The Stooges\\" sound a bit tame and \\"late '60s\\"-ish (for lack of a better term) by comparison.  But I think Cale deserves some credit for providing engaging embellishments to the almost exclusively guitar-bass-drums musical backing.  Notice the sleigh bells and pecking piano on \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\".  And of course, there's the infamous, 10+ minute, 'end of the world' mood piece \\"We Will Fall\\", which is typically considered a drastic misfire, and I suppose it isn't for everyone, but it's actually a masterpiece, with its crawling tempo, Ron's brilliantly tasteful wah-wah guitar runs, the slapping percussion, the hypnotic chanting, Cale's droning and mournful viola, and of course's Iggy's commanding vocals.    With Rhino's two-CD deluxe edition now available, you may as well just go ahead and indulge yourself considering the mammoth importance of this album, but in any case, \\"The Stooges\\" is beyond indispensible--brilliant, groundbreaking, and still a cathartic listen in its own right.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I must admit to being: <br />1) a PF fan that's never seen them live in person <br />2) a Pulse VHS owner <br />3) someone who waited forever and tolerated all the delays for this DVD. <br /> <br />Before the official release, all of this chatter about the 4:3 format had me quite disappointed. I have a 16:9 DLP 5.1 Klipsch home theater system. The thought of those ugly black bars on each side tempered my excitement for this DVD to a certain extent. However, upon receipt, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the video completely filled my screen - no side bars, no top/bottom bars. Seems there's a setting on the TV that allows 4:3 programming to be stretched to fill the screen. On this DVD, the distortion is undetectable. For all those upset over the 4:3 format on 16:9 monitors, see if your equipment will stretch the image. It's worth the effort. <br /> <br />As for the sound, it's disappointing. I own several concert DVD's with dts formatting that blow this thing away. Is it better than the VHS? Absolutely. Does it still sound great? Sure does. However, it falls well short of some of my best DVD's. I expected the absolute top shelf, given all of the delays. It is however, 10 year old (or so) material. <br /> <br />Hope this helps solve the video issues for some. 4 stars because I am not blown away by the sound. <br />
0451167716|5.0|This book is by far the best book I've ever read. I being a novelist and reviewer of most books was  very much happy with Mario's The Godfather. This book takes you through the hard-life of all the Italins and Italin Americains.  This book even gives you a clue of how good it is on the cover as saying the bestselling phenomenon a classicof our time in the year 2006 and to come. I would love to know why did Puzo write the Godfather in the first place? I mean it is a good book period.  This book gets my highest rating since my last rating of Super Bowl 38 (Patriods vs.Panthers) but if I were to judge this book it will get a 4000% score from me.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I loved this show. It had action. The new characters like Jesse were interesting, though I was kind of sad for Tristin leaving. The story is still great and Lorelai is funny as ever.
B00026WU3M|4.0|I know I'm in the minority here when I say this is a good, but not great, album.  It's certainly better than Dylan's previous 2 albums (Knocked Out Loaded and Down in the Groove), but I always found the album wanting.  The songs are way too short, for one thing.  There's really only one lengthy track on the whole album, What Was It You Wanted?.  While the album has great songs (Political World, Everything is Broken, Man in the Long Black Coat), it just doesn't have that epic quality that many Dylan albums have.  Luckily, he reteamed with producer Daniel Lanois later for a real Dylan masterpiece, Time Out of Mind.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I love this show. The first season is so sweet, funny and original. The plot and characters are well though. I laughed in every single episode and when it ended all I could do was ask for more. The couple Lorelai\Max is cool, but better than that is Rory\Dean. I think the show rocks.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|This is a great film, but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of Eastwood's career.  Many have said that Clint's film, Million Dollar Baby, was depressing.  That film was sad, but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it.  This film has nothing like that.  The 3 boyhood friends, played by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon, have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when Penn's daughter is murdered.  After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.  Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.  While at first you feel sympathy for Penn's character, you realise slowly that Penn is really a cruel, brutal man.  Bacon is very good as the detective, the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced, even though his wife has left recently, and he is a typically cynical detective.  The film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous, dark note, with Kevin Bacon giving Penn a \\"I know what kind of person you really are\\" at the end of the film.  This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.  It has the marks of a great tragedy, because like all tragedies, things never worked out for the best, they seemed to have worked out for the worst, but we're really not sure.  Great film....
6305907145|2.0|Is there a secret revised version of the novel \\"Mansfield Park\\" to which only Patricia Rozema had access? If it weren't for the title, I wouldn't even know that it was an attempt at an adaptation! I suppose it's a decent film in its own right, and I thought that the use of Jane Austen's letters and earlier works (the \\"History of England\\" Fanny was writing, for example, along with the stories of cannibalistic children eating their mothers!) as minor plotlines and dialogue was clever, but this is NOT the \\"Mansfield Park\\" Austen fans know and love.
B000EHSVQ4|3.0|While I really enjoyed the movie I was a little concerned about how the Christians were portrayed compared to Muslims.  It was pandering unnecessarily to \\"political correctness\\" showing Christian Clergy to be corrupt, immoral and fearful by in large and the Muslim to be the opposite.  I think that history was being re-written to some extent and I didn't appreciate that part of the movie.   <br /> <br />Phil Rispin
0930289528|5.0|I saw the movie and it made me buy the book.  I really enjoyed the book, but I won't say that it made the movie terrible.  There has yet to be a perfect adaption from page to screen, but if you enjoy the book, give the movie a chance.  If you enjoyed the movie, read the book.
B000002UAX|5.0|I only just discovered this album a little while ago and i was really taken aback by the variety of songs in it. Each one is totally different and totally unique. Everyone at my school thinks I am toally weird because I am constantly singing everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey unconciously at random intervals during the day. The reason these song are amazing is because they are so random, so funny, and yet sometimes really sad too and gorgeous, like while my guitar gently weeps. People complain that there are too many songs But what's wrong with decided to let out your inner dementedness and writing a song like Piggies or Wild Honey Pie or Bungalo Bill. I absolutely love the Beatles and the White Album is definately one of my favourite of their albums, along with Abbey Road. If you want a good bunch of music for a party you'll get everything with this album. There's the upbeat music like Back in the USSR and Birthday, the more melodic, sad music like While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Dear Prudence, and then the weird stuff such as Why Don't We do it in the Road (love it!), Revolution #9 (so strange!) and, my personal favourite, Everybody's got Something to Hide except for Me and my Monkey.  <br /> <br />The funniest Album EVER! Ignore all those pointless reviews from Beatles haters and BUY IT!
B00006CXSS|5.0|The show was great.  I had originally wanted to watch one or two episodes a night to draw it out a little but I ended up getting through the whole thing in about three days.
0062502182|4.0|It would be all too easy to shoot this book down because it's not overly intellectual- the story is a simple one, told simply. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here, simple works, as Coelho strips away the all-too-human tendency to over-analyze human motivation and purpose, showing us instead that we don't have to tie ourselves in philosophical knots to achieve genuine fulfillment. Rather than a Rube Goldberg approach to life, sometimes the simple truths are the right ones by virtue of their simplicity. The trick is to realize that complexity is not always superior, that affairs of the heart are not always served better by our intellectual abilities. And as Coelho's simple fable shows, that realization can be difficult to obtain, but is worth pursuing for the happiness that results. There's another enjoyable fable called An Audience for Einstein that explores similar ideas in a different way. I would recommend both for everyone school age through adult.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Someone gave me this book and I loved it. The concept was wonderful, the tone was perfect. Unlike some other reviews, I liked the fact that you get the innocent, teenage perspective as well as the perspective of someone who has spent years growing vicariously through the people she watches. Her tone changes depending on who she's watching, a pattern that is easy to understand and follow. She is many things to many people, and her tone changes accordingly. <br /> <br />Someone suggested to me that the concept of overlapping heavens sounded similar to string theory. The more I thought about it, the more I liked it.  <br /> <br />I think this is appropriate for young, mature, thoughtful readers, if you are prepared to openly discuss the subject matter with them after, as they will come away with thoughts and questions. I don't think we give young people enough credit regarding their ability to handle challenging literature. This is a good book to start with.

I realize that this was not a \\"how to\\" book necessarily, but in a way it becomes that as I related to the content in many ways--I wanted to go to Italy and play, I wanted to go to the Ashram and learn to meditate and find God, and I wanted to go to Bali and ride a bicycle and enjoy peace and tranquility. <br /> <br />But I can't do all of this in reality. So the book was excellent in that it created this image so strongly I felt I could be in Liz's shoes and imagined how it would be like through her wonderfully, descriptive imagery. <br /> <br />

B000002GJH|5.0|Temple Of The Dog (1991.), the first and only release from the Temple Of The Dog grunge supergroup<br /><br />One of the most intriguing questions when looking back at the alternative rock `grunge' explosion in the early 1990's for me is what would have become of Mother Love Bone had lead singer Andrew Wood not tragically overdosed on heroin shortly after the release of the band's masterpiece first and only album. However, what did come from this was firstly, the formation of Pearl Jam, one of the greatest bands of recent times, from Mother Love Bone's ashes and also this tribute album, `Temple Of The Dog'. Greatly moved by Wood's death, Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, who was Wood's former roommate teamed with drummer Matt Cameron and surviving MLB members bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard as well as lead guitarist Mike McCready. Released in 1991, just as alternative rock was beginning to hit the mainstream, this album has gone on to become one of the more forgotten and underestimated works from the Seattle movement, similarly to Mother Love Bone's `Apple'. So how much of a forgotten gem is this album?<br /><br />`Temple Of The Dog', put simply is a musical collaboration that words can't describe. When I originally got the album, I expected it to be good but not on a par with other Seattle classics like `Ten', `Badmotorfinger' or `Dirt'. I was shocked after listening to it; hell I couldn't have been more wrong as this album is every bit the other albums' equal. `Temple Of The Dog' is a masterpiece tribute to Andrew Wood, with 10 awesome songs, none of which are less than excellent. The collaboration of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden is a unique and successful blend indeed. Chris Cornell paves the way with the album, writing most of the songs and all of the lyrics. His words of emotional, compelling, dark and powerful and his strong delivery on this album is hard to match. I thought his vocal range on `Badmotorfinger' was unsurpassable enough but he is even more stronger on this album, and strangely seems more at home in this tribute band. The distinctive, grungy and sometimes quirky guitar play from Gossard and McCready complements his singing very well and sets up an unwavering groove throughout the album that can easily put you in a trance. Couple that with a great rhythm section of Matt Cameron and Jeff Ament (now obviously a feature in Pearl Jam too) and the results can be no less than phenominal. All of the 10 songs on the album have something different to offer, be it slower, emotional ballads or grungier rocking guitar jams. Harmonica, keyboard and organ make very effective appearances in some of the songs such as `Times Of Trouble' and `All Night Thing' also. It really is a shame for me that this album (and Mother Love Bone's `Apple') are the more forgotten works of the Seattle sound as they are perhaps two of the genres finest works. I suppose it's one of those tragedies that often the best music reaches the fewest ears. The fact that Mother Love Bone never progressed past it's first album tragically is at least a softened blow when we have tribute works like this one that are so awe inspriring.<br /><br />`Temple Of The Dog' get's going with `Say Hello 2 Heaven', an opener with tribute written all over it. This awesome opener definitely tells the listener they're in for something special with this album. A slow guitar groove works greatly in tandem to Cornell's calm verse vocals before spurring into a blistering vocal attack on the chorus. One of the prized moments on the album is next in `Reach Down', a...wait for it, 11 minute epic. The amazing thing is that it never gets boring. Plodding, stripped down guitar work is a feature throughout the song and is a platform for a lengthy vocals from Cornell. After 2 verses, the song goes all out into a jam for about 5 minutes with plenty of experimental guitar work from McCready and some great bass from Jeff Ament. The soulful vocal reprise and harmony late onis excellent. The single off the album, `Hunger Strike' is next and what a song. The instrumentation has a classic Pearl Jam feel to it, as does the song overall, as it features guest vocalist Eddie Vedder. Himself and Cornell exchange vocals very effectively and the `I'm Going Hungry' vocal exit is brilliant. `Pushing Forward Back' has a more urgent pace to it and a much more rocking feel to it, with a memorable chorus. Then we have `Call Me A Dog'; a much more slower, emotive ballad, with a piano harmony and more toned down (but just as effective) Cornell vocals. It's a very introspective song and this is reflected throughout, especially with the end solo.<br /><br />The next track for me though is the pinnacle of the album in `Times Of Trouble'. It's another very stripped down and slow song musically. Cornell gives a compelling vocal performance with lyrics about loss and drug addiction. Each verse builds to a thrilling climax were Cornell's vocals increase in power. The harmonica solo is quite special as is the `If somebody...' bridge at the end. Such a moving song. The effects of religion are in the lyrics of `Wooden Jesus', another fine song, with more fantastic guitar licks and a stunning chorus. `Your Saviour' has some interesting but good vocal harmonies from Eddie Vedder to complement Cornell's striking calls. If you had to pick a song which was closest to being like Soundgarden on the album, you'd pick this one. `Four Walled World' is another dark and moving epic with brooding guitar melodies and a heart wrenching chorus. Cornell again is the centrepiece of another fantastic song, as is also true in the final song `All Night Thing'. Cornell rounds things off accompanied by not much more than organ and piano harmonies which finishes the album in an extremely peaceful note.<br /><br />The grunge supergroup `Temple Of The Dog' only stayed together for one album with this masterpiece tribute but for me it was more than enough for them to make their mark on the Seattle music scene alongside all the other great bands of the time. Few albums can match a work like this where all songs are top notch and hardly flawed, this is truly a masterpiece. It's slow, dark and emotional but is a thrilling listen and captvates the listener from start to finish. Sadly, it's not always that easy to get (certainly rare in CD shops in the UK) so you may have to do some searching for it or you can get it readily from amazon. It's worth it's weight in gold though and I'd urge anyone to buy it who comes across it for sale. A must for any fan of the Seattle movement and aforementioned bands and even for anyone who just wants some great songs pure and simple.<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10; a classic that rises above the restoff the album, `Hunger Strike' is next and what a song.

B000002LKU|3.0|I had a bit more trouble enjoying this than did the other reviewers, I guess.  Being contemporaneous with the Chet Atkins \\"Neck and Neck\\" recordings, the country influence is very clear in this work. Of course, the name of the band tips us off to this. NOTHING wrong with that at all, in itself, my problem lies in the pace.  On too many songs, the tempo is slow, along the lines of dreamy country a la Eddy Arnold/Floyd Cramer/Pete Drake etc.  Even the opening track \\"Railroad Worksong\\" is performed much more slowly than the thumping treatment the song usually receives.  I kept waiting for the trademark Knopfler soaring guitar licks to waft me away, but they seldom came. And Brendan Croker is no slouch either - I love his own works with his bands - but here again I was seldom transported.  The album was a good idea, a sort of \\"country Traveling Wilburys,\\" but needed to pick up the pace more often.

Whenever a rock opera or concept album is released, Tommy is always mentioned right along side it.  Look at some the critical reviews for the most recent rock opera smash, Green Day's \\"American Idiot,\\" and you will see Tommy being mentioned.  Even after 30+ years, Tommy still is the standard.  For that shear fact alone, everyone should own Tommy.  Also, the music is just extraordinary and very much The Who.  If you like this album then you'll like other Who albums.  This album is not the end or beginning of the historical Who career. This is one, of their many, milestones in it. <br /> <br />Own Tommy and impress your friends ;)

The only 5 star albums should be the ones that have stood the test of time or the ones that have changed music as we know it.  That being said, this is a decent album.    This is Muse, no doubt about it.  This album has great songs that could possibly be connected like a concept album or a alt-rock opera.  If you are new to Muse, try Absolution first.  If you liked the whole of the album then try BH&R.  If you don't like Muse at all, see them live, and be ready to tell me how great they are.  Easily the best live band I have ever seen in person.
B0009A40ES|4.0|After looking at several reviews it occured to me that most of the people giving this movie low marks had not previously read the book. The story in the book is confusing as well, and it is done intentionally. The movie didn't pull it off as well and it shows, but it was very low budget so what did you expect? Overall, a decent movie of a great book.
1400079276|4.0|This novel follows Murakami's tradition of using disparate storylines which eventually run together in magical ways.  Much like _The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles_ and _Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World_, Murakami sets up two very different storylines and lets them slowly merge together over the course of the novel.  First, we're following a student who runs away from home after being told of a heinous fate (a youth who is, in Murakami style, very disaffected and lacking outward emotion but who has great taste in literature) and then an old man who talks to cats (and they, of course, talk back).<br /><br />The way these storylines converge is, of course, the drive of reading the novel, but just like in other Murakami works that deal in magical or absurd elements, the novel always focuses on the reactions of characters who are immersed in situations that are beyond them.  Murakami can be frustrasting to some in using this method, for magical elements often go unexplained and remain mysterious to the end, but this is simply because the meaning or rationale of the magic is not as important to the narrative and the exploration of the characters, who often have to make choices that will define their fates and themselves.  Since Murakami's protagonists are often on a search for identity or emotion, explanation of the elements that bring them there often fall by the wayside.<br /><br />It is fitting that Kafka should be a central element of this book, for Murakami's writing style is very akin to Kafka's in that he demands your attention on his characters rather than on his situations.  The classic question asked of \\"The Metamorphosis\\" is \\"Why did he turn into a bug?\\"  Though I think the answer is provided in the entirety of the work, the more pertinent answer is, \\"He just is--what's going to happen next?\\"  Murakami is the same.  A man who can converse with cats, or who searches for a flat stone that will open a portal at the proper time, is secondary to how these events affect the characters of the story, and in that respect, Murakami is wonderful.<br /><br />I would still recommend books like _A Wild Sheep Chase_ and _The Elephant Vanishes_ over this one, for it does drag on a little midway, but this is still magnificent work.se events affect the characters of the story, and in that respect, Murakami is wonderful. <br /> <br />I would still recommend books like _A Wild Sheep Chase_ and _The Elephant Vanishes_ over this one, for it does drag on a little midway, but this is still magnificent work. <br />
B000059Z8J|2.0|This is the first and original Superman movie, included among the Best 1000 movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This Special Edition really has a great sound and better picture with some added extras. But I am disapointed.To begin with, the first 5 minutes of the movie are credits, so booooring, you just want to forward them! If it was not for the excellent music, nobody could stand that. And then, until minute 25, when Superman lands on the Planet Earth, it is soooooooo boring that I just could not take it. C'mon, why is that part so long and boring. Peter Jackson told us much more in 4 minutes at the beginning of LOTR that here. But that is not it! The movie in general is just old fashioned. It did not resist the test of time. For instance, Indiana Jones is 5 stars. Star Wars also. E.T. I love all of them! They still MEAN something today. But I was very disapointed going back to this classic of the Science Fiction. I am sorry but I can't give this movie more than 2 stars and a half (5/10). I understand it is a classic, but the acting, the plot and the visual effects are poor. Some dumb lines from the movie \\"I'm here to fight for truth, justice, and the American way\\". And at the end \\"We're fighting for the same team\\".

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This stunningly beautiful movie by Ridley Scott was ripped to shreds by the editing demanded by the American movie industry.  This Director's cut restores its integrity and incredibly rich depth.  With all the missing details of the story restored, it becomes a whole, if not wholly accurate historical epic.  The depiction of Templars and Hospitallers was particularly apt, and if anything, Reynaud de Chatillion was even more evil than shown.  The battle scenes were horrifying and gory, but filmed with an eye for accuracy.  If the story of Ibelin was a little embellished, it was worth it to get an up close and personal feel to the moral dilemma of the era -- dilemmas that keep appearing, over and over again in the Holy Land.  This is truly a great movie to rival anything produced in Hollywood over the past 30 years, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Based on some previous Tarentino films I had seen I expected this movie to be disturbing or cleverly plotted or have interestin dialog. Man was I in for a letdown. This is just a b-movie horror flick. It's the usual scenario of T&A followed by copious blood and ooze. I'm sorry I wasted my time on it.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|It does what it says on the label: This is Dashiell Hammett-style LA noir -- complete with period dialogue -- set in a contemporary Southern California high school.<br /><br />Gritty, violent, sometimes baffling, the film works better than I think anyone could expect and better than it has any right to.<br /><br />Unreservedly recommended to fans of film noir, detective stories and, yes, Veronica Mars.<br /><br />A truly amazing film.
0553293397|5.0|The Naked Sun is the second book in Asimov's robot series and probably my favorite but all are worth reading.  This book continues the futuristic Sherlockian adventure of Elijah Bailey and his straight-man robot sidekick Daneel Olivaw.  This time they journey to the planet of Solaria to solve a murder that has political implications across the galaxy. <br /> <br />Asimov creates and socially interesting world in Solaria where people avoid human contact, live miles apart from each other and dependent upon robots to automate their society and keep their standard of living of high.  Asimov deftly ties the intricacies of the Solarians into the mystery of the murder and ongoing multi book arc or robot progression.  The whole thing is executed with Asimov's straightforward style and the character interaction and relationship between the two main characters is excellent as well. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this series to any science fiction fan as this is really top shelf sci-fi writing from the best.  The series should be read in order though and one should start with the I, Robot short story collection before proceeding to The Caves of Steel (which is the predecessor to this novel).  Also this series is entirely appropriate for any one of at least high school age. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  This series was revolutionary when it came out in the 50's.  It's still one of the best ones out there.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I enjoy watching period films, and I particulary enjoy British period films.  This is another in a long line of films that enjoy watching over and over again. I won't bore you with an analysis of the actors and actresses, other than you say that they all did a great job.  <br />The story revolves around a daughter who is unappreciated by her father and sister, both of whom don't have a clue about the financial condition the family is in.  Coupled with this is the return of a man she has remained in love with for many years, and how they finally throw off the shakles of society and get married. <br />This is an oversimplification of a great story that involves much more than this.  I think you would enjoy this film.
B000001FMX|4.0|I had pretty high expectations for this CD when I first listened to it way back when. I understood that it was a recording of high historical importance and influence, and the fact that Morrissey endorsed it as his favorite CD - and does to this very day - certainly bode well for it.  Besides, I couldn't help but be drawn in by a bunch of guys dressed as red light district Barbies playing trashy, menacing rock 'n roll in a brew of Rolling Stones-style blues and reckless proto-punk abandon.  Moreover, in the wake of the glam rock of T. Rex and David Bowie, the New York Dolls imitated their fashions so as to flatter them, but took it to the extreme and gave it an irresistibly kitschy quality. Image was very important at the time, and the Dolls were wise enough to embrace it.<br /><br />The best examples of what make the New York Dolls' debut so interesting are the manic opener \\"Personality Crisis\\", the jaunty, appropriately-titled \\"Trash\\", the absolutely superb swagger of  \\"Jet Boy\\", which fully captures the \\"trashy glory\\" which is guaranteed to the listener by almost every reviewer out there. This is probably the best song that the band ever recorded.  But the Dolls have more than sloppy rock 'n roll going for them. The poignant \\"Subway Train\\" - the first few lines of which are often used live by Morrissey as a segue way into other songs - and the acoustic \\"Lonely Planet Boy\\" highlight the band's softer side.  \\"Bad Girl\\", on the other hand, sounds like a cover of a Rolling Stones song, and \\"Pills\\" is an actual cover (of a Bo Diddley tune), and a pretty inspired one at that.<br /><br />There is much talk of the Dolls' debut as the definitive proto-punk album. I am reluctant to agree with this wholeheartedly, as the emergence of American punk rock was a very gradual one. From the unlikely spring of the early Love singles \\"My Little Red Book\\" (1966) and \\"7&7 Is\\", to the 1967 release of The Velvet Underground & Nico and the 1969 debut by The Stooges, through the New York Dolls (1973) and up to the first release by The Ramones (1976), it is difficult to pinpoint when the punk aesthetic was first realized - fully or partially - in the form of a single or an LP. (And it was surely before The Ramones started making an entire career out of it.)<br /><br />Whatever the case, the debut by the New York Dolls and its follow-up, Too Much Too Soon, are fascinating artifacts in rock 'n roll history. By artifacts, I definitely don't mean that they are outdated or worthwhile as simple historical curios. Rather, I mean that they capture moments when rock had become more image-conscious, and less concerned about whether the music was tailor-made for mass consumption. As mentioned previously, the Dolls took the image thing to a ridiculous extreme, most likely for the sake of actually ridiculing it.  On their first record, they were unrefined but accessible, thanks to Todd Rundgren's production, which gave the songs the muscle and sprinkles of pop sweetness that they needed for their intended impact. Overall, this is a must-hear record, and I recommend it highly.d up to the first release by The Ramones (1976), it is difficult to pinpoint when the punk aesthetic was first realized - fully or partially - in the form of a single or an LP.

0380788624|3.0|Reading was very exhausting. At times - extremely boring. Had to skip much of the lengthy and meaningless to me stuff. However, the main idea is just brilliant. The entire plot seems to be quite doable. Wonder what keeps some smart guys with resources from setting up something like that in our real life. It could have been done even on a governmental level just to teach the most of our civilized world an ugly lesson. I think, someone, like Russia or China, could have created some sort of a proxy world with its virtual economy if they wanted to by secretly acting behind some sort of international private consortium. That could become an ultimate weapon of mass distraction targeting the very roots of international law and order and no state would have been able to stand against such power.  No rating for this book cause there is such a huge quality gap between the superb idea and the sleeping pill of the author's text.
B000006NUW|5.0|What is Motown all about? The answer lies within the music of this rather impressive line-up of songs on \\"Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection 1959-1971.\\" It's the story of how a gifted songwriter, Berry Gordy, Jr., makes his way on up the ladder of success spearheading one of if not the most successful <br />of all R&B-based record companies during the golden age of American popular music. Detroit, Michigan, known as the Motor City, gained yet another nickname: Hitsville USA. Everyone referred to it as Motown. In this collection, all of the well-known groups (The Supremes, The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Miracles, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, The Jackson 5) are represented as well as the known solo artists (Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Mary Wells, Brenda Holloway). Included also are some wonderful one or two-shot wonders (Shorty Long, Brenda Holloway, Eddie Holland [of Motown's hit-making songwriting trio H-D-H], The Velvelettes, The Elgins, The Monitors, The Contours) and more. What's interesting about this set is that there are many of the well-known songs along with some songs that you probably just don't hear anymore or weren't that well-known. So you get your fair share of both like the Supremes' well-known \\"Baby Love\\" and Shorty Long's rare but wonderful \\"Function at the Junction.\\" The downside of this set is nothing too alarming. Not all the artists' hit songs, big and small, are included and I think that's done so that other little-known-but-definitely-worth-discovering are given a chance at spin time, too; even some from the top artists, too. Think about it: if every single Motown record that made the charts was included, this collection would just balloon up, and there'd be no telling how far. So this is a very nice general overview of those first 12 and golden years of Motown. That's what this is all about: the general overview. Granted, if you want to investiagte further about a certain artist's music, there are numerous collections out there devoted just to them like the single \\"Ultimate Collection\\" CDs, or box collections of the artist. But, back to this one. Included within is a very nice 68-page booklet containing essays and phots of ALL the artists, plus musician credits, the track-by-track listing of the whole set, including original release date, label, and chart position. <br />In the middle of the book the different 45s are pictured all together on a two-page spread which was neat, and on the cover are the picture sleeves. It was an unusual move to put no artists and only songs on the back of the individual discs. The same goes for the back of the box. The paper inserts of the CD cases are record labels that have just the label name: Gordy, Soul, Motown, Tamla. Still, out of all the Motown best of various artists collections, this is the big one! It's great party music and dance music. People young and old will love this. The sound on here is terrific and powerful, but, yes, it is in mono. If you look in the back of the booklet, there is noted that the original single masters were used (the 45 RPM versions), so what does that tell you? Nevertheless, the sound is strong for 1992 remastering. Together, this set is living proof that Motown wasn't just a hit-making machine of a record-company, it was a feeling!

B000EDWKXI|2.0|I watched the first hour of the film and then had this urge to fastforward, which helped me through the stretches when the characters were running around (people always came after Casanova and he ran away). It is indeed a light romentic comedy, but I wasn't entertained.  <br /> <br />The plot, as others have described, is fairly straightforward. Casanova, who seems downright harrowed by all his responsibilities re: satisfying women (in one of the opening scenes an entire convent is bidding him good-bye) gets a reprieve in the request that he marry, which will restore his reputation and help him avoid the Inquisition.  <br /> <br />He finds a young woman who exhibits a great deal of interest in getting into his pants, when, unexpectedly, he falls in love with another, who resists. Unfortunately, I saw no spark/sexual/emotional tension between Casanova and Francesca, an eightteenth-century proto-feminist who believes that for a man to gain the love of a woman all he has to say is \\"what are your thoughts on the matter\\" (this I quite liked :) <br /> <br />Francesca is betrothed to a rich man, whom she has never met, and some intrigue ensues as Casanova tries to win her attention. In the end, everything is sorted out, everybody finds his/her mate (odd in itself) and our feminist promptly stops writing his treatises about women on the side of her \\"true love.\\" Please. <br /> <br />
0375701427|5.0|I am not a fan of using the same protagonist in many novels.  I tend to think that it's a result either of laziness on the part of the author (the protagonist being so close to his own voice that to strike out with another character would be too difficult) or the desire to cash in on the success of previous novels with the same character.  I put those issues aside to read this book anyway and I was very happy that I did.  Thankfully, there was no need to be familiar with the other books.  The details in this book of the politics of Zuckerman's youth, the glove factory, and the anguish at losing his daughter to the world make this a great novel.  I have a terrible memory for the characters and events of stories, but this one remains with me.  I've added several other of Roth's book to my future reading list.
1401302378|3.0|When you want to eat ice cream outside your home, do you go to a store that offers only chocolate and vanilla . . . or do you go where there are many more choices?  Most people will do the latter.  That's the basic point of this book.  If you're satisfied with knowing that point, you don't need to read the book.  Instead, you could settle for Mr. Anderson's article in the October 2004 issue of Wired.<br /><br />But if you are like the growing legions of people who enjoy knowing more about the quirks of micro-economics (such as those who were intrigued by The Tipping Point, Freakonomics and Fooled by Randomness), The Long Tail will provide much entertainment.<br /><br />Let me explain what a long tail is.  If you plot the popularity of various products (say, books on Amazon) with the most popular products at the left, the left part of the curve will be very vertical (the head) and there will be a long list of items to the right that will have relatively few sales (the tail).  Mr. Anderson's point is that as it becomes economically viable to produce and distribute more low-volume products (such as print-on-demand books and e-books), there will be more items available to purchase at any outlet . . . and the length the tail to the right will grow.  As more outlets can afford to make these items available, the thickness of the tail will also grow.<br /><br />A physical store will only distribute a small percentage of the items, stopping where the offering no longer adds to its targeted rate of profits.  An on-line store will have far more items (such as Amazon), appeal to more customers and sell lots of its volume in relatively unpopular items.  The author estimates that 25% of Amazon's book sales volume, for instance, comes from outside the 100,000 top selling books.<br /><br />Here's where Mr. Anderson begins to lose his way: He tries to describe the sociological implications.  He sees, for example, a loss of common cultural items of the sort that talking about the Beatles appearing on Ed Sullivan once provided.  He imagines a world in which everyone drifts off into various different niches and the size of the head becomes less vertical.  While that may be true, it doesn't correctly forecast the amount of commonality in the culture.  The sales of any given item over time may well be in both the head and the tail.  Or an item could be a sleeper and always be in the tail, but if enough people buy it, the item will become part of the common culture.  In addition, some elements of common culture don't appear in sales curves.  I'm sure that yesterday's arrests in the alleged plot to bomb a number of airplanes have already become part of the common culture.<br /><br />I won't go on to point out his other errors.  I'm sure you'll notice them for yourself.<br /><br />The other disappointment was that he doesn't do a very good job of describing strategy choices for product producers.  It seems to me that the long tail is simply another argument in favor of intense individual product and service customization of the sort that Dell has been giving us for years in computers and related equipment.<br /><br />My grade of 3 stars for the book is 5 stars for long-tail trivia and 1 star for sociological and producer analysis.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of the following books, The Tipping Point, Freakonomics and Fooled by Randomness, I recommend that you read those long before you get around this one.  They are much better books about micro-economic implications.ce provided.

B00005JOYM|5.0|Very different from what you would expect the typical Oliver Stone movie. <br />Special effects were very realistic, but didn't take away from the story. Character development was excellent. It's unfortunate that this film is probably destined not to be a huge box office hit. Too many people just don't want to be reminded about what happened on September 11th. My only quibble about the movie is that it's rated \\"PG-13\\", and in my opinion far too intense for that rating. You won't be sitting there pretending the movie is real...it WAS real.
B000FA57RG|4.0|The CD: 3 Stars; the DVD: 4 Stars<br /><br />Upon righting her career after the underwhelming \\"American Life\\" album with the very enjoyable \\"Confessions on the Dance Floor\\", Madonna now issues her first live album in her 20+ year career, released just in time to coincide with the start of the \\"Confessions\\" tour in the US.<br /><br />\\"I'm Going To Tell You a Secret\\" is a CD-DVD combo. The CD (14 tracks, 66 min.) is a baffling choice for Madonna's first live album. The problems are many: almost half the tracks are from the mediocre \\"American Life\\" album, and they're just not great; of the other \\"greatest hits\\" tracks, too many are reworked quite substantially from their original form, taking away from the enjoyment, such as in \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Holiday\\" (notable exception: a terrific \\"Vogue\\"); and then there is the horrible cover of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\". \\"I Love New York\\" is a studio \\"bonus\\" track, and quite good.<br /><br />The DVD (140 Min.) is a different story altogether. It's not a concert film, but rather an account of the 2004 \\"Re-Invention\\" tour. I was amazed that Madonna gave so much access to private moments with her family, in particular her 2 kids, who appear frequently in the documentary. Other interesting aspects include the comments from Madonna's dad, and her frequent reflections on religion, which really shape his documentary. Not so good is the actual concert footage, with a non-stop barrage of different camera angles (literally about once every second or two, just dizzying, and greatly talking away from the enjoyment of watching it). But overall, I found the documentary quite interesting.<br /><br />I saw Madonna in concert when she did her infamous 30 min. set at Coachella this year. What fun that was. It's unfortunate that the live CD of \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\\" doesn't reflect the live Madonna experience in a better way...
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Answer: PULSE (is) BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS \\"DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER!\\"  <br />Seen both concerts on VHS.  Pulse; hands down.   <br /> <br />(4 out of 5 Dentists prefer pulse) <br /> <br />Case closed.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I don't know what expectations the Amazon reviewer had but I for one can't stop listening to \\"I Dug Up A Diamond\\" - which is how I feel about this CD.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Made only for the Force. Why? Lucas doesn't expect to get much praise from the general public because of this \\"New\\" version. Most people see it as \\"I thought the last release was the last version?\\" Just get rid of that idea. Every other 5 years until the Apocalypse, or the Earth stops spinning, expect an announcement from Lucas Entertainment an \\"Enhanced\\" or better than the last Disc or DVD. Remember Michael Jordan retired 3 times, so don't believe Lucas is going stop when he says it's over.  <br /> <br />With better technology that frustrates all of us and empties our wallets (like computers), creates more options. And movie producers and directors who've created great movies (with a cult-like following) an ability to make many versions of the original. There's no doubt Star Wars has a strong loyal fan base and a very large one too. <br /> <br />The next version will most likely be made for HD TV and the HD DVD. This is what will make every Star Wars fan crash into the stores for a copy of a Star Wars Episodes 1-6 Collection on High Definition. It's no joke, HD DVD is amazing when viewed on HD DVD Players. Like DVD's replaced VHS, HD DVD will replace your standard DVD's. Lucas knows this. Sure you can play your standard DVD's on the HD DVD Players but it's not the same. Just watch, soon Lucas will announce his release date for the HD versions, and every fan of the movie will need to have it. I'm just hoping he realizes how much money he could make if he decided to do Episodes 7, 8, and 9. Last time I checked, Lucas was worth over $3 Billion. Why not be worth another several billion?? Star Wars fans will see this latest release as a positive. And that's good thing.
6305922756|5.0|So many many DVD's come out with a \\"b\\" side hook full of outakes and dopy commentary offered by a bored actor or director who you can visualize constantly looking at their watch while jabbering away.   Not Spinal Tap. THere is, quite literally a whole other movie on side two. Another hour plus of outakes, floor clippings and the like, all pieced together as a kind of Spinal Tap II.. Every bit as good as the original. Seriously, what a deal!. This DVD is a great gift for anyone who's a musician or in the biz. Rob Reiner clearly built this flick for that audience. Lots of insider bits. This movie hits on all cylinders when it comes to actor talent. Perfect picks for the parts.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|As the VHS showed some while ago, this concert is a feast for the eyes, ears, and imagination.  Pink Floyd fans can add another classic piece to their collections with this great DVD. <br /> <br />My only criticism of this edition is that after waiting for twelve years, I really wished they would have included the entire set, which they haven't.  Space is apparently not an issue, as they went to 2 DVDs anyway, so I'm sure I'm not the only one that would have liked them to include the whole show.  In their defense however, they did include the highlights of the show. <br /> <br />Besides that small disappointment, it's still a fantastic piece and worthy of sitting prominently among any music fan's collection.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|This movie was so boring and insipid! I'd like to know where all the so-called laughs are b/c they are not present in this 'spoof' I had great expectations of this movie. Everyone I talked to told me this movie was full of laughs but all it was full of was zzz's! BORRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGG!
0790729350|5.0|When reviews of music DVD's are all over the board regarding sound quality only one fair conclusion is possible: The problem is the end user,not the product. I was stunned by how good this DVD sounded. Consider the conditions under which Woodstock was recorded and the quality and calibration of your home system before jumping to negative conclusions about this \\"transfer\\". That the VHS version sounds better than the Dolby 5.1 mix on DVD is simply not possible. You can quibble about several aspects of this movie but sound quality should not be one of them.
0802130208|5.0|The story has a collection of rich, very authentic characters intertwined in a fantastic plot. The guiding spirit of the cast is Ignatius Reilly, whose most impressive panache is only matched by his size. The absolute belief in his own high minded ways and lack of much regard for lesser souls make him quite a vociferous critic throughout the book. Yet, feisty and spirited are many others from Mr. Reilly's entourage. It is the inimitable Jones, the solitary black figure set off against all-white troupe, who managed to be so cool and defiant from his position of a strip joint janitor. Or the old and somewhat senile Ms. Trixie, who in the rare moments of wakefulness exhibited healthy doses of assertiveness and a strong belief in self worth. Ignatius's sweet mother Irene, hard-as-nails strip join owner Lana, tired factory owner Gus Levy, hapless patrolman Mancuso, the sexual revolutionary Myrna Minkoff and many others swirl around in the whirlwind set about by Ignatius when he is forced to leave his philosophical and historical pursuits and look for a job.    Each character speaks beautifully distinct, easily recognizable language, from academic and arcane of Ignatius's to simple and sweet of his mother's to freewheeling Jones's.     The story, following little crooked streets of New Orleans, takes most bizarre turns and, coupled with the colorful personalities of the cast, makes for a remarkably hilarious book.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|Whittling the complexities of Alan Moore's intricate graphic novel (illustrated by David Lloyd), shifting the politics from an attack of Thatcher's England to a mix of Orwellian futuristic dystopia and contemporary politics, the film version of V FOR VENDETTA offers polish and style but little else. One can see what this film aspires to be--it contains obvious references to Michael Radford's adaptation of Orwell's 1984, David Fincher's adaptation of Palahniuk's FIGHT CLUB, and the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX--but it falls flat. 1984 provides us Winston Smith to win our empathy and pity. FIGHT CLUB suggests that the populace would develop a movement driven by passion. THE MATRIX offers a simple story but an innovative, visually riveting form of storytelling. The film V FOR VENDETTA glosses over the confusing dynamics of the relationship between V and Evey (Stockholm syndrome? love? brainwashing?), replaces activism with costuming, and lacks the visual verve one would expect from a Wachowski production. I should note that the masked Hugo Weaving performs impressively, given his reliance on his voice and postures to convey feeling, but the fine cast cannot save this muddled production. It would be better to spend time with the above-mentioned pieces that have inspired this film.
B000C3H4M2|4.0|Nice job with the mastering. The fat disk has a hard time fitting into my iMac slot. The first few songs don't play well. On my CD player I can't play the first song at all. <br /> <br />I had exactly the same experence with \\"Speaking in Tongues\\".  It must be a problem with the DualDisc format.
0767821629|5.0|this movie is one of the best i've seen in years... if you're tired of the typical hollywood action films and prefer pure psychological suspense and highly surprising endings, then u gotta see it! the special effects are pretty cool also, and for those who think the characters' actions or the plot itself makes no sense, this is mainly SCI-FI ok? nobody said it could happen in real life! i highly recommend it =)
0780626966|5.0|I originally bought this set on its original release date for $120, which I thought was not bad considering it has all seven films, but now its a bargain at a price range of $50 -$60 is not bad at all, anyone who loves these horror classics or is interesting in horror films and have never seen these films (mostly todays teenagers) get it you would not be disappointed. TOtally original even funny fright fest.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|What did they do to this show? They butchered it in so many different ways I don't even know where start and I am offended that Amazon even listed this as a recommendation. TERRIBLE! Save your money. The Broadway actors are great. Rosario Dawson SUCKS!
0896762173|5.0|I bought this as a gift but I want a copy for myself. Can I say better?
B000BEZQ18|4.0|Lots more music then I remembered from the film, but the title song, the one that made you cry in the theatre is Really short. And there are many reprises of it. If you just want that haunting instrumental, you might want to look for the single track or mp3.

B00028HBKM|4.0|this movie depicted one of the most horrible beatings i have ever seen on film. it was well done and the torture just kept coming. from today's standards, i couldn't even have imagined the pain and suffering Jesus had to endure if this movie was in fact as truthful as it says.<br /><br />i will never forget this movie. it is one of those that left me unsettled and actually pulled a few tears from me which almost never happens with movies. i am not religious and i have not read the bible, yet after watching this i feel more of a sense of distaste for some of the things religions hold dear. i am not saying religions are bad, after all they hold people to a sort of moral code and give most followers a meaning. the distaste comes from the fact that just like Jesus, many people were killed maybe not for the same reasons but just as brutally. this was all because they didn't hold the same religious ideals.<br /><br />enough of my thoughts on religion. i still stand as agnostic but this movie touched me a way few films have. i don't know if they should show this in history classes, but people should see this. if not for the religious value, for the historical value. this is one piece of history that everyone that don't know about it, should. it just sucks that Mel Gibson is the one who had to bring it to our attention.
B00003CY6M|4.0|John Cusack is a great actor. When you're good...you're good. <br />He just nails this. It's a romantic comedy, sure. But not at all cheesey. It's really allot of fun. <br />And Kate Beckinsale is his love interest?? Are you kidding me??? <br />She's a 11 on a scale of 1-10. And funny enough, does a fine job of losing her british accent for this american role. <br />Guys...I say \\"Do it.\\" <br />You'll laugh, she'll cry, it'll be good. <br />Trust Me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed it, but I only saw this movie recently on a whim.  I totally loved it!  The action scenes are awesome - and actually believable for the most part.  The contrast between the feeling & unfeeling people is subtle yet astounding, and the whole thing just worked for me.  Even the dog was adorable.
0792838068|1.0|I couldn't stomach this movie for long. I kept waiting, hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge but the language, nudity, and explicit sexual content was too much for me so I turned it off and never saw the entire film. If there was any poignant, brilliant story with any depth, it was buried in filth and raunch. I would not recommend film this to anyone. Nicholas Cage or not, it was disgusting.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|If you're like me, you must have heard the hit single, \\"Crazy\\", about a gazillion times on the radio already. Now, there's no denying that it's a catchy tune - much like 2003's \\"Hey Ya\\". But is the album, St. Elsewhere, worth getting or is Gnarls Barkley just another one hit wonder?     I must admit, I bought this record on a whim for my girlfriend because she liked the single. To my surprise, I found that I enjoyed it even more than she did.     This CD is essentially a side project produced by Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse. You'd think that would mean it has a lot of worthless filler or throwaway tracks. This is not the case.      Taking all the serious issues that crop up in life and putting it out there with a good background beat is the overriding theme. \\"Just A Thought\\" follows logically from \\"Crazy\\", being a bit darker and with quite a bit more bass added in. \\"Who Cares?\\" explores the same issues of identity and self-worth, but does so with a mellower edge.     Of course, there are a lot of groovy, danceable songs on this album, too, such as \\"Smiley Faces\\", \\"Feng Shui\\", \\"Online\\", and \\"The Last Time\\". And there are bombastic beats here, like on my favorite , \\"Transformer\\", and the powerful, prophetic \\"Storm Coming.\\"     It is clear a lot of fun was had putting this album together. \\"The Boogie Monster\\" is not a track any serious musician this side of Sesame Street would come up. Or take the song \\"Necromancer\\", which overtly describes acts of necrophilia and makes it sound so damn smooth you can't help but smile at its tongue-in-cheek rendition.    So, you get an eclectic mix of styles and songs that run together into one of the best new albums of the year. Pick it up, there's something in there for anyone.
B00092QUQC|5.0|If You have't heard of Gotthard yet you're missing out on one of the greatest bands around.  Totally awesome release.  Great emotional vocal delivery on ballads.  Strong and catchy on the rockers.  Best tracks include 1.Anytime, Anywhere 2.I Wonder 3.Said And Done but every song here is great.  Buy all their albums, you won't be dissapointed.
B00003CXA2|5.0|You know who's in it, you know what it's about.  This is my #1 movie of all time. It's got it all. Comedy, action,drama and romance. It's a 10 on all levels.  The DVD is amazing. Special features that will take you a night to watch.  Gone with the wind?? Casablanca?? Although 2 great american classics....  Forrest Gump, in my opinion, will stand the test of time, right beside them.  If you have not seen it in a while,I recommend you re-introduce yourself to this movie. Widescreen and uncut on DVD. The way God intended it to be.  Nice 5.1 audio mix as well.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers follows the path of Easy Company (of the 101st Airborne Division) during WWII. When I had first heard of this mini-series being made, I was excited by the prospect of Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks teaming up. Obviously their other WWII collaberation (Saving Private Ryan) was a success. Right away I knew this was going to be good. I just didn't realize it was going to be THIS good. This is easily the best mini-series I have ever seen. The production qualities pass some major motion pictures being made these days. Each episode is around an hour long (some running a bit longer), even though they all could have been two hours and I wouldn't have complained. <br /> <br />Like I said, this is the true story of Easy Company. Easy Company fought in many of the major battles during WWII. Boot Camp, D-Day, Battle Of The Bulge, Holland, finding a concentration camp & even capturing Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest' is chronicled here. What I think I like best about this series, besides the production values & aboslute class everything in the series is done in, is that not every episode is just about some battle the company went through. The characters are well developed, so when they die you will actually care. And the little touches put into the series is amazing. <br /> <br />Even though the cast if filled with mostly (at the time) no-name actors, the acting is outstanding. I especially liked Damian Lewis in the role of Lt. Richard Winters. Ever since I saw this series back in 2001, I have wanted to see him in some movies. Ron Livingston plays Easy's intelligent officer, and one of the other 'central' characters here. Donnie Wahlberg, Matthew Settle, Neal McDonough, David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, and even Tom Hank's son Colin play important roles in this tale. I can't remember the names of all of the other actors in the series, but they are great overall. Even Dale Dye is great here. Of course, what's a war movie without Dale Dye in in though? <br /> <br />On top of the great acting and story, this is one great looking series. Some of the shots just make your jaw drop. I also love how it is shot in a washed out look. Only toward the end of the series when Easy captures the Eagle's Nest, does the series have a colorful and bright look to it. I must also commend Michael Kaman for his beautiful opening score. The rest of the music during the series is also top notch. <br /> <br />It's hard to put into words how good everything is done in this series. By the time you are finished watching the opening credits of the first episode, you will know you are watching something special. I love how they put short comments from some of the original members of Easy Company at the beginning of some of the episodes. Some are very emotional and almost bring you to tears. <br /> <br />One episode that stood out to me in particular that could have been a movie in it's own right was part seven. This is the best hour of television I have ever seen in my life. It's a visual sight to behold and will get you emotionally more than you would expect. The same could be said for part nine, which has Easy Company finding a concentration camp. I felt really disturbed after watching that one and it really shows how evil war can be. <br /> <br />If you are fan of war movies in any way, you owe it to yourself to go pick this up. If you are a fan of good cinema or TV, you owe it to yourself to go pick this up. This is not only the most amazing mini-series ever created, it's a true story of a group of men that were thrown together in a horrible war and ended up becoming heroes. <br /> <br />Special Features: There is an 80 min. documentary on Easy Company's path through the war as told by some of the living members. It's very interesting and pulls at your heart strings at times. Very well done. Then there is a 30 min. 'making of' documentary by HBO. This isn't near as good as the first documentary, but it's a decent watch. You also get Ron Livingston's video diaries, which show what it was like to go through Dale Dye's actor boot camp. This lightens up the mood quite a bit and is interesting, as well as humorous. <br /> <br />Before each episode you can access a 'Field Guide' to the series. This basically explains the ranks, who's each character, where the story is, etc. This would be helpful if you skipped episodes and wanted to pick the story back up quickly or are confused about which character is which. I didn't find much use for this, but it is great to have it nonetheless. Overall I liked the special features quite a bit and didn't feel shorted whatsoever. If I could give this DVD set ten stars, I would. Go get it already!!! <br /> <br />
B00005K9LN|5.0|What can be said about the great JP and their contributions to the Heavy Metal genre? Other than Black Sabbath, these guys were soley responsible for what I consider to be TRUE Heavy Metal.... A \\"crunching\\" guitar assault, \\"Head-pummeling\\" tempos, and \\"soaring\\" vocals abound. And as far as \\"looks\\" go, this band epitomized the visual side of the genre BETTER than any band before or since....literally Hell bent for Leather...and studs...and chains...and boots.  <br /> <br />Although \\"British Steel\\" is not my all-time favorite from the band (that HAS to go to \\"Screaming\\"), I feel it contains a varied mix of music that encompasses what made this band so acssesable and likeable. Metal Anthems such as \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"Grinder\\", \\"Metal Gods\\" and \\"Livin' After Midnight\\" can still be heard on FM stations across the land. Cult followers of the band would surely cite cuts such as \\"Rapid Fire\\", \\"The Rage\\" and \\"Steeler\\" as the real \\"treats\\" on this album. Personally, I like every song here...including the \\"lesser\\" tracks such as \\"United\\" and \\"Don't Have to be Old to be Wise\\" (though somewhat \\"burnt\\" on \\"Livin\\" and \\"Breaking the Law\\"). The first band I was ever in (Pure Grain...are you out there!?!), literally \\"cut their teeth\\" to this 'Metal' great, and played no less than half the tracks on this album on any given \\"Gig\\". If there is anybody reading this that is not familiar with The Priest and is searching for the REAL DEAL, \\"Old school\\" version of Heavy Metal....look no further, you've found IT! Also recommended for the \\"budding\\" Metalist: Maiden's \\"Piece of Mind\\", Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning\\", Priest's \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" and Sabbath's \\"Master of Reality\\".  <br /> <br />P.S.  As I was about to submit this review, it occured to me that I failed to mention the individual members of Priest. The rhythm section of Ian Hill and Dave Holland were as tight and \\"spot-on\\" as any in the business....holding the \\"Bus\\" together with a mighty, pounding 'Pulse'. The dual guitar\\"assault\\" of Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing never gave the music of JP a chance to even think about \\"blinking an eye\\", and literally \\"steam-rolled\\" anything in their way....rivaled in intensity only by Iron Maiden and The Scorpions. And then there's Rob Halford....This man WILL go down in Metal's history as one of the best, if not THE best vocalist ever....\\"Pipes\\"  the likes of Rob's aren't \\"handed-out\\" just any day of the week....His IS the voice of Heavy Metal and is not likely to be \\"Dethroned\\" in my lifetime! Many bands calling themselves \\"Metal\\" have come along in the years since this album----some faster, some harder and some 'flashier'...However, this band will forever remain \\"The Standard\\" to which ALL others are judged. Don't Miss Out!
B000BCKFWK|1.0|The DVD extras of Rodriguez and Tarantino directing are better than the whole film.  Still, don't buy this.  Why?  You're encouraging him.  Don't encourage him.  Let him move on to make something with a modicum of depth!  (Both in look and story.)<br /><br />I saw Sin City at a sneak preview for film critics and fanboys before it even came out.  My friend got tickets from a comic store.  I am probably the biggest fan of Rodriguez out there.  I really wanted the film to be good.  I was so amped on the trailers, I showed my students them for two months.  I show his 10 minute Flick School on breaks, his home studio tour during class, etc.  I am his biggest fan.<br /><br />BUT:<br /><br />If you like bad British TV shows and bad off off off Broadway theater, you will love Sin City.  The makeup on that Yellow B*st*rd was worth the price of admission to a true fanboy--it was phenomenal; but everything else just blew blew blew.  From shot selection to story to dialogue to bad green screen work to pace to character development, it just was a major disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted it to be good, but it was so bad people were laughing at it and some even booed it afterward.<br /><br />Shot selection: I foamed at the mouth that he was going to try to shoot it as close to the panels as possible.  It didn't work.  I was constantly going, ok, who is talking to whom?  Its called establishing shots, Robert.  It took me out of it.  The setups were HORRIBLE.  The poor environments are partly to blame, but it mostly felt like everything was shot on a green screen the width of a car, and with the height of about 7 feet.  Everything seemed to be in medium shots and close-ups!!  You'd think storyboarding would be simple for something emulating the great Sin City, but it just didn't transfer well onto the big screen.<br /><br />story: vignette style, which I didn't mind, but I couldn't get into the characters at all.  With no character development, the story seemed all sizzle, no steak. 20 minutes into it, no lie, I thought it was going to be over bc i thought I had sat through an hour and a half, but it kept going on and on.  I was expecting it to end, and it didn't.  The vignette style at least let you know that the next chapter would be coming soon, which meant it was closer to ending.<br /><br />Dialogue: it was so uneven!  I love film noir dialogue, but no time was spent getting it right with these modern actors (half were miscast--that chick from Gilmore Girls stuck out like a sore thumb!  Shame on her for sucking so bad!)  People were laughing at the dialogue.  Literally, three times I thought they were joking but they were being serious.  There is one good part: one guy gets shot with an arrow and it's the best part of the movie. Dialogue was tough too buy bc I didn't buy the environments, and when you don't buy that something is REAL, then everything else seems fake too.<br /><br />My biggest thing: If you're going to build an all digital city, make it look like its more than one block.  And the 3d environments were \\"gorpy\\" like some shots in Star Wars 1.  Sin City had no depth, it had half depth.  The clean 2d style of the comic books was there in ending panels, and they looked hot.  You have to go for it all the way if you're going to move away from the 2d, and they went halfway.<br /><br />HD doesn't look good with high key lighting.  Sin City is all about high key lighting.  I'm a huge fan of HD, but HD needs low lighting (Collateral, etc) to look like film.  The whole film seemed 3 layers away from believability.  Hence, the British TV slam. (I'm sorry, Robert!)<br /><br />Ok, now the big one.  The reason why this movie didn't work, ultimately, was the script.  IT WAS ONE LONG MONOLOGUE. Film is showing, not telling, and you learn every little thing that's going on in the minds of every protagonist.  For example, Bruce Willis is hanging out of a car trying to shoot someone.  Instead of just rockin' action, he has an innerdialogue! explaining why the other guy is missing hitting him--and then he tells you why his own shot will be on target, and gives you extra info about that even, and then he finally friggin' shoots the guy.  I was like, \\"Shoot him, Yellow B*st*rd!  Wait, no, shoot me!\\"  the whole thing felt so slow bc of this.<br /><br />When you finally get to action scenes, they narrate all the way through them!  Ack!<br /><br />My friend liked it, so this is just one person's opinion.  If you haven't seen it, maybe you should get your hopes way down, so when you see it, it wont be such a colossal disappointment.  I would advise people to only borrow the DVD from a friend.  Watch it on a small TV.  I was in the 4th row.<br /><br />After seeing the film, I think he gave Frank Miller co-credit (and Tarantino too) not to be nice, but to shoulder the blame.  Rodriguez is a genius marketer.  But a turd is still a turd, no matter how much you polish it.<br /><br />I challenge you Robert to not suck.  You have enough money now to make movies AWAY from green screens.  They will be horribly dated and laughed at in the future.  Take all that money and make something like Indiana Jones, not this.he has an inner dialogue! explaining why the other guy is missing hitting him--and then he tells you why his own shot will be on target, and gives you extra info about that even, and then he finally friggin' shoots the guy.

B000F48CD8|5.0|I bought the Album and then saw this band live and I can't get enough! These songs keep playing in my I-pod for weeks. Benson vocals are excellent here and White guitars are just amazing. There are some highlights moments here like: Together, Intimate Secretary (The best in the album in my opinion), Hands and Store Bought Bones; But don't get me wrong, the rest of the songs are excellent also. A classic rock n' roll album. The best news is that they will record a second album. This means that the Raconteurs are not a b-side project. A must have!
0553573411|4.0|The way I felt of this book is remarkably like how I felt reading Harry Potter.  Throughout the whole book, not all that much really happens but you find yourself reading and reading and reading.  Perhaps in search of something to happen or perhaps the writing is actually pretty good in that it presses the right buttons to keep you reading. <br /> <br />The  book is almost 700 pages long and I found the lack of things happening kind of disturbing.  This book was actually slower paced than the first one without anything really happening till near the end. There is literally no action either in the book.  The fights are almost always \\"hardly remembered\\" and rushed through.  Don't expect Cornwell style battles in this book.  I guess it's written in a more G rated way to appeal to girls who usually don't like the fighting. <br /> <br />There were quite a few other things that bothered me about the book that I chose to take a break and read another book before finishing up the trilogy, which I expect to be even slower.   <br /> <br />For one thing you can tell in many references in the book that Robin Hobbs is a major feminist.  I believe in equal rights but it's a bit tedious to be reminded over and over and over that women are 'just as capable as men', however subtle.  It's just awkward.   <br /> <br />The names of characters are nothing less than ridiculous.  I found myself rolling my eyes when I read 'Lady Mindful'.  King Bounty, King Shrewd.  I mean what is the point of having names like these?  All it does is detract from the seriousness of the book.  It's almost as bad as naming your main character \\"Princess Buttercup\\" or something.  Now Kettricken, that's not a bad name. <br /> <br />Fitz is supposed to be assassin, but I honestly cannot recall a single person he really assassinated except maybe that one killing in the first book.  And in any case, that killing was very minor and brushed through.  Killing Forged ones is hardly assassination but mere soldier's work.  And if he is really trained in the arts of stealthy killling, how the heck did he botch up killing two people that were practically sleeping?  That absolutely made no sense to me how he got caught in the end.  He's supposed to be really, really careful, more careful than Molly and others yet he chases Justin througout the keep during a  feast brandishing a knife.  Okay!  That's probably the most horrible part of the book which can be looked passed, I suppose. <br /> <br />Everyone important in the book knows Regal is a murderer and a killer, yet they stand around and wait for him to plot evil.  I mean how can someone plot to kill the king in waiting, killed the prince of the Mountain kingdom and ever plotting to take the throne not be punished at all?  It seriously makes no sense... <br /> <br /> <br />The ending was extremely predictable, hard to believe and you can tell Robin Hobbs loves dogs.  I'll definitely read book three, but this is in no way in the same caliber as George RR Martin(I haven't read Crows yet).     <br />
0440418569|4.0|The religious sections of this story made it very hard to read because with such a good book, this has a very odd view of God. I don't mind it since I'm strong in the Christian faith, but it was so.............well, appalling. However, besides that, the whole book was completely interesting, whether it was because of answers to some questions that were throughout the series, whether it was love, action, death, battles, evil schemes, and sad partings. Philip Pullman has a wonderful gift in writing, and he has a way of getting people to feel emotional (I weeped at the end).  A good conclusion to the series.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I'm sure most people interested in this genre have heard \\"Crazy\\", their first single off this album, but that is just the tip of the iceburg. Although it is a short CD, running time being 37:29, it is the best CD I've heard this year, even outside of this genre. The beats are more than Hip Hop or Rap, but would work great as Jazz and some as Rock. Danger Mouse has topped his previous work with this album, and the delivery of Cee-lo is unique and genuinely superb. My favorites from the album are \\"Just a Thought\\", \\"Smiley Faces\\", and \\"St. Elsewhere\\". Of course I also thought \\"Go Go Gadget Gospel\\", \\"Transformer\\", \\"Who Cares?\\", and the Violent Femmes cover \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" deserve an honorable mention. <br />  This is an excellent CD. If you haven't heard Danger Mouse before, this is the best your going to get.
B000002JPA|5.0|When I first got this CD and popped it into my CD player, I was blown away at the band's technical prowess. All of the band members are virtuoso musicians. James will leave you wondering how he could hit those high notes. John Mother****in Petrucci, thats all you need to know about the guitar. John Myung's basslines are killer. He even tosses out some solos! John Portnoy's drum patterns are complex and will leave a lot of drummers wondering how he's able to do this so quickly. Jordan Rudess wasn't in the band yet, but the keyboardist here is still awesome. Most of the songs are very long(duh,it's PROG METAL!), with the exception of 1 or 2 songs. This CD is so awesome and should be owned by any metalhead.
0895260131|5.0|I purchased this book after beginning my first reading of The Koran, in the J.M. Rodwell translation, and early in my traversal of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The book was invaluable in contextualizing The Koran, a work devoid of true poetry and driven by the engines of hate and jihad. Since the book, its history and consequences are the principal focus of Spencer's Guide, I will comment freely on both in the following.    Some apologists will argue that the Koran can only be understood in the original Arabic. that it is essentally untranslatable. I find this assertion pure nonsense. If the book is as claimed the word of God, it should be accessible to all people in all languages, not the exlusive property of those who speak a single language. It is not a mystical code whose incantations are understood only by a few. Indeed, the blunt savagery of the book, its over-the-top rhetoric and non-sequiturs, suggest the self-serving rantings of a deranged mind that by contrast make the text of Hitler's Mein Kampf appear as perfectly reasonable. Indeed, the book might well be dubbed Muhammad's Mein Kampf.    The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam does an excellent job of deconstructing the PC myths about Islam and the Crusades, demonstrating that today's Islamic terrorists are deeply imbedded in the core teachings of Muhammad and his successors. They are central, not marginal expressions of that tradition. Indeed, violent jihad is the only assured path to paradise in Islam, and that paradise is a whore house populated by permanent virgins dedicated to the jihadist.    A useful feature of the book is the periodic insertion of parallel quotes from Muhammad and Jesus, demonstrating the materialism and violence of the one and the spirituality and peacefulness of the other. Indeed, one does not have to adhere to any religion to recognize the massive difference in the moral quality of such teachings. Barbarous acts have been committed by Christians, but their deviation from the teachings of their faith is manifest; when barbarous actions are committed by Muslims, they are core expressions of the faith.     Indeed, under Muslim rule, the best non-believers can hope for is Dhimmitude, a state of subordination and near-slavery so intolerable that conquered peoples under Islam have invariably been diminished to tiny, embattled minorities subject to periodic atrocities. The rule under Islam is that other faiths are \\"separate and Unequal,\\" subordinate is every way to the dominant group. Again, this is not a matter of reformable tradition but of basic Islamic belief. It explains why Islam is at war with every religious and secular society in the world, without exception. Universal war. Universal horror. That is the will of Allah.    Spencer's book is further to be congratulated in making it apparent that Political Correctness, the bane of America's university campuses, is not merely a laughable anomoly but also a deeply dangerous deception, masking the major, substantive differences between the ideologies available today, and providing an opening wedge for the jihadists into Western societies.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This film is a sleeper. I don't know why, when it came out, it was not acclaimed by the critics. As I recall, folks claimed that it was too \\"heady\\", and tried to drive its themes down the viewer's throat a bit too enthusiastically.  <br /> <br />However, I found the film fascinating, as much for the changes from the graphic novel as for the care taken in its filming, casting, and cinematography. This film is one that will resonate with viewers for a long time after they've watched it. And, unlike the graphic novel, this one ends less ambiguously and with much less angst and more hope. <br /> <br />I really can't go into detail on what I liked and why...I just recommend it wholeheartedly. It's violent, but the violence is very stylized, such that even those who are squeamish aren't likely to be as disturbed by the bloodshed as they might be the images of Lark Hill.... But even these are not gratuitously violent. <br /> <br />Definitely five stars. Haven't enjoyed a film like this in years!
B00005UW9T|5.0|The music is very entertaining and the story really catches your attention. The plot is well put together along with the thrilling and suspenseful scenes of action/adventure. Anastasia (though she doesn't know who she is) is on a quest to find the truth about her past, and bumps into a few guys conning to get a girl to pretend she's the long lost Anastasia and receive their reward, if the girl fits the part. Together, they all go on the journey expecting to find what they're looking for, but on the way there, they face many challenging obstacles, growing closer together all the time. Even a little romance between the travelers comes in that threatens both their lives and having them never actually getting what they traveled the long way for. This movie is totally worth it!!!!
B000G75AE8|5.0|Well there wasn't much doubt that this would be great and it is.  There can be no repeating the significance of Slayer's influence on music at this point, but but if you're a fan more of the same is definitely good enough. <br /> <br />This is simply a mix of the styles they formed from \\"Reign in Blood\\" to \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\".  They are becoming somewhat more mature in their statements against christianity (at least they are basically coming right out and saying that its a myth - satanic worship isn't really plausible when you don't believe in it).   <br /> <br />In sum, this is probably just as good as anything they've done, but it doesn't have the impact because they've already covered similar ground.  A must have for true Slayer fans, and as good as any metal out there today.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Yes, I know Children of Bodom put out AYDY? in 2005, and while I liked it, it was a bit disappointing and I find this to be better. I and Snively already explained how awesome the other 4 members are, so let me introduce Pete Wilburg, the band's new keyboardist. He adds a new edge to the band's sound by making it a little more atmospheric. The one thing that angers me, though, is that some people said the band sold out because they did their first music video. How f***ing stupid is that?! It still sounds like the Opeth we know and love. Get this CD. Also check 'em out at Gigantour.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Al Pacino had appeared in \\"The Godfather\\", but was not yet the film icon that he started to become, in part, because of \\"Serpico\\".  Francisco Serpico was an honest Italian cop - courageously honest.  When he saw widespread corruption among New York Cops everywhere he was offered the opportunity to participate in the payoffs that the police were receiving left and right.  Initially, Serpico simply abstained.  The corrupt cops became of suspicious of Serpico - at one point in the film he is told \\"who can trust a cop who won't take a payoff?\\"  Because of his dedication to honest police work and a burning desire to \\"do the right thing\\" Serpico goes from a non-participant in the graft to actively fighting it.  He is understandably frustrated over and over when his reports to the police authorities are met with not much more than \\"you're doing a good job, Frank, keep up the good work and we'll reach out for you when the time is right\\".  The right time never arrives and Serpico, prodded by his friend Bob Blair (played by Tony Roberts), brings his complaints outside of the department - first to the Mayor's office, then finally to the New York Times.<br /><br />Serpico is treated by his fellow police officers initially as an eccentric goody-goody, then later subjected to death threats.  The film is bookended by a sequence in Serpico's life when he is transferred to a narcotics division then probably set-up for assassination.  The point-blank bullet that Serpico's partners lead him into doesn't kill him and Frank is alive today, lecturing at police academies and for organizations interested in having a \\"lamp lighter\\" - giving support to those who have the inclination, but perhaps not the courage, to speak up about things that are plain wrong.<br /><br />Now, thinking about the film later, I wonder what was going on in the minds of the other policemen.  Presumably, many of them didn't WANT to be crooked cops.  Certainly the \\"extra\\" money that they received was tempting - perhaps they looked at those extra dollars as compensation for what was not a lot of pay in a dangerous profession.<br /><br />Serpico is one of the most visible examples of someone \\"doing the right thing\\" against incredible odds, even as his life was threatened.  This is a good story that needs to be told and Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino tell it well.at those extra dollars as compensation for what was not a lot of pay in a dangerous profession.

B00005JLT5|5.0|Even more so being the true story of the wartime life of Wladyslaw Szpilman, taken from his book. The acting of Adrien Brody was impeccable as was, in fact, that of all the cast including all the old favourites like Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay. This is a film to be kept and viewed again and again, not least to remember the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews in that epoch. The cruel way in which some of the Nazi officers amused themselves by forcing old and crippled Jews to dance for them was very saddening. It is rather sad that the sympathetic German officer who was kind to Wladyslaw Szpilman in the final days of the war was not recognised and his term of imprisonment reduced.
B000002UJQ|2.0|I've been hearing about reviews that boast how great this album is. The editorial on Amazon even compares it with the major works of Pink Floyd. But don't let them fool you. Just like the rest of these bands of the 90s, listening to one would mean listening to all. There's basically not much difference between them. These bands have no soul nor any creativity and frankly they don't even the slightest trace of the spirit of rock. hype about these bands were just created by media for commercial sake. They are totally overblown. Try any album by the likes of the Kinks and you'd get more musical substance from these bands. 1 star for the music and 1 star for not having the grunge noise that those US bands like to use so much.
B000002H6C|5.0|Most people think that the heavily overrated Black album is Metallicas best CD. I completely disagree. This would be their best CD. Although this band was never as good as Megadeth or Slayer, this CD is still an epic in metal. This CD is their most technical release. The guitars are very complex, and while they cannot compete with the brutality of Slayer or the technicality of Megadeth, they are still complex, with lots of crushing riffs and wailing solos, as well as many melodic parts. You can't hear the bass very well, but the guitars more than make up for it. The drums are great. Too bad Metallica would follow up their best CD with their sellout album, then sink into the mainstream. This CD is awesome enough, but Rust In Peace is even better.

B000F6IOC0|3.0|Underworld Evolution is like playing a video game for 2 hours - when it's finally over you wonder why the hell you wasted your time in the first place. Than you remember, it was supposed to be fun. While watching this movie I didn't really think about the plot ( still not sure what was going on ), But later, after my brain thawed, I realized something: everyone dies in this movie. Only two people make it to the end. Bet you can't guess who! The first movie had it's flaws but it made it through with cool action and, of course, Kate Beckinsale in leather. Kate is back, blue eyes bright, as Selene a Vampire who is also apparently a \\" death dealer.\\" Scott Speedman is also back as Michael, who is half werewolf ( called Lycans ) and half Vamp. He's pretty much a nonentity, and the only thing of note he does is comeback from the dead. There is a sex scene, but it's soon over and we are back where we started: somewhere in the woods. America? Transylvania? I'm not sure. Not sure were the \\"Great War\\" that was supposed to go on happened, but maybe I blinked. There is a lot more violence in this movie, every few minutes some one gets a wing in the shoulder or head hacked off. As most ( ok, all ) of the characters are dead I find it highly unlikely that there will be a underworld 3. Sorry, don't cry. I suspect that this movie appeals mostly to guys of a certain age, most of whom would watch just to see Beckinsale in the nude. Watch it if you MUST know what happens to dear Selene and Michael, just don't think about later.
B000G1ALRK|1.0|I couldn't make it through this CD.  <br /> <br />It's so interesting how those who label themselves as \\"true\\" or \\"honest\\" or \\"from the heart\\" or (most ironic of all) \\"rebel\\" all seemed to be churned out of the same Wal-Mart-like mill of conformity. Country music has become flat-out depressing (this from a fan!). It has become so utterly predictable, so utterly bland, so utterly the same. \\"Regular guys\\" like Church really don't need to play their music. We already know what's going to come out of their mouths way before they sing a note. <br /> <br />Country music has become, sadly, a celebration of ignorance and intolerance, of W. and his war, of wrapping the cross in the flag (which is blasphemy, of course), of every man for himself (while simultaneously claiming to follow Jesus). Eric Church is just the latest carrier of that ignorant, dangerous message. It's just plain sad. <br /> <br />Oh, and it makes for really bad art.
0312305060|5.0|This is a novel to read and re-read. Yes, it requires a dedicated reader and I wouldn't call it a light read or a lightning read. Emotional, sad, gripping, all the things a great novel should be. The alternating timelines, fluidness and povs work here. It is hard to imagine why this novel wasn't rated unanimous 5 stars. Oh well. Every review seems to talk about Virginia Woolf, and I suppose that makes sense, but this is Cunningham and he's his own voice, a wondrous prose-master. The weaving of three disparate character stories into one is enchanting. More important, this is a novel you'll never forget. It will haunt you. Even the simple, disturbing burial of the bird. I have no idea as to the accuracy of the \\"historical\\" throughline focused on Virginia Woolf, but it doesn't matter because it feels dead-on real. I believed it. From my readings of Woolf, it felt like this was her. This is, perhaps, my favorite book read in the last year.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|To me, this movie demonstrates the importance of being comfortable with yourself, and it shows that each person in this world can be significant.  Not only that, but it does it in a way that is enjoyable to watch.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  In fact, I might just go watch it right now. <br />Is this review helpful? Probably not. But that's ok with me, so long as I get to give it 5 stars. <br />
0199267170|2.0|The first edition was incomplete and the Wells/Taylor team made editorial \\"choices\\" based on disproven assumptions and information.  Unfortunately, despite this and the continuing lack of a *decent* glossary, the second edition isn't any better.  Well-known FACTUAL ERRORS are still not corrected and the editors seem to feel they can take just about whatever liberty they fancy with Shakespeare's words (especially with King Lear) and nobody will notice.<br /><br />If you want a quality edition, spend more and get the Riverside or Arden due to their accurate and intelligent decisions over text discrepancies, insightful commentary and extensive glossary.
B000000HHE|5.0|This joint from De La Soul is a classic that will always have a place in the pantheon of Hip-Hop records.  It completly ignores all \\"gangsta\\" negativity, and wraps you in a soulful blanket of Hip-Hop magic.  If you like Hip-Hop, and hate Gangsta B.S. get this album.
B0002STNQ2|4.0|Prey is the best of the later Crichton's. Yes, as some have indicated, it's formulaic, right down to the \\"start up\\" venture capitalized company. But, it's just darned fun, anyway. And I like the home father spin (an extension perhaps of Disclosure, but this time a house husband instead of male employee sexually molested by a woman) and the first person treatment (unusual for Crichton). It all adds up to a fun novel. I don't buy the technology, or rather the \\"ultimate extension\\" of the technology, (certainly nanotechnology is here to stay), and it's another variation on Frankenstein, but getting past all that, it's fun reading, clever at times, more character-driven than any other Crichton novel, and on the whole a buzz (pun intended). I can't imagine anyone really coming away saying they were bored or uninterested. It's just too easy to have fun with. So, if it's formula, it's a formula that works, from the man who invented the formula. And, it's better to read a new -- and, as always, clever -- Crichton novel than to re-read an old favorite. Yes, it's familiar, but it's different enough to be enjoyable and fast-paced enough to be a quick read. I can see a movie in its future, almost certainly.
6304698690|5.0|This is a delightful version of the classic story, with some striking performances from Kate Maberly, Maggie Smith and John Lynch above all.    I was astonished to read some negative reviews, criticizing everything from child nudity to encouraging paganism.    To put things into perspective, there is a brief scene in which the ten-year-old Kate is getting out of the bath, and for a second or so, you can see her right nipple - I do not say 'breast', as she is not in any way developed at this point in her life. As a father of four daughters, I find it bewildering that anyone could even consider this an issue.    The only other fleeting glimpse of the young actress's chest comes in the first scene, in which she is being dressed by her servant in India, although this is a more distant shot. I can see how this might be considered gratuitous or unnecessary, but in terms of actual content, it barely constitutes even partial nudity.    The pagan reference is presumably the brief scene in which the young Colin makes up a chant to bring his father back from a vacation/business trip, as the children and the gardener are sitting around an outdoor fire, at night. The scene followed an earlier innocent discussion of the magic inherent in Life itself and the importance of embracing it, rather than hiding away.    The father then has a touching dream in which the spirit of his dead wife calls him back to the garden.    Hardly X-rated stuff.    This is a lovely version and avoids some of the needlessly dark excesses of some earlier productions.    Highly recommended.
B000F39MAG|2.0|Musically this is a very nice (but not outstanding) opera. However the staging and direction detract from it. One rather uninteresting set (it looks like a waiting room with a few chairs, a water cooler (from which cast members frequently get drinks for no reason) and a newspaper rack (the cast frequently reads newspapers which is probably more interesting than watching the action on stage) serves as a hall in Westminster, the duchess's private chamber, and a cell in the Tower. Costumes are not very fashionable modern dress. <br /> <br />The best way to enjoy this performance is to close your eyes.
0312323867|3.0|I read this book in two days, mostly because it was more \\"soap opera\\"-like than anything. Was it an \\"all time favorite\\"-no, but I would recommend it to a girlfriend going on vacation. <br /> <br />The main character, Darcy, is irritating but loveable and just when you want to slap her, she comes to grips with some  valuable life lessons.  Yes, I shed a tear during the birth scene, so if you ask if it's tear-worthy I'd have to say \\"yes\\", in a shallow corny way.  <br /> <br />I think I might read Griffin's \\"Something Borrowed\\" next.  I like the fact that her writing style is almost like two chatting girlfriends.
0385513755|4.0|The presentation of DaVinci Code in this format makes a difference. While I love the high concept and the absolute cleverness of the puzzles, when I originally read DaVinci Code in paperback, I was inclined to give a three. Why? The main character to me is too flat, even for a thriller, no real depth or convincing characteristics. Dialogue really bothered me. Where some novelists stop a novel to write mini-essays (Crichton comes to mind, but I enjoy those), long speeches from characters is less effective to me than narrative intrusion. But I still can't dismiss DaVinci code because it's just plain clever. I'm thinking more of the great puzzles than the outcome (the fictional outcome that seems to outrage everyone). I'm delighted (as a novelist) when a novelist breaks through in such a substantive way. Kudos to Dan Brown all the way. I'm a fan. But, frankly, I enjoyed his earlier novels far more (especially Deception Point and even Angels and Demons).<br /><br />But this illustrated edition is magnificent. Clues I \\"missed\\" were readily apparent. Things I thought were just \\"narrative license\\" became feasible enough for suspended disbelief when the prose is juxtopositioned against these lush illustrations. The Last Supper rendering is better than reproductions in non fiction books in my library. It was really nice to see a novel in this format, even at this price tag.<br /><br />And, again, I do think Dan Brown is high concept and successful for a reason. This just isn't my favorite of his novels. I read, recently, where he plans on sticking to this main character in all future novels. That's a shame, to me. His characters in Deception Point were far more engaging!<br /><br />Overall, a good investment for your library. For a good read, yes, it's still a good read in spite of my quibbles on character and dialogue. Why? Because you can't beat those delightful puzzles and the high concept pitch. But I see DaVinci Code as fun, not controversial.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I love this album as is. I think it sounds about the same as their older stuff. I don't think they have gone downhill. However with losing Tarja, I myself do have my doubts. I think she's irreplacable and they will most likely not find anyone like her again. I tried listening to other music in this genre and I always go back to Nightwish because they are the best there is. Some of their work sounds a bit tribal, but equally wonderful. I think this album is a masterpiece from beginning to end. This band is really talented and as it seems others agree because they are still around.
0312330537|5.0|When you start reading this book you start having all these feelings, desperation, loss, grief.  This guy makes you feel everything he's going through.  You visit the places he goes to.  You feel love or hate towards the other characters he's writing about.  The writer is so descriptive, you are placed wherever he's at.  I could not put this book down.  I wanted to know what would happen next.  I wanted to know how and when he'd get through any particular situation.  I know it will be a while before I get to read another book like this.  I hope he has another story like this to tell.
B00005AQE8|5.0|All I gotta say that this is a classic, I mean I've been a fan of Tupac since he dropped his first cd, and now when I pop this in the cd player almost 10 years later after it dropped, it still is better then most of what is out there today. Thats why I consider it a classic. Ya some may say that Tupac is overrated, and that his lyrical skill isn't that good. Ya and it maybe tru, but Tupac is a leader with his words, the content of his lyrics and how he expresses his pain, is something that a lot of people can relate to. Tupac was more than a rapper, was one of the most influentual person that rap music has known for a long time.
B000F48CD8|4.0|I think this album is supreme. I bought it because I read a review that said Jack White sounded like Robert Plant. Being a Zeppelin fan since 1975 or so and still my number one band, I had to hear it. I have Get Behind Me Satan by the White Stripes and I do like it, but this is far better. The collection of songs is so different that it truly is like listening to a Zeppelin album. Zeppelin was often pigeon-holed as a heavy metal band, which is so untrue -- they played such a diverse mix of music. FINALLY a band that is doing the same. When I listen to \\"Blue Veins\\" I do think of Robert Plant, not in the sense of imitation, but in the sense of inspiration. Good job Jack!
B000FG5Q1W|4.0|there's very few bands that can shift gears quite like Primal Scream.  from Screamadelica to Give Out... to XTRMNTR, these guys are always changing their spots.  Riot City Blues leans mostly towards Give Out...(minus the P-Funk influence) with its \\"Rocks Off\\" attitude, yet still has a sound all its own.  Standout tracks: Suicide Sally, Little Death, 99th Floor and <br />the New York Dolls nod Sweet Rock n'Roll...   <br /> <br />
B000GFLKF8|3.0|Despite a capable cast and a clever premise, \\"Inside Man\\" didn't quite work for me.  Like \\"The Usual Suspects\\" (a far better movie, IMHO) \\"Inside Man' relies on a chopped-up timeline and after-the-fact interviews to divert your attention from the fact that, basically, the story it tells isn't really very plausible.  How does the leader of the \\"robbers\\" know about the damning evidence in the safe deposit box? How does Case know that THEY know? And aren't we past the time when former Nazi collaborators make convincing villains? Case must be at least 85!  When do we stop?  When they're 100, or 110?  Get some new bad guys, Hollywood!  3.5 stars.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|after years of being into softer rock i started listening to metallica and loved it. a friend of mine suggested buying rust in peace as it was one of his favourite albums. after a week of listening to the album i hated it, i thought that the vocals were absolutely dire and ruined it for me. however after sitting down and listening to it again i found my slowly starting to come round and eventually found a way to my heart. my favourite track on the album is actually tornado of souls, after a blistering opening it progresses into a great two minutes of singing before what can only be described as a master class of guitar soloing by marty friedman. the album is worth buying for this solo alone. rust in peace..polaris is my next favourite with holy wars...punishment due and lucretia. hangar 18 and poison was the cure come next but unless you love guitar work the solos on hangar 18 can become straining. lucretia has a fantastic two part solo with marty doing the melodic first part with dave taking over with a faster solo at around the 2:55 mark. poison is a fratic song from start to finish with another great solo at the end.now for the bad part which keeps the song from a 5 rating, dawn patrol is just pointless and the lyrics on 5 magis and take no prisoners are almost unlistenable. overall this album is fantastic with marty and dave in great form. this is a 4.5 but with three songs not at the 5 mark i have to go for 4
B000093BDX|5.0|Regardless of the travails faced by the Beach Boys, we will always remember them as the clean cut boys they were in the early 60s.  Their music is timeless and simultaneously recalls an era when our society was more innocent.  This collection, one of the numerous compilations of Beach Boys songs, is also one of the better collections.  It may be the best single disk collection.  Some of the songs are in mono, but so was radio in those days.  I could wish for stereo for those few songs, but I am happy to have them in mono.<br /><br />Most of the music in this collection is focused on 1962 to 1968, which was the most creative period for the Beach Boys.  The list of classic songs is like a classic rock play list.  The list of top ten and number one songs is extensive.  \\"I Get Around,\\" \\"Help Me, Rhonda,\\" \\"Good Vibrations\\" and the 1988 release \\"Kokomo\\" all hit #1 on a U.S. chart.  \\"California Girls,\\" \\"Surfin' U.S.A.,\\" \\"Fun, Fun, Fun,\\" \\"Surfer Girl,\\" \\"Be True to Your School,\\" \\"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man),\\" \\"Sloop John B,\\" \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" \\"Getcha Back,\\" \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" \\"Dance, Dance, Dance,\\" and \\"Barbara Ann\\" all reached the top ten on at least one chart.  The remaining fourteen songs all had some measure of success as singles, with songs such as \\"Surfin' Safari,\\" \\"Little Deuce Coupe,\\" and \\"In My Room\\" visiting radio stations frequently yet today.<br /><br />This collection contains a combination of song versions.  \\"I Get Around,\\" \\"Surfin' Safari,\\" \\"Fun, Fun, Fun,\\" \\"Don't Worry Baby,\\" \\"Help Me, Rhonda,\\" \\"Be True to Your School,\\" \\"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man),\\" \\"Barbara Ann,\\" \\"Do You Wanna Dance,\\" \\"Do It Again,\\" \\"Wild Honey,\\" \\"Darlin',\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\" are all mono versions.  \\"Don't Worry Baby,\\" \\"Help Me, Rhonda,\\" \\"Be True to Your School,\\" and \\"Barbara Ann\\" are the single versions.  Some of the songs have newer stereo mixes from various years.  Those songs and the year of the remix are \\"California Girls\\" (2002), \\"Shut Down\\" (new stereo mix), \\"God Only Knows\\" (1996), \\"Sloop John B\\" (1996), \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" (2001), \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" (new stereo mix), and \\"Heroes and Villains\\" (2002).<br /><br />These songs favor the 1960s.

0156027321|4.0|I really like this book.  I was fascinated, and was almost late returning to work from my lunch break due to being engrossed in the story on more that one occasion.  I would have given this book 5 stars if not for the ending.  I was simply let down by end, which, I suppose was what Pi felt, too (not to spoil the story for those who have not read it yet).  I was also confused by the interview transcript at the end.  I guess I don't really need a happy ending and neatly packaged closure, but it would have done my heart good.  That said, I will read Life of Pi again and again.  It is an exciting, sometimes heartwrenching story that will hold on to you.
0140187537|3.0|This book didn't knock me out as did other Steinbeck works, but it had enough to say about double-dealings, the battle between contentment and seeking more from life, and social interactions to make it ring true. It is a comforting slice of life in a time that brought back memories to me of my own childhood, especially the views of a small town in the early sixties. The plot had some moments that threatened credibility and some of the characters were cliches, especially the cops, the drunk, and the banker who should come with his own evil music cues. Furthermore, I found Margie Young-Hunt to be a bizarre invention - a classy town skank who is embraced by the town's women as a trusted friend and part-time sooth-sayer and men as, well, a classy town skank, but she is arguably the most interesting character as well. The book picks up greatly towards the end after you suffer from a bit too much meandering and overly eager exposition. Not a starting point for Steinbeck, but a good place for further exploration.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Yes, Slayer is back in full form with the return of drummer Dave Lombardo. Slayer released several average albums upon the departure of Lombardo. They weren't bad but not as good as Reign In Blood, South of Heaven or Seasons In The Abyss. Flesh Storm starts off the album with the upmost speed and aggression.  <br /> <br />There isn't a bad track on the whole album. Yes, folks it's that good! Slayer fans will not be disappointed. My favorite songs are Flesh Storm, Catalyst, Jihad, Consfearcy and Cult. I have anxiously been waiting for this release. I went and bought it at Best Buy the day it came out. This is my favorite Slayer release next to Reign In Blood. There are lots of fast heavy songs on this album. <br /> <br />I just saw Slayer in Houston on the Holy Alliance tour. They rocked like always. I'm looking forward to new albums from Lamb of God on 8/22 and Hatebreed on 8/29. Go buy this album you won't regret it!
B00004NRWH|5.0|Most people consider this to be the first album by Nickelback, but Curb was actually before this one (1996). However, this was the first one (2000) on a lable that could push them (Roadrunner).  I heard Leader of Men and Breathe a few months before they started getting radio play and I knew this band from Canada was something to contend with.  Little did we know silver side up was going to be a massive pop/rock success, and bring nickelback into everyhouse hold, from teenage girls singing along, to 20 something metal fans rocking to the cruching sounds, to Mom and Dad finding something they like as well.   <br /> <br />  Highlights from this album are Breath, Leader of Men, Old Enough, and Worthy to Say.   <br /> <br />For first time fans (hearing them on ALL THE RIGHT REASONS, or THE LONG ROAD), you might not like this right away, but it will grow on you quickly.  For those of you who heard them back then, and just havn't picked this up, what are you thinking, BUY IT NOW!!!!!
0743454537|5.0|I've read so many reviews regarding the ending of this book.  One review states \\"a ridiculous ending that requires absolutely no decision making by the characters at all.\\"!  Well, I'm not sure what world these people live in, but I found that part of the genuiness of the story.  Life happens around us everyday, making decisions for us that we have no control over.  To incorporate this reality into her story, Jodi has given us what we truly ask for when we let a book overtake us.  We want to be transported into another REALITY, one that isn't our own, but something that make our hearts wrench for the characters in which we've emerged ourselves in. Something that truly makes us feel the story.
B000002U9W|5.0|This pink floyd is one of my favorite ones, next to Umagumma and Momentary Lapse Of Reason.  However, I have been listening to and buying floyd material for 18 of my 30 years.  This is probably not the first album one should pick up if they want to hear a good sample of the songs and sound that made pink floyd a huge worldwide success.  But it is an album that fans need to have to see just how creative Floyd can be.   <br />   My absolute favorite song from any pink floyd album is \\"IF\\"  on this album, and Fat Old sun is in my top five.  The title track and Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast are both good examples of where Floyd started to sample and mix more experimentally that before, and where they explored their what mix they needed to get their 1973 masterpeice dark side.  Pink Floyd have gone on record before as calling this album as Rubbish, but there is none of that here to a fan.  This was a necessary transition to go throug to find where the band was going.  Buy this album after you have some of the other mainstays, and you want to hear what acid rock sounds like.  Jam On!!!!!
B000683VI4|4.0|Do not get me wrong. I love this movie.  I had a couple of problems with it. <br /> <br />First of all as good as Gena Rowlands and James Garner were in this movie, and they were great, I could not accept they were the old Allie and Noah. <br /> <br />Secondly why didn't Allie write to Noah?  She knew where he was when she left.  Perhaps she thought he did not want her anymore but she wanted him and it was so important that one would think she would have written.  Of course then there would be no movie! <br /> <br />Thirdly, I wanted to see more of them.  They were great together and so when she came back why did she come back.  The last scene before that she is telling Lon she knows she should be with him. <br /> <br />What made her come back? <br /> <br />Fourth, how old were their 3 children? If Noah and Allie were close to 80 in the movie how could their kids be so young? <br /> <br />Other than these things, and due to the magnetic attraction to Noah and Allie I found myself watching this movie over and over again.  I NEVER DO THAT. <br /> <br />So I love it, I love them and I wish there could be more because that relationship is what love is all about. <br /> <br />Thanks to the makers of the movie
0895260131|5.0|I would like to clear up a misunderstanding by a reviewer called Cornelius Canton Lll \\"Count Julian\\" who cited the following as an example of a peaceful Surah in the Quran:     Surat al-Kafirun(109) \\"Say: O disbelievers! I worship not that which ye worship; Nor worship ye that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which ye worship. Nor will ye worship that which I worship. Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.\\"    The important fact the above reviewer is not aware of is Surah 109:6 (\\"Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.\\") had been abrogated (cancelled) by Surah 9:29. The peaceful sounding Surah Cornelius Canton Lll \\"Count Julian\\" quotes is an earlier Surah and was \\"revealed\\" to Muhammad while he was militarily weak in Mecca.    Additional Commentary on the review by Cornelius Canton Lll \\"Count Julian\\":    Earlier I commented on Mr. Cornelius Canton Lll \\"Count Julian\\" who presented Surah 109:6 from the Quran as an example of a peaceful Surah. I pointed out that Surah 109:6 had been abrogated by Surah 9:29.     There are also Surahs, namely  2:256 and  5:32,  which are frequently quoted by the deceptive and crafty, so called  \\"moderate muslims\\", to deceive gullible Westerners, as examples of the peaceful nature of the Quran. The fact of the matter is that all the above Surahs had been abrogated by Surah 9:29.    The so called \\"moderate muslims\\" are more dangerous as they are very deceptive and slippery. In the first place, the existence of moderate muslims assumes the existence of a moderate Quran. But there is only one Quran, and it is a very lethal one. If you do not believe me, please go and read the Quran itself (not commentaries written by dishonest liberal leftist intellectuals such as John Esposito, Juan Cole, and Karen Armstrong etc.) In any case, the so called \\"moderate muslims\\" are playing the role assigned to them through a division of labour among muslims.    Now, the other issue I want to comment on is that of Mr. CorneliusCanton Lll \\"Count Julian\\" presenting Matt. 11:21-24 \\"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee\\" as an example of the violent disposition of Christianity and the Bible.     Here, Mr. Cornelius Canton Lll \\"Count Julian\\" commits a logical fallacy by not supplying complete information on the issue i.e. by not saying that the above quotation from the New Testament is fixed in Time and Space, in other words, it is contextual. The above quotation cannot and does not serve as a guiding principle to any Christian sect.     On the other hand, the Surahs (verses) in the Quran are not only very violent, but they are also open-ended, and declared to be timeless and Universal. That is why they served, serve, and will serve as guiding principles in the past, present and future Jihads.
B00005JOQS|5.0|I was not even remotely excited about seeing another Superman movie.  My 17 year old grandson told me he was taking me to see it so I agreed to go.  Was I ever surprised!!  Was I ever Amazed!!  Was I ever glued to my seat!!  Now I can not wait for the movie to come out so I can purchase it.  It is a \\"Must Have \\" for our home!!  I am thinking that we will probably want to go again before it leaves the theatre.  You won't want to miss it, ok?
B000002KET|5.0|This cd in particular for Sabbath was one that divided the fans. The inclusion of keyboards were brought to the table on this cd. Now up to this point, Black Sabbath had really not ventured in with the synths and electronics. It was always just hard hitting metal in every aspect. That is by all means the same on this album except for some keyboard here and there. How can you deny these legends.<br /><br />This album is very solid. There are only two songs which I don't care for to much, but even then they aren't too bad. Those two are Fluff(I just really couldn't ever get into that song), and Who Are You(If the effects were left out in that song, I think it would have been excellent and helped out immensely).<br /><br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath-10/10- What can be said of this masterpiece. Easily one of the best Sabbath songs ever. Begins with an extremely catchy riff then transfers into a nice soft piece and then gets extremely heavy. Amazing song.<br /><br />A National Acrobat-9/10- Another great piece. Guitar is especially good on this song.<br /><br />Fluff-7/10- For some reason this song never really struck me as a great instrumental. I think they could have done better with this one. I find myself skipping over this song every time I listen to the cd. It's respectable though.<br /><br />Sabbra Cadabra-9.5/10- One of the highlights off the album. You can definitely see the blues/jazz influence in this song. They make it sound excellent. Great vocals.<br /><br />Killing Yourself To Live-9/10- Great song. This song reminds me of Looking For Today. They sound a bit similar. Chorus is very catchy and will be stuck in your head.<br /><br />Who Are You-7.5/10- It's not a terrible song. It's not catchy and is quite weak. I don't care for the effects either.<br /><br />Looking For Today-9.5/10- Great song. The whole way through is solid. Great solo by Tony. Chorus is the highlight of the song. The flute on the verse actually mixes in very well with the guitar riff on the verses.<br /><br />Spiral Architect- 10/10- They end the album off with an excellent piece of music. Starts out very slow with acoustic guitar, builds up a bit, then breaks out with a great guitar riff. Excellent way to end off the album.<br /><br />If you don't have this classic album from the founders of metal, go get a copy. You will not regret it. It's well worth the money, even though it only has eight songs on it. It actually clocks in at right around 43 min. The album cover is awesome too!tar riff on the verses. <br /> <br />Spiral Architect- 10/10- They end the album off with an excellent piece of music.

B00005T30L|4.0|I had mixed feelings when I watched this movie. I loved it because no other movie had every portrayed the lifestyle of the outsiders so accurately. This was how I felt in high school. Stand back and feel good about making barbed sarcastic remarks on all the normal people, it makes you feel superior, and at the same time, utterly depressed. This movie broke my heart into little pieces. Also the humor was fantastic, I LOVED the scenes in the art class which made fun of the hokey concept of high art.  <br /> <br />However, I'm not sure why this movie exists. Sure I enjoyed it but when it came down to the end it gave no hope, no real story, just a moving picture of real life. The pacing throughout the movie was remarkably slow (which is true to life). But I wanted to get something out of it, because if the movie was trying to be profound, it still had no message. It left me feeling empty and depressed. Maybe this is part of why it is good...but I honestly don't like a movie to make me feel like taking painkillers.  <br /> <br />I gave it 4 stars because I respect it for being such a brave little movie and for it's fantastic sense of humor. but don't expect a feel good movie.
B000E97X66|5.0|Since most every other review (justifiably) praise all the songs, I'll spare you and just say this: <br /> <br />If you want to be a genuine rock-singer/musician, listen to this album and take notes!
B000G75AE8|4.0|I own every Slayer album from Show No Mercy up to Christ Illusion. It's no joke when I say Reign In Blood, South of Heaven, and Seasons in the Abyss are Slayer's best albums. Everything after that (Divine Intervention--God Hates Us All) was just ok or for Slayer fans only.<br /><br />I knew that when the song 'Cult' was released, Slayer were back to making great music. Christ Illusion is definetley one of Slayer's best album in a very long time. With the opening Flesh Storm, they waste no time getting their point out there.<br /><br />There were a few songs I didn't really care for which were the slower 'groove metal' style if you would. Most people don't really care for that style of Slayer but cmon, at least it's not Metallica.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are looking for the golden days of Slayer you need Reign In Blood, Sout Of Heaven, and Seasons In The Abyss. There is no metal head out there who isn't influenced by Slayer. Otherwise they wouldn't be metal heads. Christ Illusion is actually a good enough album if you want to start listening to Slayer.<br /><br />STILL REIGNING!!!
B0000931QR|5.0|This album is stunning! The songs are once again, catchy, clever, literate, romantic and often funny. The arrangements on this album are even more elaborate and innovative than in their previous effort. I swear this band just keeps getting better! The vocal harmonies are as lovely as they have ever been; the lead singer's voice is amazing, strong, beautiful and sexy! The Beatles influence is still there, and the songs are very well crafted, yet sound very different from the previous album. The first three singles are outstanding; \\"20 de Enero\\" (\\"20th January\\"), \\"Puedes Contar Conmigo\\" (\\"You Can Count On Me\\") and \\"Rosas\\" (\\"Roses\\"), but the rest of the songs are just as good. This album (and its predecessor \\"El Viaje De Copperpot\\") is one of those albums where every song is very very good. This one of the Best, if not THE BEST Spanish Pop/Rock Band in the world!! I refer to their music as \\"Pop/Rock\\" for two reasons; the \\"rock\\" more than most \\"pop\\" bands and their songs have a complex struture that reveals craftmanship. This is not your average pop band!! These guys and gal actually write their own songs and play instruments; they don't just sing. This band is a real treat and a rarity amongst all the crap that passes for music in the Spanish Pop world today. I heard they just put out a new album. Can't wait to hear it!!
B00004XPPE|4.0|The movie is excellent, focusing on the strategy and tactices of nuclear brinksmanship.  Henry Fonda wears the role of President well. <br /> <br />How would YOU atone for the act of accidentally bombing a major city? <br /> <br />[In an earlier review, I thought I had caught a filmography error, but this is not the case] <br /> <br />March 3, 2002 Reviewer: \\"rhyre\\" (Cincinnati, OH)  <br /> <br />Enjoyed the movie as much as when I first saw it in the 70s. <br />I only encountered two problems: <br /> <br />1) Original film quality <br />A digital restoration of the original film print is in order, I noticed a lot of graininess and flecks in the image. <br /> <br />2) Larry Hagman seems to be slightly confused with Gene Hackman in the filmography under 'special features'. <br />For example, Larry Hagman is credited with an appearance in the 1978 Superman movie. Lex Luthor was played by Gene Hackman. <br />[This is not true, Larry Hagman AND Gene Hackman both appeared in Superman: The Movie, in different roles.  Larry Hagman played the character of 'Major']
B00003CXC7|5.0|I don't usually give classics high marks because movies to me are visual more than cerebral entertainment, and technology, production and might I even say, directing, is just so much better all the time.    However, Rear Window is one of those movies which transcends time, maybe because it only takes place in one setting there isn't much technology could do to improve it. And perhaps the grainy quality of the movie actually enhances the creepy atmosphere. The movie set itself is masterful, especially considering it was done in 1954. And gosh, Grace Kelly, they just don't make movie stars like that anymore.    So, what's good about it?  It puts you in the position of Jefferies, who is basically helpless. We are voyeurs together with him, however, a horrendous event occurs which eventually involves him, and being helpless, he cannot escape...... That's it in a nutshell, without telling you the story, which if you want to know you can read the other reviews.  I don't think any of Hitchcock's other movies have stood the test of time as well as this one because there pretty much isn't anything you could do to improve it. As I said, the poorer quality of 1954 production values only adds to this movie - making this movie any better would only make it worse.    Goofs:  1) When Jefferies changes his lens, he just puts it camera side down on a table. No pro worth his salt would ever do that, or use a telephoto over binoculars for that matter.   2) An in home nurse who also prepares a sandwich?! Bring me back to 1954! OK, her sandwich better be better than her 1 minute massage.  3) And this is the worst goof of all. Unbelievable. There isn't anything wrong with Jefferies' leg, it's his brain which is the problem.  How can any sane man reject a Grace Kelly who's throwing herself at him, c'mon, get real! That's just real bad script. If Rosanne Barr was playing Lisa Fremont, then yeah, I'd believe it, yeah then I'd try to get to SE Asia ASAP lobster dinners notwithstanding. (Or maybe he just doesn't want to leave that apartment and Ms. Torso.)     Enjoy.

B000FS9FCG|3.0|Well, if you like your villain as some sort of Wizard of Oz - Big Brother Stalinist Nazi - Ranting Phoole with a ham handed George W. Bush smear and your hero as a self-justified terrorist who believes that destroying symbolic infrastructure will somehow revive a moribund culture and that swords are more effective than guns, well, this movie might be for you.<br /><br />I watched the movie because I am a fan of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (and I didn't think it was possible that the brothers who made the first Matrix could make a worse movie than Matrix 3, but I was wrong).  Portman and Weaving both do the best they can with the handicaps they are given (such as an idiotic plot and pretty weak dialogue), but ultimately their talents are wasted.<br /><br />John Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.  The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.  It thinks that they yell and scream and threaten and kill everyone indiscriminately.  Really, they have to combine murder with a kind of charisma and off-balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.  Anyway, Hurt is certainly what the script asks him to be, but the character is a waste of his abilities.<br /><br />Weaving only gets to use his voice and I am not sure he was ever the body wearing the mask.  If he was, why?  He is not needed under the mask anymore than James Earl Jones had to wear the Darth Vader costume to create such a memorable character.  There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.  He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.<br /><br />The best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).  He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.  However, here it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have traded on a cheap kind of paranoia that resonates with their audience, but this one is incredibly dumb.  If you actually believe that political leaders can make reality out of media messages despite what is actually happening in the real world, well, this movie will seem like a documentary, I guess.  But I would then feel sorry for you and encourage you to get some help.  Each movie these brothers have made since the first Matrix has gotten weaker and more pathetic.  Maybe it is time to turn off their money spigot.  Of course that won't happen because they turned $50 million into $130 million at the box office plus all the DVD sales and rentals to people like me.<br /><br />Oh, well.it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.

1878424114|1.0|There is a huge flaw in this book. Below is a quote:  <br /> <br />\\"When you make any choice...ask yourself two things:  First of all, what are the consequences of this choice that I'm making? In your heart you will immediately know what these are. Secondly, will this choice that I'm making now bring happiness to me and to those around me? If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answer is no, if that choice will bring distress either to you or to those around you, then don't make that choice.  It's as simple as that.\\" <br /> <br />If you follow this advice you would stall any sort of personal growth.

B000065U1N|4.0|This movie seems to be a portrayal of the modern day soldier's esperiences in war being fought in urban settings.  A real eye opener for those of us who still think of war in the terms of  WWII and other wars of that era.  This is exciting, eye opening and frightening all at the same time.  Definitely not recommended for a bed time story or for young children.  It contains the story of war and all that goes with fighting a war.

B00005O5U9|4.0|Queen's legendary lead singer, Freddie Mercury, was diagnosed with AIDS at the end of the 1980s.  When the 90s rolled around, Mercury was aware that he didn't have much time left, but insisted that the band continue their work until his death.  Mercury's final album turned out to be INNUENDO.  Though the album received lukewarm reviews from critics, it was received extremely well by fans, who praised it as one of Queen's finest efforts.  That it is.  INNUENDO is more of a pop album than most of Queen's releases, though it does have a number of hard rock numbers, namely the excellent title track and the great \\"The Hitman\\".  The majority of songs on INNUENDO are either highly emotional (\\"Don't Try So Hard\\", the marvelous \\"Show Must Go On\\") or very playful (particularly the delight \\"Delilah\\", an ode to Mercury's cat, or the wonderfully eccentric \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\"), but they all sound extremely optimistic considering Mercury's state at the time.  In the end, though it still has its flaws, INNUENDO is a powerful and very emotional album and a wonderful way to bid the beloved Mr. Mercury farewell.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album is what, 14 years dated? Yet young new listeners LOVE this album. Its funky, its hard, its rebellious, full of passion. This album alone, not RATM has its place in history, is a classic already in many avid music fan collections. It was ahead of its time, it was the band's best, ultimate life effort squeezed into one album. Unfortunately they could never live up to it. Released in a time of jaded generation X, rebellious punk/undustrial movement, it GOT the recognition it deserved. Not overrated, but maybe under appreciated. There are no synthesizers, sampling of music. All the funky sounds played through REAL talent. It blows away any alternative / industrial music produced today. Even new young fans ask - where are bands like this today? There just arent, so sad. RATM, holds its legendary place is music history. Paved the way for the Linkin Parks, the LImp Bizkits, the Korn - but no one could touch RATM's style.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's debut album was one of the best-selling albums of the 1970s and is one of the most popular rock albums ever released.  It's also one of the very finest.  The mastermind behind the album is Tom Scholz, Boston's guitarist and the father of arena rock.  Brad Delp's multi-layered vocals are wonderful; in fact, the production as a whole sounds fantastic.  Just about every song on the album is a classic -   the album's opener, \\"More Than A Feeling\\", is one of the very best rock songs ever recorded.  Musically and lyrically, rock music doesn't get much better than this, so it goes without saying that BOSTON is a must-have.  It's undoubtedly one of the greatest rock albums of all time.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Well I'm from Spain and I don't know if you will understand this. I think that Beauty  and the beast is the best Disney movie just because...It's the best!!! Firstly because the story is very well and the romantic story beetwen Belle and the Beast is the best I've ever seen. Sometimes I think where can be a woman like Belle? where can I find her??? She is pretty, intelligent, brave, affectionanated, a good friend and of course she is very kind.  <br />Another thing that I would like to stand out is that songs are really good as well in English as in Spanish.  <br />Well I cann't explain how much I like this movie. THE BEST.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever.  I saw this movie in the theater when I was ten and twenty years later I still love it.  Great 80's music too.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|The are many good things about the movie, but for me, they were overshadowed by the politics.    Is the government in \\"V\\" really a government sort of like our own?  ...a government which controls our minds and uses invasive laws to threaten our freedoms?    Those who have a profoundly negative view of modern societies, sympathize largely with anarchists, and enjoyed seeing the White House blow up in \\"Independence Day\\" may enjoy this film.  But if you see the positive things that western society has accomplished, if you sense that history has been steadily moving in the direction of progress, education, and increasing freedom and prosperity for citizens of 1st World nations (and most others as well), then this movie's prescription for social change through terrorism may seem alarming to you.    I was unable to enjoy Vendetta because I feel that it is trying to level undeserved criticism on Western Governments and Liberal Democracy.  The Government in \\"V\\" is meant, it seems, to be a caricature of the U.S. government...though I find the two hardly similar.      Still, I have many friends who see the U.S. government as somewhat like the government depicted in this movie.  They're paranoid about government conspiracies, and if you feel the same way, you may get a kick out of this movie...but I implore you to consider the differences between western governments and the governments that usually oppose them and I hope you will ask yourself which governments the totalitarian state in \\"Vendetta\\" really resembles.  I feel that any fair interpretation will find the governments of the West to be far freer, but that's me.      ********************************  other thoughts    I think about who might enjoy a movie like this, and this comes to mind:    Anti-social people  Timothy McVeigh  Tim Treadwell (The subject of \\"Grizzly Man\\")  Osama Bin Laden    There are many who, unhappy with modern society, can see only the destruction of it as a remedy.  I see this as frightening and incoherent.      What would Martin Luther King Jr. think of this perspective?  What would Gandhi think?  ...and Jesus?    Frightening because those who end up doing horrible violent things: Osama Bin Laden, the Columbine Killers, McVeigh...have rationalized their actions along similar logical lines: the oppressing powers are evil, so that justifies any response.  But what if people die in the blown up buildings?  What if the act doesn't actually accomplish anything?  What if the murder of all these people is based on political opinions that not everyone agrees with?  Why should people die because some turkey has an opinion?    Usually criticisms of the West are based on the opinion that life was better before modern society, or that we had more freedoms once...or that our prosperity is hurting the world...or that life is getting worse and worse...    But there are many, many, many people who disagree with this point of view.    It is my opinion that this movie advocates violence that no good can come of.  Many many people may disagree with me.  They have that right, but they do not have the right, to blow me up.
B000F48CD8|2.0|I was very disappointed by this album.  Jack White's impressive song writing ability kowtows to the pop mediocrity of Brendan Benson's.  This album sounds very much like Benson's \\"The Alternative to Love,\\" which isn't awful, but isn't up to the level of even the least of the White Stripes' efforts.  The album does feature some nice touches that are due, unquestionably, to White's influence, but overall, this album is more suited to a fan of Top 40 music: <br /> <br />\\"I've got a rabbit, it likes to hop  <br />I've got a girl and she likes to shop  <br />The other foot looks like it won't drop  <br />I had an uncle and he got shot.\\" <br /> <br />These are not inspired lyrics. <br />
1401302378|4.0|This was a very interesting extension of Anderson's article in Wired from a few years ago, building on the premise that selling a few of many things could be just a lucrative as selling a lot of just a couple of things. By extending the sales curve way out into the tail (hence the title) organizations can tap into many niche markets. I am fascinated by the emerging digital culture, so the parts of the book I found most interesting were the descriptions of the innovations being made by iTines, Netflix and yes, Amazon. You may not agree with Anderson's assessment completely, but he makes a compelling case and deserves to be read.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|Spike Lee is the last filmmaker you'd imagine making a slick heist film for a major studio and yet that is exactly what he's done with Inside Man, a cleverly staged and executed thriller. What's even more incredible is that this intricately plotted movie was written by first timer Russell Gewirtz. Lee fans worried that he's sold out can rest assured that even though the filmmaker is working for a studio this is hardly your average director-for-hire gig. And, as if to reassure his fans, Lee has teamed up with Denzel Washington again - always a good sign as they work so well together (this being their fourth collaboration).<br /><br />Washington plays a smooth talking smart guy who is trying to figure out what the bank robbers, in particular Russell, are up to while dealing with influential bureaucrats, like White, breathing down his neck. He displays the ease and confidence of an actor in top form and is wonderful, as always, to watch. Clive Owen is also very good as the ruthless bank robber with a keen intellect. Is he messing with the cops? Is he following some sort of ingenious master plan? Both? It's an interesting role for the actor as he spends a good chunk of the movie with his marquee good looks obscured by a mask.<br /><br />One of the joys of watching Inside Man is seeing all of these A-listers interact with each other; all under Lee's expert direction. The plotting is complex and brilliant as Gewirtz puts a new spin on the \\"perfect crime\\" while also paying homage to other heist movies like Dog Day Afternoon and Quick Change. Best of all, like The Usual Suspects, he ends the film with a delicious twist that is extremely hard to predict. Inside Man is a solid, thoroughly entertaining thriller with a brain - a rarity in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />There are five deleted scenes that include more footage of Frazier and Mitchell interrogating the hostages and how they perceived what went down. There is also an amusing scene where Frazier and Mitchell discuss the meaning behind a Bob Marley song and also a collection of local news reports on the bank heist.<br /><br />\\"The Making of Inside Man\\" is a pleasant notch above the usual electronic press kit material. Producer Brian Grazer provided the director a way to work successfully with a studio, which he hadn't done for some time. Also included are excerpts from a cast script read-through and rehearsals that sheds a little light on the creative process.<br /><br />In what is quite possibly the most enjoyable extra on this disc, \\"Number 4\\" is a lively conversation between Lee and Washington about the four films they've done together. You can tell that they're good friends by the way they joke with each other in a relaxed manner. This is a fun, engaging extra.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Spike Lee. For a director it's all about making choices and Lee talks about particular shots in the movie and why he chose them. He speaks fondly of the cast without being to sycophantic about it. This isn't the chattiest track ever recorded but Lee talks enough to make it worth a listen if you're a fan of the man and his movies.discuss the meaning behind a Bob Marley song and also a collection of local news reports on the bank heist. <br /> <br />\\"The Making of Inside Man\\" is a pleasant notch above the usual electronic press kit material.

B000G75AE8|5.0|This album is way better than I thought it would be.  The three song sampler put our earlier is actually only a slice of the greatness of this album.  I have listened to this album now straight for well over a week.  I have not put it down and just blast it over and over.  Here is my take: <br /> <br />1.  Flesh Storm: 10/10 - Instant Classic.  Fast as heck. <br /> <br />2.  Catalyst: Catchy, fast, and brutal. 9/10 <br /> <br />3.  Skeleton Christ:  Pure Slayer riffage. 10/10 <br /> <br />4.  Eyes of the Insane: Rather boring.  6/10 <br /> <br />5.  Jihad: Brilliant and Crazy.  10/10 <br /> <br />6.  Consfearacy: Amazing, Crazy, Fast. 10/10 <br /> <br />7.  Black Serenade (My favorite!): Dark, Evil, Great. 10/10 <br /> <br />8.  Cult: Instant Classic 10/10 <br /> <br />9.  Supremist: Over the top fast! 10/10 <br /> <br />This album is pure Slayer. Integrity, Speed, No Sell-out!   <br />Slayer has once again delivered the goods and proved once again that they are the last band left standing from the Big Four of Thrash.   <br /> <br />THANK YOU SLAYER FROM A FAN OF OVR 15 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br />

B000062YAZ|5.0|This is both an easy and challenging review to write. It's easy because this is quite simply the finest and most important extreme metal album ever released, so praising it is certainly not difficult. But it's challenging too as surely everything that can be said about it has already been done so many times over. So I won't bother banging on for too long.    Simply put, this is Slayer at their absolute prime. 10 songs over only 29 minutes may seem less than satisfying, but every one of those tracks is a masterpiece and it's just so easy to press play again when it's all over.    Jeff and Kerry lay waste with awesome riff after awesome riff, shredding solo after shredding solo. Dave's drumming is perfectly crushing and monstrous. Tom's vocals are much more defined than previously and yet lose none of their aggression. None of these guys ever had or ever would sound as good as this again. It really is a case of all the perfect ingredients coming together at the perfect time to make the perfect album. Highlights are the classic \\"Angel of Death\\" and the closer \\"Raining Blood\\", but everything in between is also pure class.    The earlier Slayer albums had a similar energy to this, but lacked the precision and production quality. The later albums, while still containing some awesome material, lacked the consistency and pure unadulterated venom that this slab scorches the listener with. While the controversial nature of its lyrics (in particular the references to Nazism) may offend some, I personally see it as a far more successful direction than some of the very immature Satanism messages of earlier releases.    It's just astounding how many times I've witnessed magazines and websites list their top albums of all time to find \\"Reign in Blood\\" towering at the top. In Terrorizer magazine, not only did the magazine writers select this as their top album of all time, a reader vote found around 50% of readers thought \\"Reign in Blood\\" was the greatest album ever recorded. So really, I don't have much to add to that. If you don't own it, you simply must do something about that.
0747582882|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time.  I could relate to Elizabeth so well.  I was so sad when I finished it as it was the kind of book that you don't find very often.  Gilbert is a very good writer, exceptional in fact, at how she can communicate her thoughts, feelings and psyche onto the page.  That is a real art and talent as few writers have that ability. I have read other reviews complaining about the book and not describing the countries she visited - Hello!, it is not a travel book! It's a memoir and if you are not interested in learning about other people and their lives and experiences then don't read the book to begin with.  Judging how other people deal with their own personal struggles in life is childish.  Everyone is different and handles their life challenges in different ways. None are right or wrong just different, so grow up.

B0000028RR|5.0|This is probably the greatest rap-metal album ever made.Period. I was brought up on bands such as Slipknot, Limp bizkit, and Linkin Park and while the latter does a decent job of combining such elements, Ratm are the real deal. I stumbled upon this fascinating band whilst playing GTA San Andreas. Upon hearing \\"Killing in the Name\\" I checked it out on my PC and bought it later that week (about two years ago).  I've never looked back. It's their best effort because it is the most funky and every bit rocks (maybe bar settle for nothing, but even that is cathartic).I thought Zack was gonna lose his voice on that track :D. Each song has so much energy and emotion, its nigh impossible not to get drawn in. I also love how Zack's voice is quite high and enthusiastic, such as the little \\"ughhhs\\", \\"c'mons\\" and \\"YEAHs!\\" littered throughout the album. It makes for an inspiring listen, especially since how most other nu-metal bands (Korn) are so depressive. The rythym section is amazingly solid and if you listen carefully you can hear little nuances and fills (especially from Timmy C) during Take the Power Back and Bullet in the Head, which make it seem even more sublime. Morello shows off his more conventional solos (Freedom) alongside his \\"random\\" ones (Know Your Enemy) and combined with his catchy riffs it gives the album great variety. Wilk's drumming is minimalist, but thats suited to his funky style (I couldn't imagine him using a double bass). I should also mention the CD has been mixed extremely well, you can actually hear each instrument independently of one another. The best of 90s? Its a sure contender
0805066691|5.0|I'll keep this simple and straightforward.  Dee Brown's book should be required reading for every citizen of this nation.  It's that good.  I rank this book with Howard Zinn's  \\"A People's History of the United States.\\"<br /><br />I read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee shortly after it was published, and its illusion shattering impact has stayed with me to this day.  The section debunking the \\"hero\\" George Custer is more than worth the price of the book.  Be forewarned, however, this well researched book is full of heartbreak, broken promises, betrayal, genocide, and sadness on an enormous scale, and it is powerfully written.  It will affect you profoundly on a variety of levels.  Read it, and weep, and know.  It's the least you can do.

B000GCFO0I|4.0|We all have favorite books, video games, and movies, but let's be honest.  How many times have we seen those favorite things slaughtered, either by way of make, remake or just plain stupidity when they have come to the big screen?  How utterly refreshing to see a movie made with its fans in mind!  Finally, a director got it into his head to make a movie with an intention on appealing to fans of the particular genre, in this case a video game. <br /> <br />While some may credit this as a negative, I see it as nothing but a positive.  The plot and storyline almost completely follow the video game and as such those, like myself, that remember playing it and being genuinely disturbed, can sit back and fully appreciate it.  Likewise unlike some video game-turned-movies, I did not feel the movie felt overall like a video game in its portrayal.   <br /> <br />Haven't played the original video game?  Well, then who knows how you may feel?  One thing's for sure, if you enjoy having a at least a slight sense of feeling creeped out, you will enjoy this movie, hands down.
B000G75AE8|3.0|Christ Illusion.    *** 1/2.    Slayer's first album with Dave Lombardo back is a mixed bag. The drumbeat has been building of anticipation since Dave jumped back on board in '03 when Paul left.    Everyone was expecting greatness. What you get is something that is part Reign, part Seasons and part Diabolis. At times it really works. At other times, continue reading.    The Great: Flesh Storm, Catalyst and Consfearacy which are easily the best of the album. In listening to the album over and over again I know why I like those so much. They are classic Slayer, meaning no lame guitar downtuning.    The Great: Dave Lombardo. Enough said.    The Not-So-Great: Skeleton Christ, Catatonic and the rest of the tunes that exhibit serious guitar downtuning. NUmetal kids may love the downtuning, to me its annoying as hell. Slayer's sound is totally destroyed when Kerry goes into detune mode.  The detuning also does not work with Tom's voice either.    The Not-So-Great: Lack of consistency. The album does not flow well. Its a strange mix of classic Slayer and 1990s Slayer. The Diabolis style groove of Skeleton Christ and Jihad don't coexist very well with the opening tracks.    The Not-So-Great: Tom. I miss creepy lyrics like 213 or Dead Skin Mask. The religion theme is getting a bit old.     Final Opinion: Great attempt at a revival. Only it gets marred by a dodgy midsection. A little reworking, along with blowing out that damned guitar detuning and keeping the album in the classic Slayer tuning. Then this would've been a classic for the ages.    Instead its a mixed bag.
0803730098|4.0|This book is great as young children love it. There is lots to talk about and a nice story too. The riming isn't the best and could be told as well in normal story telling.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Quite simply this is a good album. I heard it today and I am very impressed; only one problem, where is Naz on this album. <br /> <br />I wish Tupac was still alive to see the fun he has created !!!
B00003CWNR|4.0|some might pass over this movie because of of the material on abortion, but I think that would be a mistake. True, there will never be a movie where they show the typical face of abortion, women who have other options but don't take them, but at least this film doesn't ram its views down your throat. Rather, the story is a lot like the music, gentle and relaxed, moving at the pace of the wide eyed innocent, Homer. I love Lasse's movies anyway, and wasn't disappointed with this one. He brings you along without any high drama, infusing things with a sweetness most directors pass over in favor of over the top action and dialogue.  <br /> <br />Give this movie a chance. It's a deftly crafted piece with a slew of great performances. A nice surprise.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I think it is great that he is releaseing the Star Wars flims on DVD in the form that the crying masses have asked for. \\"We want the movies of our childhood back...\\" \\"How dare you change your own film...\\" So what has Mr Lucas done he gave you what you asked for. There was no THX in 1977. There was not %.1 sound so you get what you asked for the films the way the were shown in 77 80 and 83. I will buy them agian because I think this was VERY funny. Of course there will be changes and a new box set. What do you think the\\"Fox Archive Collection\\" was started for. Thanks George!
B000002LGW|5.0|Originally I had 101 on tape, years ago.  I had to get it on CD, and I still love it.  Nothing has changed, I just remember being in high school and loving Depeche Mode, they helped me through my angst,and the music has really stood up to the test of time!!
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Rocky is without question,the best underdog movie I've ever seen,and was good enough to spawn four sequels.The film is about a Philedelphia club fighter named Rocky Balboa,who is going nowhere,living in a rundown apartment in the suburbs of Philly,trying to win the affection of shy Adrian(Talia Shire)and settling business with a corrupt loanshark.Soon after,he is given the chance of a lifetime when he is offered the chance to fight the champion of the world.Rocky accepts and trains hard under the watchful eye of his trainer,Mickey.I don't want to ruin the ending for those of you who haven't seen it,but it's a knockout.
B000FSME1A|3.0|Though I got from this DVD what I wanted - a commentary by Francis Coppola, I'm far from happy with \\"The Complete Dossier\\". Why on Earth are both versions split into two halves and spread out over both discs? This is completely non-sensical. I'm very aware of the 'quantity vs quality' debate on a single dual-layer DVD, but there seems no good reason why both versions couldn't have occupied their own single discs, and still included the commentaries.    I also have to take umbrage at the earlier reviewer/DVD promoter Kim Aubry's attack on people here knocking The Complete Dossier's lack of the \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" documentary as well as bemoaning its reduced aspect ratio. It's all very well for Mr Aubry (who just happens to have been heavily involved in the making of \\"The Complete Dossier\\" [I wonder if it was he who came up with that title?], and was paid to produce/direct the features, and will also probably receive countless free copies to give to friends and family), but it's us - the consumers - who are being asked to put our hands in our wallets, and we have a right to moan about a film, we all love, having a distinct lack of features we would expect any DVD entitled \\"The Complete Dossier\\" to have.    This is not a 'Complete Dossier'. There are no recent interviews with either Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Scott Glenn, or Harrison Ford. Even the featurette \\"PBR Streetgang\\", including interviews with Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Laurence Fishburne & Sam Bottoms, only runs for a paltry four minutes. The deleted scenes look as though they've been scraped off the cutting-room floor and dragged through the transfer process without any hint of restoration, and the criticism regarding the lack of Eleanor Coppola's behind-the-scenes documentary feature is legendary. But my main gripe has to go back to both films being split over both discs - an incomprehensible decision, regardless of any increased bit-rate, Mr Aubry!    Still, I would definitely recommend Apocalypse Now fans buy this two-disc set .... just don't throw away your previous discs of either the 1979 or Redux versions, that have the entire film on one disc!    I'm now just waiting for \\"Apocalypse Now: The Ultimate Dossier\\" to be released. Will you be involved in that too, Mr Aubry?
B00000G3PL|5.0|This DVD collection is awesome.Complete with all four action-packed films,the series is about two cops who obviously can't work together without screwing up.Gibson stars as Martin Riggs,a suicidal cop who blows his top without warning,and when he does,you better be far away.Glover stars as Roger Murtaugh,a police captain who is without warning,teamed with Riggs and the two face many trials and tribulations,including stopping drug lords,ex-soldiers,and a karate-chopping crime lord.Those of you who like bumbling cop movies will love Lethal Weapon.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This pride and prejudice is the finest I've ever watched.The Mother  is not overdone at all but is still her same old self.Lidia is not over done like she is in the A&E version with Colin Firth. Kity is very good. Mary is not over done like all the other mary's did you ever notice that all the bennet sisters were fine robust pretty girls all that is except Mary who is allways sooooo plain thin and boring.inthis one she has the same caracter only she isn't rediculously thin or ugly...Like the one from The A&E version(Colin Firth)Jane is the best Jane ever, no one could ever get a better one. Unlike the A&E version she does have a chance at being prettier that Elizabeth. Elizabeth is perfect she has the perfect everything like her better than A&E's. Keira Knightly and Rosamond Pike are beautiful as elizabeth and jane.Mathew Macfayden is the best MR.Darcy ever He looks yunger, more handsome, and thinner/taller than colin firth.Ah Mr. Bingly is such a breath of fresh air after the A&E one. He is perfect.all the others mr Bingly's i felt embarressed for they weren't very good actors. Mr bennet I like better he seems more responsible and more kind like when he hugs mary after saying she can't play the pianon at the ball. All the other fathers ust seem so much more heartless.So all in all this is the best one yet and is definatly worth seeing for parents with kids they do have 2 bad words in it but no inapropriate sceens especially with lidia and Wicome. Unlike A&E version again.And lidia just has a dirty mouth in the A&E one. so I definatly recomand this movie to the whole family.
0446678430|2.0|This book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than I am.  But while I was reading, I kept asking myself, \\"When's he going to get to the point?\\"  The first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something I thought was unnecessary.  The bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.  Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.   This was the only part of the book I was interested in.  To me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with \\"fluff\\".  However, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts.  I would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd.  I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise.
0143039830|4.0|\\"The New York Trilogy\\" isn't a novel. As the name would imply, it's a trilogy of novella length short stories, each revolving around a similar theme. While externally, each is pinned to a common geography - namely the city of New York - internally, they tackle the more complicated issue of self-identity and self-worth.  <br /> <br />The building blocks Auster uses to create these stories hinges on the concept of creating a setting where the protagonist is pulled into a mystery and forced to take the role of detective:  <br /> <br />In \\"City of Glass,\\" our narrator is an author who gets a call from someone looking for a detective, and he decides to play along. The unfolding mystery turns the city itself into an antagonist, while carrying our hero into an ever-devolving exploration of self.  <br /> <br />In \\"Ghosts,\\" our narrator isn't playing at being a detective, but is in fact an actual detective. He is, however, cajoled into performing an investigation similar to City of Glass, which takes him out of the traditional realm of detective work, and sets him up to essentially spy on his own reality.  <br /> <br />Finally, \\"The Locked Room\\" sees a return to the author as protagonist, as he begins a literary (and eventually physical) search for his one-time childhood friend. With a few nods to the first story, Auster attempts to tie the trio together in a fairly loose bundle.  <br /> <br />As with many post-modern stories, \\"The New York Trilogy\\" is grounded in the psyches of its protagonists and to a certain extent its author. It would probably be impractical, if not impossible, to discuss these stories in terms of plot, as the action that moves them isn't what's happening in the ebb and flow of each story's structure, but what each character is forced to face mentally.  <br /> <br />If there's any shortcoming to Auster's writing, it's in the way he attempts to immerses his readers in his character's search for self through a fairly transparent mechanism of repetition. This is most noticeable in \\"Ghosts,\\" where he essentially covers the same ground for twenty or thirty pages.  <br /> <br />Even so, Auster's writing is unbelievably dense and enjoyable to read, and his stories are uniquely reflective of our society and culture. For this reason, I can see \\"The New York Trilogy\\" slipping into the canon of college literature courses over the next couple of decades.
0143036742|3.0|This novel has received a lot of publicity but sadly, it disappoints. The characters are nothing but stereotypes. The story is overstretched and repetitive. The strand about tractors has not been integrated into the rest of the novel. For a first novel, perhaps it isn't bad, but it's a frustrating, irritating read.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I Rented this DVD and watched it, It was absolutely an breathtaking visual musical ride. It is The 1994 PULSE concert, where Pink Floyd got together and put on a cool show. Here, they preform some of their classics such as MONEY, COMFORTABLY NUMB, SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND and more. Plus, it's nice to see a DVD of what was the best concertof the 90's.
B00006JDVV|3.0|There be dragons in this movie. And who doesn't like dragons?<br /><br />Dragons are essentially flying dinosaurs, and who doesn't like dinosaurs? They're just winged ones, but not those wimpy, weird looking Pterodactyls. Dragons of legend and ones Hollywood most often portrays have real heft and menace, besides just looking totally cool.<br /><br />In the 1980's thanks to a resurgence in Sword & Sorcery movies like Conan: The Barbarian, Beastmaster and Willow, and the RPG Dungeons & Dragons, dragons were suddenly everywhere. Not only in the movies, but in every gift shop known to man. Walking into any Hallmark store was like waltzing into some medieval cave. The shelves were chock full of porcelain dragons, ceramic dragons and the pricey, but exquisitely rendered silver and pewter dragons. Is Hallmark still dragon central? In any case, Reign Of Fire has dragons to spare.<br /><br />And what beasts!  Aside from that, there's not much more. Production values are great, the acting serves what there is of a story and there's plenty of well executed action. Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey mostly elevate the so-so script, and McConaughey gives his crazed military commander character some spark of humanity. Alice Krige shines all too briefly as Bale's doomed Mother. I would have loved to see her survive as one of the dragon fighters, but alas she's the dragons first victim.<br /><br />Reign of Fire's premise is intriguing. At first glance, it appears it's merely \\"What if Dragons really existed afterall?\\" And yes, there's that. But what I took away from it in a larger way was: What if man encounters an animal he simply can't conqueror? What if that animal sends him back to the stone age and starts a holocaust of proportions which not even nuclear weapons achieved? We're so confident our higher brains and technology makes us masters over the whole animal kingdom.<br /><br />But what if...
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Listening to muse gives one a small sense of the Divine. I love Muse, and I love this album.  What they are capable of conjuring  with their music is utterly astounding.  There are a lot of bands and albums that are good and lovable, but Muse belongs to that far more elite group of artists that are capable of truly creating something that is not only good but is alive and scintillating.  As far as this album is concerned, I find no disappointment.  BH&R is full of excitement, albeit often dark, and is very tight and fluid.  It does have a rather political vibe to it, but it does not give the listener a sense of preachiness.  This is no let down from Absolution, but is a continuance of Muse's great music making abilities.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Wow, what a thrill to see a movie that delights in the visual and doesn't let the images just lie flat on the screen.  This movie is not an homage to noir, it IS pure, unrepentant noir.  The twisting dialogue, the complex plot, the gorgeous photography, the femme fatale with the flower in her hair, the amoral vixen, the gang war and even the clueless mother of the vicious gangster are all here - transported to a high school setting but still set firmly in LA.  This is no \\"Clueless\\" or \\"Ten Things I Hate About You\\" which watered down their original plots for a younger audience, this is noir in all its gritty splendor.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt is the best thing about this movie. He's completely believable as a high school gumshoe out to solve the murder of the dame... um, girl he once loved.  The rest of the cast does a great job, notably Meagan Good as the girl who is \\"Bad News\\" and Lukas Haas as the Pin.  Nora Zehetner is partially successful in her role but her acting isn't quite as strong as the others.<br /><br />Great movie that was all but ignored in its original run (did it even play theaters?)  but deserves a second life on DVD.  Pick it up.
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir is a master at turning historical information into well-versed, readable material.  I bought this book and could not put it down for two weeks.  We all learn such skewed facts about Henry VIII through ill-informed resources.  Weir's unbiased, often shockingly truthful account of this period really opened my eyes to what it must have been like to live in King Henry's court.  I can't recommend this book enough!
B00062IVKS|5.0|Raging Bull is possibly the finest boxing film that you can see, and have to see. The feature was released in 1980 and was directed by Martin Scorsese, with Paul Schrader(also wrote Taxi Driver) and Mardik Martin with the writing credits. The film won two oscars, one for Robert De Niro and one for Thelma Schoonmaker for best editing. Both were rightly deserved wins, but one of the most outrageous decisions from the acadamy was the best director award, Scorsese was robbed once again, but I'll speak about that later. This is considered Martin Scorsese's best feature, and possibly his most popular and most acclaimed film to date. This film is shot in a beautiful black & white picture and also has colour footage in only one segmant of the film.<br /><br />Raging Bull is a film that depicts the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta's boxing career, which spanned from the 1940's to the 1960's, the film doesn't just follow his boxing life, but it also follows his life after boxing, when he retired. The film starts off with Jake(De Niro) in the 60's as an overweight man reciting some words for an upcoming show he is preparing for(you find out what the \\"show\\" is in the movie), emediatly after his last words and a puff of his cigar, we are thrown into the 40's with a gritty boxing match. He's taking a beating, but turns around to knock out the other fighter. He leaves his opponent dazed and confused, but still loses the fight. His brother Joey(Joe Pesci) who is also his boxing managertells him to stay in the ring, all the spectators and Joey think that Jake was the victor and that he won the fight fair and square. Eventually a riot breaks out at the fight and we are hurled into a chaotic moment in the film. Afterwards we see Jake's marriage and living problems at home, him and his wife spark an argument which leads into a fight. Later on he meets a young girl named Vickie(Cathy Moriarty), who he dates and eventually marries during the film, the rest of the film follows his troublesome life with boxing, weight, his brother, and his family. The film is a telling of his rise and fall of the boxing world and his personal life. Remember, this is all based on true events, and is all from a book based on Jake LaMotta's boxing career.<br /><br />The cast and crew's efforts to make brilliance are accomplished with a brilliant performance by De Niro, where he put on weight, trained with Jake LaMotta and could've actually been a professional boxer, he was wonderful as LaMotta and definately deserved the oscar for best actor. Joe Pesci's excellent performance as Jake's supportive brother Joey is not a weak performance at all, their chemistry on screen is wonderful to watch, and you get a clear idea of how they got along and how they fought in their personal lives involving boxing, family, friends, and Vickie, Joe Pesci was nominated for best supporting actor as Joey. Cathy Moriarty is Vickie, Jake's young girlfriend and, later on, wife. She is also a stunning example of fine acting when under pressure with great actors and a great director on board. She is another actress that's showed great chemistry on screen with her fellow actors and their characters, she is actually the perfect Vickie, a brilliant casting choice, she was nominated for best supporting actress as Vickie. The script is a great piece of writing and storytelling, with character writing and story plot that creates tension, love, loyalty, betrayel, and distrust between the characters. The cinematography is an eye opener here, and keeps you focused and inlove with the film, plot, and it's characters, with brilliant camera work in the boxing scenes(only used one camera in each fight scene), and an excellent switch from black & white to colour during the home video footage of them. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is some of the finest editing ever, with complex fight scenes put together, and just carefuly put together with a love for the film. Scorsese's direction is indeed noteworthy, he managedto guide inexperienced actors like Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty through a tough task of a very technical and important film. His imagination for the perfect fight scenes, visuals, and performances caused stressful problems, especially the boxing sequences with one camera, but paid off with his most perfectly made film that will be remembered in cinema history for generations to come. It is radiculous that he did not win the oscar for best direction, instead it went to Robert Redford for Ordinary People, Scorsese's brilliance and tireless effort isn't rewarded once again. But for someone this good, you don't need awards to prove that he's brilliant. The music is classical music that gives the film another beautiful edge to it, finishing off the film's perfection.<br /><br />The cast and crew's blood, sweat and tears are rewarded with a film that pleases audiences with rivetting performances, stunning visuals, brilliant direction, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography. The use of drama and exilarating boxing scenes blend well with dialogue, story, and beautiful music. A beautiful film in every aspect, and will bring you back time and time again to crave your lust for more black & white films you don't get too often, and makes you wonder why Scorsese hasn't won an oscar yet. This is a film anyone can enjoy, and will find a place in your heart. This is an inspiring film that you should definately watch and add to your DVD collection. The opening sequence alone is another reason to purchase this. A Must-see.<br /><br />This \\"Ultimate Edition\\"(special edition) is definately worth buying, It has all the facts the film enthusiast needs to know, and every other person that is interested to learn about the film's grueling process. It has a highly detailed, but greatly awarded commentry by all the people who were involved in the film(including Scorsese and Jake LaMotta), it has a feature called \\"Before the Fight\\", which is another rewarding doc about the casting, writing and preproduction of the film, with how they started the idea to adapt LaMotta's biography. \\"Inside the Ring\\" contains the highly detailed look at how the actors trained and prepared for each carefully planned boxing fight, as well as the extremely tough shooting of each fight that was carefully planned and expertly finnished. \\"Outside the Ring\\" is simply a behind the scenes look at the film, and all the interesting stories and facts that happened on the sets and production period. \\"After the Fight\\" is a look at the impact that the film made on audiences, and a look at how the sound and music were carefully planned together. \\"The Bronx Bull\\" is the making of documentary, bassicly everything before that is summed up into a 30 minute doc.<br /><br />\\"De Niro vs. LaMotta\\" is shot by shot comparison with De Niro and the real LaMotta in the ring, this bassicly follows the accuracy of the film.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|I didn't buy Gnarls Barkley right away because although I really liked \\"Crazy,\\" I didn't know what to expect in the rest of the songs.  I read a review in a magazine that said the music was really fresh and so I thought I would give it a shot...I am really glad I did.  The collabo is so perfect - the beats are really really awesome and the lyrics seem thought out and fun at the same time!! The whole cd has a really groovy feel (not to sound old school but hey)  I would recommend this cd for people who just wanna chill and listen to some really cool beats and production.  I think my favorite tracks have to be \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\" for the incredibly upbeat sound to it, \\"St. Elsewhere\\" for the great lyrics, ahh I like them all it's hard to choose!  I really like the sound and vibe of \\"Necromancer\\", too.
0895260131|1.0|I can't even rate this book, if I could give it 0 stars I would have. The writer definitely has some biased agenda, he clearly lacks objectivity. Unfortunately many who read (as I see from the reviews) and who will read this book will believe the author's claims. One thing I can say to intelligent individuals who read this book is to be critical when you read anything. His alleged quotes from the Quran should not be taken literally as he describes them because as we all know the Quran is originally in arabic and he most definitely read a translated version, now we can all bet that there are many translated versions of the Quran that are biased. From what I know that in arabic sometimes words can have many different meanings and that every verse in the Quran was revealed in a certain occassion. That's why for someone to read the Quran they must also read the stories behind each chapter and each verse's revelation. Another important point I want to make is that the word Jihad in arabic does not mean holy war, the word literally means struggle and in Islam anything that is done to better someone or someone's life is considered Jihad including things such as work, education. In its most widely known context Jihad is a defensive term not an offensive one, meaning that Jihad is only proclaimed when somebody aggresses against muslims. To all those that claim that Islam is an anti-semitic religion I really suggest that u look up the word semitic and know that Hebrews are not the only semites in the world and one of these semitic groups are arabs, which prophet Muhammad was an arab. Also Islam doesn't alienate itself from its predecessors judaism and christianity and it traces its roots and lineage to abraham. I really suggest that people should go and research information about islam from objective credible sources especially its history (claims that Muhammad fought Jews and Pagan Meccans in the arabian peninsula are true but it was him who started the aggression, The pagan Meccans tortured Muslims to the point that they had to migrate Yathrib, and even then they were still sending armies to fight them. As for the Jews, Muhammad has made agreements with them that they should not aid the pagan meccans in their aggression against Muslims, but despite that the Yathrib Jews broke the agreement and tried to kill Muhammad.) Islam is a tolerant religion, nobody can deny the Jews, Jewish literature, and philosophy flourished in Muslim lands while Jews were being executed and tormented in Europe and Christian lands. In fact to this day even after 50 plus years of ongoing struggle between palestinians and Israel there are still jewish populations living in many muslim lands including Morocco, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. Also, how many people truly know the contributions of Islam and Muslims to modern day sciences, math, literature, chemistry, physics. If islam truly is an evil religion like this book claims then how do u explain its contributions to humanity. Again, I cannot stress enough how uncredible, and biased this book is. I do not suggest that anyone should read it unless they just have a blinding hatred and objectivity and truth just doesn't matter to them. If you really want to know about what is going on with Muslims and the middle east in particular (rather than just blame Islam) I suggest reading The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East by Robert Fisk or A History of the Modern Middle East by William Cleveland.Meccans tortured Muslims to the point that they had to migrate Yathrib, and even then they were still sending armies to fight them.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|I really enjoy the music and everything, but I just wish that the tracks were longer than what they were. The longest track was about 2 min and 45 sec. But I was surprised how fast I received the package. It came in a day early than what it said on the tracking order form. You guys do a great job! thanks
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I went to see Brick knowing nothing about it.  The first thing I noticed when sitting down was that I was the oldest person in the theater by probably 2 decades!  (I'm in my late 50s.) What it turned out to be was wonderful neo-noir - and I am a huge fan of late-40s, early-50s noir films.  It was as terse and well-acted as anything of this genre that I've seen - with several delightful twists I didn't see coming. <br /> <br />***SPOILER*** <br /> <br />I LOVED the scene where the lead actor's mother is in the kitchen talking to her son about being out of orange juice - talking to him like he was a kid (which he was) while he is having a \\"meeting\\" with \\"The Pin\\" at the kitchen table - the juxtaposition is hilarious, clever, and a needed moment of comic relief. <br /> <br />***END SPOILER*** <br /> <br />Run, don't walk, and get a copy of this one.  Great stuff!
B000GFLKF8|1.0|Danzel Washingotn is one of the best actors no doubt about it but this was the second worst movie he ever did as the worst was Missisipi Masala, he was not up to his normal spirit it was as if he was doing a comedy and the worst of all the sound track didnt fit to the movie + the script whoever wrote was absolutly no big deal, to me was a waste of time + wouldnt maintain in my colection.

B000G6O2TS|5.0|My partner and I are currently in debate as to which of the newest World of Knights figures from Schleich - Taurus or Dragon - is the most impressive. My chips lie on Taurus, but the ball-and-chain/other-half is saying Dragon. Regardless, both of these are fantastic toy soldiers. This is a remarkably detailed piece, with an amazing level of historical accuracy in the armor and armaments of the 14th/15th century. It's made of highly durable plastic, and overall it's rugged enough to withstand the rigors of entertaining youngsters. I bought several other members of the Schleich Knights series for my two nephews, aged 4 and 6, so there is minimal concern that the detachable parts could be dangerous for young children. While the pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics, this fellow, and his compatriot (Taurus) don't fall into any particular camp. The level of detail, for this price, is actually quite surprising. Some care must be taken when unwinding the wiring that affixes the toy in the box, as it can scuff the paint on the hooves of the horse. Matched with the jousting set, as well as any other Schleich jousting knight, it makes a wonderful display piece.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've been an Emmylou fan since I was a pup playing her Luxury Liner LP on my GE Wildcat stereo.  She is and always has been a national treasure in my mind.  The pairing of her voice with Mr. Knopfler is creative, unique and beautiful, as art should always be.  Mr. Knopfler's songs Red Staggerwing, This is Us, and the haunting and exquisite If This is Goodbye are brilliant.  Also, track #6 written by K. Rhodes and Ms. Harris is a must hear for anyone who ever knew and loved a child.  A love anthem to cherish and enjoy over and over.  TLKeith

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I've been reading the reviews and frankly I don't understand how so many people could hate this album.  I'll give it to you that this album sounds a lot different than Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen, but the fact of the matter is that the band has taken a turn towards a more melodic sound, which happens to be more popular than their former musical stylings.  You can't blame a band for the type of people that are listening to them, if a 14 year old likes to listen to A7X, more power to them.  I'm pretty sure your grandparents aren't pissing and moaning if you come across a Frank Sinatra song, or your parents flip out because you are wearing a Pink Floyd shirt and are listening to Dark Side of the Moon while watching Wizard of Oz.  Seriously, you people that completely bash the band because they don't sound \\"metal\\" and that they sound like whining babies. I remember a man Axel Rose who sounded even more annoying that M. Shadows, but that doesn't mean I automatically hate GNR.  And as for the guitar solos, I'm pretty sure that after a while, every guitar solo is gonna sound the same, there might be similarities in the types of solos, but they aren't ripping off solos from other guitarists. <br /> <br />There are many good songs on this album.  I especially like M.I.A. because for some reason the guitar riffs bring me back to the 8-bit days of Mega Man 2.  The solos are outstanding on this album and the lyrics are more melodic than they were on the previous two albums, which I think the band pulls off wonderfully, especially in Seize the Day. <br /> <br />For all you \\"metalheads\\" out there, just because A7X became popular doesn't mean they suck.  Bands like Pantera, Iron Madien, Slayer, GNR, Manowar, Black Sabbath, and plenty of others are being listened to by the same kids that are listening to A7X. Does that mean that every band that I've mentioned sucks?  I dare you to tell me that Black Sabbath is a woosey, baby, group that 14 year olds listen to...because any band, underground or mainstream, would rip your head right off of your body if you told them that, and Ozzy would bite it off.   <br /> <br />If music is good enough, it's going to get popular; it's inevitable.  And just because you can't write your own music or don't have as much talent as these guys, don't cry about it on amazon that it's your constitutional right to call this band any name you want; the fact of the matter is that A7X is a group of talented musicians that are living a dream.  They worked their way up, producing a sound that they liked, and that people liked.  Just because they aren't as \\"hardcore\\" as they used to be doesn't mean they are any less talented.  Any man can scream his brains  out with music playing in the background, hell, I'm pretty sure my little sister could be the lead singer of a metalcore band that yells over power chords.  But it takes talent in order to sing melodies and harmonies, which is something that a lot of music has been lacking as of late.  He still screams, but it sounds like music. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I like metal and metalcore, and I always have, but a lot of stuff, including the underground stuff, sounds very similar.  There is only so far a band can go by screaming their brains out about killing people, praising dark lords, and living in a dark abyss. A7X took it to a different level with City of Evil, and I think that this is probably their best album (very close with Waking the Fallen).      <br /> <br /> <br />Well, I guess that's just one mans opinion, but I hope many other people feel similar to the way I do.  Music is always changing; Some bands become popular while others are left in the dust.  If you wanna say that a band is bad because they become popular and you see them on MTV, be my guest, but I can't wait until another band you like goes mainstream so you can cry about it again.  <br /> <br />-Edele
0515123447|2.0|Maybe my expectations were too high; The Killing Floor did win the Edgar for best first novel, but I guess it must have been a weak year. Lee Child's first offering is typical of a first book, and that's the problem the story is typical. Nothing surprising or new here. It is both predictable and implausible. The book's hero, Jack Reacher, is boring. I think he is supposed to be mysterious and troubled, but I found him grating and arrogant. The book reads like a B action movie. The whole plot not only stretches the imagination, but also one's grasp of reality. It seems that Child has never left New York City and understands neither the American justice system nor small town life. Maybe I missed something, but I found The Killing Floor to be a sub-par thriller with flat characters and rather large plot holes.
1401302378|3.0|Four stars for the writing, and two stars (barely) for the content. <br /> <br />It's an interesting book, well and clearly written, but focused (to a fault) on the entertainment business. Most products in the marketplace are not electron-based or entertainment-focused and Mr. Anderson ignores them almost completely.  <br /> <br />There are two economic models that work: high volume at low margin (commodities) and low volume at high margin (specialties). Because electrons allow for high margin on low volume items the subject matter of this book fits into the second category, but in reality it covers only a small fraction of the highly-interesting specialty sector. Given Anderson's connections to the Web world it's an understandable limitation, but a serious one nevertheless. <br /> <br />He ends up applying a fairly standard theory to a small sub-sector of a small sub-sector of the overall market. If you're in the music/video download business you probably know most of his content already. If you sell other specialty items that by their nature must be stocked in physical inventory -- for example 1922 Edison light bulbs, or Hungarian apricot brandy -- this book isn't going to give you many insights, and if you're like me you'll be enormously frustrated by the near-constant references to an entertainment industry that is increasingly both trivial and decadent.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Carnivale. Jack & Bobby. Sportsnight. The Job. Star Trek. The best shows burn bright, hard and fast, and are always ultimately killed before their time. Firefly is the hardest example of this disturbing phenomenon. Fox wanted an action-oriented sci-fi franchise with a built-in fan base. Joss re-wrote and re-tooled and addressed every one of their notes. The show was groundbreaking, beloved by critics, and had a fanatical following before the first episode ever aired. So naturally, Fox dumped it in the time slot of death, Friday evenings, began the show by premiering with the second episode, not the pilot which explains who these people are and why you should give a damn, sporadically removing the show even from this slot some weeks, sometimes without even saying so. After 10 episodes, less than half a season, Fox canceled the series before it ever had a chance. The fans rallied, and Mr. Whedon was able to retain the rights to the show, shopping it around until Universal picked it up as the major motion picture \\"Serenity,\\" a bittersweet triumph of sci-fi that wraps the show up beautifully. Buy this series, and give it a chance. No one who watches the whole first disc comes out the other side a non-fan. It's quite simply the best television series in human history.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|My favorite new band since I was turned on to Killswitch Engage. Excellent from start to finish. Every song is good, no fillers! My personal faves: <br />Her Voice Resides - Will always kick me in the teeth. <br />4 Words (To Choke Upon) - LOOK AT ME NOW! <br />Tears Don't Fall - Great Song. <br />All These Things I Hate - Another Great Song. <br />Room 409 - Awesome! Makes me want to get violent. <br />The End - Perfect closing song, my personal favorite on the whole CD. <br />These guys rock - METAL RULES - metalcore and classic metal influence - Bullet For My Valentine, Killswitch Engage - these are the bands which will bring back true heavy music to the fans like me who love the heavy stuff and love the talent that writes great songs as well. Fast is fast but cool is the rule! Buy this CD!

1400032717|3.0|Many people liked this book, apparently, but personally I did not really enjoy it. Here is why:    The book is told from the point of view of an autistic adolecent. As such, I found the plot to be predictable and simplistic. I realize that the whole point of the book is to allow the reader to see the world from an unusual autistic point of view, however I found an entire book told from this perspective to be a bit too much for my taste.    I can see why some people would find this book interesting, but it simply did not work for me. Nevertheless, the book is competently written and the concept of an autistic narrator is original.    Bottom line: the book is OK but it's no masterpiece.
1594200823|4.0|If \\"Fast Food Nation\\" made you think twice about eating fast food, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" may do the same for buying from the grocery store.  Don't be turned off by the prospect.  Read the book, and it will make you think about improving your buying habits.  Even if you don't think you're interested in that, the book is a fascinating read.<br /><br />As I've looked at how similar the ingredients lists are for many of the foods in grocery stores, I've wondered for some time if maybe we aren't eating real food any more, but if instead the food industry has figured out how to make everything from one basic substance, with the difference between products being minor changes to coloring, flavoring, and whatever thickeners they use to texture the stuff.  Well, what do you know--it turns out that's pretty much the case!  This book provides the explanation: we're eating corn, in many different industrial reformulations.<br /><br />This book isn't as comprehensive as I'd like, as I'm pretty sure there's a soybean story out there too, which this book alludes to but doesn't explain.  And I'd think Pollan could have gotten into those big processing facilities if he'd tried (he could've gotten a job there for a week, like Ehrenreich did in other industries for \\"Nickel and Dimed in America\\").  But what's here is important, and I'd think almost everyone should give it a look.

1573226521|4.0|The speakers of this \\"dialogue\\" admit, when pressed, that they are actually Harvard graduates, seeking adventure in Thailand in the early 1990s.  Like Richard, the main character and speaker of this novel, they are looking for Eden, someplace the rest of the world has not discovered, where they can live apart from corrupt \\"civilization\\" and enjoy the more \\"meaningful\\" aspects of a simple life, independent of the rest of the world.  Richard, while staying in a Bangkok guest house, befriends two French travelers, Etienne and Francoise, and when \\"Daffy Duck,\\" an older resident, bequeaths him a map to Paradise, just before committing suicide, the three decide to find it.  As a precaution, Richard draws a copy of the map and leaves it for the two Harvard boys, in case he does not return.<br /><br />Surviving a long sea swim, conquering the cliffs on an uncharted island, and, more importantly, recognizing a dope farm and avoiding the bloodthirsty gunmen who patrol it, the three eventually make their way onto \\"The Beach,\\" the utopian society Daffy has told Richard about, and in which he was a founding member.  As they settle in and learn the ropes, the three newcomers experience the mystical, sometimes drug-induced peacefulness they've always dreamed of.<br /><br />As in Lord of the Flies and other utopian dreams, the magic lasts only until the first big crisis, and on the beach, several crises occur simultaneously.  An illness sweeps the community, followed soon after by the first death, and the community begins to unravel into division, hostility, and eventually, chaos.  Several characters, including Richard, start to hallucinate and lose touch with reality, with Richard associating life on the beach with the warfare he faced in Vietnam.  Daffy Duck, the long-dead \\"friend\\" who gave him his map, becomes a major character in Richard's daily life.<br /><br />Garland's ability to conjure images and move the action along makes this an intense and exciting novel.  His dialogue is hip, the drug culture is depicted casually and realistically, and the naivete of the free-wheeling characters is plausible, making their conflicts inevitable and understandable.  As Richard deteriorates emotionally, the reader empathizes with him while also seeing his weaknesses and self-absorption.

B000BJS4TO|4.0|<br />I first wished to purchase this cd after the score won a Golden Globe.  I was crushed when it didn't get the Oscar! <br /> <br />Complete with Itzhak Perlman on the violin and Yo-Yo Ma on the cello, this is a must have. <br /> <br />But, of course, there's just a couple complaints.  It can get repetitive at times, and some tracks are skimpy.  (Track eleven, for example?)  But that shouldn't stop anyone from getting it anyway.  It's truly a great buy. <br /> <br />T.K., 14
0553801503|5.0|A Feast for Crows isn't the best novel in the series, but it's still a masterpiece.  It's not GRRM's fault the book had to be split in half.  There are reasons, I suspect, that were out of his control.  But that doesn't mean the book deserves to be penalized.   <br /> <br />Although not as much happens in this novel, there were still plenty of interesting and satasfying moments.   <br /> <br />(SPOILERS) <br />  We get the see more of Jaquen H'gar (the assasin Arya meets in A Clash of Kings), and more info on his character.  We get to see marwyn, an intriguing character we've only heard aout from prior books.  We are introduced to yet another intriguing charcter we've only heard about, Euron Crowseye. <br />  Sam's POV screentime is more satisfying than people realize.  We learn about the Prince who Was Promised in some more considerable detail, which I will not spoil, but will say is a big revelation.   <br />  Sansa's POVs are in my opinion, the weakest and slowest, but not bad either.  She actually becomes more mature, and her story does at least continue. <br />  Arya's POVs are strong.  For instance, we learn about who the Faceless Men are, and were they came from.   <br />  The Ironmen chapters are all fine, and the best one is the chapter when Euron takes charge during the kingsmoot with the dragonhorn. <br />  I've some people say the Dorne chapters were useless and boring nd unnecessary.  In my opinion, I liked them.  Yeh, Areo Hotah is a one-time POV, but it gave good insight into Doran and the Sandsnakes.  Arianne has some good moments to,especially her final chapter. <br />  Brienne's POVs are underrated.  In her POVs, we learn quite a lot: the Sparrows, a huge reference from GRRM's prequel from The Hedgeknight, Sandor Clegane, the Quiet Isle, and her final chapter with Lady Stoneheart. <br />  Cersei's chapters get better and better as the book reaches it's end.  I think fundamentalist religious themes with High Sparrow are very interesting.  It's unexpected plot developement I didn't see coming, and were very satisfied to see Cersei's cruelness finally catch up with her.  I can't wait to see how GRRM handles this new story with Sparrow.  They do add a lot of suspense to the fate of some of the characters, like Maragery, for instance.  And there is a big plot revelation with Gregor, something which was foreshadow by a character back in A Game of Thrones. <br />  Jaime is becoming a more a better character too.  His confrontation with the Blackfish, his conversation with Genna, nd sveral other key moments make him a great read. <br />  So, despite no Tyrion, Dany, Davos, Jon, and all other of the more popular characters, I felt this books was fine.   <br />

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I was told about this band ages ago from a friend of my sisters. I like all kinds of bands, except EMO, and this is one of my favourites. The music is beautiful and very different to anything else i've heard. One of the stand out tracks would have to be 'Rebellion (lies)' but when you listen to the cd a couple times you'll find that every track is a masterpiece in itself. I seriously recommend giving these guys and girl a listen a few times before deciding whether you like or hate them. In some ways they are very different to most bands, and i especially like how in this album every song seems to get faster in the last minute of each track. I saw them perform live once and it was really cool, especially with the whole drumming on ppl wearing helmets on their heads. In a way the singer kinda reminds me of the singer of Talking Heads (David Burne), another exceptionally cool band. Overall, give them a try and listen to them more then once before you decide you dont like them. Most ppl drawn to this band (whether by word of mouth or something else, wont be dissappointed). Arcade Fire for the win!

B000ESSTKG|3.0|Wow. I'm really surprised that I'm going to be the first person to mention this: The thing which makes this reissue disappointing for me is that every incarnation of this album up to this point (well, maybe not on vinyl) flowed from Pimpf straight into the pseudo \\"bonus\\" tracks \\"Agent Orange,\\" \\"Never Let Down Again (Aggro Mix),\\" \\"To Have And To Hold (Spanish Taster)\\" and \\"Pleasure Little Treasure.\\" Now, the album ends with \\"Pimpf.\\" If over the years you've listened to this album 10,000 times like I have, you're going to feel a bit cheated, like you aren't getting the whole album. Those kind-of-kind-of-not bonus tracks have always felt like an integral part of this album. \\"Agent Orange\\" and \\"Pleasure Little Treasure\\" are now seated at the kids' table, pushed into their own, separate little section along with some additional B-sides on the DVD. You have to navigate around on the DVD menu to access them. It seems particularly weird to regard \\"Pleasure Little Treasure\\" as a \\"bonus\\" track, given that it was one of the first cuts from the album to be pushed as a single. And sadly, \\"To Have And To Hold\\" and the Aggro mix of \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" are nowhere to be found. <br /> <br />The sound mix is great, as is the documentary, but you really should approach this reissue as something to complement one of your favorite albums, not as a replacement for it.

B000025XKM|5.0|This was Nick Drake's masterpiece. It did not have the lush orchestration of his two previous releases, and it's delivery by tape to Island records adds poignancy. It only runs for 25 minutes plus. <br /> <br />I first heard Drake here in the UK when at school in the late seventies and was amazed - very few people were listening to this style of music amongst the tide of punk and new wave. <br /> <br />Nick probably wrote this whilst living in isolation in London, and Parasite is a song that many can relate to, but the glorious 'To the morning' reminds us to his rural upbringing, and if you know the wonderful Engish countryside this is one of the greatest tributes. <br /> <br />Often in music greatness emerges after death (Bach and Schubert for example), and Nick Drake was/is one of the few greats in contemporary music. <br /> <br />This CD also reflects a yearning for more spiritual things and finding direction (such as 'road' and 'which will'). Yes, it's sparse, but has an amazing honesty and a sense of what might have been. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000GFLKF8|4.0|I was entertained by this movie....up until the end. It had suspense, action and an enigma at the heart of the movie. It was a bank robbery movie - or was it? What kept me riveted were the performances of the central actors - Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, etc....as well as the various moral ambiguities and twists and turns.<br /><br />  It was not, however, totally plausable and for that reason I have to give it a less than stellar rating. Without giving too much away, I can only say that I found the central premise to be a bit hackneyed and the ending, such as it was, left too many loose ends.<br /><br />  However, I HIGHLY recommend getting the DVD, if only because the bonus features are wonderful. There is an interview with Spike Lee and Denzel Washinton, a kind of retrospective of the movies they've made together, the challenges, the experiences they went through. THat was fascinating to view.<br /><br />  Also, Spike Lee's commentary (if you choose that option) is also well worth hearing. He is a brilliant filmaker and his insights about how he composed various shots, how he envisioned this film, etc....offer much to budding scriptwriters, film students, actors or people who simply like to watch movies, even if they never want to be a part of a film crew.<br /><br />  The film itself, however, left something to be desired, at least for me. Would I watch it again? In a heartbeat but only for the pleasure of watching the actors and actresses in this one. The plot would not be the main draw.

B00001SIES|3.0|I just read the below review from B.D. Love regarding Muse's recent concert at the Greek.  I attended the show also and take issue with his assertion that Muse played little of the music live.  That is total B.S.  Very rarely were tapes used, and that was just because Matt Bellamy (understandably) can't always duplicate the multi-tracked keyboard parts that are on the albums by himself.  As far as guitar tapes, I don't what the reviewer is smoking - not once was there a guitar sound that Bellamy wasn't actually playing live.  It's highly doubtful that Love was even at the show, so please ignore his review.
B0009A21R6|4.0|Wouldn't play on Pioneer and Yamaha. PLays on Cambridge Audio and SONY!
B000000WG4|5.0|I guess that is what we would call this album now.  One of many great instrumental albums that came out in the late 60's and early 70's as a result of improvements in recording and the developement of synthesizers.  But lets face it, you can't listen to this album without thinking about the movie \\"Exorcist\\".  This album served as the semi-soundtrack for the \\"Exorcist\\".  This gives the album a darker feel than it legitimately deserves.
6304696566|5.0|Everyone has already mentioned Ford's directing and his brilliance in capturing stunning scenery along with intruiging charactors. But with that said, This is John Wayne's film. This is Wayne's first western that takes him to another level outside of the hero good guy he was always playing. Red River touched a little bit to his dark side but this film was simply the framework for him to truly shine as a diverse and incredibly underrated talent. At first he starts out as a bigoted hero going out with his \\"nephew\\" to find the kidnapped niece. But slowly you begin to realize that he has other motives. In the scene where they are at a fort we see several white girls who had been kidnapped by the Comanches and finally had been rescued only to see that they are now emotionally disturbed. Ethan (Wayne) sais they are no longer white, they are now infact (Comanche). This line opens the door to what Ethan's new motives are for finding his neice. After he sais this line and begins to walk out the door, one of the girls screams and Ethan turns around to look. The stare captured on film and the look in Wayne's eyes is chilling beyond words. You can almost feel the hatred for the Comanches spilling out of his icey glare.  <br />This is the film Wayne should have gotten his oscar for. True Grit was also great but this is the real Poer House performance of the two.  <br />The film is not all gloom either. There are some funny scenes when Ethan is tucking Marty (a grown man)in bed and just saying \\"Just making sure you're comfortable\\". And also when Marty ends up with a Comanche squaw following him around much to his dislike, and Ethan calling her \\"Mrs. Pawlie\\". That scene always cracks me up. I rate this #1 as far as westerns are concerned but this film goes way beyond that. It's in the top 10 of the all-time great films right along side with The Grapes Of Wrath and The Godfather II.  <br />A stunning achievement never to be duplicated. <br />
0316926345|5.0|By the time that Evelyn Waugh wrote BRIDESHEAD REVISITED in 1945, he had earned the reputation of one who saw a decline and fall of sustaining Upper Class British values, a descent which he exposed through his satire and one in which he could see no forseeable solution. The closing of the Second World War oddly enough filled Waugh with a whiff of hope that there may yet be a Grace that watches over us all: He wrote the book \\"to trace the workings of the Divine Purpose in a pagan world.\\" Such a shift in metaphysical gears is noteworthy in that in his earlier books, Waugh saw religion only as a cover for hypocricy. Now in BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, Waugh continues to depict religion as a cover, but this time, it may obscure that for certain people, religion may have a base that provides ongoing faith, even if they lapse into faithless actions.     The novel opens with Captain Charles Ryder revisiting a mansion that in his youth he had often frequented, Brideshead. Except for the last few pages, the entire novel is a flashback that shows how Ryder enters the lives of the powerful Marchmain family. As Ryder interacts with them, he can see that they are a family in crisis, not the least of which is a failure to maintain a sustaining ethos that Waugh has railed at in all of his previous novels. The patriarch of the clan, Lord Marchmain, early in life found himself in religious confusion; he thought that by converting to Roman Catholicism, he might find inner peace. He did not help his cause by abandoning his wife and family to take a mistress in Italy. His four children, Sebastian, Brideshead, Julia, and Cordelia, have their own issues, many of which revolve upon either a too heavy or a too light emphasis on religion.     At first, Ryder has an idyllic existence in his youth as he becomes intertwined with the Marchmains. His friend Sebastian, is a hopeless alcoholic. Later in the novel's second half, Ryder marries, but begins an affair with Julia, which ends predictably unhappy when Julia refuses to divorce her husband and to marry Ryder because of religious restrictions. There is no one in the novel who is happy with the way that things have turned out.                                                                   Critics have tended to focus on the religious implications of the novel. A typical comment is that there are so many religious overtones at all, a surprising development considering the lack of same in Waugh's earlier canon. Further, many readers have confessed confusion as to the purpose of all this religion. Did Waugh intend it to be revered as a sustaining ethos or did he see religion as he did earlier, as yet another symbol of an irrelevant institution fit only for ridicule? The answer is both cryptic and troubling. If the search for values is limited to the sphere of mortality, then there can be no possibility of an ethos to sustain one when circumstances become dire. Waugh implies that it is only when one has faith that there is a realm of faith beyond the earthly walls of Marchmain castle, that life and death may have meaning, however terrible and terrifying that meaning may be.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This RHCP album is great.  There are several really cool songs and all of the songs are quite varied in rhythm and cadence.  This album definetly deserves a grammy or two.

B000000WG4|5.0|What can anyone say. This work has been around for a long time and is still recognized by most people. I do have some concerns as the CD appears to have some level problems during certain parts, but overall this is one of the \\"must haves\\" for this era.

B00079HZUM|3.0|I have been a fan of Billy Crudup's for awhile and I thought he was the only well cast person in this film and he is even lovely as a woman. Claire Danes really lacked a certain quality that would have made her 'star' quality, she always seems so bland. But I do have to give it to them for the final Death Scene. I felt they really captured the intensity of that scene.<br /><br />  Rupert Everett as King Charles is silly and wimpy, and the mistress Nell, played my Zoe Tapper, is just ridiculous.<br /><br />  All in all an entertaining watch.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Not much was left out. This is a great collection of Elton's public and personal hits without buying every album.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Okay, Opeth is one of the few bands out there that are so rediculously intricate and intresting their compositions are more then just music. Its a landscape of beautiful brutalaity that brings out every emotion thats both calming mesmerizing. All of their past projects have been great. deliverance and damnation were the stepping stones for this album. This album takes you places my friends fills you with creepy erie feelings and at the same time serene feelings. From the opening track ghost of perdition you are hooked the intricate weaving between the best low growl deathmetal vocals and the amazingly smooth vocals and insturmantation leave one in awe. Most of these tracks are around 10 mins long but it dosent matter this is one band that can do the long songs but keep you intrested for the whole 10 mins. I cant really explain how good this really is or any of opeths previous works with out you purchasing this cd and listening on your own. Any negative review on this album is probably from someone who dosent enjoy music that takes a lot of talent and that person is probly from L.A where every thing is cheesey all the metal that comes out and all the music very comercial. Opeth are simply genius and they dont care about comercial success they have been around for over 10 years. The only thing they prove now is that they are still one of the best Metal rock progressive bands out there and not many people are up to their par. Purchase this album if you want some music that will take you to other worldly places. Oh yea lyrics are amazing on this album same with every other opeth album beautifully dark.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Say I've been with Korn since the Self Title album and left em after Issues, not because they suck or anything just a new sound of quality entered my life. But first off I've been reading all the reviews and see that Korn Fans are still out there. To those dumb a** kids that think they could do better, should chill out, look back at what they've already done. Yea Yea it's not as good as the Self Title or any other classic they've made but nobody stays flawless, hell yea their still slamming drums, pulling strings and breaking beats rather u like to admit or not f** boys and les*****. So kill all that noise about how much they change or lost their touch and start giving them the respect they deserve a**ho***! \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is a good album and defiantly has play in my ride, the whole thing has a sweet kick a** sound. If u listen to lyrics and actually listen you'll see it rocks from start to finish I've said my peace.   <br /> <br />Over & Out <br />Rawkuz <br />
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Plot: After Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) defuses a dramatic situation (excuse the pun) involving a madman bomber (Dennis Hopper) and a rigged elevator filled with innocent people, it looks like these events were merely a rough day on the job. Unfortunately, this badguy has only just begun. Jack ends up entangled within a dangerous web spun by a mind bent on revenge and mayhem -- and it soon becomes personal. He ends up among the passengers of a public transportation bus that has been wired with a bomb. Once the bus goes above 50 MPH, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, there's gonna be a hell of a mess to clean up. The crazed villain demands money as well as full cooperation from Jack and the local police force. But Jack knows that if anybody's going to make it out of this alive, the rules must be bent and the bomber must be outsmarted. Yet with so little time and many hazards, is that even possible?<br /><br />Speed (1994) is one of those instant action/thriller classics that popped out of the 80s and 90s. It may not have any Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it does have some major suspense, superb acting, a solid script, and tons of booms and bangs to satisfy any fan of the genre. My favorite aspect of Speed (and I doubt I'm alone in this) is Dennis Hopper as Howard Payne -- the out-of-his-mind kook who's causing all the trouble. Hopper has always had that edgy, slightly crazy feel about him, and it goes very well with the violent antics and intriguing dialogue of his charatcer. Overall, it's definitely white-knuckled entertainment with the first viewing, but still maintains its appeal time and time again. In the end, it's all just another thrill-ride that steps out of the bounds of reality to give folks a good old-fashioned action flick, but come on, isn't that we wanted?

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Pink Floyd's long awaited DVD release of this 1994 Earl's Court concert from the PULSE tour is certainly worth the money. The audio is suberb,and the light,film, and prop show are vintage 70's Floyd. The DVD technology has been well utilised with excellent extra's including films used during the concert available for seperate viewing. Only drawbacks are lack of interviews(not altogether a surprise, and of course, that by that time Roger Waters was long gone. I'd like to believe there is film in a vault somewhere from the mid-1970's tours, and that we will see that released someday. In the meantime, this is is the best record we have of Pink Floyd(minus Roger), and what it was like when giants like them filled huge arenas and made it work for the fans. Disc 2 the complete Dark Side of the Moon performance is not to be missed.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved \\"Put Your Records On\\" -- and then fell in love with every other cut as well. C-B-R's music is interesting, soulful, contagious, and deep. I'd highly recommend this CD!
0977326403|5.0|I have direct experience in the social sector with over twenty-five years as an advisor or board member of several, varied non-profits. \\"Good to Great and the Social Sectors\\" resonated with me as it fills a very deep void in social sector leadership guidance.<br /><br />Recently, one executive newcomer to a non-profit called to tell me she was being told to back off by other executives. She was being perceived as \\"too businesslike\\"; she did not understand the non-profit world. I asked her to have these people define \\"businesslike.\\" She learned that \\"businesslike\\" meant expecting people to complete assignments on time and be accountable!!<br /><br />This attitude, which permeates many non-profits, is one of several targets in \\"Good to Great and the Social Sectors.\\" In fact, due to the diffuse power structure that exists for most social sector organizations, non-profits need even greater discipline - disciplined planning, disciplined people, disciplined governance, disciplined allocation of resources.<br /><br />And the culture of discipline is not a principle of business; it is a principle of greatness.<br /><br />Non-business leaders in the social sector must operate differently as they do not have the concentrated power of a business CEO. They have a thousand points of no. It is Collins' observation that they require two skill sets - leadership skills and legislative skills - to be successful. And, he believes you will find more true leadership in the social sector as a result.<br /><br />The book is organized around five issues that need to be addressed for greatness. These are:<br /><br />Issue One - How do you define great without business metrics?<br /><br />Issue Two - What is \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" in the social sector?<br /><br />Issue Three - How can you get the right people on the bus?<br /><br />Issue Four - How do you apply the Hedgehog Concept (attaining piercing clarity about how to produce the best long-term results) without a profit motive?<br /><br />Issue Five - How do you use brand to build momentum?<br /><br />Great societies have both great business sectors and great social sectors. With this in mind, Collins was motivated to write this book. He realized that it was not simply good enough for him to focus on a great business sector but also on a great social sector. He has done us a service. We will gain as a society if all who work with or for non-profits read and apply the lessons of this excellent monograph.w do you use brand to build momentum?  <br /> <br />Great societies have both great business sectors and great social sectors.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars has become a cult hit over the course of two seasons. If you watch the DVD, it's not hard to see why. This is intelligent, well written fare with fantastic acting, particularly from Kristin Bell, whose portrayal of teenage private-eye Veronica Mars is kind of astoundingly good. Each tightly plotted episode of the 22-episode first season hooks you with its own mini-mystery. But it's the season-long mystery (which gets a satisfying resolution in the season finale), that will keep you glued to the screen.  <br /> <br />Don't be deterred by the somewhat silly sounding premise, or this show's label as a teen drama (on UPN, no less). Veronica Mars is a quirky drama, free of soap opera teen love stories, that adults as well as teens can enjoy. (The DVD set, unfortunately, is not as spectacular. Aside from some deleted scenes, there are no special features worth mentioning.)
B000HCO840|3.0|It's too bad they couldn't entice Bryan Singer back to do the third X-Men because he would have stayed with the original vision of this being a trilogy, rather than just a sequel.  X-Men The Last Stand has some fantasic special effects and some awesome action sequences, but ultimately there is no heart to the film.  And really no story to boot. <br />Brett Ratner strives to leave behind everything Brian Singer did to make the first two films some of the best comic book films ever.  He must have felt the characters had been developed enough, and so now it is time for \\"action\\".  This film was greenlighted by studio executives just to make a quick buck off of the success of the first too.  They don't care about the characters.  And neither does the director Brett Ratner.  To prove my point, Ratner films a scene for after the film that says to the audience, \\"Wait, the one powerful scene I make for the film, the death of Charles Xavier, is meaningless now, because he'll be back for X-Men 4.  A trilogy is how they should have stopped it.  It should have been left alone. And because this is a substandard sequel, it ranks with the Fantastic Four or the early Batman films.  Good for a watch every now and then, but nothing worthwhile to make it a classic.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is actually a pretty good flick.  Kinda pulls you in.  Enjoyed it
B00005JOVH|2.0|Brett Ratner screwed this up royally.  My biggest problem with the film...Wolverine was TAME!!!!  And that is enough to hate this movie.  Cyclops always got the short end of the stick in this series of films, and he really had absolutely no point in this one.  Jean Gray's death should have sparked Wolverine into further isolation, and hurt Cyclops, but not make him as distant as he became in this film.  And what about the Colussus vs. Juggernaut battle?  That was just screaming to occur in this film.  And Angel?  No point in the film.  Saves daddy at the end and that's it.  And why...why....kill Professor X.  And the ending...I thought that I was going to see Hugh Jackman break out into a musical number as Angel swooped over the mountains.  I wish Bryan Singer remakes X-Men 3, and I hope the planned Wolverine film kicks [...].
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Another strong album from Shakira.  I would rate this as slighly less then \\"Laundry Service\\" but still an enjoyable album worht listening too.
0060763280|1.0|No one seriously interested in accumulating wealth today thinks in terms of \\"millions\\".  Accumulating wealth is a long-term project, and a young person earning the minimum wage and saving at a modest rate today can realistically expect to be a millionaire by middle age.   <br /> <br />Even as an outdated metaphor, \\"millionaire\\" is a sloppy term, characteristic of the misleading sloppy thinking and sloppy writing found throughout this book.  You would do better to deposit $20 in a low interest savings account, rather than contribute it to the author's self-promotional enterprises and personal pursuit of wealth at your expense.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|What I like about All That Remains is that they are a band that is not afraid to venture out, and that's what they do with \\"The Fall of Ideals\\". Phil Labonte's vocals have improved, from the death growls in \\"The Weak Willed\\" to the clean singing in \\"This Calling\\" (it grows on you, don't worry). And, as always, they are hell of amazing guitar players. Nothing beats a good guitar solo from ATR.<br /><br />This is easily one of my top 10 albums of the year. I recommend if you are a melodic death metal fan. You don't even have to like metalcore music to like it, as they abstain from the breakdowns here. Highly recommended.
0811729117|3.0|First of all, this book was written by Carius as a type of memorial to the men he served with.  He goes into to great detail (sometimes to much as it gets tedious) of his various battles.  In that this book gives a good picture of what fighting in a Tiger was like, it is a good book of history. <br /> <br />However, it really comes across that Carius was realy upset that Nazi Germany lost.  He goes out of his way to insult the American and Allied tactics, even though such tactics had him and his fellow tankers hidding their JagerTigers in a group of trees for fear of air attack. He also trys to explain away the eastern front atrocity stories as \\"propaganda\\" and nothing else.  You get the feeling that he did not believe that the concentration camps existed. <br /> <br />If you like military history, it is a good read.  But be aware that, as in any such book of the \\"other side\\" of WWII, there is still a good amount of denial by the author.
B000062YAZ|4.0|\\"In order to be a real metalhead, you must possess Slayer's 'Reign In Blood'.\\" Hahahaha, whatever...<br /><br />This album, even though it is a big influence on a lot of music today, really doesn't deserve all that hype. The majority of the songs are in the same tempo and clock under 3 minutes, except for \\"Raining Blood\\" and \\"Angel of Death\\", which are like the two Slayer anthems, and \\"Postmortem\\", which has a good intro riff to it. The whole CD clocks under a half hour as well. Tom Araya is a vocalist that you have to grow into. You either like him or you don't.<br /><br />This is a good album to kick off Slayer's adventure into the big world, but it is certainly not their best. It tends to get boring after a while. If you're looking for a Slayer album that has more variety to it, check out \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\". Also, check out \\"Agent Orange\\" by Sodom and \\"The New Order\\" by Testament for some underrated thrash.
B00005JOYM|4.0|This movie released less than five years after the attacks on September 11th, 2001, may very well go down in film history as one of the most contraversial movies ever created. Some moviegoers will be able to endure it, most will probably steer clear of it. Though it is given a subtle, yet cinematic atmosphere to it, it will still no doubt reawaken past memories of the event as it happened. Where in an action flick, we would be shown the planes crashing into the towers, here Stone wisely shows us a shadow of the plane on a building, and then a rumbling in the distance. The viewer doesn't need to be shown exactly what happened, for the viewer will never forget how it all unfolded that Tuesday morning in September. <br /> <br />The acting in uniformally strong in this movie, although the loved ones of policemen burried in the rubble give the most powerful ones. If the acting wasn't strong, this movie would no doubt lose it's impact. Throughout the proceedings we are always at eye level with the men and women involved, we are two steps behind their every move, so naturally the audience would have to form some kind of connection with them. And for the most part the audience does. Asides from certain scenes where it just feels Stone is milking the emotional tragedy bone-dry, we go through everything Nicholas Cage and his fellow policemen go through, and the loved ones they leave terrified that their husbands won't be returning.  <br /> <br />The cinematography, sound, and lighting all are strong points as well in this film. From the moment the police officers step foot outside the bus that has transported them to the towers, we feel like we are actually there. The shots of the tower from street level with degree falling and smoke rising really puts the viewer in perspective of what these brave souls are dealing with. And in the concourse sequence, the thunderous noises from high above that come without warning add to the effect. The naturalistic lighting also adds to thelifelike atmosphere incredibly.  <br /> <br />This movie is definitely not for everyone, some will argue that it has arrived too soon after the events almost five years ago, and some will simply not be able to stomach the thought of being put into the shoes of the few experienced it firsthand and survived. However it is no doubt an important movie, like United 93, and it serves as a constant reminder to society of what we are capable of, be it self-destruction, or be it bravery and courage and what good we are capable of.
B000A59PMO|4.0|My granddaughter and I watched this series together during the summer!  We loved it!  It has a few PG-13 moments that I would have skipped if possible, but otherwise it was extremely well done and a great mystery!
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I am not giving this film two stars because it is a terrible movie, but rather for its lack of devotion towards the novel.  I am a lover of the BBC version and book, not only because its well-acted but thoroughly sticks to the story.  In this film,The language and monologues are so altered, and I'm afraid to admit that this is a result of our lack of appreciation for the old english language, and a yearning for a less intricate way of speaking.  It's as if our generation needs subtitles for our own language! And This is coming from a youth. In this new version of Pride and Prejudice I couldn't help but be diverted from the manner in which Kiera Knighlty delivers her lines.  That's the thing...they are just lines.  Not only are they rushed, but lack any substance that would induce me to love her as a character.   Elizabeth Bennet is supposed to be bold, smart, witty, and admirable.  Kiera Knightly sort of betrays her as a girl who can't hold her tongue. I surmise that is why i was surprised to see how Darcy falls in love with her so quickly.  Don't get me wrong, there are some good elements that this movie has to offer.  The scenery and music are exquisite, in fact I believe that these two very things tell the story more the actors do, and that's swell.  This movie is loved by everyone, understandably so, because it gives a more romantic approach.  I have to admit, it is appealing, and beautiful to watch, but it is not Austin.
0471463396|5.0|A must-read for investors of any stripe, growth or value.  This book, written by a couple of the most popular professors at Columbia Business School, explains the innovations in the field of value investing as practiced by some of the most successful investors in the field. (fair disclosure: I took Prof. Greenwald's courses in 2007) This book successfully bridges the gap between the traditional Graham & Dodd style of value investing to what works today. Although it's a paperback, it's written with the density of a textbook.  The writing style is not light, and the actual meat of the book takes some time to wade through.  If you don't have some experience in accounting or corporate finance, then Joel Greenblatt's The Little Book That Beats the Market is good to read first.     The substance of this book is a process for modern value investing: value investing is not investing in lousy companies just because they appear cheap.  The authors also teach a structured way to value a company.  Finally, the authors address how to value growth.    First, before reading this book I had the mistaken impression that value investing was all about investing in the ugliest, least interesting company you could find just because it had a low P/E ratio.  I was completely wrong!  (Maybe I have attended too many stock pitch sessions and heard too many poultry stocks and encyclopedia companies get pitched.)  Modern value investing, according the authors: \\"When B. Graham went scouring financial statements looking for his net-nets, it did not concern him that he may have known little about the industry in which he found his targets.  All he was concerned with were asset values and a margin of safety by that measure.  A contemporary value investor had better be able to identify and understand the sources of a company's franchise and the nature of its competitive advantages.  Otherwise he or she is just another punter, taking a flier rather than making an investment.\\"  What a breath of freshair to read this passage.    Second, this book lays out a structured way to value a company by first looking at reproduction costs of assets, then earnings power, and finally the value of profitable growth.  I, like the authors, find traditional DCF valuations to be plagued by false precision.  The authors' more practical method starts by adjusting the balance GAAP balance sheet to calculate the cost of the assets for a potential business entrant.  Next, the company is valued based on the earnings generates consistently, assuming no growth.  A key insight is the value of the franchise: the difference between asset value and Earnings Power Value is the value created by a company that has significant competitive advantage.  Last, the value of profitable growth is considered.    As a self-admitted recovering growth stock addict, I learned from this book that value investors are skeptical about growth for two reasons.  One reason is that it is so hard to predict, but more important, many times growth is not worth much.  Unless the return on capital (ROC) of the company is higher than the cost of capital, growth does not create value.  (I am a slow learner; Greenblatt's example in The Little Book That Beats the Market of opening an additional gum store is even clearer to me.) The growth matrix and formulas in the book were a revelation to me.  The surprising thing is how little multiple expansion a stock deserves based on growth.  Unless a company truly has a franchise, expanding into other areas and \\"diversifying\\" the business often destroys value.  And growth for growth's sake will not make a stock go up.    This book brings value investing into the modern stock market.  Modern value investors still use traditional valuation principles in a structured way, but they also consider the value of growth and the attractiveness of the business.  What a relief, I not restricted to buying typewriter and pay phone stocks!

B00005MP58|5.0|After seeing this film, I had to read the novel.  I was so pleasantly surprised to see how true this film is to the novel, whih would explain why it is so long.  Firth's portrail of Darcy was perfect.  His demeanor and countenace are so captivating and convincing.  Ehl's approach for Elizabeth was quite impressive.  She has such a strong noble disposition, and her and firth work quite well together.
0790733226|3.0|Contact is one of those movies were you have to share your opinion with friends, not as much for the alien factor, but the always intriguing Science vs. Religion debate that entails.<br /><br />The \\"religious\\" elements of the story were just plain dumb. Does anyone recall there being a belief test for astronauts before?<br /><br />There are mysteries in the world which are completely unfathomable to me. And one of them is why anyone can consider this film to be any good at all.<br /><br />It is true that it had a promising start, with the first alien signal being detected by scientists; but from that point on, it goes downhill at the speed of light. Apparently, it is supposed to be a realistic hypothesis on how contact with an alien civilization could take place. But for me the story is completely unbelievable, and so full of holes that they are too many to list them all... I don't believe NASA would ever handle things the way they do in the film, I don't believe the church, let alone some neo-hippy preacher, would have squat to say in how things were handled, I don't believe a terrorist could ever get that easily to the very centre of the most expensive and important structure ever built by mankind, I don't believe some rich guy could set up a secret spaceship orbiting the earth aside from the powers that be, just like that, I don't believe NASA would be so keen to discredit the tale of their chosen ambassador, especially having proof (the hours of blank tape) that there was some truth in it, and I do not believe aliens would show up in a virtual beach with the face and voice of some poor girl's dead daddy. It is all so ridiculously contrived and movie-like that I simply cannot understand the general public's perception that all of this is \\"realistic\\", \\"profound\\" or \\"brainy\\"

So many people have done fine reviews of this film that I only wish to comment on one scene, not a terribly profound one, but nonetheless one that touched me deeply.    Cash is trying to sell record company executives on the Folsom Prison album idea.  One of them says \\"Johnny, your fans are Christians.  They don't want to hear you singing to a bunch of murderers and convicts trying to make them feel better.\\"    Cash's simple response:  \\"then they're not Christians.\\"    Amen Johnny, amen.

0395951054|3.0|This is a very difficult book to read, not only because it is the product of the hateful and ignorant mind of a man that seized control of Germany and plunged the world into one of history's most devastating wars, resulting in the ethnic genocide of millions of Jews, Slavs, gypsies, homosexuals and others.<br /><br />\\"Mein Kampf\\" [My Struggle] is extremely poorly written, even after considerable editing. The author, Adolph Hitler, airs his thoughts at random and in appalling crudeness on every conceivable subject, including culture, education, the theater, movies, the comics, art, literature, history, sex, marriage, prostitution and syphilis. Those wishing to learn about the life of the German leader will be disappointed as there is little autobiography in this book.<br /><br />Written while he was serving a prison term for his failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler originally wanted to title his work \\"Four and Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice\\". However, Max Amann, the hard-struggling manager of the Nazi publishing business, shortened the title to \\"Mein Kampf\\".<br /><br />The book was first published in 1925 and was some four-hundred pages long. Other editions soon followed, especially after Hitler came to power, and sales made the German leader a wealthy man. Journalist, author and historian William Shirer, author of the monumental \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" wrote of \\"Mein Kampf\\": \\"Except for the Bible, no other book sold so well during the Nazi regime.\\"  Not every German who bought a copy read it and even Nazi party stalwarts admitted that it was difficult reading and that many were never able to get through the end of the book.<br /><br />Hitler's ideas were formed in the early 1920s and we have his own word for it that he learned little afterward and altered nothing in his thinking. When he left Austria for Germany in 1913 at the age of twenty-four he was full of a burning passion for German nationalism, a hatred for democracy, Marxism and the Jews and a certainty that Providence had chosen the Aryans, especially the Germans, to be the master race.<br /><br />In \\"Mein Kampf\\" he outlined his views and applied them specifically to the problem of restoring Germany to power and building a new state based on race. That state, the Third Reich, would include all Germans living outside Germany at the time the book was written.  Hitler made it clear that there would a final reckoning with France and that German expansion would have to come largely at the expense of Russia.<br /><br />Thus, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is a blueprint for conquest. France would be destroyed, but that would be secondary to the German drive eastward. First the immediate lands to the East inhabited predominantly by Germans would be taken, including Austria, the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, and the western part of Poland, including Danzig. After that Germany would turn on the Soviet Union.<br /><br />While not a bluepring per se for ethnic cleansing, \\"Mein Kampf\\" certainly laid the foundation for the Holocaust that followed under the Third Reich. According to Hitler, Jews and Slavs were inpure races and when he became dictator he would forbid their marriage with Germans. He made it clear that in his New World Order they would serve the Third Reich as slaves serve a master. Thus it began...<br /><br />Why then was the world so surprised when Hitler and Nazi Germany set out to accomplish exactly what the German leader had set out in \\"Mein Kampf\\"? Because, of course, they had either not read his book or, having done so, did not believe that he was capable of carrying out his program. Indeed, who in their right mind would have believed the program outlined in \\"Mein Kampf\\" possible or that Hitler and Germany were capable of carrying it out?<br /><br />Anyone who wants to understand the mind of Adolph Hitler and the true nature of his Third Reich must start here.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I hated this album at first...too many songs, they all sounded the same, I just didn't have the patience... <br />My fourteen-year-old son didn't feel the same way.  He listened and listened to this album, which means I had to as well (and I was so happy it wasn't Fall Out Boy anymore that I didn't argue about it).  Accidentally, I started learning the lyrics. I started to recognize and anticipate those juicy bass and guitar nuggets in the songs... <br />Suddenly, I find myself in the grocery store singing, \\"Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon...\\" Uh-oh, I'm hooked.  Can't wait to check out, get into my car, and blast it. <br />All I can tell you is just let this album get inside.  It is so worth it.  Some of the lyrics are total genius.  You can hear his pain and regret, yet his willingness to accept the past and his excitement about the future. Inspiring. <br />Listen, listen, listen...

B000HCO83G|4.0|I, like everyone else writing a review for this release, have only scene the theatrical version. Based on what I saw in the theaters (I saw it 4 times!) there are a lot of good and bad things about this movie, mostly good. While it did stray from historic comic book plots and characters, what director Brett Ratner envisioned is a fine and acceptable, if not a really good, story. <br /> <br /> <br />The story, special effects, and the acting were excellent. <br /> <br /> The story, while there are those who'll say otherwise, was really good. The X-men find out from The Secretary of Mutant Affairs, aka Beast, that there is a threat to mutant kind. A child, played by Cameron Bright, has the \\"uncanny\\" (pardon the pun) ability to \\"leech\\" any mutants powers. The effect is temporary and only while the mutant is within about 10-15ft from him. However the military uses the kid's blood to make (any guesses?) a weapon, of course. This causes a flurry of reactions from the mutant comunity. Some mutants want \\"the cure\\" some want it destroyed. I don't want to ruin the story so I'll just say it is a pretty acurate depiction of what would happen. I was kind of dissapointed that not any muntants from other Marvel series were involved. I thought it would be an excellent chance for some cross-over characters to make a few cameo apearances. While the comic book fanatics were freaking out about the differences from the movie to the comics, they were not paying atention to the really great story. <br /> <br />The special effects were up to the same level, if not better, as the first 2 entries in this series. There is a really great scene where Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer (aka Frasier), reaches out to touch the Leech (C. Bright), and his hand becomes a normal looking human hand. There is also a scene that has Cyclops, played by James Marsden, blasting Alkalie Lake, where Jean Grey drowned. Also when the Phoenix is around...get ready for special effects to wow you. <br /> <br />The acting was, as always when you have Patrick Stewart, superb. Everyone from Halle Berry, who plays Storm, to Vinnie Jones, who plays Juggernaut, did a fine job. I only can complain about one actor...Cameron Bright, who plays the Leech (the kid who has the negating power). He says about 3 words through the whole movie. From what I've seen of the kid he has played basically the same character in every movie he's been in. This small negative does not take away from the movie as a whole. He only has about 4 scenes anyway.  <br /> <br />All in all this is a fantasic movie. You must make it a point to watch the extra scenes at the end of the credits. A lot of story happens in those few scenes, and you don't want to miss them. The last few moments of these scenes cement the idea of another X-Men sequal. Which is a great idea. There is only like 40 years of stories to cover. I, for one, will go see every X-Men movie they make.

B000EMGAOY|3.0|This is a good cd. it has some good songs on it and is worth lisetning through but its definitly not as good as people are making it out to be. Every song sounds the same and is alot of the time just boring. There are a lot better Red Hot Chili Peppers cds out there and compared to those this is pretty much bad. Id say if your a new fan of RHCP then get theyre greatest hits or Californication, but i guess if your a hardcore fan its worth it.
0553296981|5.0|A year ago, I was forced to read this book by my english teacher... At first, looking at the cover, (it was red with a picture of a girl) I had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it...<br /><br />After a couple of days, i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere I go... During break times, lunch, and spend 2 full hours reading it at home...<br /><br />Reading this diary, made me picture how Anne had her teenage life.. It was really different from mine. Nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic. No other friends to talk too... Same people she sees every single day... In a small place called the \\"Secret Annexe\\".<br /><br />Can you imagine that that kind of life? That you have no idea if you can eat or not, if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day... or if you can still get out of that Annex and live a normal life again... Can you imagine??? But still, they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe...<br /><br />For me, those people are the real heroes. They never gave up. They sacrificed and united. And best of all, their faith in God reamined strong.<br /><br />This book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world. This is a real story of a real world... And the fact that this happens too to so many people. Sometimes we ask, \\"Why do we need to repeat History?\\"<br /><br />Read this book and you'll realize that this is different, worth it and remarkable...

Everything afterwards just didnt have it. Downhill he went...the rest history. THis CD with SACD to kick its [...] is designed to pop your speakercones right out on to the floor. Thriller,  right off the shelf all those years ago was top notch in sound to begin with, add a bit of remix and some technology and gawd...Vincent Price's voice at the end of it is sooooo real it creeps you out, like it's suppose to. Put all the headlines and  People Magazine articles aside and go back to the early 80's before it all went wrong. Michael was hittin it on all eight cylinders.
1580084621|1.0|The book is filled with historical details, recipes are carefully laid out, ingredients are beautifully described.  However, if I were living in Thailand, this book would be helpful.  Even though I live in southern California where there are plenty of asian supermarkets with fresh fruits and vegetables, the ingredients asked in this book are impossible to find.  For example, some recipes ask for mangosteens and other tropical fruits, where to find?  I think that the author strikes for absolute authenticity, but as we know, every cook improvises given the available ingredients.  The author does not bother to tell us how to substitute any hard-to-find ingredients.  This makes the book impractical and useless.

0140620303|4.0|People often group science fiction books or horror books into their own category, even though the great sci-fi / horror books explore the same themes that \\"non sci-fi and non-horror\\" books do.  In navigating the human condition and making a commentary on it, books are either categorized as tragedies or comedies.  This classic of literature is alternatively classified as a sci-fi book or horror book, when it is most definitively a tragedy.<br /><br />Set in 19th century Europe, the book tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young and upcoming scientist with great skills in the life sciences and a gifted engineer.  Whilst his colleagues spend time enjoying the social life of Europe; Victor devours books and speculates on life itself.  Soon he begins secret experimentations on life, and concludes that it is nothing more than organic material energized by electricity.  He follows this be creating life, in the form of a human made from spare parts that he obtains from graverobbers and such.  At the moment he brings his creation to life, both freak out and are separated.<br /><br />Frankenstein's creation, the monster, wanders the cities and countryside of Europe, trying to piece together his origin, his whereabouts, his identity, etc...  All the while, his horrific looks, being made of human spare parts, makes him so ugly as to be unacceptable to society and he whiles his days in hiding.  The experiences breaks his heart on an hourly basis.  He realizes he can never be accepted into human society, so he contacts his maker and asks for a female mate.  The maker accepts at first, but at the last moment, negates on his promise.  And so starts the hatred between maker and master, for the monster is truly the master since he is not bound by human laws nor human relationships.  The monster proceeds to kill all those loved by Victor Frankenstein.  In turn, Victor begins a lifelong chase of the monster to kill it.  The book ends on the decks of a ship in the northern seas with the monster getting his last laugh.<br /><br />Tragic in its ending, the book makes commentaries on multiple subjects.  First, man should not play god.  This is the obvious theme of this book.  We cannot control our creations and should be more careful in what we create.  This theme has since been echoed on the topics of nuclear weapons, automobiles, fire, and now nanotechnology.  Second, this book firmly places itself on the nurture side of the nature - nurture debate.  The monster is born innocent, and his sufferings at the hands of humans makes him into a true monster.  Third, love makes the world go around.  The monster ultimately does not want a home; awards, rank or title, social distinction, etc...  He wants a wife.  Could this theme be related to the author being a wife herself, and maybe the book somehow comments on her marriage?  Not sure here.<br /><br />All in all this is a great book.  It is a great story book, it is a great commentary on human society, and it is a wonderful examination on the needs of all humans.  I highly recommend it.seas with the monster getting his last laugh.  <br /> <br />Tragic in its ending, the book makes commentaries on multiple subjects.  First, man should not play god.

0060574216|4.0|I like this book a lot and I think every couple in the world should read it.  It can potentially prevent a lot of arguments and screwed-up relationships, and it has all sorts of information that you never knew about the other gender, but then it all makes sense when you find out.  I realized that I had done a lot of these things that really irritate the other gender, all the while thinking that I was \\"right\\" and being helpful.   One of the best aspects of this book is its explanation of men's emotional needs.  We are socialized to believe that men don't have intense feelings and needs, that women are the emotional ones.  But in fact men are just as emotional, perhaps moreso.  They are raw *all the time* and actually quite fragile when it comes to comments that their partners make.   You can NEVER criticize a man - not for anything.  Even an offhand remark contributes to destroying him inside and killing his desire to please you.   (They have an intense, instinctive need and drive to make you happy.)    If you need to change a man's behavior, you can only do so using positive reinforcement.   You must simply ignore \\"bad\\" behavior, politely encourage \\"good\\" behavior, and reinforce it with praise-type rewards.   Men automatically adjust their behaviors to duplicate whatever yields a positive response from you.   So they are actually very easy to train, but women constantly criticize and discourage them (for some reason, it is their first instinct to acknowledge *only* bad behavior), causing men frustration until they completely give up trying.         Women also have a strong maternal instinct, which they act on by (inadvertently) questioning/doubting men about trifles.   This ties in to each gender's needs; What men need most is not \\"love\\" or \\"caring\\" as it means to women, but faith and trust.  You have to build them up and show that you have confidence in their ability to do things.   This is what \\"love\\" means to a man.            The only complaint I have is that his writing style is redundant. He could abridge it to include the main points and make a handbook that would be practical for everyday situations.    Still highly recommended.
B000002AS3|5.0|Here I am, sat in England, several years after this album was first released. <br /> <br />Despite the years that have passed, this is one of those albums that is always good to listen to, and as such, it has so far stood the test of time. <br /> <br />When Oasis burst onto the UK music scene back in the 90s I was 17, just finishing high school, and there was genuine excitement among us 'kids' about this band.  No other band had generated such excitement in our lifetimes, and no band has done so since.  When a new Oasis single was about to be released, it was all everyone was talking about.  And, once it had been released, everyone was talking about how great it was, and which was their favourite 'B side' track. <br /> <br />I love this album.  It was the soundtrack to my 'Golden Years' - those great days in your late teens when everything is good in the world, and all that matters is going out (or hanging out) with your mates.  What better way to enjoy those days than by listening to 'Supersonic' or 'Rock'n'Roll Star' while you do so? <br /> <br />Oasis' later offerings I considered disappointing.  But that's understandable, when they produced a debut like this.  How do you follow it up?  You can't.  In some ways I wish Oasis had crashed and burned after this storming debut.  It would have been a fitting way to have ended things - bursting onto the scene, showing everyone how a record should be made, doing the rock'n'roll thing, then bursting into flames and disappearing into the place of legends. <br /> <br />If you don't already own this album, buy it now.  Open a beer, spark up a cigarette, and PLAY IT LOUD.
B000FS9FCG|3.0|The Wachowski Brothers, of \\"Matrix\\" fame, adapted \\"V for Vendetta\\" from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, moving the action further into a dystopian future where Great Britain has exchanged obedient consent to totalitarian rule for order and peace in a world beset by violence and chaos. A single avenger (Hugo Weaving), calling himself \\"V\\" and wearing a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, plans to shake the population out of complacency and exact revenge on those who tortured him years ago. On the 5th of November, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' 1605 Gunpowder Plot, V blows The Old Bailey sky high. And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament. Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) is charged with finding V and his supposed accomplice, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) whom V saved from arrest when she was out after curfew. When he is not rabble-rousing, V is leaving a trail of murder victims, whom Finch traces to a detention center that housed top secret biological research years ago. But Finch's investigation attracts the displeasure of the Chancellor (John Hurt) and secret police chief Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith).<br /><br />Although it is ostensibly an action movie, I found \\"V for Vendetta\\" mostly tedious and generally bland. \\"V\\" could as easily stand for \\"verbose\\" as \\"vendetta\\". V's wordy, philosophical oration would put the populace to sleep, not move them to arms. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue stilted, as you might expect of a graphic novel. The depth should be found in the story's ideas, but \\"V for Vendetta\\" comes up short in that department. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic, has criticized the American writers and director James McTeigue for transforming his conflict between anarchism and fascism in Britain into a critique of neo-conservatism in the United States. I have not read the graphic novel, so I must judge the film alone, which is an awkward mix of all of those ideas. There is a message about the politics of fear, as the fascist regime exploited fear of violence and disease to increase its domain in the name of national security. Citizens traded freedom for security, or the illusion of security, whether they really wanted to or not. This would be an interesting theme if it came across strongly, but unfortunately, the politics of fear is peripheral in the film.<br /><br />Much has been made of the idea that \\"V for Vendetta\\" casts a \\"terrorist\\" in heroic light. In fact, the film avoids the issue of terrorism almost entirely. V isn't much of a terrorist, and he's hardly heroic. He's an amoral, manipulative ideologue who treats his friends as badly as his enemies. His vendetta is one of personal vengeance. He blows up government buildings with no one in them. V doesn't kill civilians. His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks. As terrorism is violence intended to leverage a political cause by creating fear, it would not be an effective tool against a regime whose power is rooted in the fact that everyone is afraid of the world around them. The government is the exploiter of fear, not V. So \\"V for Vendetta\\" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism. V's violence is intended to be emblematic. It's vandalism, not terrorism. He's an anarchist. He targets institutions, not people. If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see \\"The Battle of Algiers\\", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true. \\"V for Vendetta\\" is the sum of shallow characters and nonsensical plot wrapped up in bland politics, and it's casual view of torture is indefensible.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006 single disc edition): The single bonus feature is \\"Freedom! Freedom! Making V for Vendetta\\" (16 min), which consists mainly of interviews with producer Joel Silver, director James McTeigue, production designer Owen Paterson, and much of the cast, including Natalie Portman, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and Hugo Weaving.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|The Coen Brothers' 1998 masterpiece \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is a classic in every sense of the word. From its tight plotting to great characters to a string of great quotes, this is truly one of the best movies ever.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude, a stoner livin in L.A. who enjoys bowling and being lazy. One night, a group of thugs mistake him for a millionaire with his name, and pee on his rug and demand money. Jeff decides to settle things by visiting the elder millionaire who posseses the same name as him. The wealthy Lebowski refusese to compensate for the rug, angering The Dude. However, when Lebowski's wife Bunny (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, he enlists The Dude's help. The Dude is ordered to make a ransom drop, to which he reluctantly accepts. Things go well until The Dude's friend Walter Sobchack (a riotous John Goodman) decides to tag along, managing to complicate manners. The Dude is then plunged into a world of intrigue, encountering hialrious situations, killer nihilists and the perfect match for him, the esoteric artist Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore).<br /><br />This film is a true classic. The special edition dvd comes with a making-of documentary, a photo gallery and few other extras. This isn't a film for everyone, but those who enjoy this type of art-house humor and filmmaking will no doubt be impressed.

B000BTC5LW|4.0|its kind of odd to look at a dvd performance that took place about twelve years released only a couple weeks ago.  It is also very odd to watch songs from \\"the Wall\\" and the entire \\"Dark Side of the moon\\" and not really see or hear any mention of Roger Waters, the ultimate conciever of these albums. <br />the thing that attracted me to this dvd was the only recorded version of \\"the dark side of the moon\\" ever released.  Basically the concert is divided onto two discs.  The first disc mostly contains songs from the most current album at the time \\"the division bell\\" as well as a great live version of \\"shine on you crazy diamonds\\" and \\"one of these days\\".  The second disc,which is my favorite of the two, contains the entire dark side of the moon and a seemingly planned encore that contains \\"wish you were here\\",\\"comfortably numb, and \\"run like hell\\", possibly my most favorite song on the dvd is \\"comfortably numb\\" because of the great light performance and the impact that song has had on my life.  ALso the dvd contains a section called \\"Bootlegging the bootleggers\\"  which features bootleg concert footage from the pulse tour which i thought was a very creative way to deal with bootleggers.  All in all this dvd is a must have because of \\"the dark side of the moon\\" performance and documents the latter days of pink floyd after the break off of roger waters.  This dvd proves there is life after \\"wish you were here\\" and propels the music seeker into albums such as \\"the division bell\\", \\"the pros and cons of hitchhiking\\", \\"obscured by clouds\\", and \\"on an island\\".
B00005JOYM|5.0|When Oliver Stone was announced as the director for this movie, I initially thought that Hollywood lost its mind.<br /><br />Although my friend and her family then living in New York ultimately fared okay, we knew many others had not been. I worried that Stone would use the appointment as an excuse to deliver a blood-thirsty jingoistic diatribe against 'terrorists'--ironically not much different than what Washington D.C. was dishing out--and was wary of the film.<br /><br />Stone surprised me and perhaps many other Americans by instead going in the exact opposite direction. This film provides a glimpse of that day and Americans capacity for helping each other out in a time of crisis.<br /><br />The film centers on John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and Michael Pe&ntilde;a (Will Jimeno), two Port Authority police officers who were among the first responders to the World Trade Center site. Faith and family sustain them as they realize they will also have to be rescued but wonder when.<br /><br />It also focuses on the tremendous emotional and psychological burdens their families endure in general and especially during that day. Stone wisely avoids his 'trademark' conspiracy in favor of just showing the heroism of these ordinary Americans and side-stepping politics. We don't even see the plane crash into the buildings.<br /><br />I also thought that Chuck Sereika, as an 'underdog' in this screenplay, is an interesting character. Before the attack he is a disgraced paramedic because his license to legally work is not current. However since 'all hands are needed on deck' during the day, he is actually among the people who rescue Jimeno and McLoughlin themselves on September 12th.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is great--again considering the fantastic pressure everybody must have been under to make a one-dimensional title. The errors which do exist (there is a car model on the screen which was not made in 2001!) are minor and will not substantially detract from watching the story--both once and repeatedly.

B000002N2P|4.0|Dookie was a great album, and Green Day's fan contingent was expecting their next album to follow a similar path. However, the majority of fans were left dissapointed by Dookie's follow up, 'Insomniac'. It maintains the core of the groups sound, but adds a shade of darkness that is cast over each song.  Despite the critisism this album has received, 'Insomniac' is a massively underrated album.  <br /> <br />The 14 tracks are consistent, although most of them sound too similar. The only real exceptions are 'Brain Stew' and 'Jaded'. Don't get me wrong, it's a strong album with few fillers, but it lacks that across platform hit that completes an album. Insomniac is by no means a poor effort, however it needed a bit more variety. Nonetheless, it's quality punk rock stripped down to the bare neccessities with breakneck drumming, pounding bass and Billie Joe's catchy riffs and snot-nosed vocal delivery. <br /> <br />Insomniac is a grossly underrated album , but not an undiscovered classic.  <br /> <br />1. Armatage Shanks: 8.5/10. Great opening track. I love the drum intro. This could have easily been released as a single. Billie Joe's pessimistic self-hating lyrics fit the tune perfectly. <br /> <br />2. Brat: 7/10. Perhaps a little too repetitive. However, the beat relentless pounds and drives the song forward. <br /> <br />3. Stuck With Me: 9/10. Made memorable by the down cycling intro. Not a guaranteed single release, it didn't sell well, but is still worthy of a healthy rating.  <br /> <br />4. Geek Stink Breath: 10/10. Sounds like the worst hangover you've ever had, but actually refers to drugs. It's a slower song, but with a punchy riff that keeps powering forward, <br /> <br />5. No Pride: 7.5/10. Starts wonderfully but becomes stale and boring in the second half of the song. Not a waste of a track by any means, though. <br /> <br />6. Bab's Uvala Who?: 8/10. Built around a stop start riff that puts you in the mood to destroy something. Billie Joe's well-timed cries of 'shhhhhhhhhhhhhoOOOOOOOOOO' make this song all the more worthwhile. <br /> <br />7. 86: 8.5/10. A sad song that manages to maintain the mood while remaining upbeat. Catchy chorus that will draw you in.  <br /> <br />8. Panic Song: 7.5/10. Not a great song, although it is saved by a long and suspenseful introduction. <br /> <br />9. Stuart And The Ave: 9.5/10. My favourite song from the album. The clever bass solo at the start dictates the rest of the song. Definitely worth a listen. <br /> <br />10. Brain Stew: 9/10. Painfully repetitive, the opening riff is repeated for the entire song, although it is catchy enough to stay in your head. You may hate it at first, but this song will probably grow on you.  <br /> <br />11. Jaded: 10/10. 90 seconds of punk rock chaos. Flies past you at such reckless speed that you are left not knowing what hit you. Often considered as part of 'Brain Stew'. <br /> <br />12. Westbound Sign: 8/10. Correct me if I'm wrong but this is the only song on the album that doesn't have pessimistic lyrics. Billie Joe is a talented songwriter but it took him a while to write about various issues. A chirpy guitar riff is the backbone of the song.  <br /> <br />13. Tight Wad Hill: 6.5/10. The weakest song on the album, but not terrible either. Used more as an interlude between Westbound Sign and Walking Contradiction. <br /> <br />14. Walking Contradiction: 9/10. Billie Joe uses witty references to double standards and hypocrites in this well thought out song. Would have been a classic with more variety.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Writer-director Richard Kelly's debut feature, the Lynchian Donnie Darko, is a tale of adolescent angst ripe with enigmatic sci-fi underpinnings. Regardless of whether Kelly's titular protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is seemingly deranged or merely on the brink of saving humanity from itself, his time-warping fantasies become startling metaphors for confused teenage male development. This endlessly inventive film is the virtual antithesis of happy-go-lucky '80s teen flicks, hauntingly gauging the pulse of a nation gripped by sexual repression and political uncertainty. Kelly's jabs at Reaganism are about as subtle as his devilishly boldfaced \\"Vote Dukakis\\" shtick. By film's end, Kelly has expertly transformed his comfortable '80s milieu into an apocalyptic sweat chamber nervously situated between moral complacency and heartbreaking could-have-been hopefulness.<br /><br />\\"Maybe it's the story of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of Phillip K. Dick,\\" says 26-year-old Kelly of his film. The students at Donnie's school free-float through hallways that begin to resemble portals into an alternate universe. Make no mistake, this is Kelly's deadpan notion of what life was like in the '80s. A school bully openly snorts cocaine by a friend's locker in one hysterical slow-motion shot. Kelly allows ample room for poignancy when the bronze statue of the school's mascot (here, a curious squatting dog) keeps stoic watch over a fat girl named Cherita (Jolene Purdy), whose swan-inspired performance at the school's talent show is rejected in favor of a lame Stacy Q rip-off. The group is named Sparkle Motion, spearheaded by Donnie's young sister Samantha (Daveigh Chase). They are the embodiment of '80s cheese-pop; their performance is ghoulishly applauded while Cherita's hopeful gaze into the future is tossed aside with polite disinterest.<br /><br />A sleepwalking Donnie is lured out of his house by his alter ego (here, a rabbit named Frank), who saves Donnie from the plane engine that crashes into his bedroom. As a result, Donnie comes to believe Frank's prophecy that the world will end in 28 days. Halloween's arrival and the Bush/Dukakis race pitch-perfectly compliment the film's apocalyptic wind-down. With doomsday nearing, Donnie becomes an upstart messiah ridding the town of self-righteous false prophets, though he does find time to innocently woo new-girl-in-town Gretchen (Jena Malone) with retro come-ons like \\"do you want to go with me?\\" A New Age gym teacher who makes little emotional allowances outside her fear/love lifeline is Donnie's main target. Her downfall is followed by and linked to the fiery demise of a self-help guru played by Patrick Swayze, whose motivational shenanigans Donnie hysterically shoots to the ground.<br /><br />Now in a hectic search for enlightenment, Donnie begins to believe that time travel is possible. For help, he looks to the town's 101-year-old biddy (writer of the fictional tome The Philosophy of Time Travel), who is as eerily frozen in time as her hopeful disciples. Taught in English class by quasi-hippie Karen (Drew Barrymore), Graham Greene's The Destructors and its tale of creation/destruction beautifully compliments the film's fateful finale. References to '80s pop-culture abound: Sparkle Motion is invited to be on Star Search '88 while Donnie and Gretchen catch Sam Raimi's Evil Dead before Donnie does away with the town's false prophet, whose participation in a kiddie porn ring seems to shatter the entire town's sense of complacency. Donnie Darko is a blazingly original evocation of better-place-than-here hopefulness, an affront to '80s naivete that is mindful of strange events that seemingly happen for a reason though not always for the better good.the plane engine that crashes into his bedroom.

While it took me almost 2 months to read, I enjoyed every page. It's a wonderful retelling of a story that I thought I knew well. I really liked that it gave it's own unqiue twist and provided a new side by telling it from the view point of the women - much more than the typical story of Guinevere, Arthur and Lancelot. It's starts before Arthur becoming King and continues past the holy grail quest - the full story told in a unique and fanscinating manner. It's wonderfully written and while not a quick page-turner, I highly recommend it.

B00006BNDI|5.0|Simply put this is one of the best black metal albums ever made. Heck, it's one of the best metal albums ever made. The music is very simple and repetitive, the point being to put the listener into a trance-like state. The music is paradoxically dissonant and beautiful. The opening segment of Det Som En Gang Var is a perfect example of this. You have this simple beautiful keyboard line hovering over very dissonant droning distorted guitar chords. The two halves of the album mirror each other, the first and last track are both about 14 minutes long and are divided into two fairly equal sections. The second and third tracks are around 8 minutes apiece and are very similar in sound/style. The first and last track however while very similar in mood are quite different in instrumentation (the opener involves vocals, guitars, bass, drums and keyboards; the closer is pure keyboards). Simply put the music on this album is some of the most hypnotic and achingly beautiful you will find within the black metal genre. Get it.

B000002UAC|5.0|The Beatles have now faded into legend. Future music historians will doubtlessly classify them as the most popular, innovative, and important rock group of the twentieth century. But the group that produced Sgt. Pepper, the White Album, and revolutionalized western culture began as a slick pop group that sang mostly love songs. In late 1963, when \\"With The Beatles\\" was released in England, the brunt of the British invasion had not yet pummelled America. In fact, the Beatles had released two full albums, \\"Please Please Me\\" and this one, by the time they appeared on the Ed Sullivan show in early 1964. Parlophone's American affiliate, Capitol, then blasted the album \\"Meet The Beatles\\" into the American market almost instantaneously. Though the albums share the same cover photograph, they remain very different albums. Thus began the dichotomy between the \\"American\\" releases and the \\"British\\" releases that would last all the way up to Sgt. Pepper (which supposedly led the band to protest with the controversial \\"butcher cover\\" in 1965).<br /><br />When The Beatles ouvre was finally released on CD in the late 1980s, they followed the British releases exclusively. So gone were \\"Meet The Beatles\\", \\"The Beatles Second Album\\", \\"Something New\\", \\"Beatles '65\\", , \\"Beatles VI\\", \\"Yesterday... And Today\\", and a few others. Capitol released them on CD just a few years ago in a box set. They remained available only on vinyl until then. But most went completely out of print.<br /><br />This album, their second British release, used multitracking for the first time. The previous album was recorded live in the studio with no overdubs. Producer George Martin apparently introduced the new concept to the band in 1963, and they ran with it. A new sound emerged.<br /><br />\\"With The Beatles\\" even marks the first time that the band had a say in the cover art (a new concept for a 1960s pop band). They wanted to mime a shadown intensive photographic method used by a friend in Germany. And they got exactly what they wanted.<br /><br />The music, in contrast to their releases of the late 1960s, sounds very full with the voices put high up in the mix. Guitars, drums, bass, and piano get deemphasized. Some of the individual instruments take effort to pick out. This resulted in a full frontal attack that energized the band's distinctive sound. Rock was still a nascent genre in 1963. Consequently, Martin and the group had more or less carte blanche authority to do what they wanted within reason.<br /><br />Something definitely worked, because \\"With The Beatles\\" still sounds fresh today. It contains music designed for hormone-soaked teenagers that somehow speaks to all of us. But why it works remains a little ineffable. The raw energy contributes to it, but a lot of recordings at the time had the same drive. But nonetheless they lacked something that The Beatles nearly monopolized. What that \\"stuff\\" was remains the holy grail of pop music. If the recording industry knew the formula we'd be drowning in it by now. But the evidence argues that The Beatles had something inexplicably special. They were regular lads brought together under the right circumstances. And so much of Western culture still remembers them as \\"THE\\" band.<br /><br />\\"With The Beatles\\" contains many Lennon/McCartney classics that we've all likely heard dozens of times: \\"It Won't Be Long\\", \\"All My Loving\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\". But only eight of the fourteen tracks were penned by the fab four. The others came from their countless hours of gigging in Britain and Germany. By the time of their second British release, their repertoire swelled. This basic formula, mixing originals and covers, dominated The Beatles' albums all the way to \\"Help!\\".<br /><br />But some of their best known songs of the time, such as \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"She Loves You\\", don't appear on \\"With The Beatles\\". What happened? These classics only appeared as 45 rpm singles in Britain (a policy not followed on the American releases). Singles were used as economical \\"test releases\\" to justify the recording of a full length album. And record companies at the time assumed, probably correctly, that audiences wouldn't want to pay for the same songs twice. That was how the music industry functioned in 1963 Britian, and explains why these songs don't appear here. Times and markets change, for better or worse.<br /><br />\\"With The Beatles\\" preserves the excitement of the young group from Liverpool as they began to dominate twentieth century popular music. Very soon after America would fall hoplessly in love. Then, a mere seven years later, they would change the face of popular music forever before vaporizing into history.on the American releases).

0143036556|2.0|As other reviewers here have mentioned, Diamond spends too much attention on the Greenland Norse and his arguments about them are unpersuasive.  He draws conclusions about the end of their society that he himself gives plenty of evidence to believe are wrong.  The three economic bases of Greenland Norse society, he tells us, were agriculture, game hunting, and hunting for Walrus ivory to trade to Europe.   <br /> <br />Agricultural production shrank because of worsening weather in Greenland.  There were repeated crop failures and consequent loss of farm animals, followed by intermittent starvation.  The ivory trade ended when the Crusades opened Mediterranean trade routes between Europe and the Arabs. That made elephant ivory available  in Europe, which was cheaper and superior to Greenland walrus ivory.  The end of the ivory trade destroyed the economic basis of ship traffic between Europe and Greenland.  Further, as Diamond explains, increasing ice floes in Greenland fjords made navigation difficult and finally impossible, and ended Greenland's connection with Europe.   <br /> <br />Diamond is vague about whether hunting for food became less productive because of the worsening weather or because of competition for game from the Inupiat eskimos, or both.  Diamond suggests the Inupiat may have massacred the last few remaining Norse. <br /> <br />He also mentions that Greenland had been populated by four successive waves of peoples coming from the Canadian arctic, each of whom died out, apparently during past eras of worsening weather.  <br /> <br />From these facts Diamond somehow concludes that the cause of the failure of Norse Greenland was their failure to become Inupiat eskimoes.  He says they died out because of their cultural inflexibility.  That is not much more relevant than saying they died out because they didn't have supermarkets.   <br /> <br />Along similar lines he concludes that the near extinction of the Easter Islanders was their cutting down the trees on which their agriculture was dependent.  He gives this as an example of environmental short-sightedness.  He does not mention the generally accepted theory that they did it, not carelessly, but as deliberate acts of destruction during a lengthy and ultimately mutually suicidal civil war.  The conclusion that Diamond draws may still be true, but is very much beside the point in answering what the Easter Islanders could or should have done differently. <br /> <br />Many of Diamond's other conclusions are similarly unpersuasive.  This was particularly disappointing since his earlier \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was so thought-provoking and interesting.  It may be cynical and even unkind to say so, but the obvious paddedness of the book made me wonder if there was not a book contract somewhere requiring the book to be at least of some specified length.  Even more cynically, I wondered if the largely irrelevant-to-anything and apparently tacked-on-afterwards section on Montana's Bitteroot Valley was not a way to make his trips there tax deductible. <br /> <br />

Everything's here: the lady in distress (Emily), the ambiguously dangerous dame (Laura), and the menacing kingpin (uhm, Pin). In true detective-movie fashion, Brendan (the lead character) gets knocked unconscious at least 5 times. The witty dialogue and believable performances actually made me have to keep reminding myself that these characters were high school students and not cynical thirty-somethings. A true modern classic.

The characters history and their mystery both made you encourage the love story because there wasn't any reason for them not to fall in love.  You could imagine them married and their looking forward to growing old together.  Great acting, great directing, great writing, great photography all made the characters believable and bearable. I love movies that take romance and make it romantic--intellegent conversations between the ones who are in love with each other and the slow discovery of what they hold inside of themselves.  When they finally except that discovery, you cheer AND you don't have to cover your children's eyes.  A wonderful discovery.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Artwork cheesy? ... THE POWER OF CHEESE! This is what all bands should try to do with the cd artwork. This great package is really FUN and my enjoyment of the band and each release goes up every time (I have all but the first) partly because of their old-school effort to create a mental/visual trip that supports the music, like the great psychedelic albums of the 1960/70's. Not many cds are this DELUXE - Some people are never happy. I doubt they can profit easily after the expense and overall effort that is provided graciously to the fans here.<br /><br />My goodness, this packs a monstrous set of progressive/psychedelic rock balls. What a headtrip generally!  The gradual but beautiful building of energy through each song and to the eventual (75:52 minutes) sci-fi endpoint of the album is like engaging the eyeballs of the universe to get a glimpse of galaxies far away ... DON'T YOU LOVE IT WHEN MUSIC CAN DO THAT?<br /><br />We should accept this fine package for what it is: intense, well-produced/conceived musical artistry that is a pleasure to behold and experience (and a great collectible value as unique visual album art that few bands or record co's would provide at this price).  I am still digesting the album musically, even though I have given it numerous careful (musician) listens. It takes a good long while to explore the nuances of this conceptual infinity knot (song, verse and construction) ... but lyrics would have been helpful considering the thickly layered vocals in parts.<br /><br />My take on this: 10,000 Days is a very cool, unique and special album. Don't rush it, it takes time to absorb for sure. It is a progression of the band taken to new but familiar places (I am intentionally NOT comparing to previous Tool albums, a futile excercise with most great bands; they are all excellent, moody masterpieces). The extra paint on Van Gogh's paintings seemed garish to some fussy people of his day, and Salvador Dali was a little too trippy for most - but we now see them as visionary artists on the cutting edge of their genres (and their oddities endearing).  Aren't we glad they did it their way?  Thank you Tool for going all out to please the fans. Enjoy (late at night)!onary artists on the cutting edge of their genres (and their oddities endearing).

B00008PC2O|1.0|I was looking for something to show off the capabilities of my new plasma screen and thought this might fit the bill. I've been testing lots of the WMVHD clips from the microsoft site and was impressed but I wanted to try a full-lenth feature film. <br /> <br />Let me summarize the reasons I am not satisfied with this product. <br /> <br />1) The HD windows media files require the installation of the Interactual player which is known and well documented spyware. We shouldn't be forced to install or use spyware to play HD content. <br /> <br />2) After I finally got the Interactual player to find and install a license for the video (the WMV uses DRM protection) I inspected the license and noticed it was only valid for 5 days. 5 days to play a movie I own??? I set the date on my machine forward by one week and, sure enough, the video was no longer playable. I set the date back and the video still wouldn't play (as expected). The quality of the video was nice, but I refuse to pay for a movie that expires in 5 days.  <br /> <br />Thank you Amazon for at least having a simple and straightforward return policy. It's in the mail :)

B000002I2I|5.0|Morrison Hotel strikes the perfect balance between a straight-ahead blues record and The Doors' signature, psychedelic sound.  Following the underrated but spotty Soft Parade, Hotel is refreshingly focused.  It's also probably the least \\"heavy\\" album that they made in terms of lyrics and musical pretension.  They actually sound like they are having a blast on this album.  Also, the changes within each song flow smoothly, as opposed to the abrupt shifts in style that plagued many of the tracks on Soft Parade.  Musically, Robbie Krieger takes over the reigns from Ray Manzarek as the lead instrumentalist, and despite him being the less talented musician, the change suits the band at this point in their career.  Ray is pretty much done with his mind-bending experimentation by now, anyway, and settled into more of a honky-tonk piano approach. <br /> <br />The dichotomy of blues and psychedelia is illustrated right off the bat.  The opening track, now a rock-radio staple, is pure blues shouted out with conviction by Jim Morrison.  (This is one of the songs that makes Morrison one of the all-time great sing-along vocalists, because he has a wonderful inflection that is fun to imitate, but he's not such a good singer that you would be intimidated to try.)  The next track, however, is a throwback to the era of the album that bears its name.  \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" would have sounded at home on The Doors first album, in fact, with cryptic lyrics, performed hauntingly by Morrison, and a surreal, acid-tinged soundscape provided by the rest of the group.  Fortunately, these two extremes don't divide Morrison Hotel, but instead provide the boundaries in which the band is free to explore. <br /> <br />\\"Peace Frog\\" is one of the great pop-rock songs of all time, yet boasts lyrics about a river of blood flooding the streets of Los Angeles.  Nearly as catchy is \\"Queen of the Highway\\", which, like \\"Peace Frog\\", boasts some fantastic Morrison lyrics that don't take themselves too seriously.  Two of the ballads, \\"Blue Sunday\\" and \\"The Spy\\" are welcome changes in pace.  The narcotic \\"Indian Summer\\" would drag a little bit if it weren't for such a short running time.  As it stands, it is a sleepy and hypnotic gem that fits in the album nicely.  There is filler, of course, like \\"You Make Me Real\\", but it's tremendously enjoyable filler nonetheless.  Throughout all of these tracks, the band tries to find the right sound. They are experimenting, but in an off-hand way.  Since they aren't making a big deal out of the experimentation, but simply enjoying the process, they never lose sight of their real goal:  Making a great record. <br /> <br />Finally, consciously or not, The Doors find the sound that they are searching for.  The album ends on a track that blends the psychedelic and the blues of the previous ten songs into a hard-nosed hybrid that prepares us for their next, and final, effort - L.A. Woman.  It's impressive that they were able to wrangle all of the disparate ideas and self-conscious weirdness of Soft Parade and produce their most accessible album to date.  Even more impressive is the fact that they would fine-tune their sound with renewed focus and go on to top themselves on their next release... <br />

B000002UAR|5.0|As an avid Beatle fan I would like to stress one aspect about the Fabs so often expressed by others...their ability to stick with you, follow you through your life and engage you as if they were your friends living down the street sharing a drink (or a smoke) and a twinkle of the eye....I know I have played Revolver thousands of times since I was 12 (I'm now 39) and yet I never tire of hearing each and every song...I think what is also fascinating is that this album is only 35 minutes long, but the Beatles cram so many ideas and sounds into that 35 minutes that there is no half-realized idea, no over-indulgent moment, no wasted note on this masterpiece...I will not highlight individual tracks, we all know that Revolver is the perfect blend of Harrison's emergence as a songwriter, McCartney's blend of pop balladry and classical flourishes, and Lennon's version of acid-rock guitar psychedelia....Revolver keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, all without the pretense of marketing to a particular audience.....its just the Beatles creating revolutionary music that would turn on the world....their greatest work...don't forget Paperback Writer/Rain recorded at the same sessions, which is also vital to this period ...

0440241588|4.0|I really enjoyed this John Grisham novel and think it is one of his better books.  This is a good tale of intrigue set mostly in Bologna, Italy, a city that sounds lovely.  Now that I know something about it, I have put Bologna on my list of places I hope to visit some day.<br /><br />The lead character, Joel Backman, is an anti-hero who you find yourself cheering for, even though at the start of the book he's not a very nice guy.  As the story goes on, however, Joel grows on you, especially because most of the characters who are out to get him are even more nasty than Joel is.<br /><br />As with most Grisham novels, the plotting in this one is very good.  I like stories that feature a hero who, against all odds, manages to out-fox his enemies, and that is the source of the action in this book.  It's a quick and easy read that will hold your interest.

B00008PRR9|4.0|Just for clarification, this is a review of the true stereo version of \\"A Quick One\\".  Since the CD and booklet of the stereo and mono reissues are exactly the same, there may be some confusion as to where reviews should be placed. <br />    Anyway, the stereo version sounds quite good.  Unlike the \\"My Generation\\" remixes, all the instruments are present (as far as I know).  I do wish the left and right panning were a bit more extreme.  I'm a big fan of that and it's very common for 60's style stereo mixes.  But it still sounds massively better than the original mono.  The bonus tracks are interesting.  Most of which are also in stereo. (\\"Batman\\" is mono and \\"Disguises\\" is still in fake stereo)  <br />    Now about Happy Jack; Even though it wasn't on the original British LP, the producers still should have included it here.  An acoustic version is included however. <br />    Perhaps in the future, a CD of the Who's non-album singles will be remixed in stereo. (Substitute, Pictures of Lily, I'm a Boy, Anyway Anyhow Anywhere, etc.)
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I used to really love this movie in 1983-throughout the 1980s, before alot of the younger public jumped on the bandwagon. I see so many people with Scarface shirts and other Scarface clothing. I admit it made me sick of the movie. I guess the reason why so many young people like this film is because it is a great movie. And has stood the test of 20+ years of public rereleases. Tony Montana was the major cog in this film, his charachter stood with me well after I first saw this film 22+ years ago. Al Pacino made you believe Tony Montana really lived. Al Pacino mixed in old time movie gangsters into Montanas charachters James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson. The cuban gang killings portrayed in Scarface were taken from actual Florida authorities accounts and police files. The classical music score by georgio moroder is incredible. Actor Robert Loggia as Frank Lopez a drug lord was a convincing charachter. This movie is a timeless classic as well as an excellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This movie was not well recieved by the movie critics and did not do well in the theatre, only after its vhs release it got worldwide popularity. Scarface merchandise has made and continues today to make amazing profit. Universal Pictures or whoever owns the Scarface copyrights could'nt resist the huge merchandise income. I guess that is why Scarface is so popular today, merchandise and a great movie can bring an old movie to a younger audience. Lines  from Scarface have become common immitations among the public. Scarface is not only a great movie but a great franchise as well. Great movie despite its played out popularity. A great directing effort by Brian Depalma. After 20+ years scarface is still an American epic that struck a chord with its audience....................................

0446310786|5.0|I figured out something when I finished re reading this book after I read new biography on Harper Lee titled \\"Mockingbird\\" Why adult revewers who love this book can not write or spell good? There are chunk of generation who are Mockingbird-free who is now about 50 to 60years old, well educated, well read, good speller but missed timing to read this book as young adult because it was not around or school didn't assigned it on them. These people grow up and know once how to appriciate good books, it is kinda hard to go back to pick up this book in first time in their lives. So naturally, if you are not an English major--means you can't write-- and an adult and read this book and able to appriciate it, chances are you are kinda person who won't read more complicated books anyway or your kid had to read it so you just did (my case) or watched movie first and got interested in or, you are an immigrant (my case) ---so we can't spell.  It have been four years since I read it first time and back then, I was reading only chicklits and books my kid was reading because that's about I could have understood. Now I can see through how much struggle for the author to make this book publishable with help from editor and agent. How come Atticus, that perfect dad, let kids go alone in the dark to Halloween pagent and aunt Alexandra, the gossip, would not wanted to accompany them knowing whole town is at the school? because otherwise Bob could not have chance to attack kids so whole climax won't come about. Scout does pre- show for the family and go so far to explain once she got to the show, that ladies too tired from decorating were not there, to justify her aunt's absence. I hate myself even thinking about all these while I was re-reading but could not help it. It moved me to my guts the first time I read it when I did not know any better (or worse)   It is sad as many kids love this book in this review pages, some kids just plain hate it. You have to be young and flexisible to hitby the chord but you have to be mature enough to understand the deeper message. I guess, that's why 6th to 9th grade are the best match for the first time Mockingbird experience. You can come back to it again and still moves you but, it still doesn't make you a good writer or speller.

0380973650|3.0|I am a fan of Gaiman and I have a number of his books in my collection and I will also buy his forthcoming collection \\" Fragile Things\\" released in September 2006. I hope the next book I read by him (Anansi boys, a sequel of sorts to American Gods) is more enjoyable. American Gods is not a bad novel at all, it's good, but, not the masterpiece it purports to be. It doesn't somehow fulfil it's ambition and I think Neil Gaiman will trump this novel at some point with the considerable talent he has. Bottom line for me is that all in all, it's a mixed bag of a story. Good but not great.

When I first saw it on TV I was hooked, I got lost to its absolute beauty, I think now I found the movie that ive been longin for for a long time. You spend most of the time wondering what really happen to travis while at the same time enjoying the picture perfect cinematography, and of course the always beautiful Nastassja Kinski delivers it most when its needed, and who would ever forget that poetic dialogue between travis and jane, whom many considered  the highlight of the film.  Watch it and enjoy.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|\\"This is not a teen movie.\\" This statement comes straight from director Rian Johnson and never have truer words been spoken. The language is strong, forceful and brilliant, and the settings dark, drug-infected, and noirish, harkening back to Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon.<br /><br />Being one of his first feature films, Rian Johnson has struck gold with this indie movie, making us wonder what he could accomplish with a larger budget (BRICK was made on less than $500,000).<br /><br />The story seems pedestrian enough. A high schooler named Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 3rd Rock from the Sun) takes it upon himself to investigate the death of his former girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin, LOST). The discoveries launch Brendan into dark corners where drugs, thugs, and friends combine to form a triangle of deadly proportions. Pulling heavily from noir films of old, this updated look and story has a unique place amongst the genre. Brendan's niche group cares nothing for cheerleading squads or who's dating who. The level of sophistication is upped to extreme levels, showing us a danger and intellect amongst the teen population never before seen on celluloid.<br /><br />The noir comparisons are the most fascinating. The cloudy skies, telephone booths, and shadowy locales give an underpinning sense of dread, much like films from the 30s and 40s. There's even a piano playing portion that obviously pays homage to the \\"Play it again, Sam\\" lovers.<br /><br />Shot on location at San Clemente High School (the directors alma mater) and edited on a home computer, this amazing flick will win audiences over with its wonderful camera angles, dark themes and excellent script. The acting, too, is well done with Joseph Gordon-Levitt appearing in every scene and pulling the quality of the entire production even higher.<br /><br />My only gripe is the sound. Editing must've been tough and several times lines were garbled or mumbled, making it necessary to rewind and find out what was said.<br /><br />Watch out Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Howard.

B000002GJ7|5.0|This album is the epitome of good mainstream 80s metal. Every member of the band sounds great on this album (Nuno Bettencourt in particular), even the production is amazing. And this album has a well thought out theme, too. The common string tying all the songs on Pornograffiti together is the theme of finding love in a cynical, decadent society.  <br /> <br />And, of course, the songs are rockin'.  <br /> <br />If you hate the song More than Words, it's just one of thirteen on this album. There's definitely more to Pornograffiti than Extreme's most popular radio hit.  <br /> <br />But when I say that, that also doesn't mean that the popular songs on this album are bad. Indeed, the last track Hole Hearted is fantastic. Great use of a 12 string acoustic by Mr. Bettencourt.  <br /> <br />The heavier songs are awesome too.  <br /> <br />Trust me when I say this: you will not be disappointed by this album.

B0002OERI0|5.0|i love how theres so much controversy on this cd and green day in general. some people think its total [...] and some find it inspiring. i guess its that way with all music though. i love green day. this cd is one of their more brilliant peices i think. the whole story continued through each song is amazing. Its a definate change from their older music but a great change nevertheless. the two longer songs: jesus of suburbia and homecoming are by far some of their greatest songs [[i think]] and its hard to skip past any song on this cd. yes, green day isnt as punk as they used to be, but thats because theyve grown and have become better musicians. they dont just scream and sing and play a few punk chords anymore. yeah theyve become mainstream. but everything that becomes mainstream isnt terrible. they have actual talent. and thats definetly shown throught this cd. buy it and you'll be one satisfied fan.
B000062YB1|5.0|While \\"Reign In Blood\\" is frequently regarded as Slayer's finest moment (at least of the earlier work), to me, \\"Seasons\\" is a far more mature album with some classic raging tracks -- Opening with \\"War Ensemble\\" and ending with the slower, but heavy and dark title track, the album is through and through raw, intense speed metal with great writing and playing. <br /> <br />The album does sound a little dated in comparison to their later work, but nevertheless, it withstands the test of time and for me sounds far less \\"80's\\" than \\"Reign In Blood.\\"
B00009XITP|3.0|I have \\"The Reluctant Debutante\\" in its VHS version in my permanent library, but I'm not really likely to add \\"What A Girl Wants\\" to my collection anytime soon.  Here's why.  I think the movie's producers goofed with Anna Chancellor's character.  In the original, the stepmother (played by the absolutely wonderful and radiant Kay Kendall, who died too soon and was the premier British comedienne of the 1950's) was, though a social-climbing flibbertigibbet, at heart a decent, good-hearted, well-intentioned woman who truly only wanted to do right by her stepdaughter and had a wonderful relationship with her husband (played by her real-life husband, Rex Harrison).  In the current film, Anna Chancellor, a very fine actress, is misused as a two-dimensional villain actuated by the lust for power at one remove (she wants her husband to become the next Prime Minister and will do anything to achieve that, even if it means being mean to her husband's daughter).<br /><br />If you want to watch \\"The Reluctant Debutante\\", do yourself a favor and get the original movie.
B000001FOL|5.0|Christia Paffgen, more famously known as Nico, is best known for her three contributions to the seminal classic \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" (1967). Nico, however, left behind a remarkable legacy, including film, modeling, and most importantly, an impressive recording discography.<br /><br />Compared to fellow Velvet Underground alumni, John Cale and Lou Reed, Nico's solo work is even less assessable, even more of an acquired taste. Much of her solo work probably can't even be categorized as rock, pop, or even Western-style music. Albums like \\"Deathshore\\" (1970) and \\"The End,\\" (1974) great as they are, are really out-there.<br /><br />Early on, however, Nico's music was although not exactly mainstream, more assessable. After coming to the United States and falling in with the Andy Warhol, \\"factory\\" crowd, Nico released her first single, \\"I'm not saying,\\"  a morose 60s pop-song showcasing the singers great potential. Then came her most famous work, \\"Femme Fatale,\\" \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" and \\"I'll be your Mirror,\\" (Reed) recorded for \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico.\\"<br /><br />While still in with the VU/factory crowd, Nico begin work on her debut album. Collaborating with such legends as Jackson Browne, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan, Nico released her debut album \\"Chelsea Girls\\" in the fall of '67. Because Cale, Reed and Morrison contributed to at least half the album's songs, it can in some ways be considered a companion piece to \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico.\\"<br /><br />\\"Chelsea Girls\\" is a brooding mix of Goth (before it became known as Goth) 60s pop and folk. It's sort of like Bauhaus meets Donovan meets Sisters of Mercy meets Tim Buckley. There are no drums or bass. The songs are all done acoustically, with overlaying strings and flute (recorded without Nico's involvement).<br /><br />If you loved Nico's icy-cold, melancholy apathetic songs on \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico,\\" you will definitely appreciate \\"Chelsea Girls.\\" There is a certain peaceful, yet nightmarish quality to this recording. Listening to this album is like a walk though the cemetery at night.<br /><br />As great as \\"Chelsea Girls\\" is, however, the album did not demonstrate Nico's true talent. Nico only co-wrote one of the album's songs, \\"It was a Pleasure then\\" (along with Cale and Reed) and didn't play on it. While Nico wrote almost all her own songs and lyrics and played harmonium on subsequent albums, \\"Chelsea Girls\\" is more-or-less the work of other artists, with Nico contributing only vocals.<br /><br />If you looking to explore Nico's solo works, this album is the best place to start. While \\"Chelsea Girls\\" may not be Nico's crowning achievement, it is none-the-less a haunting classic that provided a strong foundation for a remarkable recoding career.lsea Girls.\\" There is a certain peaceful, yet nightmarish quality to this recording.

Nico only co-wrote one of the album's songs, \\"It was a Pleasure then\\" (along with Cale and Reed) and didn't play on it. While Nico wrote almost all her own songs and lyrics and played harmonium on subsequent albums, \\"Chelsea Girls\\" is more-or-less the work of other artists, with Nico contributing only vocals. <br /> <br />If you looking to explore Nico's solo works, this album is the best place to start. While \\"Chelsea Girls\\" may not be Nico's crowning achievement, it is none-the-less a haunting classic that provided a strong foundation for a remarkable recoding career.  <br />
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I find it difficult to believe that anyone would think that the fascist government shown in \\"V\\" would be suggestive of the current American government.  It was CLEARLY drawn from Nazi sources!  It couldn't have been any more obvious, short of actually using swastikas!  IT'S FICTION, a story, not an expose of current world politics.  If you think this film is Fahrenheit 9/11, Part II, then you're looking at it with that as a preconceived notion.  You wanted to see it as criticism of America, and you found it.  I don't know how or where, but you found it. <br /> <br />For the rest of us, it was a good movie, especially if you prefer movies that aren't all car chases, gunfights, and scantily clad teenage girls.  There was an action element to it, of course, but mostly this was a movie that made one think about the power of words, of ideas, of freedom.  If you're into \\"thrill a minute\\" movies, keep going.  If you don't mind people actually talking to each other, give it a look.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Yes, \\"Reign in Blood\\" is a genre-defining album.  Yes, \\"Reign in Blood\\" is a brief, but sweet album.  Yes, \\"Reign in Blood\\" moves at about 10,000 miles per hour without any sense of mercy for the listener's blood pressure. <br /> <br />The album opens with the spectacular \\"Angel of Death\\", a Slayer classic that hits the listener like a brick to the forehead.  This song is lyrically brutal, and is about Dr. Mengele and the experiments he conducted while being stationed at Auschwitz.  Next comes \\"Piece by Piece\\", the best cannibalism song on the market today.  \\"Necrophobic\\" is possibly the fastest paced song on the album, and clocks in at roughly 1:40.  \\"Reign in Blood\\" doesn't let up until the first minute of \\"Jesus Saves\\", but after that minute Slayer resumes playing all lightning-fast riffs.  \\"Criminally Insane\\", \\"Epidemic\\", and \\"Postmortem\\" are all flawless and a ton of fun to listen to.  \\"Raining Blood\\" begins with sounds of a thunderstorm and then bursts into that classic \\"Raining Blood\\" riff, which I can't describe with words, it's that awesome. <br /> <br />There is only one minor disadvantage with the speediness of this album- and that lies with the lyrics.  They can be difficult to follow and at times Araya sounds like he's spilling out jibberish, when in fact the lyrics are very good and intelligent.  \\"Reign in Blood\\" is a lightning-fast metal classic that clocks in at just under a half hour.  For those new to Slayer, it will probably take a few listens before this grows on you, but once it does, you'll see how sweet it is. <br /> <br />***If this review was helpful, please click that \\"Yes\\" button***
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I had long since given up hope of ever hearing another modern Progressive Rock band to match those great bands of the 70's, when a friend let me hear this album, \\"Frances The Mute\\" on vinyl through a top end hi-fi rig. The instant the stylus touched the record, I new I was about to hear something new and full of surprises. I loved the music on first hearing and it takes a VERY special recording indeed for this to happen!  <br /> <br />\\"The Mars Volta\\" sounded like a band, which had been sucked from the 70's, put through some highly sophisticated \\"time travel/reprogramming\\" device, then injected with a large dose of music covering over three decades - and, finally unleashed to the public! This band seems to have captured the spirit and essence of those Classic Prog-Rock bands with the addition of a very large dose of diverse music (including \\"experimentation\\") - and finally, presented in perfect tune with the present day musical environment. In short, the band has redefined the \\"rock\\" genre in general and opened up a completely new area of music - an amazing feat!  <br /> <br />Even the production of this album switches between having that raw, hard-edged \\"Led-Zep\\" sound, to the refined and very latest recording techniques used now. This is an incredible accomplishment for any group of musicians to achieve, especially in the pretentious and cynical marketplace of today's music scene. <br /> <br />If you miss hearing all those ground breaking Progressive Rock bands of the past, then I would suggest you listen to \\"The Mars Volta\\" and you may be surprised and astonished by what you hear.  <br /> <br />Yanek

B000BOH8XW|1.0|I've loved some of Shakira's previous songs, and when I heard \\"Hips Don't Lie\\", and the fabulous \\"Don't Bother\\" (I LOVE those lyrics), I just had to get the album. I put it off for a while, but saw it at a semi-reasonable price, and bought it.<br /><br />My oh my.<br /><br />It isn't good!!! The only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks. I listened it to it twice. Normally I can love an album on first listen, very rarely will I get bored of it on a second listen. Nope, not with this one. Shakira has a lovely voice, but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" and \\"Don't Bother\\".<br /><br />Don't bother buying this album unless you are a true, die hard fan of Shakira. Don't waste your money.
B000HCO840|4.0|Fans gasped when it was announced that X-MEN and X2 director Bryan Singer was leaving X-MEN III to make SUPERMAN RETURNS - and he was taking his crew with him. Singer told 20th Century Fox that, if they would wait until he completed SUPERMAN RETURNS, he would make X-MEN III as well. Fox decided to go ahead without Singer, bringing numerous directors on to the project before settling on Brett Ratner. This worried fans ever more, as they realized that Ratner's previous films included RUSH HOUR, MONEY TALKS, and THE FAMILY MAN. What many fans forgot is that Ratner also directed the superb RED DRAGON. Personally, I was optimistic. Ratner's work on both RUSH HOUR movies and on RED DRAGON had impressed me, and I thought that he could do a nice job on the film.  <br /> <br />I was right - sort of. Ratner does a fine job, but he tends to favor shots that are either very close or very far away. Because of this, he creates a sort of claustrophobic feeling which hung with me throughout the film. Also, he can't wring great performances out of the actors like Bryan Singer can. On the plus side, Ratner does create some stunning visuals (with lots of help from the special effects team) - namely a sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Ratner is potentially a very good director, he is nowhere near as talented as Bryan Singer.  <br /> <br />Three other new additions to the crew are screenwriters Simon Kinberg (MR. & MRS. SMITH) and Zak Penn (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, ELEKTRA) and composer John Powell (THE BOURNE IDENTITY). The script is good, though it feels like the events in the film are rather rushed. Perhaps editors Mark Goldblatt, Mark Helfrich, and Julia Wong - taking over for John Ottman - are to blame for this. I also noticed that some of Wolverine's lines seemed forced; they didn't seem natural like those from the previous films. I must say that the ending, however, is very clever. Very clever indeed.  <br /> <br />Then we come to the matter of the soundtrack. John Powell's music fluctuated between being grand and atrocious. It's a sweeping score, but it seems a little too over-the-top. It's not as good as John Ottman's score for X2 or Michael Kamen's score for X-MEN, but it will suffice.  <br /> <br />The cast seemed far less stellar this time. At her request, Halle Berry's part was expanded. Though I've always thought that Storm was an interesting character - and Berry did very well as her in the first two films - her performance seems rather weak in this film. Hugh Jackman is still excellent as Wolverine, but even his performance isn't as wonderful as it was in the previous films. Then we have Ian McKellen, who is just outstanding as Magneto. He shines in each and every one of his scenes. Famke Janssen is great, although she doesn't get many lines. Also great is Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, and especially Vinnie Jones (LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH.) as Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a hulking character whose special ability is plowing through everything and everyone with no difficulty whatsoever. Jones turns Juggernaut into an extremely amusing character. His scenes are the most fun of any in the film.  <br /> <br />As both a comic book fan and an avid moviegoer, I enjoyed this film very much. However, the comic fan within me wishes that we'd learnt the origins of Hank McCoy (which I've also found very interesting) and seen Gambit, one of the major X-Men characters from the comics (LOST's Josh Holloway, a perfect choice, was offered the part but turned it down). Though it does seem rushed and a little short (it clocks in at 106 minutes, compared to X2's 133 minutes), I had a ball throughout the movie. I'd have liked to see Joss Whedon or Matthew Vaughn as director (both of whom were attached to the project at one time), but Brett Ratner did a good job. X-MEN: THE LAST STAND isn't up to par with Bryan Singer's X-MEN and X2, but it's a fine film nonetheless.
0007189958|4.0|This is one of the most original books I have read in a long time. It's seems completely fictional, but it consists of nothing but notes passed in school, emails, instant messages, text messages, and the good old fashioned way, letters. It also spans over 40 years just in one book. Of course, only the important events occur, years sometimes passing in the turn of a couple of pages.<br /><br />There's no particular no time period in this, as instant messaging is included quite early on in the book, and for it to span over 40 years, there's no specific year the book starts and ends. It can be quite confusing that way, but don't let your mind dwell on it.<br /><br />The book is about Rosie & Alex, who start off as best friends at school, and over the years, they encounter all the important events together: first loves, first jobs, pregnancy, marriage (to the wrong people at that), divorce, loss of jobs, reappearance of old girlfriends/boyfriends - basically everything you dread to happen in your life. Throughout all this, they argue, talk to others about what they can't tell each other, marry others ... The list goes on. They want to be together, but there's always some kind of obstacle.<br /><br />At first the book can be severely hard to get into, considering there's nothing but emails etc. But I've now read this book more than once (it must be 4 or 5 times now), and I still find it exciting!<br /><br />I identified a lot with this book, cos I'm a terrible hoarder, not only of material things, but stuff like emails & texts too. I have saved any email that ever meant anything to me, and the same goes for texts. I've saved some IM chats with my friends (which are somewhere), but I'm terrified about ever losing all my emails. They tell a story. They're nice to look back over every so often.<br /><br />I love \\"P.S I Love You\\" too, but \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" was confusing and disappointing, and I still haven't managed to read more than halfway through the book. I haven't even managed to GET halfway. I hope her next book follows on from \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Where Rainbows End\\", cos then it'll be great.er next book follows on from \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Where Rainbows End\\", cos then it'll be great.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The brilliant Hugo Weaving excels and Natalie Portman redeems herself (Princess Amidala, anyone?) in this all-too-relevant film.  This film deals with many of the issues relevant to politics today and brilliantly skewers many characters who will seem very familiar from current events - politicians who exploit fear, blowhard talk-show hosts etc.  Set in England after the demise of the US as a superpower, the film deftly refers to current political events as background to the rise of totalitarianism and ethnic cleansing.  The central theme of the film is the trading of civil liberties for security, and the difficulty of undoing such a pact once it has been made. <br /> <br />The film also tackles many ethical issues such as vengeance and torture with what may be for some people uncomfortable conclusions.   <br /> <br />Much has been written about Alan Moore (the original author) removing his name from the credits of the film, a decision which was based on the Wachowski Brothers (of Matrix fame) departing from the original text in their efforts to update it.  However, the Wachowski's have created a masterpiece that adheres to the spirit of the original book whilst holding up a mirror to contemporary politics.  Most importantly, the character of V (dandy, intellectual, mysterious) is largely untampered with.   <br /> <br />Unsurprisingly for a film that is based on a comic book/graphic novel, the main characters almost border on archetypes, and this lends an appropriately comic-book feel to the film, and in this respect although it has no animation it has some similarity to films like Sin City. <br /> <br />The plot centers around the interaction of Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey.  Carefully-placed reveals allows us insight into the events that (literally) moulded V's worldview and show his conversion of Evey from timid obedientarian to revolutionary.  Of particular note is Hugo Weavings ability to emote from behind a glossy, permanently-grinning mask.  The mask (and I am not going to give any spoilers here) is of a character called Guy Fawkes, a would-be revolutionary who long ago was foiled in his attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in England. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman gives a convincing portrayal of the personal journey that Evey is persuaded to undertake, and John Hurt excels as the megalomaniacal Chancellor Sutler.  All similarities between Hurt's Sutler and Adolf Hitler are of course completely intentional, as are the ruling party's insignia and oppressive behaviour both of which have definite Third Reich similarities.  Hurt's performance would seem over the top if it were not for the fact that we regularly see the same hate-spewing histrionics from political pundits and talking heads.  I would guess that Hurt modeled his performance on talk-show hosts every bit as much as the crack-pot dictators of the Second World War.  It is no accident that when Hurt addresses the public, or even his political allies in private, he does so over a giant TV monitor. <br /> <br />To call the supporting cast excellent would be an understatement.  Of particular note is Rupert Graves' brilliant portrayal of Dominic, the 'Voice Of London', a twisted, hate-filled talking head whose concentration-camp crimes are rewarded by a cushy job spewing vitriol over the airwaves on the government-controlled TV channel, a man so in love with his own persona that he even rants along to recordings of his own shows whilst in the shower.  His diatribes are punctuated with catch-phrases such as \\"I'm a God-fearing Englishman!\\" and \\"England Prevails!\\".  Also notable is Stephen Rea's portrayal of the beaten-down Inspector Finch, a man who has risen in the ruling party despite his not-quite-ethnically-pure family background and whose disillusionment with the party enables him to play a defining role in the plans of V and Evey. <br /> <br />Perhaps inevitably, despite providing the catalyst for societal change, V is ultimately consumed by his vengeance. <br /> <br />This film is not afraid to take on issues that many vendors of popular culture would shy away from, and that inevitably will invite criticism.  However as the poet Hardy once said \\"If way to the better there be, it exacts a full look at the worst\\".  If you haven't already seen this film, get yourself a copy.
B00005JP5J|5.0|This is a terrific family film. Well written, acted, directed and scored....The theatre was laughing throughout, the pace was great and it left my family charmed and feeling good. Wild and painful, but apt and poignant. Definitely to be seen.
0743454537|4.0|I picked up this book off the \\"free table\\" at my work simply because I love books and I knew no one else would take it.  I was surprised at how quickly I became attached to it and read it at all hours of the day.  It made me think a great deal as to what I would do in each character's situation. <br /> <br />Out of 423 pages, I enjoyed probably 415 of them.  I must say that as much as I hated Sara, I loved to hate her.  She makes the story that much more real.  By the time the closing arguments came, I no longer liked Brian for giving into his ridiculously foolish wife, but felt for him all the same.  And I must say Campbell is my favorite character.  Also, like many readers, I think there was a much better way to end this book that would have been just as short as the route Picoult took.  Because of the ending I will seriously reconsider whether or not I want to read another work of hers. <br /> <br />I must reiterate, the book was amazing and I definitely don't feel that I wasted my time.  A \\"must-read\\" even if I didn't like it 100%.
B000G73UEU|5.0|Aside from this soundtrack is the film which features most of these songs being performed at an Australian tribute concert. That unto itself may be a better buy when the time comes, as it hopefully will have extra performances available, not to mention the visual joy of watching Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Jarvis Cocker, Antony, Nick Cave and the rest dig into Cohen's brilliant and immensely poetic words. Like Bob Dylan, Cohen's canon is so great that a multitude of artists can recreate it's parts and reveal the depths of the song and themselves...I don't know why Rufus Wainwright's Hallelujah performance isn't here, and Famous Blue Raincoat, The Guests, and if memory serves, Bird on a Wire weren't in the theatrical release of the film. A great album, but I still hope for a fully loaded DVD!
0060736267|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It broke my heart during parts though, I had never realized how different times were then.  It is a bit long, but I found that in the end, the extra length was worth it.  Francie is by far one of my favorite characters I have come upon in any book.  Those looking for an exciting book may want to back away from this one, but those wishing to read a wonderful piece of literature definitely need to pick this up.
1401200605|5.0|The story of Hush begins with Batman rescuing a young Edward Lamont from his kidnapper Killer Croc, who has suddenly changed his M.O.  After the boy is safe he discovers that Catwoman in the area and pursues her after she steals the ransom money.    Unexpectedly his Batline breaks and he falls down into Crime Alley, where he is nearly murdered by a gang of thugs, but is saved by Huntress.    After receiving life-saving surgery by his childhood friend Tommy Elliot, Batman tries to discover who is behind it and why Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and possibly Catwoman are all connected.    It's a great story with excellent dialogue and exciting fight sequences.  The story is a well-spun story that involves many important players ranging from Catwoman to Superman.      Jeph Loeb is a writer who knows how to tell a good story.  His dialgouge is engaging and fresh.  His spin on all the characters within the story take them further in their development.  He knows how to grab your attention and keep it.  I loved every page of this book and could not put it down.    A well done mystery that gets better and better as it continues.  Hush: Vol. 2 is even better, and both are worth buying.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Lucky for me I have never heard the awful remix cd that others have commented about that came out before this gem was treated properly by the mighty Rhino Records.  Looking through dusty vinyl, I would find this one but it was always scratched up pretty bad and for good reason as I would later find out.  Last week this happened to me again and so I got on here to actually listen to some song samples.  I like ZZ Top's sound a lot even though I only remember having Eliminator on tape but I found that their production was too thin and slick for my tastes and some of the lyrics were pretty predictable/weak.  Well like others have said, this is an excellent release by ZZ Top when they wrote great songs, had  thick and raw/heavy production besides being a complete outlaw no holds barred type of band.  This belongs in every rockers collection for sure!
076781214X|5.0|I remember watching this at the movies and not ever wanting it to end.  Back in the day, movie tickets weren't too expensive so I think I saw it 3 times there and rented it out on video when it came out about 50 times.  It's been about 12 years since I saw it until today, and it's just as good and I still love it. <br />Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner) goes to her high school reunion and faints.  Upon waking, she is back in school as if it were all those years ago again.  I think for me, it was one of the first 'time travel' movies I saw.  It's not especially funny or dramatic, but it's really nice and warm and beautifully done.  It also stars a very young Jim Carrey which is funny to look back on. <br />This really is a cute movie and worth watching because there is good music in it (also a very nice score throughout), familiar faces (Helen Hunt, Joan Allen and a young Nicholas Cage to name a few) and a good feeling to finish with.  You'll love it. <br />
B000000W5N|4.0|I like their music, but can't watch Mick sing. This product was very good. In good condition, packaged great, no problems in receiving. Music is great too!
B000058983|5.0|As an open minded person, I have read the naysayers reviews along with the highly tauting ones, and I must add my 2 cents. I have listened to the Forever Changes music for nearly 39 years off and on. One reviewer hit the nail on the head basically saying you have to put this music on and let it happen to you. I remember being in the Army overseas when I bought and listened to Fleetwood Mac's 1975 release (their big break through). I could not understand why anyone would like that stuff, so I stuck it away and sent it home to go in storage. After I found out it had sold a million+ copies, I thought I should give it another shot. Suffice to say, it grew on me like a fungus, and i became a huge Fleetwood Mac fan. That's just the way it is with some groups. They make wonderful music with great lyrics (sometimes) and you just have to let it work on you a bit. Recently, I discovered Chris Rea, who is BIG in Europe, and should've been in the states. I love his stuff and am buying most of it up and buying more to give away to my closest friends and relatives...I am going to do the same with Love's Forever Changes cuz it is just that good! If you disagree, you probably didn't give it enough play time, try again and again and again...like that fungus, it will work on you. Believe it. Some music just hits you right away, but fades quickly as if it were a shooting star...short shelf life, but some pieces, like FC, never gets old to me. America is the same way; Dan Fogelberg; James Taylor; lots more; so, for those who just can't believe the 4.5 rating of 133 reviews from all over the globe, i just feel sorry for you. Maybe have your ears checked or simply open your mind to it a few more times. The 35th Anniversary cd and DVD are worth buying and the DVD has a short interview piece with Arthur Lee. And i must add that the album after FC, Four Sail is damned near as good as FC, but different, in fact there are about 4 songs on it I absolutely love, no pun intended. Buy them both and don't look back. Bankerbill out...
B000BTC5LW|5.0|How do you describe this concert?  The BEST one ever!  The music, the lights, perfection!  And just when you think it's gettng close to the end they perform the ENTIRE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON PLUS 3 more songs!  I bought the video when it came out about 10 years ago and have been waiting for the DVD - FINALLY it came out!   <br /> <br />If I had a tme machine, I'd go back to 1994, hock everything I owned if I had to and fly to London and attend this performance.  One of my great life regrets that I didn't go (like missing Woodstock and Roger Water's performance of the WALL live in Berlin AT the WALL!  - what was I thinking!??)
B00004WG2F|5.0|The major virtue of this emblematic film resides in the fiery character of their personages. Since we have born under the designs of the Trojan syndrome, it results us undecipherable certain behavior codes preserved by old legends enrooted and surrounded by the mythic paradigm.<br /><br />The essential core has to with the transition between the natural law and the tenet of the rules. Of course there is a notorious homage to Shakespeare's Titus and King Lear in which concerns to the well visible differences between these three brothers.<br /><br />From Lear we have the relationship between father and child. But Tristan ( thinking about Wagner?) is the embodiment of the irreverence, the son of nature, the alter ego of his father, a disillusioned Colonel who fought bravely in previous combats and singly detests all the related items with politics; he knows the real essence of the meaning of honor and loyalty under country' s service. But the nature is by definition, instinctive, because it has no memory. All his sons will enlist and fight as soldiers in the WW1, and through this process will face the reality of the youth's dreams. The weakest son Samuel looses the vision previous his imminent death (Remember the myth' s premise in the case of Wotan or Ragnar?). Alfred represents the new tradition, the submission and the loyal compliment of the law; he is the civilized man. But Tristan represents the wild force and definitively does not follow the tradition; he simply follows the bliss, the renaissance of the Viking' s spirit, that' s why his untamed spirit will lead him to new overseas lands and traditions.<br /><br />This movie must have shocked many people, because that generation of the last half of the XIX Century, wrought under nature's designs spoke another idiom and even reasoned in another level; but as well as \\"The wild bunch\\", this is precisely what it most liked me; the confrontation between the hunter approach of the life and the modern way of life. Obviously his author sympathizes with the wildness and Tristan's death is simply a consequence of the natural order or told in other terms, the cosmic designs.<br /><br />This was the film who catapulted Brad Pitt as solid actor, and one must guess that having as partner a monster actor as Anthony Hopkins it's easy understandable. What else can be added to this mesmerizing performance of the best actor of the world Sir Anthony Hopkins?. Formidable photography and sensitive direction. The masterpiece of Edward Zwick.<br /><br />Magnificent in every little detail. There is nothing to disapprove. But just five stars?.  An instantaneous cult movie and besides, one of the ten best American films of the decade.Obviously his author sympathizes with the wildness and Tristan's death is simply a consequence of the natural order or told in other terms, the cosmic designs. <br /> <br />This was the film who catapulted Brad Pitt as solid actor, and one must guess that having as partner a monster actor as Anthony Hopkins it's easy understandable.

1401302378|3.0|Recognizing the Long Tail is a powerful thing (though not original to Anderson as he readily admits), but not powerful enough to constitute a whole book. It would make a nice cocktail napkin sketch because it's that simple. See the curve, realize an example and move on with a new topic. Stretching a five minute conversation into a whole book is a big stretch.  <br /> <br />I also love the irony that a book about selling less to more is a best seller. Funny how that works.
0930289528|5.0|V for Vendetta is the story of one man's fight to right atrocities that were brought down on a future society that is held captive by a corrupt government. V, the masked avenger, was tortured and held prisoner for years, before an explosion and fire set him free. Hiding his scars behind a mask and gloves, he sets out to kill those involved in the mass genocide in his country. One by one, people begin to die.<br /><br />And caught in the middle is Evey, a young woman who is rescued by V, then whisked away to his secret underground lair. She is both terrified and fascinated by the man in the mask, by his plight and firm convictions that those who committed crimes against humanity must die. And when he tells her of his plan to literally bring down the ruling government, she promises to meet him one last time, right before his explosive event.<br /><br />The story ends the only way it can, with fireworks and explosions and death. Part Zorro, part Phantom of the Opera, V is the heroe we all wish to be. This sensational story sends a message about freedom and love. Freedom fighters unite! V for Vendetta is a blast!<br /><br />~ Cheryl Kaye Tardif<br />Author of Divine Intervention

B000EHSVQE|1.0|How many times do we have to see the \\"nerd movie\\" with the millionth clichés, dorky guy gets girl etc? Are there not other funny screenwriters out there that can get their movie made? The premise of Napoleon Dynamite is ancient, old, nothing new, and therefore I cannot recommend it in anyway whatsoever. EVERYTHING in the movie is a cliché that has been done before, and the lead is just annoying to watch. UNFUNNY! <br /> <br />Here's a movie inn  nutshell: Let's get some guy to dress up really funny and nerdy. Let him talk real dumb and slow \\"h e y   m a n,   w h a t ' s   g o i n g   o n   m a n . \\" Then put him in ridiculous scenarios like some stupid dance routine and you think you have a funny movie. NOT  Unless you are stoned and/or have the attention span of a two year old, you may like it.  I say don't bother as there are probably so many movies that are much funnier that you may not have watched.
B000002KIT|1.0|Sorry, but this concert is just not well recorded.  We lose Phil's vocals as he turns from the mic.  In the same manner we also lose sax on dancing in the moonlight, and guitar cords throughout the album.  The reason people love this album cannot truely be because it's \\"a great live album\\", but because it is a great list of Thin Lizzy songs.  Honestly, their main albums sound much better! Any other  Lizzy album recorded in the 70's dominates Live and Dangerous! I've listened to them all!
B000F6IOC0|4.0|When I popped Underworld Evolution in the DVD player I expected it to be the same as the first, only chopped into pieces and reassembled. I was wrong.<br /><br />Underworld Evolution is its own film. Yes, it still had Lycans and Vampires, but it has so much more. Firstly, the scene is not urban. Most of the movie is set in a wintry hinterland, which was fine by me. I loved the new setting. It made the sequel feel the same, but refreshingly different.<br /><br />There were also new monsters and bad guys. The winged vampire was one of the best cinema bad monsters to date. Awesome job! I would love to see a third movie with more creative monster madness.<br /><br />Lastly, the story holds its own and doesn't resemble the first. This is good.<br /><br />Overall, Underworld Evolution is a great addition to the Underworld family. I highly recommend the film. I do have a couple nit-picky items I would like to mention. First, Lycans don't really play much of a prominent role in this film except for Michael Corvin. It is much more of a vampire flick with some Lycan scenes thrown in to hold continuity from the first Underworld.<br /><br />Secondly, Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin in underused in the movie. Near the end, before his return, I almost forgot about him. While he was on screen quite a bit, there wasn't much about him that really mattered. I thought his character would play a prominent role in the sequel, but he was more of a minor player. His \\"hybrid\\" was of little importance. Kate Beckinsale's transformation was much more interesting and captivating.<br /><br />Lastly, the scene with Kate and Scott where Kate broke down in tears was a bit over dramatic and not really believable. This isn't a rip on Kate's acting - she did a wonderful job - but more a commentary on how little chemistry was developed between Michael Corvin and Selene in the sequel. I didn't buy there love affair, if you will.<br /><br />Great flick! See it! Buy it!

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This unique movie depicts everyday lives of mostly teenage characters in the small town set in the middle of nowhere. The individuals presented to us are hopelessly handicapped by the limits of their small town's life  - however this is not a movie with deeper meaning in mind, this is movie for laughs. The characters are carefully selected and well portrayed, situations and dialogs flawlessly written without a blank spot, superfluous scenes or empty dialogs. There is not too much of a plot because nothing ever happens in here - the main events are concentrated around the teenage dating attempts, who to take to the big dance, and the class president election at the local high school. <br /> <br />This movie offers intelligent humor in it's best; most big production releases with it's toilet type jokes can't even distantly touch what writers of Napoleon Dynamite were able to do here with minimum budget and little known cast. It appears that people who rate this movie so poorly are divided into two main groups; those who are not able to find any meaningful plot and so they condemn it, and those who seem to judge it way too quickly - and then throw it together into the same bin with Beavis & Butthead type humor - because the teenage characters and small town similarity... these two things are the only common points. <br /> <br />This title is worth your attention and time; my wife and I watched the movie quite a few times and so far we didn't get bored - it is funny & sweet at the same time; hopefully you'll be able to find your way to like Napoleon, Pedro, Deb and others for exactly what they are, and accept their strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br />
B000FFJ85I|3.0|I love AFI, and when I heard Miss Murder on the radio, I went out and bout the CD. I really only liked about 3 or 4 songs though. However, the good ones were VERY good, and I now listen constantly. I still prefer AFI's older music, but I think the band could still put out good CDs for a while.

B000EQH2QK|4.0|Shakira is one of the industry's most talented female artists and her latest offering (the English language Oral Fixation) is only proof of the reason why.  The Colombian songstress is--simply put--amazing: her signature bleat of a voice, chart-topping songs and introspective songwriting skills can make just about anybody want to shake their you-knows on the floor.  Oral Fixation is an eclectic album, nearly perfect too if it weren't for the record's two worst songs \\"Hey You\\" and \\"The Day and the Time.\\"  Newly-added \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" featuring Wyclef Jean does its job well, adding a much-needed club-ready instant smash.  Fijacion Oral's \\"La Tortura\\" is presented in a new format but remains just as addictive and likable as the original.  The record's best moments come in songs like \\"Dreams For Plans,\\" \\"Animal City\\" and \\"How Do You Do,\\" including the aforementioned \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" and \\"La Tortura.\\"  Despite two obvious (though not horrible) flaws (\\"Hey You\\" and \\"The Day and the Time\\") Oral Fixation remains a beautiful, poetic and all around wonderful sound.

0739441671|2.0|Having read first \\"Angels and Deamons\\" and \\"The Davinci Code\\", I found \\"Digital Fotress\\" somewhat boring. The plot is very predictable, especially when it comes to the major characters.  Just like the other two books, the main characters are a college professor and a beautiful and dynamic woman who is an expert in what she does (in this case being a cryptographer).    Possibly, the author tries to live his unfulfilled dreams and expectations through his writings. However it is not a bad read by the beach.

B0009MDPYM|4.0|John Constantine sees demons.<br /><br />He argues with them, dispatches them to hell, oh yes and occasionally even sleeps with them. He's a man on a mystical mission armed to his nicotine stained teeth with gold crucifix guns, chattering fright beetles and enough holy water to float even the Vatican for a month. Despite his laudable focus on ridding our Earthly plane of the foul miscreants, Constantine isn't a very likeable guy. He's not a noble priest exorcising a pea soup swilling teen of evil nor a sunny cheerleader who stakes Vampires. Constantine prowls the streets as a tortured, demon bedding, chain smoking rude guy who pretty much doesn't care anymore, because he really shouldn't even be here. His supernatural gifts are firmly tied up with his secret past, and those decisions both haunt him and drive him forward all at the same time.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is again the \\"chosen one\\", and trades in his Matrix sunglasses and black trench coat for cigarettes and a black suit.  Fans of his from the Matrix movies can't get away from the feel that this is Neo battling demonic forces instead of cybernetic ones.  However, Reeves performance is meatier and more confident and the \\"whoa\\" factor of his Bill & Ted days is thankfully missing here.  He may never win an Oscar, but he's a decent enough actor and likable enough to get him over the rough spots.  Rachel Weitz shines in a dual role and her depth as an actress is developing nicely.  Art design and the visuals effects in this film are stunningly beautiful.  When used judiciously and to serve the story, digital effects don't have to make a film look like an expensive video game and Constantine's visual FX crew should be praised.  We've seen glimpses of Heaven & Hell many times in movies and here they've been reworked yet again and effectively so.<br /><br />Think of Constantine as a pumped up, action laden FX driven version of The Exorcist.  This film undoubtedly will never attain that classic level, however the philosophical issues of good and evil and heaven and hell are played here with the right mixture of seriousness and entertainment to satisfy any horror fan who likes films dealing in matters of biblical proportions.
B00005RHGL|5.0|In 1993, George P. Cosmatos (the \\"Rambo\\" films) made an epic historical drama action remake (if you wish to call it such) of the classic film \\"Gunfight At The O.K. Corral.\\" Although the translations for the Latin used by Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn,<br /><br />\\"The Terminator,\\" \\"Terminator 2\\" [Special Edition], \\"Megiddo\\") and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, \\"The Saint,\\" \\"Batman Forever,\\"<br /><br />\\"The Prince Of Egypt\\") appear in the \\"Trivia\\" section, I still<br /><br />think that Cosmatos should have placed English subtitles for those phrases in the movie. Worth viewing, not only for the historical value of the film, but because of the star-studded cast, which includes the real Wyatt Earp's fifth cousin, also named Wyatt Earp, Kurt Russell (\\"Sky High\\"), Sam Elliott (\\"HULK\\"), Bill Paxton (\\"The Terminator,\\" \\"Twister,\\" \\"Titanic\\") Billy Zane (\\"Back To The Future,\\" \\"Back To The Future Part II,\\"<br /><br />\\"The Phantom,\\" \\"Titanic,\\" the made-for-TV remake of \\"CLEOPATRA,\\"<br /><br />\\"Sniper,\\" the TV mini-series \\"Sole Survivor,\\" \\"Posse,\\" \\"Tales From The Crypt Presents DEMON KNIGHT\\"), Billy Bob Thornton (\\"The Alamo,\\" the recent remake of \\"The Bad News Bears,\\" \\"Bad Santa,\\"<br /><br />\\"Pushing Tin,\\" \\"Armageddon\\"), Stephen Lang (\\"Gods And Generals,\\"<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\"), Powers Boothe (the TV mini-series \\"Joan Of Arc\\"), Thomas Haden Church (the \\"George Of The Jungle\\" movies, the upcoming \\"Spider-Man 3\\" [set for release next summer]), Robert Mitchum (\\"The Longest Day,\\" \\"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison,\\" \\"River Of No Return,\\" \\"The Wild Bunch\\") as the Narrator and Academy Award winner Charlton Heston (\\"The Ten Commandments,\\" \\"Ben-Hur\\" [Academy Award, 1959], \\"Planet Of The Apes,\\" \\"Soylent Green,\\"<br /><br />\\"William Shakespeare's Hamlet\\") as Henry Hooker. Too violent for young children, but older kids and adults will enjoy this excellent history lesson. Rated PG-13 for violence and brief strong language.
B000F39MAG|4.0|My title says it all. The singing is excellent, with Gruberova showing she can still pack a punch in her portrayal as Elizabeth. The updating of the opera to modern dress will deter many a traditionalist, hence my 4 star rating, although it does not bother me, as the dramatic qualities of Donizetti's score have never been acted out as well as this in previous productions. Watch it and see what I mean!

0767802519|5.0|One of the reviewers mentions that this movie has an additional 15 minutes which were cut from the US version. This is not true, none of those scenes is present.

B00009W0U4|4.0|As soon as the opening credits roll ( or collapse rather ), you know you're in for something. At the start you don't understand what's going on because the camera is shaking all over the place and you can't make out who's who and why there's so much arguing and fighting. Persevere and you begin to understand why, the camera steadies and a natural storyline begins to come to the fore.  <br /> <br />Realizing that his wife has been badly beaten up, one guy and his friend try to find out who took out this atrocity. Hence the shaky camera can be described as \\" blind with rage.\\" It's interestingly done. You'll soon find out that the movie goes backwards ( seems to be the fashion these days ) in finding out how this all came about. So in order to find out how this works you have to go backwards to go forwards. <br /> <br />We find out more about the trio the more we dig into the film. And it also brings to mind how people change completely after someone close to them has been assaulted. The uncontrollable rage that eats inside them. In a way, the fact this film goes backwards reminds you that when you ask someone who has lived with this trauma, they will often speak of their wish to go back to how it was before and how they wish they could turn back the hands of time. People also don't realize that this can last for a long, long time. They simply cannot be the person they used to be. And as a result this film portrays that excellently.  <br /> <br />However, it's not a film that can be watched lightly. This can be brutal stuff as it's unrelenting realism when it pictures would make anyone wince. I will wilfully admit that the centrepiece of the movie ( if you can call it that ) was Monica Belucci's rape scene. So brutal and ugly was it that I practically had to skip whatever was the chapter. Watching what I did, I could feel every kick and every beating that was given and I just winced and looked away. It was that brutal. <br /> <br />A film that will only test the bravest souls. It's not for the squeamish. To be quite honest, it's a hard film to recommend but it's something that must be given respect in terms of the sheer audacity to make a film like this. However if you want realism in your movies then I think this must be the film for you. Just be careful you don't get any nightmares. Or worse still, if it happens to you.......

055357342X|3.0|While I was able to finish reading the third book, I did find myself skimming a great deal of it because quite frankly I find GRRM's writing pedestrian and tedious. I found myself laughing at a reviewer of the 4th book using the expression \\"blah blah blah\\" because I had exactly the same reaction. This book could and should have been edited heavily... as a fan of Neal Stephenson I'm no stranger to long-winded epics, but GRRM is just not *that* talented a wordsmith! Most of the plot twists were telegraphed well in advance, so there were no surprises and in the end you are left feeling like you have read a book, not entered a world. GRRM never lets you forget that the plot is not flowing naturally, but is in fact heavily contrived. Kurt Vonnegut said it best: \\"...and so on.\\"
B0004Z33G4|5.0|The Rambo trilogy is awesome!Sylvester Stallone plays as ex-Vietnam veteran named John Rambo who comes to a desolate town,where he is thrown out by an overzelous ranger.Soon,Rambo's escapades land him in a prison,where  he escapes nito the woods and kills nearly all the town's officers.The battle leads to town,where Rambo blows the hell out of a dozen buildings and is finally brought out of hiding by his old Colonel,from where he is sent to jail.The sequel finds Rambo in Vietnam,where he is instructed to take pictures of a Vietnamese camp holding American P.O.W.'s.Rambo finds the whole thing is a conspiracy,and erupts into a one-man firestorm in which he blows Vietnam to bits.The third film sees Colonel Trautman captured during a mission in Afghanistan.When Rambo hears of this,he travels to Afghanistan to rescue his old Colonel,but first must square off against a dozen or so Russian soldiers.You'll love these films!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this movie. I like how they bridge the gap between this gem and Superman and cutting off ties with those disgraceful sequels like Superman III and IV. My favorites scenes were when Superman saved that jet and when that crook shot that big gun at Superman and he was walking to him like nothing and then when shot him in the eye, the bullet was flatten and Supes just looked at him and smiled. To the people that thought this movie was bad you guys are a bunch stupid idiots. I LOVED IT!!!! I can't wait until the DVD comes out.
B00005JMCT|4.0|American Wedding is so far the funniest installment to the trilogy.This one finds Jim and Michelle getting married,opening with what I've found to be the naughtiest scene I've ever seen take place in a resturant.Stifler brings more laughs to the screen as Stifler,who thinks the first thing that comes to his mind when he thinks of weddings:Bachelor party!The biggest scene,basically,is the bechelor party scene,where a gay guy Jim and his pals met in a gay bar brings a couple of foreign strippers to Jim's house and they party for a while,until it's busted up by the early return of Jim and Michelle's parents.Laughs and gut-busting humor ensue as the pals get caught up in what might be the best film in the trilogy.
B0002BO05S|3.0|This film moves like a procession through aisles of dogma. Deliberate, conservative, lovely, austere: the images go by like a series of Greek Orthodox icons. As attractive as they are, the landscapes of Utah and Nevada create the anticipaton that an Indian war party could swoop down at any moment. And after two hours in the old west, the voice of John Wayne seems quite appropriate. Unfortunately the use of Handel's Hallalujah chorus seems highly inappropriate. In an otherwise modern score, the use of this baroque period oratorio is almost comical. A film like this would look great as a series of stained glass windows in a church. But for sheer inspiration and dramatic impact, it doesn't compare with the Passion of Christ, the Gospel of John or even Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is such a good experience and I wish everyone had the chance to watch this series. I liked it better than the book upon which it was based.  The interviews at the end with the real members of Easy Company were wonderful. I watched the series when it first aired on HBO.  Unfortunately, the all too real events of 9/11 occurred midway and not enough attention was paid to this story and how well it was made.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Ms. Bailey Rae is my favorite new artist. Soul mixed with a sound of old standards. New but old. Very upbeat.
B00004SVIK|5.0|I just received and listened to this live disc of Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", and I still get the same feelings that I did in 1979 when the album first came out. And back in those days, I listened to it over and over and over...I even had an artist friend of mine re-create the album inside cover, complete with all the animation drawings, on my living room wall. I had turned it into a pool room/party room, and my friends and I had some incredible times in that room. Or so I've been told. Anyway, most of the people I read on this review page say exactly what I feel. Some bemoan the fact that there isn't a DVD of this concert. But back then, what did you do? If you were like me, I would \\"get my head right\\", turn off the lights, and then turn my stereo up just short of distortion, and let my imagination and Floyd do all the work for me. Yes, it was a dark and disturbing place that Roger took us all to, but I'm quite sure that we could all relate to it, especially if you were working on your own Wall, as I'm sure we all were, if you'll just think about it. Anyway, what I can't understand is the negative reviewers of this piece of rock mastery. What are you expecting? If you didn't like the album, or the movie, or anything else that Floyd did, why do you even bother listening to this in the first place???You either love Pink Floyd, or you don't, and that's it. There isn't much of an in between. Therefore, suffice it to say, if you are a lover of anything Floydian, you must have this in your collection. If you don't really care about Floyd, this is not going to sway you. But if you know someone that doesn't have an opinion, say a younger person, this isn't really what they need to be weaned on. A novice should be started on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Animals\\". If they like that, then move on to the earlier stuff, then unleash \\"The Wall\\". And that my friends, is my humble opinion.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Just reading the reviews on here reminds me of why Madonna is still around in the 21st Century- clear talent and a clever business plan. Most of the negative reviews on here I suspect come from jealous and bitter musical wannabies!  <br />The album is both a re-visit to her roots and a reinvention, something that keeps her fresh and a move that most artists are too afraid to do.  <br />The album showcases some real 70's inspired disco highs and is a refreshing change to so called RnB and pop tripe around in the charts at the moment.  <br />To Madonna and her success- good for you gal and heres to many more!
B000002B2X|1.0|I bought this while in Philadelphia, and it was terrible except one song which I played endlessly for about a day and a half before I got tired of it, and this would eventually end up on the soundtrack of the film \\"Clerks\\" which was \\"Got Me Wrong\\". This was a noble attempt of showing that they can do acoustic as well as electric, but it didn't help if the songs weren't strong enough.
B000002JR8|2.0|This is the day I first listened to this album. May 27th, 1994 was a day that I was at a crossroads where I made wrong choices, but that's because I thought things would be alright. I know the night before I had a bad night, but then I took a girl I was interested in to breakfast for her birthday, and she kissed me, so I thought everything was fine, but looking back I know now I made some bad choices, and I know I watched \\"OLTL\\" that day, and Rebecca had rejected Todd, and so I listened to this. I know the first 2 albums were aggressive metal, but here it was starting to be more techno sounding, and it's rather annoying sounding. \\"I'm Broken\\", and their cover of Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\" are the only 2 songs that are salvagable here. It also shows that the music scene was changing even as this album debuted at #1 on the charts.
B000000WJZ|1.0|It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was \\"Today\\", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was \\"Disarm\\" which I hated from day one, and the same with \\"Cherub Rock\\". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is \\"Mayonaise\\" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's.
B00005JP4U|5.0|Technology of our time, PowerPoint, used to its greatest power. <br />Science made understandable and compassionate. <br />Encourage everyone you know to see this movie, especially children and teens. Then tell them to study all the earth science that they can get because as the generation that will have to deal with these consequences, they will live or die by it.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I can't say it was enjoyable...it was painfully sad.  I can't say I'd listen to it over and over again because like an album that was about a singular horrifying event in our lives.... 9/11..I have not listened to Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\" after the 1st 3 or 4 times.  This album is like that...I prefer to listen to the earlier recordings than this one..it just reminds me he was near death.  I don't need to be reminded...I got it.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|This is an amazing box set, almost as amazing as how much the box set costs. Dont get me wrong im glad i purchased this over the standard cd edition its just i felt a little ripped off that is until i heard the 2 cds. This cds take you to another world, they just take you away out into....space. I cant describe it any better than that.(you'll have to listen to both cds entirely to get what i mean). Most of the songs have a groovy funk feel to them: Storm in a teacup, Hump de bump but theres some fast ones in there: Torture me, Shes only 18. Theres also some slow songs: If and Slow Cheetah are prime examples. I think the cds are perfectly balanced between mellow and heavy altho theres less heavy songs than mellow ones, it all seems to fit like the pieces of some puzzle. Dont listen to any cynic who disses this cd and Powermans new one as well as Breaking Benjamins new one. These 3 bands are prime examples of perfection. The cynics are just jealous and prob cant play instruments. I also have the same feeling about ppl critical of george bush, i say YOU TRY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AND TELL ME HOW EASY IT IS! <br /> <br />Anyways back on topic this cd is awesome buy it and let it take you away....
B000002MTR|5.0|I wholeheartedly hate this band.  Never liked it, never again will.  This album is something else.  It's loveable.  It kicks.  It does not sound as the usual \\"same song in all their recordings\\" syndrome that they suffer. <br /> <br />Dave Navarro gave them some gold to mold.  And they did it right. <br /> <br />Go for it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Bram Janssen's review (21.10.03) did it for me and I do not hesitate to give this album 5 stars and I haven't even bought it yet, but am about to!  <br /> <br />Like Bram, I too saw (only some of) that video whilst flicking channels one day and it moved me so much that it has haunted me ever since as I didn't even know what the song was.  My musically talented 19 year old nephew had recently told me that he and his other (up and coming) band members were REAL admirers of Johnny Cash - this puzzled me as I, like Bram, had never really 'known' Johnny or his music - I remember growing up to 'A Boy Named Sue' on the radio when it was a hit but sadly dismissed anything else by Johnny as I thought he was just `country'.  How wrong was I!   Having been influenced by my young and trendy nephew (who, incidentally is into Green Day, Muse, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana but to name a few), I too am now a fan but alas too late to appreciate Johnny while he was still here with us.  I am, however, comforted that he will live on in the younger generation like my nephew.   <br /> <br />Rest in peace Johnny and thank you for your music.  Now all I must do is wait for my CD to arrive, listen, enjoy and no doubt shed some tears for you. <br />
B000002MUN|1.0|I feel that Petty pretty much fizzled out after \\"Southern Accents\\" in 85. I haven't had much good to say from \\"Full Moon Fever\\" till this album. I just seen Petty's sound getting too grown up, and I just feel that it's not the classic folk-rock sound that I grew up enjoying. The stuff like \\"Shadow Of A Doubt\\", \\"Listen To Her Heart\\", \\"Thing About You\\", \\"One Story Town\\". I feel it's not as overproduced as the Heartbreakers 1991 outing was, but it's still not good sounding. It's not as care-free sounding, and with an artist like Petty it has to remain laid-back sounding. I really didn't like any of the songs here except for \\"You Wreck Me\\", and the \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\" I say that it's the worst Petty song ever. It's worse than \\"Mary Jane's Last Dance\\". \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\" is a depressing harmonica piece that just doesn't tickle my fancy; it makes me cringe to thoughts of suicide. I remember hearing this at a time in my life when I really felt low about myself, and this didn't help me with healing. This was released in the second half of 1994 the pivitol year for rock and roll as this was just lost as anything else that was released the second half of 1994.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|I got this movie knowing nothing more about it than who was in it (Denzel and Clive were enough to sell me) and that it was a bank robbery movie.   <br />I was in for a surprise.   <br />This is not another cop/criminal action-adventure.  Inside Man uses magnificent acting and great plotting, with a little of Spike Lee's social commentary thrown in, to move film along at a nice pace. With as little action as it has, the movie wastes no time and manages to keep you entertained the whole way through, right up to the end when everything falls together.  And as far as the ending: it may not be your typical \\"happy ending\\" per se, but it'll leave you with a smile on your face. <br />Watch this one and recommend it to others.  It's a good flick. <br />
B000000OSO|2.0|I was disappointed with this. I was kind of hoping that they would get down to business, and do a real 70's retro sounding album. I was put off by the slick produced \\"Pump\\" album from 1989, and wanted to hear something on the lines of thier first album, or \\"Get Your Wings\\", but here the songs were too weak, and most of them had way way too much harmonica on here. Songs like \\"Fever\\", \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Cryin\\", and \\"Crazy\\" are just as bad as if the group ran thier nails down a blackboard. \\"Amazing\\" was a annoying ballad, and with that, and \\"Crazy\\", and \\"Cryin\\" having Alicia Silverstone in them made me jealous as I'm like: \\"Why is it always the rich ones?\\" There was only one real good song on here, and that was the last one which was \\"Boogey Man\\". I did go onto find out that this was during the time that the group was having a falling out with Geffen Records, and was tired of the record president causing trouble with the contract. This is why I'm giving this 2 stars otherwise it would've been less.

B000002V07|1.0|However, I did hear some more of this back in my days of working at a trucking company, and I would go to this corner store to buy stuff for the people, and this 17 year old girl who was called \\"Flower\\" would play this, and now I think she's near 30. I know if you wanted to paralyze me, and make me docile as a pussycat, or make me curl up in a fetal position is to play \\"Fade Into You\\". I remember hearing this after May 27th, and after my car accidents, and I just fell apart. The slide guitar, the soft singing, and the slow movement it just made me think of girls/women laughing at me, and this is from where I know that a couple of girls had stood me up a couple of times, and it just reminded me of this. The rest is just as bad.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|You'd never know from my music collection that I like The Eagles, singularly or as a whole;nary a cd to be seen, except for one old Joe Walsh entry. This DVD caught my eye as it was used to advertise a big-screen TV at my local video rental place, and on a whim I rented it. It brightened up my weekend considerably.<br /><br />It's comforting to see so many of the veteran performers still operating at such an energetic level, especially after self-proclaimed headlong charges toward oblivion. This is addressed eloquently by Joe Walsh (\\"I was drunk once - for twenty years\\")in a new song called \\"One Day At A Time\\" - an exhilerating and typically Joe Walsh song that caught my attention from the very first note. Joe has always been my favourite Eagle anyway; he seems to have the best approach to life, and certainly he would have to be in the running for Funniest Rock Musician. He'd definitely have my vote.<br /><br />This two-disc set covers The Eagles from the start, and incorporates all the individual high points. As already stated, the energy level is way up there; it was recorded in Melbourne, Australia, with an audience ranging from little kids to oldsters like me, and not only is it a packed house, everybody is singing and dancing. No dozers here. And on stage, you'd never know these guys are cruising toward that nasty word \\"old\\" (Joe Walsh will be 59 in November; Don Henley is already there, and Glenn Frey will be 58, also in November); they never were a group to gyrate and race around on stage, but here they get together on some of the songs and hop in time to the music, clearly enjoying each other's music and style.<br /><br />All the great songs are here; \\"One Of These Nights\\",\\"New Kid In Town\\" \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\";one of my personal favourites, \\"Heartache Tonight\\"; along with a spate of Henley's most singable, best-loved songs, \\"Dirty Laundry\\", \\"Boys Of Summer\\" \\"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\\", and Glenn Frey's hits as well, \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"Desperado\\". Joe Walsh's music is also well represented, but Joe really only has to be there for it to be worth watching; he makes a party wherever he goes. During \\"Life's Been Good\\" here, he dons a hardhat with camera attached and films the audience.<br /><br />This is a high-powered, well-produced concert; makes me wish I'd been there. As a DVD, it's a keeper.represented, but Joe really only has to be there for it to be worth watching; he makes a party wherever he goes.

B00012FXAE|5.0|This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of the first and this and enjoy.
B00005JNRY|5.0|I have to say that I've seen this movie twice, and it was time well spent.  As Pixar always does, the animation was outstanding, and the story was top notch.  The kids can see all of the cool race cars, while the adults can appreciate the story about individuals who care about each other. <br /> <br />This movie has definitely been one of the better movies of the summer.  We need more movies to remind us that life is too short to not stop and smell the roses.  We need to appreciate those around us and what they bring to our lives.  Towards the end of the movie, when Lightning McQueen stops right before the finish line and goes to push \\"The King\\" over the finish line, the viewer can see McQueen's transformation from a selfish race car to one who realizes that he needs others on his team in order to succeed. <br /> <br />I wish that there were more movies out there with such a positive message and lots of humor.  It is ironic that a movie about cars can remind me of why we need other people in our lives. <br /> <br />Pixar does it again.  Cars hits a homerun, scores a touchdown, and wins first prize in the race.  We all need to remember to stop and smell the roses.  Seeing Cars reminded me of that very fact.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|<br />I do like this album.  Although track two (\\"The Answer Lies Within\\") and track four (the U2 inspired \\"I Walk Beside You\\") can seem cheesy, the album is still very worthwhile. <br /> <br />I find it very enjoyable, although it took me some time to decide that it wasn't too depressing.  That's the thing about DT--you need time to decide your feeling on it.   <br /> <br />If you're easily depressed, then you might wish to listen in moderation, (try not to become too addicted--like me) and do what you can to not overdo it.  (Because not only are the compositions potentially depressing, but the average DT song is five to eight minutes long, with occaisional huge tracks, like the twenty-four minute long track eight!)  Whenever I've overdone it in the past, it's given me a bad mood, and yet at the time, I couldn't quite put my finger on what the cause was.  So be cautious. <br /> <br />For those of you that aren't overcome by depression so easily, then you'll probably do fine.  Especially if you listen to hard rock or heavy metal regularly. <br /> <br />With all that said, this album is more than worth the money. <br /> <br />T.K., 14 <br />
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The neocon reviewers don't get it. This is not a movie about the US goverment today. They hate this movie because it shows where this goverment is leading us. \\"V\\" is a true hero because the goverment he fights is unambiguously evil. We are not there, yet. This movie is merely a warning. It asks us to \\"look ourselves in the mirror\\" and not let our fears override our values. The dangers we face from terrorists are real, but also the fear mongering and deception of this goverment are real. That's the only way to explain how something as un-american and un-patriotic as the \\"Patriot Act\\" (\\"Articles of Allegiance\\" in the movie) can get that name and be accepted by the citizens of our country. We as a nation are sure to face new attacks from terrorists, but we should never renounce our liberty for the sake of security.  As Benjamin Franklin said: \\"He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither\\". Maybe the intentions of the neocons are good, but \\"I'm not here for what you hoped for, I'm here for what you did\\".    ++Spoiler Warning++    The movie itself is brilliant, the dialogue stupendous. In real life walking around quoting Shakespeare may be pedantic, but in a movie with a subtext about the power of words it's more than appropiate and actually enjoyable. \\"V\\" is a flawed hero, driven more by the desire for vengance than by ideals, but idealistic never the less. He realizes his shortcomings; he has became a monster and tells Evey as much in the climactic scene: \\"You are right about what I've become, there is no tree at the end for me\\". In other words, there can be no happy ending for \\"V\\", no tree to climb with his love like Edmund Dantes. The genius of that scene is that it makes the movie morally consistent.  In the end with the announced destruction of Parliment \\"V\\" just gives the people the opportunity to lose their fear of the goverment and reclaim their freedom. It still takes the will and civil courage of the people to actually walk the streets to take it back. This \\"movie a clef\\" as a metaphore is simply perfect and should be seem for what it is ... a warning.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|<br />Keira Knightly has finally stopped getting collagen injections on those lips of hers, and it's quite an improvement in this somewhat decent movie. <br /> <br />The acting on Knightly's part wasn't bad, and neither was Donald Sutherland's, but the rest of the cast was annoying. <br /> <br />And although the music was very good most of the time, it was drowned out by the terrible cinematography.  That cinematography! <br /> <br />The lighting was very pretty, although whenever the characters in the movie would take a stroll in town, you could tell that the \\"town\\" was a set. <br /> <br />And why did Elizabeth (Keira Knightly--no, I'm not confusing it with Elizabeth in \\"Pirates\\") stand on the edge of that cliff in the first place?  Why did she wish to be there?  Was she dreaming?  If not, where in the world was she?  How did she get there?  How long did it take her to get home?  What's the point in having that in the movie, seeing as it made no sense? <br /> <br />Altogether, this movie was just so-so.  But if you can tolerate obnoxious cinematography, things happening for no reason and annoying co-stars, then I'm sure this is the movie for you. <br /> <br />T.K., 14

B000BKVQTS|3.0|I love fantasy movies and had high hopes for this one, especially considering the director, writer, and cast, but I came away with a general feeling of disappointment.  <br /> <br />Unlike many reviewers, I did not find the acting to be all that impressive. I have no doubt that each of the roles could have been played as well or better by any number of other actors. Indeed, I found the role of Cavaldi, as portrayed by Peter Stormare, to be the most annoying character since Jar Jar Binks...his grossly exaggerated accent and facial expressions began to wear thin very quickly. I generally respect and enjoy Matt Damon's efforts, but felt that he simply \\"phoned\\" in this performance. <br /> <br />The spooky settings reminded me of Sleepy Hollow, and could have been the basis for a wonderful fantasy movie, but this one lacked the genius of Tim Burton and a coherent, engaging plot. All sorts of wierd and, at times, seemingly unrelated events transpire in rapid succession, without any unifying, galvanizing central thread. I never became engaged by the plot or characters, and spent most of my viewing time analyzing the intricate sets and effects.  <br /> <br />In the DVD commentary, the director, Terry Gilliam (who is capable of much better work) stated that he hated the script upon first reading. I think he either should have obeyed his first impression and avoiding making the movie, or held out until a more coherent, engaging, satisfying screenplay could have been created.  <br /> <br />Rent, buy, and watch this movie if you are a staunch fan of fantasy stories, but be prepared to be disappointed as I was. This entire production could have been so much better, with a little more attention paid to the story and a little less paid to the style.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a Joss Whedon fan from the start coming from Buffy and Angel, so naturally I just had to start watching Firefly. After you stick through the first five minutes of war on the outer planets (which I think turned a lot of viewers away) you get to the current time in Firefly with Mal as captain and all of his crew members. The writing in the series is wonderful- full of witty comments and fantastic characters that are well developed. You cannot help but fall in love with the series and each crew member in their own way. I highly highly recommend this series- I have shown it to my friends all of whom have fallen in love with it.

Ms. McPhee just stands around most of the time looking <br />ugly. The story line could have been better done.  The silliness and crudeness were really overdone for a children's movie.

The plot lines do not correspond completely but it is understandable  in order to allow new viewers to enjoy the movie and get a quick background introduction. This movie MUST be seen if not for the plot but for the wonderful interaction between characters and Joss Whedon's witty writing!

0062502182|2.0|I must give it a low grade. Why? Simple. When a kid is given a list to read during the summer they always have some book that is 'Required to Read'. Sadly and disappointingly this book had to make it to that specific title. I must really wonder if I seen a book most childish, shallow, and out of place than this... <br /> <br />I'm not going to go into detail about how much I loathed this book or why I have chose to loath this so called 'brilliant piece'. I know how many of you would turn around and say, \\"What would you know? It's a cute book and you don't have good taste.\\" <br /> <br />Maybe you're correct. In my mind however it circulates on one's opinions and that's all these reviews are about right? Opinions. What's not to say your opinion isn't as good as mine? This world is full of them. Don't take them for granted. <br /> <br />I simply do not take interest in a sheperd boy trying to find his way in life with his spiritual guides and his 'personal legend'. Simply put it. Wisdom can be from personal experiance or just overlooking things. You don't need to conversate with the golden grains of sand to understand that. <br /> <br />Might I add that if the character was truly important to this...he should not be referred throughout the book 'as the boy'. So he was not important enough for this book? He was after all the main character with his 'Personal Legend'. Without the protagonist what book is there? If the character does not know he is more than just a 'simple boy' by now he must a very depressed sheperd. <br /> <br />However this is not the worst book in the world. It has made me infurieted enough to pluck my eyebrows off one by one (no lies, no jokes.) at how a book of this standard peaked its way to the list I had to read. Required? I doubt that. The teachers are out to get us. This book is a joke for my age. Are they dumbing me down so quickly? <br /> <br />Kids younger than I would probably love it. They probably would find meaning beneath this book. I sure hope they could do it better than I. For the wisdom in this book didn't reach me yet.

I concur with most of those here who awarded this work 5 stars. IMO, there is a thread running thru those reviews as well as this man's work which gives a glimpse of the essence of the man and his art. Prairie Wind and the Ryman DVD \\"Heart of Gold\\" performances are excellent. Both Mr. Young and his music demonstrate that good things really do stand the test of time.

B000GGSM76|5.0|The Head on the Door may just be the best of the Cure's re-issued catalog yet. Being a long standing fan of the band, I have owned every release, in every known format, vinyl, cassette, analog CD... finally songs like INBETWEEN DAYS, KYOTO SONG, CLOSE TO ME, and A NIGHT LIKE THIS, leap from the speakers with the sound they deserve. The bonus tracks are a great concept too. Instead of each track being a different version of a song that has been remixed 1000 times, Robert Smith is actually trying to show the progress of each record as it was taking shape. Far more bands should follow in these steps... All of these new discs are must haves for fans of the band. Don't listen to the reviews of people fretting about re-touched vocals or lost song intro's... Damn Man! Get a life, kiss a girl. This series is a true gift from Robert to those of us who have taken the journey with the band in our own ways.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I think it is the best movie that Steve McQueen made.  Explained the prison system in French Guinea.  Great movie.
0786915749|1.0|I would really like to know the average age of the reviewers who rated this book favorably. <br /> <br />I read 210 pages and finally had to quit. I just couldn't keep reading. The writing is very unimaginative. The authors have a very limited use of vocabulary - the sentences are short and stilted and they often use the same adjectctive or other words repeatedly to describe a scene  or other point of the book.  Once you pick up on this you can't help but notice it over and over throughout the book. <br /> <br />The resemblance to Lord of the Rings is almost laughable. At one point the 'kender' character (which would be the hobbit) says something like \\"I used to own a magic ring once - have I told you about it?\\"  Duh!!! <br /> <br />Another thing that is really annoying is the authors constant use of exclamation points. Instead of using clever and sophisticated writing to make a point - the use short sentences punctuated throughout with exclamation points. Again- once you notice it, there is no ignoring it and it becomes more and more irritating. Where were the editors??? <br /> <br />Young adults may find this book interesting - which is scary - as for me this shows what poor writing it takes to get someone to claim a book is one of the best they've read.  It will be a long time before I give another Weis/Hickman book a chance. My time is too valuable to waste it on such poor writing.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This cd is beautifully sung and lyrically brilliant . I thoroughly enjoy it!
B00003CXAT|3.0|Having deleted my old review, I'm now going to give a less biased one.    Good:    I don't even need to mention the special effects.     The atmosphere was really great.    Very good music.     Ian Malcom and John Hammond were decent characters.    Bad:    The other characters were generic and cliched. Back when I was younger and first saw this is wasn't so bad. Being older and having seen many older movies watching most of JP's character scenes is boring.    Switch \\"Velociraptors\\" and for \\"Xenomorphs\\" and \\"Tyrannosaurus\\" for \\"alien queen\\" and it becomes clear that once the action starts, this becomes another rehash of the \\"alien\\" formula. Again it wasn't a problem when I was younger and hadn't seen movies like \\"Alien\\", but now it seems generic and kind of boring.    A complete waste of Sam Neill's acting.    Everyone who died practically had \\"dead\\" written on their forehead in neon.    Overall:    As you may have guessed by now, I don't like this movie because I've basically outgrown it. But I guess it is a decent movie, though tyounger viewers would enjoy it a lot more.
B00005JP7M|5.0|Just see the movie if you are wanting a fun night out.  Or if you simply want to feel good the remainder of the night.  Remember this, there are people who have an interest in you not \\"wanting\\" to see certain movies and you might wonder why they are being paid to do so.  Just as Match Point was an intellectually brilliant commentary with good humor, Scoop is vintage Woody Allen.  Treat yourself.
B00004U8JV|5.0|Steven Speilberg actually made a good monster/animal attack movie for once. <br /> <br />On another note, Nick, a character who appears in this movie, was the character most people wanted to make a return in 'Jurassic Park IV'... which was supposed to be released last year. Regardless, it's already confirmed that Nick won't be returning.
B00005JOYM|5.0|\\"World Trade Center\\" is brilliant! Oliver Stone's directing is brilliant! This is one of his best films since \\"Platoon\\" (1986), which he won an Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director! He has also won Best Director for \\"Born On The Fourth Of July\\" (1989) & Best Screenplay for \\"Midnight Express\\" (1978) This is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Stone. Nicolas Cage is brilliant as John McLoughlin, a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Michael Pena is excellent as Will Jimeno, another Oscar-worthy performance. Maria Bello (as McLoughlin's wife Donna) & Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Jimeno's wife Allison) give excellent performances as their wives, two other Oscar-worthy performances. Andrea Berloff's (who wrote the upcoming remake \\"Don't Look Now\\" (2007), this is her debut film) screenplay is brilliant! The music by Craig Armstrong is brilliant! The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is brilliant! The film editing by David Brenner (who has worked with Stone since \\"Salvador\\" (1986) & won the Oscar for his work on \\"Born On The Fourth Of July\\" & Julie Monroe (who has also worked with Stone since \\"Salvador\\") is brilliant! The casting by Kerry Barden (who has worked with Stone since \\"Any Given Sunday\\" (1999), Billy Hopkins (who has worked with Stone since \\"Wall Street\\" (1987), Shalimar Reodica, Paul Schnee, Suzanne Smith (who has worked with Stone since \\"Born On The Fourth Of July & Mary Vernieu (who has worked with Stone since \\"The Doors\\" (1991) is brilliant! The production design by Jan Roelfs (who worked with Stone on \\"Alexander\\" (2004) is brilliant! The art direction by Richard L. Johnson (who worked with Stone on \\"Born On The Fourth Of July\\") is brilliant! The set decoration by Beth A. Rubino is brilliant! The costume design by Michael Dennison is brilliant! This is one of the year's best! This is just as impressive as \\"United 93\\" (2006) is. This is a film to remember on Oscar night.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. \\"Go With The Flow\\" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back!
B00005JM2I|5.0|The venerable Gary Cooper adeptly portrays Howard Roark, an unwavering principled architect in the Ayn Rand testament to individuality, \\"The Fountainhead\\".  Roark is a scion of modern architecture, steadfastly rejecting the accepted classical concepts in his field.  His stubborn approach initially leaves him penniless and without clients forcing him to work in a Connecticut stone quarry.<br /><br />While toiling in that rockpile, he meets Dominique Francon played by the comely Patricia Neal, a wealthy socialite and daughter of one of New York's foremost architects.  The frigidly emotionless Neal works as a columnist for a large tabloid, The Banner whose owner is wealthy newspaper magnate Gale Wynand played by Raymond Massey.  So begins the interplay between these three main characters.<br /><br />Cooper eventually gains fame and fortune designing and constructing a controversial housing project that is lampooned by The Banner with the approval of Massey.  Massey's henchman, architectural columnist Ellsworth Toohey played by Robert Douglas, jealous of Cooper's creative genius, proceeds to excoriate his every effort.<br /><br />Neal and Cooper fall in love but realize they can't be together and she eventually marries Massey. The wealthy Massey recognizing the genius of Roark bestows many choice projects on him and lives his life vicariously through Cooper's spirit.  In Massey's rise to the top he has lost his individuality, always catering to the masses.<br /><br />Cooper becomes enticed to design a massive housing project using a schooltime crony of his and Neal's father's partner the soft and venal Peter Keating played by Kent Smith as his front.  When the clients decide to alter his plans without first consulting him, denying him control of the project, the steadfast Cooper decides to take matters into his own hands.  His actions result in a court case, in which Massey is forced to take an unpopular stand.  Throughout Cooper rigidly stands up for the tenets in which he believes, refusing to abandon his creative rights and ideals.in which he believes, refusing to abandon his creative rights and ideals.

B000F7CMRM|3.0|This movie is supposedly based on Robert Baer's non-fiction work on America's floundering espionage in the Middle East, but frankly there are so few similarities I wonder how the producers could dare to make this claim. The film, if anything, is more consistent with Sleeping with the Devil.<br /><br />There are some very real aspects to the film, which came highly recommended to me by fellow Middle Eastern scholars. But except for the realistic portrayal of Islamic fanaticism, and acts of religiously motivated terror, I really didn't see what all the hoopla was about.<br /><br />The acting, to be sure, was good. But the story is very confusing, and which corrupt officials and oil company executives are doing what evil to whom is often almost impossible to discern. I suppose that's one of the difficulties of being in the spy business.<br /><br />But if you want to make a fictional movie about the spying, and how it is affected by corrupt politics and corrupt corporations, it's a good idea to tell the story in enough detail for viewers to figure out what the heck is going on.<br /><br />Three members of my family watched this film, and all of us came away, well, disappointed.<br /><br />If you want to know about Bob Baer's book, skip this film, read [[ASIN:140004684X See No Evil]], and then read [[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil]].

B00005JP7Y|5.0|This is one of the most delightful films we have seen in a long time. The story is warm, and meaningful, with excellent character development, plot, acting, dancing, and music. And it teaches morals and ethics, to boot.<br /><br />Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a down and out, teenage foster kid, stuck in a family with a harried foster mom, struggling to support the family; a beer guzzling, TV-addicted, couch potato \\"dad\\" and two younger foster siblings, just as lost as he is. He hangs in his run down Baltimore neighborhood with  Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington), whose mother works at night, which is when the boys routinely get into trouble.<br /><br />Tyler and Mac regularly jack cars and sell them at the local chop shop. On Saturday nights, they drop in at a neighborhood night club, populated by the occasional gunslinger, but with the best break dancing anywhere. And Tyler is a natural.<br /><br />One weekend night, after being threatened with a gun and fleeing the club, Tyler, Mac and Skinny run through the streets, kicking cans and carelessly tossing refuse. Then one of them accidentally hits the window at the Maryland School of the Arts. Skinny decides to smash the window completely, and before long, the boys are in. They ogle the halls and showcases until Tyler finds the auditorium and heads for the stage, awed by the costumes, sets and props, which which the boys are soon dancing--and smashing.<br /><br />Tyler takes the rap for his friends, who flee into the night. Sentenced to 200 hours of community service, he at first wants nothing more than to finish his time, mopping floors, changing lights and collecting trash.<br /><br />But while making repairs on a ladder one afternoon, he witnesses a series of inept male dancers trying out as the partner for Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan). They trip, they fall, they drop her. They stink. She goes through them all, and then wonders what to do. She needs a stand in until her regular partner recovers from his sprained ankle. Tyler offers to catch her. She hesitates, but when he convinces her that he's serious, she is surprised to see that he not only can catch her--but do it gracefully.<br /><br />An appeal to school director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) wins her hesitant support for Tyler to temporarily take the role. Over the next few weeks, he helps her to rework the piece, jazzing it up, and adding several more dancers he has recruited from around the school. He also convinces her to let her talented friend Miles Darby (Mario), revise the music, after Nora's erstwhile boyfriend Brett Dolan (Josh Henderson) drops Miles from his group to sign a New York recording contract.<br /><br />There is some really original music here, some great dancing, and a wonderful plot, emphasizing the importance of friendships. It's a heartwarming story of success in the face of adversity, and tragedy. A great family film that teens especially will love.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappenprained ankle. Tyler offers to catch her.

0780622553|4.0|Dark City is an inspired film. Rufus Sewell is always worth watching and delivers a thoroughly believable performance within the incredible world of Dark City. John Hurt is a good hard-boiled police detective with the proper degree of angst. The sets, the special effects, but above all the storyline keep one guessing and fascinated. A definite cult classic, which leaves lingering questions and a vague, but enticing disquiet in the viewer.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I know real people that are quite similar to every character in this movie.  I never was an Adam Sandler fan until this movie.  He really has crossed over from just being a simple comedic actor to being a complex, moving dramatic actor.  The child actors/actresses are also amazing which adds to the ability to believe the story.  I've probably seen this movie six times now.  I love it every time.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|The movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is riveting and fascinating.  There is plenty of action and drama.  It is a must see.
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|Oh, man, this is rough. The debut was OK, the second was middling sophomore slump, and now, this third one is just ghastly - a real mess and a total letdown. What glimmer of talent on display on the first record has been replaced by flat, tuneless, and totally bland riffs in search of song structure and hooks that never come. Did you see the lead singer try to \\"sing\\" on SNL?  Sadly, he looks cool in his para-military peacoat and touseled rockstar hair, but the guy cannot carry a tune, for real. Out of key yelping is a understatement. Just painful to listen to.  Why bother?  Make this CD a coaster.
B000008JI5|5.0|I have had the cassette \\"Synchronicity\\" for 23 years since I was 9 and it recently quit playing.  I bought 3 gold \\"Synchronicity\\" cd's and the sound is much fuller and better.  I bought one for a girl at work, one for my brother and one for myself. It is my favorite cd.  I never get tired of listening to it though the song \\"Mother\\" is really strange the rest of the Cd is great and it sounds better in gold.
B000002UB3|5.0|...Not many other artists could pull off a feat as grand as The Beatle's Abbey Road!! I bet you anything that you'll smile when THIS music starts its rockin' and rollin'!  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you The Beatles!  Perhaps the nation that was so moved by this awe inspiring band also saw, early on, their great potential in influencing bands of the future.  And it is safe to say that The Beatles were one of the most beloved and respected bands this world has ever known.  It's not for just any old reason that they came to be known as \\"The Fab Four\\", or as a major milestone in musical history!  They dared to experiment with bold new ideas and sought opportunities to try something a little different.  In a way, to venture into the semi-unknown if you will.  Many of their songs have great sound effects added in.  They broke tons of records and barriers and throughout the process each member of the band had the grand opportunity to develop and polish off a playing/writing style all his own.  Something that today Paul McCartney and Ringo Star are probably very glad for.  ESPECIALLY since they are now independant musicians.  Did it all pay off in the end?  Well, I'll let you do the math on that one!  So let's see: rock solid appeal, strong fan base, great past and history, good success today, and a stellar array of song material.  It all adds up and grows on ya!  What's not to love?  The Beatles weren't a band to be taken lightly and today they still warrant the same respect as they did back in their prime.  It's not every day that songs from so long ago still elicit the same strong responses they did as when first released.  But it looks like these guys managed to pull just that off...that and getting me hooked on them!  For first time listeners I'd recommend any of their anthologies (because they offer such great variety) or The Beatles 1.  Just one fair warning, however!  If you wait any longer to fall in love with this band, I'll have to personally call you CRAZY!!lol  If you check out just one of their albums make it Abbey Road.  All of their albums are awesome, but this one is among their best!
B000E1MTV8|4.0|This is in direct response to the guy that is saying that HD-DVD is inferior. You need to learn what your talking about before you come on here yapping BLU RAY BLU RAY BLU RAY.<br /><br />As of right now it is very common knowledge that the combination of Microsofts VC-1 with HD-DVD is putting out a noticably better picture than the Blu Ray MPEG2 combination. The Toshiba is simply getting better bitrates and lets face it when talking HD, bitrate is everything.<br /><br />As for the storage argument, even Sony has backed off of using that argument in its promotion of Blu Ray. The fact is that right now Sony only has single layer Blu Ray discs available with 2 layer coming very soon making the 25 Gig disc a 50 Gig disc. HD-DVD is currently capable of dual layer at the moment for 30 Gigs with a 3 Layer disc on the way soon making it a 45 gig disc. So to sum that up for you HD-DVD will max out at 45 Gigs and Blu Ray will max at 50 Gigs. If you thing that a measly 5 Gigs is something so big as to sway your decision on which format to support than your crazy. 45 Gigs is absolutly plenty of room for 1080p movies. Sony has conned you once again into thinking you need something you dont.<br /><br />So to sum up this argument, at the current time, HD-DVD is by far looking like the much better choiuce of the two formats. Better picture quality, cheaper player and a very descent selection of movies on the way. Ihave made my choice and its HD-DVD.<br /><br />As for the movie The Italian Job, Its not the best of the Paramount releases but it is a nice crisp image. I actually think the reason its not as sharp as some of the others like Sahara is the original film stock. Its still a very nice upgrade from the original DVD release and being its one of my favorite con movies to come out in recent years, it was a no brainer. Overall I would give it a 8/10 for the picture quality with another 8/10 for the sound.<br /><br />GMOC!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Superhero movies tend to work best if done as a trilogy. Unfortunately, studios don't view superhero movies that way and see a particular character or characters as being a franchise: if they can get characters on the screen more than in just three movies then the better it is for them. This seems to be the approach that was taken with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. The series was originally envisioned as being a trilogy with one or two spin-offs. That approach seems to have been thrown out. Granted some of that might have to do with the series and film's original director, Bryan Singer, leaving and taking the majority of the production crew with him to make SUPERMAN RETURNS. After Singer's departure, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND was in production limbo for awhile until Brett Ratner was given the reigns. In a strange bit of irony, Ratner was originally supposed to direct the first two X-Men films and left and was supposed to direct SUPERMAN RETURNS and left there, too. In both instances, Singer took over the helm. Despite the change-up in direction and production, there really isn't an excuse for X-MEN: THE LAST STAND being the somewhat lackluster film that it came to be.<br /><br />The story itself is full of promise. The federal government develops a vaccine that can cure mutants of their disease. Many mutants are excited by the prospect of living life as a normal human. However, many other mutants aren't very keen on the idea. Neither Professor X (Patrick Stewart) or Magneto (Ian McKellen) support the vaccine. Both mutant leaders believe that mutants should embrace their talents and gifts. However, the two leaders strongly differ on their approach. Professor X preaches tolerance while Magneto sees the creation of the vaccine as a declaration of war upon all mutants. The mutants led by Magneto begin the war against humanity in full force, while the X-Men find themselves in the middle: protecting the humans and preaching Professor X's message of tolerance and unity.<br /><br />The movie builds up to a huge climatic battle between Magneto's mutants and the X-Men and humans on Alcratraz. Unfortunately, this battle doesn't live up to the expectations it has built. There are some very cool parts of the battle, e.g. the scenes with Beast (Kelsey Grammer). However, the battle is rather anti-climatic. Everything in the film leads up to that battle and then nothing really happens. That is a major let down.<br /><br />The best part about X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is seeing different mutants on screen. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back as is Storm (Halle Berry). Professor X and Magneto are here, too. In fact many of the mutants from the first two movies have returned (well Toad and Sabertooth and Nightcrawler are mysteriously absent, though Nightcrawler's absence is explained in the video game based on the movie). However, other than those four most of the mutants play much smaller roles. Rogue is hardly on the screen; Cyclops is destroyed with only about a minute of screen time; Angel's introduction is huge, but he's not really seen. I realize that part of this is because there are so many superheroes and not all of them can be seen in each film. However, part of it is because the studio is setting things up for sequels to come. In some way, they are following the lead of the comic books: some characters are written off to make room for new ones, but if need be you can always bring someone back from the dead. That makes for interesting, though frustrating reading, but doesn't translate well on the big screen.<br /><br />Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is a mediocre comic book movie. The movie introduces some great new characters and contains some very interesting battle sequences.

B000GTJT0W|4.0|Now I wont sit here and blow sunshine up this pictures behind. It is an action adventure popcorn film and isnt intended to promote mensa leveled discussions. With that being said this picture absolutly suceeds in being what it is, a fun adventure film. I see films like this all the time as my son loves them and not many of them do I think about much after seing them but i absolutly loved this film. Great chemistry between the actors, especially between McConaughey & Zahn. Zahn plays his part perfectly and never goes overboard which is a pitfall for his type of character. Playing it crazy but not annoyingly so, Zahn really steals the show.<br /><br />I wont go into detail on this film as its pretty pointless with action films although I will say its entertaining and puts the characters into situations where the film never bores and moves at a nice brisk pace. I would love to see a sequel to this film with Zahn & McConaughey teaming up again. Penelope was basically eye candy but did what she was supposed to well.<br /><br />Bottom line is this movie does exactly what it sets out to do and that is not to win an academy award but to highly entertain an audience that is in love with the action-adventure film genre.<br /><br />As a footnote this movie absolutly shines in HD-DVD and is by far the best looking film paramount has released yet. After viewing sub par HD-DVD releases such as Tomb Raider from them it was nice to see Paramount up the ante with this one. This is by far the disc I would put in to show off my system to someone. At times i wonder why I spent so much to upgrade to HD-DVD but then I pop in a movie like this or Pitch Black and that feeling drifts away into pure amazment. If you have an HD-DVD player and enjoy a good action flick, this is a no brainer!!<br /><br />Peace!!
B000B7QAHO|5.0|What a treat, visually, musically, and performance wise.  Johnny Depp was riveting and the supporting cast outstanding.  The combination of all these elements seemed to congeal and bring out lessons of the story in a sweet, sublime fashion that I don't think could have been done with any other cast and crew.
B000G75AE8|5.0|like I said before...Dave Lombardo has officially saved this band. His return to Slayer marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. This album proves it. After listening to the first minute of the opening track I knew I was in for something amazing!<br /><br />Buy this album you wont regret it.
B00000JNNY|5.0|At last is still one of the finest recordings ever!  Chilling vocals that get under your skin and stay there.  Etta at her best!
B000667GFK|5.0|I have been waiting for a CD from Luis with Mariachi and this was definitely worth the wait.  Miguel is such a professional that he wouldn't put out anything but class. <br /> <br />If you like mariachi music, you will love this CD.  It is a work of art!

B000F0UV0E|2.0|I really like Emmylou Harris and hoped this CD would reflect similar songs that I enjoy. BUT this CD is really too much country. IF I had known that I would not have bought it.
031286504X|3.0|Enjoyable short read. Better than the 70's movie version and better than the author's Hell House.
B0002W18MU|4.0|I like Johnny Cash and thought this CD was special considering it was his last. His voice had alot of emotion in it which I am sure is because of the death of his wife. It is definately worth having in your Johnny Cash collection.
0441013074|4.0|I usually am put off by hard sci fi authors, but this book was a very entertaining. Pretty much good action through out. It shares a couple of concepts with the Hugo nominated \\"Spin\\", but I found this one much better. It reads more like a thriller. First book I've read by this author and I will read more by him.
1573228737|4.0|In Victorian England, a scholarly spinster with a tragic past who prefers feminine companionship becomes at the recommendation of her attending physician, a lady visitor at a women's prison.  Expecting to forget her tragedy and heartbreak by doing charity work with women \\"more wretched than she\\", she comes under the spell of a spirit medium serving time for fraud and assault.  Is the prisoner the real deal and an innocent woman wrongly sentenced or is she just a con-artist and seductress?  Chapters alternate between the medium's diary told in flashback leading up to the events that caused her to be imprisoned and in the present of the story in the diary of the lady visitor.  The twisted ending is revealed in the final 2 chapters of the book. <br /> <br />Loved this book, I found it a bit slow reading to start, but it does pick up.  This is a must read if you like period stories.  If you liked Michael Faber's \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\", you'll like this.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I enjoyed the entire CD.  It was refreshing, with lots of good tunes.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|There is nothing like this album in music right now.  Totally fresh and unique which is becoming more and more rare.  I've had this cd in my car for about 3 weeks now and haven't taken it out once.  Cee-Lo has one of the oddest sounding voices but you can feel the emotion in his singing.  Very soulful.  Cee-Lo plus Dangermouse...nuff said.
0743454529|5.0|This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I ever read.  Since then, I've read them all.  Having read most of the reviews on this book, I felt compelled to write one of my own.  I thought the entire book was amazing.  A truly sad ending, however it certainly did not ruin the book!  I thought it just added to the masterpiece.  I was really taken in by the issue of a child genetically engineered for the sole purpose of saving her sister's life.  There are some very difficult moral questions raised in this story, however there are no right or wrong answers. This book, and most of her books,  cover many controversial topics.  It was a great read and I highly recommend it!
0060589280|5.0|I had not heard of the author before a friend recommended this book. Books that move me to tears are few and far between, but this book did.  Mr. Coelho has a spartan writing style that adds elegance to this work. He has a poignant way of addressing so many issues we must confront in life and love.  His story has crystalized so many thoughts in my mind that I would not know where to begin describing them in print. In short, his book encompasses so much from love, to life to Rousseau to the juxtaposition of sex and love and the contrast between Switzerland and Brazil.  Maria serves as an amazing character in leading us along the train tracks of this tale.  His quote from Ecclisiastes near the end brings it all home.
B00003CX95|5.0|Yes, yes, we all know the troubles Mr. Gibson has been going through lately. The DUI. The ant-semetic remarks. His consequent arrest and public contritions. We sometimes get caught up in our favorite actors/actresses' off-screen antics and forget about the talents that attracted us to them in the first place. If this is the case with your Gibson attraction, all one needs to do is view \\"Braveheart\\" again. It reaffirms why Mel Gibson ranks up there with Scorsese, Spike, Speilberg and Eastwood as great American directors. I don't agree with what he said, but I do like the majority of his films, especially this one. Now for my review:<br /><br />Braveheart is the story of Scotsman William Wallace who lead a revolt against English oppression in the Middle Ages. At first Wallace, like most of his countrymen, is more or less content with England occupying Scotland. That is until the English king (Patrick McGoohan)instates a law that declares that on their wedding day, Scottish brides must sleep with English soldiers before they lay with their husbands. I just want to take a moment here to point out the similarities between the Scottish/English conflict (which still rages today) and the Black/White conflict (that still rages today) in America. NEWS FLASH: We're ALL human. We all put on our trousers one leg at a time. Chill. Anyhoo, Wallace and his bride are secretly married at night to avoid this sanction the king has imposed, however one of the soldiers takes a liking to Wallace's bride and tries to attack her. She fights back, wounding the guard and has her throat slit for her rebellion. God save the Queen and England indeed! Wallace exacts a bloody revenge on the soldiers and takes over their outpost. Word quickly travels back to England that a peasant upstart has started a revolt. The film is filled with grand action scenes (some of the most realistic war scenes ever), political plot twists and turns, and yes even Romance. Gibson and writer Randall Wallace knew what they were doing when they decided that the catalyst for Wallace's revolt would be the death of his beloved. If it could make the future Queen of England (Sophie Marceau) swoon, why not the world-wide female audience? The film also has great scenes between the King and his homosexual, inept son, which makes me point out the father/son relationships throught the entire story: Young Wallace and his \\"Da\\"; the King of Scotland (Angus McFadyen) and his \\"Pa\\"; all of which ends with the elder kings dying and their sons overtaking the thrones.<br /><br />There are just so many good things about this film that I don't know where to begin, so I'll just hit on a few points: Why didn't Patrick McGoohan receive an Oscar nomination at least?! It can be argued that McGoohan's performance is what actors dub  \\"One Note\\", meaning the actor never really changes their emotional content. But what a note to hit...repeatedly! McGoohan's King of England is a cunning, cold, manipulative, evil boor. If his performance is patterned after the REAL King of England during this period (Edward Longshanks), its no wonder they dominated through the centuries. They say that \\"the eyes are the windows to the souls\\", well one look in the king's eyes and you realize that he has no soul. Only when he is on his deathbed, unable to speak, and is told by Marceau that she is carrying Wallace's baby, do his eyes register anything akin to human emotion. Definitely one of the greatest film villains of all time. Another point: As I've stated before, the battle scenes are as accurate as one can get, predating Speilberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" by three years. Notice how even after the fighting has ceased, you can still see soldiers crawling around on the blood and limb covered ground, clinging to life. This, coupled with the bleak mud and rain soaked surroundings of Olde England makes you feel as if you're in this long ago world. And lastly: Wallace's cry for \\"Freedom!\\" as he is beheaded makes for a fine martyr-momentin film lore. One can easily see the link between Moses, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King to William Wallace. People can only take so much oppression, overt and covert, before they fight back for the simple, God-given right to LIVE. Its clear to me why this film won best picture of '95 and why Mel won best director. If you haven't seen this film, please do so; and if you have, it deserves repeated viewing: For Freedom!!!ment in film lore.

B0000648WZ|5.0|Brand spanking new DVD of a fun movie with spaceships and giant bugs. What's not to like?
B00003CXMG|5.0|I just got this movie yesterday.  It rejuvinated the songs of the time in a way that I never felt before.  I'm only 19 and yet I felt the way my parents must have when they heard these songs. They had meaning again. They felt pure.  Never in all my life has a movie done that for music.  Im going to start an online group dedicated to bringing back Rock and discovering modern day artist who hold on to that unique sound. You have to see this movie.  It speaks to me in more ways than one. I'm an aspiring journalist and though I dont sing or play an instrument it moves me musically too.  Music is my mood changer.  I could be pissed at the world and for that moment in that time, that one song could calm me.  These songs can do that again.  Buy the soundtrack. Buy the movie. ROCK HAS MEANING FOR ME AGAIN!!!!
B000DZIGDU|1.0|Where to begin with a film so full of verbal and visual clichés? Taken from Swofford's cynical memoirs, Mendes goes to town with the usual \\"grunts as foul mouthed dupes thrown into war by capitallists\\" routine. The language is gratuitous except to convey how Hollywood thinks recruits and PFCs behave. Drill sergeants have long been prevented from slapping recruits but here we go again with scenes showing the supposed brutality of the system. <br /> <br />Mendes thought he had the raw material for a great war movie. He doesn't. And it looks like he gave up trying halfway, throwing around liberal and literal plagiarisms from Apocalypse Now, Three Kings, Full Metal Jacket, The Hill and Deer Hunter. It's pathetic.  <br /> <br />For the acting, Chris Cooper phones his performance in and Dennis Haysbert wanders in from another movie. Only Peter Sarsgaard emerges with any credit. An actor to watch for but not in this nonsense.  <br />
B000EU1PKA|5.0|Yes, this album followed two enormous ones (keepers 1& 2).  However, the musical quality of \\"Someones Crying\\" and \\"Mankind\\" are some of the best songs that Helloween ever produced as far as lyrics, vocals, guitars, and drums are concerned.  And of course \\"Your Turn\\" is a nice change for Helloween.  The B-Sides \\"You Run With The Pack\\" and \\"S**t and Lobsters\\" are melodic and talented as well.  Some songs on this album such as \\"Number One\\" may really turn some people off because it lacks the \\"metal\\" feel, however, it is not bad either. I would have given this album 4 stars because of the song \\"Heavy Metal Hamsters.\\"  That song is just too cheesy for my taste. However, the other songs demand 5 stars :-). If you only like metal then this album may dissappoint you.  But if you admire creativity this album is worth getting.  Make no mistake though: \\"Someone's Crying\\" is one of the fastest songs that Helloween has written.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Since these reviews are best kept short and specific, meant to let others know if they should buy a title or not, I will simply state, that this is the best Music DVD of the year in my opinion and you should buy it right now!  <br /> <br />I have been only a casual Pink Floyd fan up until seeing this DVD. Although a concert DVD without Roger Waters in the band is not as good as any performance with him would be, David Gilmour is a genius, and he is well worth the focus of your attention. The actual quality of the production of the film itself is what makes this performance so incredible. It sounds and feels like you are inside the concert hall when viewing the DVD and I find myself wanting to watch it over and over again. This DVD has inspired me to go back and complete my Pink Floyd CD collection as each era of the band is special, and while I hope for a reunion with Roger and David soon, I will more than enjoy this 1994 performance for a long time to come.
0792838068|5.0|For years one of my favorite movies. The roles played by Cage and Shue are haunting reminders of a true segment of our society. While the roles are cleaned up with a \\"sexy\\" prostitute and swave drunk, the unfortunate truth is there is a significant percentage of this country the are living lives as presented by these carachters. Individuals who can not survive and have to make a living by selling themselves or bury there pain/anguish with alcohol or drugs. Do not let the glittzy hollywood music, lavish Vegas setting fool you into thinking this is a love story. It is a tragic story that is played out by thousands of people in urban, suburban and rural settings across this country everyday. Cage desereved his Oscar and Shue should have also won for this powerful, courageous portrate of one overlooked segment of our society

B0000630YA|5.0|The reason why Rock and Roll has always been the Devil's Music. <br /> <br />Notwithstanding Messr. Cooper's conversion to Christianity, (and I do applaud him for his foundation to help wayward teenagers, as remarkable as that seems, since he \\"goaded\\" wayward teenagers in the 1970's!) there was a time when parents were convinced he was sent by Satan himself. <br /> <br />The truth is somewhat more prosaic. <br /> <br />The guy is brilliant. When the original Alice Coooper group didn't see the potential in greater theatrics, Vincent Furnier said \\"Goodbye\\"--and took Alice Cooper with him! <br /> <br />Truth be told, there was only one Alice Cooper. The bandmates he had (Smith, Dunaway, Buxton & Bruce) were very good, and some of their early work (My Stars, Second Coming, Desperado) was so perfect it begs description. <br /> <br />Alice Cooper was always smart, and it also shows in this, his masterwork: Welcome To My Nightmare. He has a collection of great musicians (Dick Wagner, Steve Hunter) and the eminence de gris himself, Bob Ezrin, at the helm of the entire thing. <br /> <br />The concept of this album is so bone-chilling that it, also, like the musical classics it spawns, defies words to describe it.  <br /> <br />Rare is the album where every track is good, but here it is.
B000BTJDGC|1.0|Having looked forward to this, I was woefully disappointed.  Emily wasn't established as a character prior to being possessed so I didn't care what happened to her.  The whole design of the film was stylised in a way that made it feel unreal.  The demonic manifestations were boring & didn't (as in The Exorcist) challenge the beliefs of those involved.  The spooky shadows popping up to scare the other characters didn't add up to anything.   The 'significance' of things happening at 3 a.m. was hokey.  And whenever people thought intruders were in their homes they never did what anyone would do in real life & turn on bright overhead lights to see what's going on or not going on clearly.  Emily, while possessed by (for no particular reason) six demons (including Legion, who I thought was himself many demons: 'My name is Legion, for we are many,' he says in the good book), manages to take time out to write a lachrymose letter to her priest about encountering the Blessed Virgin who says she's going to be a saint.  I don't know why the demons let her do that, but what the hey.  The film also features a hokey 'witness through the windscreen' moment, featuring sugar glass, which I thought went out in the 70s, & was reminiscent of the crummier moments of The (original) Amityville Horror.  Emily jumps out of a window in a trashy 70s fashion while being exorcised.  And surely you simply can't hand over 'total responsibility' for your deranged daughter to your local priest: the parents would have been charged with neglect themselves (at best); & saying 'it's the priest's fault' would be no defence.  The film pretends to be even-handed about the reality of the possession but the visual coding clearly tells us that we're supposed to believe in the supernatural aspect.  I found the pious denoument nauseating and irritating.
0307276902|5.0|This is what I wrote to a good friend of mine while I was reading \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey: I searched on keyword 'autobiographies', found this one and liked how it was described: a true happened story about a young man who tries to overcome his addiction to drugs and alcohol in a clinic. I'm fascinated by people who have to hit the bottom of life before they are able to start a different, a more human connected life. As I'm writing this I know it sounds very cliche. But are not all great stories about some kind of rebirth? In the nineteenth century eventually most rebirths failed in novels, and ended with suicide. Or perhaps the dead world they ended up in could be regarded as the ultimate liberation. But in modern society we don't/can't accept suicide no longer. Psychotherapy or working on yourself is the key to free your mind. James calls it the \\"Great American Crying\\". I never knew that in the US you first have to confess to Christ before you can kick off from drugs. It doesn't surprise me however. James' conversations with his therapist about which structure to choose, instead of God because he doesn't believe, is interesting. Although the clinic holds on to their own developed 12 steps (religious) program it seems they grant James to do it in his own way. At least I would allow James. I dont know yet how the story continues. It's a fact actually that people who are clean never stay clean when they don't adjust to a new 'religious' system. James just hates it when he is forced to exchange one addiction for another. We'll see. I hope the progress James makes (he starts to believe in peace in himself and friendships) will allow him to finish therapy. I already like James so much I cannot face it to see him go down once more.<br /><br />Meanwhile I finished the book and I learned that not everything is autobiographical but instead fiction. This forced me to think about what this book gave me. Well, I know, it's the way James learns how to deal with what he calls the Fury or the Shrew. This demon of fear and hate that forces him to take drugs and alcohol, to find relief. Whether James invented the Shrew or really experienced this horror doesn't matter to me. It provided me insight into the tormented soul of an addicted and depressed person and what these people are dealing with and eventually have to overcome. Next to this, I also truly loved the way James spoke about his love for Lilly, his co-addict in the clinic. Seldom have I read about a man's love for a woman this sincere and touching and sweet.

B00005JOYO|3.0|I watched the movie yesterday. I wasn't moved very much. This is my second movie review (on amazon). The first one was for the much more powerful \\"United 93.\\" I was going to write a short review yesterday, but I needed some more time to think. Since yesterday I have read many critics' reviews of the film (on the rotten tomatoes website). One of them captured very well how I feel about the movie, by a critic I never heard of before: Eric Snider. I will quote the most important part of his review below, it is exactly how I feel:    (Begin quote from Eric Snider's review):    Yet after a while it dawned on me that this movie has nothing to do with 9/11. The bulk of the story is McLoughlin and Jimeno trapped under tons of debris. They could just as easily be coal miners caught in a cave-in or mountain climbers buried in an avalanche. Their stories have no universal appeal beyond a basic \\"their wives are worried, and golly, I hope they make it out OK.\\"     The problem, then, is that when you purport to tell a 9/11 story but in fact make a film that has little to do with the larger themes and issues of the day -- well, doesn't that cheapen it a bit?     (End quote from Eric Snider's review)    There was no mention of who or what caused the September 11th attacks (radical Islam and its war against civilization) anywhere in the movie. The attacks were treated exactly like accidental plane crashes. It's like a movie about the victims of a serial killer, which avoids showing him, naming him, or making any reference at all to him. That is my beef with the movie.

1558908382|5.0|Like many other reviewers here I never tire of watching this film, although it had to grow on me over the course of several viewings.   <br /> <br />Grosse Pointe Blank works on several levels.  For one, John Cusack appearing in a movie about a high school reunion is a nod to the high school flicks that made him famous as an actor.  There are many sly references to his earlier films here; i.e., with the bike messenger (Better Off Dead) and the pen (Say Anything). In that sense the film serves as a \\"killing off\\" of his image as a teen actor. On another level, the hit man storyline is a great political commentary on the eighties that translates well to the political scene we currently find ourselves in.  All the characters, in fact, are morally compromised by their careers, and in that sense Martin Blank serves as an extreme on a spectrum.  And what really hooked me initially is the straightforward portrayal of career burnout, alienation, and early midlife crisis.

B000BKVQTS|1.0|Brothers Grim is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. They butchered a beloved storybook fantasy to make this drivel, wile watching this bile of a movie I found that my wrist-watch was more interesting and that I didn't even need to see or hear to the move to know what was going to happen next it was that predictable. If that wasn't enough all the acting or over acting was sub-par at best. The actors seemed to be trying to act like other actors while in the movie and doing it badly to boot, so to sum things up this movie is crap don't watch it and count your self lucky that you did not waste your money or time on this desolate film. P.S. If your looking for a good movie then see V for Vendetta it's a great movie, 100 times better than Brothers (CRAP) Grim.
037571457X|5.0|While I was reading this book, I kept flashing back to \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" - a book I only intermittantly liked. Marjane's rebellions and small images of girls forced to wear veils while growing to love Iron Maiden and Michael Jackson were more evocative than hundreds of pages in that book. When she found out what happens to virgins who are found guilty by the Revolution, I burst into tears, even though I knew what their fate was. Just like Maus, the graphic novel format makes it more immediate and more shocking to learn what happened in Iran during the revolution. I look forward to readng Persopolis 2! I highly recommend it.

So much so that I bought \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" sight unseen. <br /> <br />Beckinsale is wonderful, not just another pretty face, she actually has talent.  The rest of the cast is well cast and believable.   <br /> <br />Sticking to the \\"Rules\\" governing Likens and Vampires, \\"Underworld\\" will pull you in for an exciting ride as these two sides race to end war that has been going on for centuries, but to what end? <br /> <br />Definately worth seeing if not owning.
B00005JL96|5.0|I must say I thouroughly enjoyed this film. I know Disney had been treading some troubled waters with their prior releases, with several not doing what they would have hoped at the box office. This picture is a wonderful breath of fresh air. The story is fresh and highly original, and the characters are well-done, especialy Lilo, the lonely girl who adopts Stitch as her pet, not knowing he's an alien experiment gone wrong. Tia Carrera is great as her older, long-suffering sister who's struggling desperately to hold whats left of her family together. The soundtrack is a true gem, with traditional Hawaiian music alongside Elvis Presley classics. A little Hawaiian girl who adores Elvis! Fantastic! Anyway, there is a wonderful moral of family to this film, which gives it heart, something not many films these days have. Moving, funny, and with something the whole family can watch and enjoy, Lilo & Stitch is possibly the best film to come out of Disney for a long time. The DVD transfer is excellent, the colors just are vibrant and glow, like watercolor paintings. The sound is wonderful and clear, and the bonus features are well worth checking out as well, especially the Stitch In Time feature. Priceless! Anyway, get and enjoy this fine film.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is about learning to live.  Donnie Darko is a troubled 15 year old who thinks life is absurd and meaningless because, in the end, everyone dies alone.<br /><br />Set in the Fall of 1988, the movie is about personal transformation and how through your own personal transformation you can change the world.  The 1988 Presidential election serves as a handy backdrop for the despair caused by alienation and apathy.  The country has emerged from 8 years of conservatism under Ronald Reagan and has a choice to make.  This larger sense of place echoes within the community, where conservative values are prominent and people fear change.  The only kind of \\"change\\" people accept comes from the self-help guru who spouts shallow epithets; whereas real works about transformation and change are shunned and called \\"pornographic,\\" such as Graham Greene's short story which says, in part: \\"It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his fifteenth year crystallised  with the pain of puberty.\\"<br /><br />This could not be a better description of the angst of adolescence and of Donnie Darko himself, now in his 15th year, who is searching for the \\"plan\\" he needs to accept the yin and yang of existence:  that destruction and creation work together to create change.<br /><br />Donnie is the only student in the class who understands the Greene story.  When called upon by his teacher he says the story is saying that \\"destruction is a form of creation.  So the fact that they burn the money is..,.ironic.  They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.\\"<br /><br />But how does one find transformation in a world that seems to offer only diminished possibilities?  In a world that believes acquisition leads to happiness?  What Donnie ultimately discovers--which is why he laughs and smiles at the end of the movie--is that meaning is found through your creative engagement with life and through the mark you leave on the world.<br /><br />The song \\"Mad World\\" truly encapsulates the thematic concerns of the movie beautifully.

B000001IPP|5.0|I am a Clash fanatic who was tired of the lack of punk music from the 70's and early 80's. I saw Let's Go bought it and put it in my car CD player. I listened to it every day for a week and absolutely loved it. At first I was skeptical but man is it catchy. Some great songs and lyrics if you can understand them. But hey its not about clear vocals....The bas lines are awesome and almost rocka billy in some places but it all works. Classic tracks include Harry Bridges, Salvation, Radio and Nihilism but in a way all the songs have merit. I am still playing this CD on the way to work and it gets me ready for anything the day can bring on. I am glad that even an old punk rocker like myself can still be revved up by music.  <br />Here is the tip... <br />Buy this CD...give it a few listens and I guarantee you will put it in your top 10 CD's to take to a desert island.  <br />If only there was more music like this.
B00003BDXG|5.0|Oliver Stone's take on violence and television in contemporary America. The visuals are stunning as well as the hyper violence. Downey's character is pretty much Geraldo Rivera and Jerry Springer combined,and is the biggest statement of the film.A big commentary on the glorification of violence and the insane place in American society that we have glorified celebrities of all sorts.An art film all the way. If you can handle the gore and violence,this is one of the best movies ever made and is the film that put Oliver Stone in the same league as Francis Ford Coppola,Martin Scorsese et al.....Definately one for the library. <br />
0679746048|5.0|This title is one of my favorite books. I read it in one afternoon. It is broken up into relatively short chapters which are all related. At the same time, many of the chapters are self sufficient  and hae almost a short story feel to them.  This work is an autobiographical account of Kaysen's youthful \\"breakdown,\\" and subsequent involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital in MA.   More specifically, Kaysen's diagnosis was Borderline Personality Disorder.  However, this title gives the reader a feel for mental illness in general as it explores the situations of several of her fellow patients.  I think Kaysen tells this story in a unique way which  is much different than many of the typical mental illness memoires out there.  Kaysen tells a story more than she details the innerworkings of her mind and neuroses.  In that way, she leaves some mystery to her character.  I felt that this work was not so much about Borderline Personality Disorder, or even mental illness, but it was about Kaysen adjusting to a new environment and new people. It is more about Kaysen's happenings and encounters than it is about her every thought, feeling, and impulse. Also, I work in a psych hospital and think it's important that the reader keeps in mind that this story is set in the 1960s, as institutions are quite different from what is described in here.  Unfortunately, the movie is a huge letdown and does not do the novel justice.

B00004SVIK|4.0|In general, studio albums sound better than live concert albums, and this is no exception. There are many reviews here that say this live version is better than the studio version of \\"The Wall.\\"  While this sounds excellent, and it is natural to be very enthusiastic about a live performance as great as this one, I strongly disagree that it makes for better listening than than the studio album.  I would rather listen to \\"The Wall\\" anyday!  However, this is a superb live concert recording and it is well worth having because the concert event for The Wall is legendary in rock annals, and, after all, this is Pink Floyd - and they sound great! It's very good to hear Roger Waters giving it his all, and David Gilmour's guitar solos on \\"Mother\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" are the very stuff that rock guitar legends are made of.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Having recently read Bob Spitz's massive but delightful book \\"The Beatles: The Biography\\", I wanted to check out the Beatles Anthology again, not having watched it in many years.<br /><br />\\"The Beatles Anthology\\" (5 DVDs; approx. 645 min.) does an absolutely superb job in bringing the visual history of the Beatles to the screen. Here some of my personal highlights of this set: (1) the Swedish TV appearance from late '63, where the band gets asked to do an impromptu additional song, and Paul tears into a rousing \\"Have Some Fun Tonight\\"; (2) the madness that was Beatlemania in mid-1964, such as the visit to Amsterdam and the premiere of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" movie in London; (3) the Shea Stadium concert in August 65, with a cleaver pre-concert montage (I also had forgotten this was the first stadium show in rock history); (4) the first intentional video in 1966 for \\"Paperback Writer\\"; (5) the montage for \\"A Day in the Life\\"; (6) the utter boredom of the guys, but in particular George, in the video for \\"Hello Goodbye\\"; and (7) the whole commotion around the opening of the Apple store in December, 1967 (capping off an unbelievable 6 months, started with the \\"Pepper\\" album release).<br /><br />The \\"Special Features\\" DVD is actually quite good. The best bits are of course George, Paul and Ringo reminiscing and playing/strumming some songs (such as a great \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\") in various sessions in 94 and 95 (George's story of his second--and last--meeting with Elvis in the early seventies is hilarious). The guys also spend time in the studio with producer George Martin going through various takes of some songs; the disection of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" will be fascinating for true Beatles fans.<br /><br />In all, this is a massive DVD set, but enjoyable from beginning to end, and that's an understatement. As the years go by, this now also becomes a nice time piece for historians looking back at the 1960s culture and society. Essential and highly recommended!highly recommended!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|The biggest puppet movie ever made,and probably the funniest that ever will be made. Pokes fun at American politics,fundamentalist islama-fascism,and Hollywood celebrity culture.Really wish this movie could be viewed by all the Ayatollahs,mullahs,sheiks,and all fundamentalist Muslim clerics.Throw in Kim Jong Il,Alec Baldwin,Tim Robbins,and Susan Sarandon as well as Maaatt Daaaaamon. The puppet love scene is too funny,although the end of that sequence goes a little to the sick side,unless you're R. Kelly. Definately not for kids.If you are a fan of SouthPark,this film is for you.Will watch this again and again..Parker and Stone at their best....
B000003CMB|5.0|I've been listening to this record probably weekly for over 30 years, and never tire of it. Primary reason: Duane's slide guitar playing. He has somehow turned his instrument into a device that I find to be the most expressive musical vehicle I've ever heard. It rivals the human voice. He's making that guitar SING. Tony Bennett(who I don't even like that much)has said that musicians envy singers because there are limits to what they can express with an instrument.  Take 4 minutes and listen to the slide playing in Statesboro Blues. It's the most joyful,wondrous, humorous thing you'll ever hear. Jeff Beck eat your heart out. <br /> <br />Gregg's voice is wonderful throughout, tho now it seems more of a technical rather than emotional achievement. Still, whateya want from a young white guy. A very minor quibble. <br /> <br />One of my favorite parts is the drive and atmosphere they achieve leading to the end of Elizabeth Reed. The anticipation during those two short drum solos roaring toward the close is jaw-dropping. The energy of the crowd waiting to explode is a palpable breathing thing.  <br /> <br />Get this recording. You'll find yourself coming back to it over and over.

B000002U9W|5.0|One thing about Pink Floyd that is obviously true that I never really hear people talk about is how incredibly funny they are.  This band has got to be about the funniest, most comically gifted band I have ever heard.  They are like the Monty Python of rock music.  True, their albums can be very serious at times, like The Wall - but even The Wall has a few really funny moments... like Gomer Pyle - \\"surprise, surprise, surprise\\" - Dark Side of the Moon \\"I've been mad for f*cking years\\" is hilarious...  but anyway if you look at their entire body of work (with Roger Waters) their sense of humor is obvious.  This album is absolutely hilarious, in addition to being musically brilliant.  What's funny about it?  Well - the title track is a complete joke, I mean look at the names of the individual musical movements - Breast Milky?  Funky Dung?  And what's up with that chainsaw (or is it a motorcycle?) at the beginning of the piece?  And nonsense comments like \\"This is a loud announcement\\" and \\"Silence in the Studio!\\"  It's totally absurd, and very funny. The 3 more accessible songs in the middle by Waters (If), Wright (Summer 68), and Gilmour (Fat Old Sun) have a few moments that are funny, at least in a British way - \\"If I were a good man I'd talk with you more often than I do\\" is a humorous line in this Waters confessional about being somewhat insane;  \\"Summer 68\\" is a great song about some rock and roller (perhaps Wright himself) who sleeps with a groupie he met the night before (\\"we met just 6 hours ago, the music was too loud\\" is a rather funny line) and in the morning can't even remember her name while he tries to think of a way to get away from her; Fat Old Sun is a lovely, ambiguous song by Gilmour (not as much to laugh at here); and Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast (funny title) is a 3 part musical enigma accompanied by kitchen sounds and a man (a Pink Floyd roadie named Alan) making and eating breakfast in the morning while he mumbles incoherently about things like \\"lots of marmalade\\" and being \\"ready for the gig.\\"  These guys were hilarious.  If this album isn't enough to convince you, then you probably do not understand English humor.  By the way... just because it's really funny doesn't make it any less brilliant (quite the opposite) - this delightful album is yet another great work of art by the most innovative rock band of all time.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|To think a story like Pride and Prejudice can be improved on, that one can write its dialogue better than Jane Austen, and that a story such as this needs help before it can become accessible is a case of hubris.  The appeal of Pride and Prejudice is universal and its characters are timeless.  The creators of this movie, however, took major liberties in their translation of this classic onto the big screen. <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this movie, and I anxiously awaited for its release, but it fell completely short of my expectations.  Most of its characters were poorly cast, and the scriptwriters blundered many parts of the plot, re-writing it into nonsense that wouldn't have fit the sentiments and protocols of the era. <br /> <br />Mr. Bingley was portrayed like a goofy boy rather than a respectable, good natured gentleman; Caroline Bingley looked more like a runway model on a perpetual high as opposed to a keen, manipulative social climber; Georgiana Darcy was bubbly and extrovert instead of being painfully shy; Mr. Collins was wooden and dull as opposed to being an obsequiously wily toadie (he was funny, though, I'll give him that); Darcy was portrayed as utterly misunderstood without pride, when we know that Darcy was definitely proud; and, though Keira Knightley is definitely spirited, she played Lizzie with liveliness and fire, but without the undeniable charm that tempered her faults and compelled us to forgive her trespasses.  Knightley's performance is also a little too forward and she is unable to subdue herself when necessary--basically, it's too modern a portrayal. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have already poured over the script blunders, and I agree with most of them, but the ones that really stood out to me were: <br /> <br />- Georgiana's wild hair, which was loose and looked absolutely unbrushed, along with her being portrayed as an extrovert.  <br /> <br />- Lady Catherine's late-night visit, with the entire Bennett clan standing around in their nightwear. <br /> <br />- The rainstorm scene where Darcy proposes in clothes that are utterly drenched. <br /> <br />- The inconsistencies with the costumes, particularly Lady Catherine's throwbacks and Caroline Bingley's modern, sleeveless numbers. <br /> <br />- The inconsistencies with Longbourn.  It was rustic, dingy, and dirty--no doubt to make the Bennett's surroundings look more 'raw'--but they had servants at the ready in nearly every Longbourn scene. <br /> <br />This isn't Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice; it's entirely someone else's vision of Pride and Prejudice.  Often times, I would wonder if the creators of the movie and I had even read the same book.  The scriptwriters thought that they had to help the story, that the story the way it is wouldn't work with audiences.  In the end, what was preserved of the original story was the only saving grace, with all the changes made with the plot done in poor taste. <br /> <br />I understand that films and books are two entirely different creatures, and that there would be tremendous challenges for any movie seeking to portray a book's worth of material into a 2-hour film.  That, however, still does not excuse the dumbing down of the plot and dialogue.  One reviewer said that the film was too \\"obvious,\\" and I'm apt to agree.  Even my husband says that the movie was \\"P&P for Dummies.\\"  The movie was more of a typical romance novel featuring P&P characters rather than a movie version of our beloved novel. <br /> <br />In the end, the A&E version is still vastly superior.
0142000663|5.0|A towering masterpiece. Realistic and poetic at the same time, angry and compassionate, and still amazingly relevant after two-thirds of a century. This brings the Depression more real than anything I have read, and yet it is far from being a depressing book. One of Steinbeck's themes is how when people are cast out and cast down, their basic humanity draws them together into a big family governed by the laws of simple goodness and compassion. Perhaps this is a sentimental view, but it is attained one agonizing step at a time. Against this he sets the impersonal forces of big business, a pitiless economy, besieged communities hiding behind a corrupt police force, and the indifferent hand of nature, portrayed in short interleaved chapters that can be lyrical or bitter, passionate or cynically understated.<br /><br />These short anonymous sections are absolutely necessary to the scale of the book, but some of them have a set-piece quality that at times seems somewhat dated. Not so Steinbeck's treatment of the main narrative, especially his portrayal of individuals: Tom Joad, prison-hardened and wiser than his years, Casy the preacher who loses his faith to arrive at stronger truths, and Ma Joad who holds the family together. These are people totally of their time and place, and yet timeless, a testament to the almost unquenchable power of the human spirit. And nothing is more moving than the way the novel ends: with a simple act of kindness by one broken human being to another, that in Steinbeck's hands becomes a sacrament of grace, bringing tears to the eyes and hope to the soul.<br /><br />[PS. I first tried to read THE GRAPES OF WRATH four decades ago, in England in my mid-twenties, but gave up. I found it impossible to follow the dialect, I utterly lacked the knowledge of American history in the Depression era, and I dare say I lacked the life experience to appreciate the book's moral strength. For the second and third of these reasons, at least, I thus find it strange that the novel is so often assigned at the high-school level. After living in the USA now for 35 years, it means so much more to me. This is not because of history or language, but because the issues which made the book relevant in 1939 are still present in American life today, in its politics, its corporate culture, some aspects of its religion... but also in the enduring human spirit which Steinbeck so powerfully celebrates.]novel is so often assigned at the high-school level.

B0000025DD|5.0|This album is surprisingly good.  I mean it shouldn't be all that surprising - as Roger Waters once cleverly punned, David Gilmour is a \\"musician of note,\\" but what I mean is this album is excellent.  Every song is great - this is an enjoyable listen from start to finish.  There are a few surprising moments that are truly great.  Though there are a few similarities to the overall approach that Pink Floyd took musically, I would not bother to compare this to a Pink Floyd album.  There is no concept being explored here that unifies the album in the style of Pink Floyd.  It does not in any way, shape, or form resemble a soundtrack to a science fiction movie.  It is not a psychedelic album, but you can tell from listening that David has had plenty of psychedelic experiences and knows what that's all about.  This is an intelligent album that rocks out very tastefully.  This is David taking a much-needed break from Pink Floyd, though he is turning out music here that contains a few Floyd trademarks - soulful female backup singers and organ, as well as solid bass lines... and of course the unique sound of Gilmour's voice and guitar.  David's songwriting on this album is really quite good.  \\"There's No Way Out of Here,\\" \\"No Way,\\" and \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" are my favorites, but really every song on this record is great.  If you like David Gilmour's work with Pink Floyd, and you have never heard this album - trust me, buy it.  It really is worth it.  You will not be disappointed.
0802130208|4.0|Anyone who has read A Confederacy of Dunces will tell you that the main character, one Mr. Ignatius J. Reilly, is difficult to love. He's barely likeable on many scales - I found myself completely disgusted and appalled by him most of the time. His grotesque personal hygiene practices, his arrogance and his assumptions of superiority over absolutely everyone he meets are all revolting. I admit I didn't start to lighten my disgust for Ignatius until the last 100 pages (maybe because I simply got used to all of the belching and discussions about his `valve'... but the rubber glove discussed at length at the end of the book did bring back my yelps of disgust as I read), but I still loved the book and found myself thinking about it several times a day.  <br /> <br />A Confederacy of Dunces is a sort of parable, where the wackiest of characters each has a specific part to play in their own story and the overall book. John Kennedy Toole ties them all together in the silliest but most skillful way. Some notable characters are his \\"poor, poor\\" momma, who has to support and put up with Ignatius, but then berates him and continuously complains and nags at him. (Which one do you feel more sorry for?) Patrolman Mancuso is just another cop on the beat, or so you think, until you find out he is the laughing stock of the whole precinct. The Department forces him to dress up in lewd costumes \\"to go undercover\\", but they only do it so they can laugh at him. My favorite, though, is (Burma) Jones, a black out-of-work \\"vagrant\\" who is trying to start his own kind of revolution and who adds spice and comedy to every conversation he's in (\\"Whoa!) <br /> <br />I think the key to enjoying this book is: as readers we must keep in mind what this book is - a remarkable and ambitious work of classical-style fiction, not a snapshot of real life. It sounds simple, but many readers do it - we attempt to identify with the characters of the book. And if they are likeable or if they have traits of friends or family, the characters almost feel like \\"friends\\" to us by the end of the book. This is a story where most readers cannot possibly do this because the characters are so unrealistic. But this does not detract from the book in any way - it teaches us to like the story for other reasons than the obvious, and isn't this a good lesson for all of life? Not all things that are good are so simple to see right away - sometimes we have to look a little harder. <br /> <br />John Kenney Toole created a masterpiece in A Confederacy of Dunces, but it may only be realized by true lovers of reading, and this is why I gave it only four stars. If you love literature or reading or writing, you will love this book. It is by the amount of emotional response that this story elicits that we can judge this book, not by whether we `like' the main character. Whether you hate or love or feel sorry for Ignatius, you will be impressed by John Kennedy Toole's writing and his story development. I definitely recommend it. <br />
B000FS9FCG|2.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first \\"Matrix\\" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of \\"V\\" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in \\"The Professional\\" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.<br /><br />The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name \\"V.\\"  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this \\"terrorist\\" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.<br /><br />The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of \\"tolerance.\\"  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.<br /><br />The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.<br /><br />I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.<br /><br />If you loved the \\"Matrix\\" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.<br /><br />Recommended as a rental only.Gore.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|Have you ever gotten lost in a good novel? And when you were done, you felt like you had just returned from a fascinating world? That's how I felt after watching The Constant Gardener. It's an excellent story of a British diplomat whose wife was killed in an accident. But the diplomat (who happens to love gardening and is played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes) discovers that her death was no accident, that she was in a fact a target of the drug companies that she was speaking out againston account of their desire to test unproven drugs on the African people.    This is definitely an anti-drug company movie. This movieis a slam on the drug companies in the same way the Davinci Code was a slam to the Catholic church, it makes the powers that be look like greedy, power hungry hypocrites.    But I love a good story line, and since I haven't always been happy with the way drug companies do business, I didn't mind.    Another reason why I thought this movie was the best movie of 2005 (in addition to the awesome storyline and the great acting by Fiennes and Rachel Weisz) is because of the tremendously beautiful camera shots of Africa, and the achingly beautiful soundtrack. Two thumbs WAY up!!!

B000BTC5LW|3.0|Someone else in their review correctly opines:  DSOT is a far better production than Pulse.  I just finished watching all of my late 1980s VHS of DSOT (after not having watched it for years), shortly after watching Pulse on DVD; I was blown away at how great DSOT is and the 1987-88 tour that it documented.  First and foremost, DSOT is shot on film, not video (like Pulse was).  Even David Gilmour has admitted that in hindsight Pulse should have been shot on film.  Second, the sound quality on DSOT is better (even without the digital enhancement).  Third, Pulse has too many wide angle shots of the stage; not that many close ups like DSOT.  Last, if you have a copy of DSOT on VHS, go back and watch the \\"Great Gig in the Sky.\\"  Unbelievable.
B00005QVHA|5.0|Another reviewer on Amazon, discussing a different album, stated that the album he was reviewing would be the one he would use to introduce an alien to Rock & Roll music for the first time. That is an interesting question, and to my own surprise, one I immediately had my own answer to.  <br /> <br />Iggy & the Stooges' 'Raw Power' is not my all-time favorite album. However, I do believe that it is the very essence of everything that makes me love rock music. The bad attitude, the feeling that it will all explode into a violent mess at any second, the distorted, kick-to-the crotch mix, and the menacing lyrics all say, \\"this is rock.\\"   <br /> <br />I would not end an introduction to rock music with Raw Power, but I think the argument can be made that this is one of the best places to start.  <br /> <br />Come to think of it, maybe Raw Power is my all-time favorite album...
0743455967|4.0|This is a good book for an aspiring writer to read. King offers some insight into the process of creating a fiction story. I felt the strength of this book is the underlying perseverance King has demonstrated throughout his career and in life. He honestly writes about the numerous rejections he got prior to his first publication but he has also overcome other obstacles life has thrown at him like drug addiction and the long road back from a debilitating car accident. He has persevered not only in the literary world but in life itself.  <br />To me it was also interesting to learn how much of a reader he is and how the whole craft really begins with an individual's passion for reading. He includes a list of some of his favorite books. I found the list to be quite interesting as well.  As far as instructions on how to write I found the book, <br />Lessons from a Lifetime of Writing, by David Morrell to be more informative.  Both books make for some intersting reading. <br />  <br />
B000E0WJIC|5.0|Go buy it yourself and see what all the hype is about. These guys are the real deal. And while it might not be groundbreaking, it is metalcore executed perfectly.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|7-Year-Old's Review:  I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but the form won't let me.  It's a really great movie, except there's one scary part where the Trunchbull chases people.  I like the movie a lot, because I read the book and you kind of know what's going to happen.  It's really funny. <br /> <br />Mom's review:  The movie follows the book fairly closely.  My daughter watched it three times in two days.  The extras on the DVD are entertaining and even educational.  Danny DeVito and his wife actively encourage kids to read and spoke of reading daily with their own children.  They included an extra on a real library and focused on how reading the book to their own children inspired them to make the movie.
B000002WU9|5.0|Trufully every reviewer is correct about the album so there isn't really much to say. Raekwon's debut \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" remains a classic to this day. Back in '95 when Wu-Tang was still rising to the top of their game, Raekwon with the help of Ghostface Killah drops this classic. Lyrically both Raekwon and Ghostface spit each verse like it was their last one, going hard on tracks like \\"Criminology\\" and \\"Can It All Be So Simple 2\\". Alot of the rhyme subject in this album are something you can imagine in a movie (such as \\"Scarface\\") as they rhyme about drugs and money.<br /><br />Guest appearances are also great too. Capadonna makes his debut on the song \\"Glaciers Of Ice\\" and the hit song \\"Ice Cream\\". My favorite is the Wu posse cut \\"Wu Gambinos\\" with RZA, Method Man, and Masta Killa. While Inspetah Deck and The Genius would join on one of my favorite Wu Tang tracks \\"Guillotine (Swords)\\". Nas would take part in the album also in the song \\"Verbal Intercourse\\". Production is razor sharp curteosy of RZA with the help of the 4th Deciple.<br /><br />Overall great classic teamwork by Rae and Ghostface. If you don't own this album, I recommend that you purchase it as soon as you can. There would be more Ghostface and Rae colabs in later Wu albums (Ironman, Bulletproof Wallets, etc) but will not have the same momentum as this album here. Supposedly Raekwon is working on a \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx 2\\" but I haven't heard much about that project for a while. If you're a Wu fan, this is a must have.<br /><br />My Favorite Tracks: Criminology, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Guillotine (Swords), Can It All Be So Simple 2, Glaciers Of Ice, Verbal Intercorse, Ice Cream, Wu Gambinos, Heaven & Hell, North Star
B0002858YS|5.0|When I first heard Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told me on the radio, I fell in love with The Killers.  It was hard not to like their distinct style and impressive sound.  When I bought the CD on impulse, I was in for a pleasant surprise! <br /> <br />Jenny Was a Friend Of Mine: 10/5.  Not kidding.  I've yet to hear a song that blows me away like this one does.  Easily the best song on this album in my opinion. <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside: 5/5.  You've just gotta love this one; trust me. <br /> <br />Smile Like You Mean It: 3/5.  Never made a big impression on me.  It's a bit dull compared to some of their others. <br /> <br />Somebody Told Me: 5/5.  This song got me into The Killers! <br /> <br />All These Things That I've Done: 5/5.  Now this one is interesting.  It has a unique style that differentiates from the rest of the album.  I adore it! <br /> <br />Andy, You're a Star: 5/5.  Though the lyrics appear confusing, who cares?  I'm in love with this song! <br /> <br />On Top: 5/5.  I love the bouncy/uplifting feel to this one. <br /> <br />Change Your Mind: 4/5.  Not bad, but it's never made an impression on me. <br /> <br />Believe Me, Natalie: 2/5.  From the first time I heard this song, there was something about it that made me skip it.  Not their best. <br /> <br />Midnight Show: 5/5.  This one gives me a similar feel as Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.  My second favorite. <br /> <br />Everything Will Be Alright: 5/5.  An excellent way to unwind after all of those energetic songs.  Yet somehow, they manage to keep their same distinct style. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this album to, well, anyone!  Really, you don't have to be into this type of music.  This is the album that converted a Top 40 girl into an indie rock addict.  I think that listening to this is worth a shot; I doubt that you'll regret it!
0380807343|5.0|I purchased this novel to read to my nephew, and soon fell in love with it as well !
0141301066|5.0|This book has been one of my daughter's favorites for a year.  We first got it from the library when she was 6. She loved it so much she wanted her own copy and got one for her birthday. Now she reads it to me!  My daughter loves the smart, polite, yet mischievous Matilda.  She laughs out loud at the funny passages in the story. <br /> <br />Be prepared; this is a typical Roald Dahl book, and the humor is a little quirky.  Matilda is the exceptionally gifted daughter of parents who think she is a \\"twit\\" and a \\"scab.\\"  They either ignore her or verbally abuse her.  Matilda gets back at them by playing tricks to \\"punish\\" them.  My daughter says that I should warn you that your child might learn some tricks from this book.  These punishments are things that you would not want your child trying at home!   <br /> <br />Matilda finds a heroine in her teacher at school, though Matilda becomes a heroine to her teacher, rescuing her from her own problems.  We won't give away any more of the story, but good triumphs over evil in the end.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|The film in itself was fairly good, but covering far to much action and information in such a short (2 hours 57 minutes) time. Something like the extended version of LOTR (all three movies)would  better justify Frank Herberts work. They stayed true to most of the scenes, but so much was skipped.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere is one of Gaiman's best yet!  I highly recommend this novel!
B000ESST6U|5.0|Having been to the production at Glyndebourne in 2005, and the revival this year I am pleased to say this is a terrific and true reproduction. Sound is wonderful in both stereo and DTS, with very effective sound staging and balance between singers and orchestra. Visually it's wonderful too, though some of the closer shots are a bit shocking if you are used to viewing from afar; it would be good if OPUS could use the DVD features that enable the viewer to choose their own preferred camera angle.  As for the Opera production and cast, then as near to perfect as I've ever experienced anywhere (including the Met, Covent Garden, Glyndebourne or Sydney) of Handel or indeed anything sub-Wagnerian. The Age of Enlightenment create a beautiful complement to first rate singing (none were bettered by this years cast - Daniels included) and the McVicar production a brilliant bridge of entertainment and emotion. Laughed and cried at almost every scene.
B000000W5N|5.0|STICKY FINGERS IS ONE OF THE BEST STONES ALBUM OF ALL TIMES.IT CONTAINS THE GREATEST ROCK SONG BROWN SUGAR WHICH IS AS GREAT AS SKYNYRD'S FREE BIRD,BOSTON'S MORE THAN A FEELING,QUEEN'S WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS AND PINK FLOYD'S ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL.THIS ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OVERRATED DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER ALBUM.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM OVERRATED BANDS LIKE DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER.    PS:HEAVY FUEL SUCKS,WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU SUCKS.
038572179X|4.0|\\"Atonement\\" is an excellent read.  I don't read much fiction but my neighborhood book club encouraged me to try this one. I am glad I did. The character development was penetrating.
6305907145|5.0|This movie is not as faithful to the book as some would like, but it is a wonderful film and story in its own right.  Mansfield Park is very moving and exciting.  The acting and directing is wonderful and I was facinated by the connections between British society and the profits of slavery and sugar cane holding it up in its colonies.  Fanny Brice is a very wonderful character and I loved seeing many popular British actors in this movie.  Lindsay Duncan plays a dual role and James Purefoy from Rome are in this movie.
B00005JP5J|5.0|What a great movie! The theater was packed with people to see this, and everyone, everyone was just howling.  Tears were abundant from laughing so much.  First time I've been to a movie where everyone clapped loud and long afterwards.  Next day, and I'm still laughing, wishing I could tell others about it...but don't want to spoil it for them.  A HAVE to see movie...just good clean fun (and do you see parts of your own ring of relatives here?)
B00008BXJG|5.0|HIGHWAY TO HELL IS A TERRIFIC ALBUM.NO AMOUNT OF STARS IS ENOUGH TO GIVE THIS ALBUM WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME.EACH SONG IS FANTASTIC AND THIS IS ONE ALBUM WHICH WOULD BE THEIRE IN EVERY ROCK FANS COLLECTION.VERY VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  PS:PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS ONE STAR REVIEWER JUKE BOX HERO A.K.A WHIRLIGIG AND AVOID THE LOUSY FOREIGNER 4 ALBUM AT ALL COSTS.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you love Pink Floyd, you MUST purchase this DVD.  They are my favorite group.  I have all their albums or CD's. I have seen them in concert during the Division Bell Tour.  My husband and I listened to the Pulse CD traveling all over the country in our RV. Seeing beautiful scenery with their music in the background was an unforgettable experience. <br /> <br />Watching this DVD was so addicting, I didn't even want to budge from my seat. The music was incredible, the special effects were the best I have ever seen in any rock concert. <br /> <br />If you love this group, you will order this DVD for every member of your family that feels the same way.  My son in college got a copy, too, and he went crazy. It was a great evening for our family!
0930289234|5.0|I have read this story several times and it keeps getting better with every read. It never lets you want to leave the story with it's gripping plots and beautiful imagery. There is no wonder why it still to this day is one of the best comic book stories ever written...
0792164903|4.0|Excellent Johnny Depp movie. Johnny Depp delivers yet another off-beat performance as an over-eager young detective set in the early 20th century up-state New York. I am giving 4 stars only because I have already seen the movie when it was first released.
078322933X|4.0|ALyssa Milano is HOT , HOT , HOT. I like this movie, it is like a reverse teen version of Fatal Attraction. Made after The Crush and before SwimFan, fell right in between and much better film than both, much more suspenseful and better actors at that.
B000850IHW|5.0|from 1972's octopus through 1976's interview, gentle giant was arguably the best band in the world. yes and the gabriel-fronted genesis can make claim to that title as well. no one else comes close. free hand is perhaps the best way to commence your quest into GG's unique world. the hooks are strong, the musicianship first-rate, the production crisp. this, gentle giant's seventh album, ranks as one of the better records ever recorded.
B00005JOML|2.0|I am a huge fan of Mann,s work but in my opinion this one is his worst.Great locations,stylishly photographed,fine music but there is no story to follow here.It is overlong by the way.Watch the series instead.There is no way to care about the characters.OK performances(I mean just suitable).There is a rumor that the director will re edit this mega disapponting experience so I think we shall wait for the reduxed movie maybe it will be better SOMEDAY SOMEHOW.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Again Aaron Spelling put another show on the map.  The frenzy this show created was amazing.  At my school we all took turns in hosting a 90210 evening where we'd all sit around watching this and eating pizza.  I loved this show. <br />In the pilot, we meet Brandon and Brenda who move to 90210 from Minessota.  They try to fit in with all the kids who have money.  It's not always easy.  There are 21 episodes in this first season, and they are all adictive.  It's going to be funny to watch all the fashions and hairstyles they all went through over the time.  The one unrealistic thing they did with this show is put older 'kids' staring as high school kids but we somehow looked over that to just enjoy the fun and drama that came along each week. <br />I'm really looking forward to watching this fantastic series again and I can't wait till it's release.
B000FDEU12|4.0|I'm writing this review because I feel that S. Crabb's opinion is unjustified.  Avishai Cohen is a great composer who tends to use vamps and grooves more often than the typical acoustic jazz musician but certainly not as often as Crabb conveyed in his review.  The album hardly feels monotonous or repetitive. <br /> <br />His compositions have a poetic simplicity and creative elegance that is lacking in a lot of modern jazz music.  As a bass player, Cohen makes no effort to overshadow the other members of his trio.  Oudist Amos Hoffman makes several appearances on the album, adding to Cohen's trademark Middle Eastern sound. <br /> <br />This is certainly not Cohen's best work.  Give that prize to his second solo album \\"Colors.\\"  It is quite clear that a larger ensemble serves as a better vehicle for his work.  Continuo is a fine album worth the $11 though.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|I just watched this movie last night and was expecting a \\"I see dead people\\" film-thought it was going to be more of a supernatural flick. Even with my expectations, I was not disappointed in how it turned out.  <br /> After trying to make sense of the film all the way through,In the last miunutes of the film it hit me, \\"Ambrose Bierce's short story \\"An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge!!\\". I noticed another reviewer here also mentioned this. <br />If I hadn't read that story, the movie would still have me wondering what it was all about, so for sure read it if this movie leaves you confused!! <br />Overall, it was a refreshing change from many of the typical and predictable movies you see now days.
B000GI3KHQ|1.0|Don't get me wrong the movie itself is great .I have a 1985  Key Video VHS copy of the movie that I wanted to update with a DVD.The DVD says digitally mastered ,I guess that means it looks worse than a 21 year old used rental VHS tape .I don't see how they can charge $26 for this junk .I am going to try and get my money back.

B0000DIXDR|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful, BEAUTIFUL movie. This is the ultimate love story in a more innocent time.  This movie captures the innocence of that first love, and how real everything is.  I've watch this movie probally close to fifty times, and it NEVER gets old. Of course I am the hopeless romantic, but even people who are not into romance movies would enjoy this timeless film. This would have to be one of (if not) my favorite movies of all times.  \\"I've Had the Time of My Life\\" makes you want to be in love for the first time all over again.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Tim Burton did an excellent job remaking \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\\" The film stays pretty close to Roald Dahl's book and the original movie adaptation, although there's this weird thing at the end regarding Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) father and the whole issue of family. Overall, though, I was impressed with this movie. The special effects are excellent, and the children are all hilarious and perfectly cast. (I especially loved watching Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket...that kid is so adorable!) The Oompa-Loompas are spectacular...they were all digitally multiplied and portrayed by the same actor, Deep Roy, who is very funny.<br /><br />Some people have criticized Depp's performance as Wonka, but I think it was brilliant. He really made the role his own by building upon the quirkiness of the character, which resulted in a fresh interpretation of the role that is drastically different from Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka, but not at all bad. I also loved the way that Willy Wonka's skin was the same grayish color of a human cadaver...that's Tim Burton for you! It really added to the overall creepiness of the movie.<br /><br />This is a very good film and is one of the best remakes to come out of Hollywood in some time.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|tengo años esperando que por fin saliera en formato DVD, porfin pero valio la pena esperar, supero mis espectativas con respecto a la resolucion de la imagen y sonido, no hace falta que te guste la musica para que te quedes pegado al televisor disfrutando de este espectacular concierto.

B000H7JCG4|5.0|Hooray for common sense. Roll on November, can't wait!!! All those dodgy ebay sellers will shaking in their boots, no longer making copious amounts of money selling cheap, TV recorded episodes. Well done in making this series available. I'm oh so excited, yay!!!!!
B0007GAERG|1.0|I like Mariah's attitude and persona and some of her songs are awesome but this CD was plain awful.  Her voice these days is way too breathy and weak.  Mariah used to have a moderately powerful Coloratura voice.  Now her voice is considerably weaker and the songs she sings are sappy and boring. <br /> <br />I personally think that Patti Labelle has a far superior coloratura voice even in her old age.  Try listening to her instead.   <br />
B00005J6UP|5.0|I grew up with this movie, so Im a little bit biased.  However, I have not met too many people who did'nt enjoy it.  Its just a good time, feel good movie.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I was hooked on this movie from the first scene. All the actor's played their characters to perfection. Although Clive Owen's character was greatly flawed (as were all the characters), I was immediately drawn to him. He made this movie for me. It's a sad movie full of emotion and heart break, but it's great, and I loved every moment of it.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This movie was outstanding. It takes place a little after Final Fantasy 7, where the game ends. I'm glad this movie came out because it was meant to put a conclusion to the game. If you've played and beat the game it leaves some stuff in question. After I beat it I wanted to know more about what happend to the characters, well this answers that. <br /> <br />We here in the beginning of the movie a battle going on in crater between the Turks, and 3 unknown young men. Next we see Cloud driving a motor bike, he's now a deliverer. The same unknown 3 reveal themselves and attack Cloud on the way. Cloud meets up with a few of the Turks and someone who I won't mention that was from the FF7 game. Clould learns a little about the 3 from them, the main leader of the 3 is called Kadaj. Cloud is asked to help stop them for everyones sake.  <br /> <br />Later we learn that their true intention, is to find the one they call Mother, quite a lot through the whole movie. The one who they call Mother. The first former comrade and child hood friend Tifa is the first one Cloud meets again. Tifa too has some trouble with Kadaj's group. There are other appearences by Cloud's former party members helping out.  <br /> <br />Cloud not only contends with Kadaj but also his own guilt still about what happend to Aeris in the game. So he has his own inner battle going on at the same time. The movie makes the main character Cloud even more interesting in this way. The story may seem somewhat short, but the game was close to 70 hours, with many mini-quests along the way, not just battling Sephiroth, but many monsters, and Shinra's Empire. This of course will seem like a much story. <br /> <br />The grahpics of the movie are superb. They look like the game characters, the design of them has been redone though, they are more real types. Not as anime looking as the game characters looked. The environments of the city, to the rain effects really set the mood. A fantastic battle scene towards the endwith a well known FF monster was terrific, and my favorite battle. There will be lots of battles in this movie. Some people felt they had to many battles, I felt it was just right.  <br /> <br />There were enough story points in the movie to tell everything they had to. Also I'll mention again this is only a 2 hour movie here. They had a lot of time to put out focus on all the characters, including a lot on Shinra. Not much of Shinra as an evil force here, lot's more on Kadaj and company. And there was alot of action in the game too remember. <br /> <br />I've watched the Japanese and the Dubbed. I like them both, from what some people were saying I was expecting the worst from the dubbed. The voices fit well, I did not feel the need to have to switch to Japanese again, since I saw that first already.  <br /> <br />That's about it. So remember this is meant as a conclusion to the events of FF7 mainly, with a new side story mixed in. This movie was a wonderful experience to watch. FF AC made up for the movie Final Fantasy Spirits Within, yes, I did not like that movie. This is much more entertaining in every way, and is actually based on one of the games. <br />
0156027321|5.0|this book captures you and doesn't let go. Martel switches back and forth between a first perspective of Pi, the main character, during his adventures while also providing the perspective that Martel has when he meets Pi in the present day. The first half of the book is mostly set up without any of the dramatic events however it is as interesting as the adventures that follow. Make sure you read the author's preface and don't think the story is over before the last page!

B000GFLKF8|4.0|Dalton Russell tells views in the beginning that he's going to reveal everything once only, and that the viewer had better keep up.  He and his gang of thieves infiltrate a large metropolitan bank and get caught inside.  Detective Frazier, who is struggling with an Internal Affairs problem of his own, as well as a girlfriend who's ready to tie the knot, gets called in to handle the negotiations.  Only the bank robbers aren't in any hurry to negotiate.  As the hours spin out, with SWAT teams ready to invade and a rich man growing more desperate by the minute, the plot twists and twists again as all of the characters play out their own agendas.  Frazier knows early on that this isn't a typical -- and may not be at all -- robbery.<br /><br />Spike Lee directed the movie.  He and Denzel Washington (Detective Frazier) have paired on MALCOLM X.  The director has had a string of movies, choosing material that he wanted to work with.  Denzel has been in MAN ON FIRE, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, OUT OF TIME, RICOCHET, JOHN Q, TRAINING DAY, THE BONE COLLECTOR, THE SIEGE, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, and CRIMSON TIDE, all of which might be of interest to viewers of this film.  Jodie Foster has starred in FLIGHTPLAN, PANIC ROOM, and SHADOWS AND FOG.  Clive Owen has begun a successful American film career after enjoying one in England for several years.  He's starred in DERAILED, SIN CITY, and THE DRIVER.<br /><br />The movie progresses at a relatively slow pace, and doesn't really deepen any of the characters to any degree, but it does offer the viewer plenty of chances to guess what's going on.  The suspense mounts slowly, and the ending comes together in a manner that is almost anti-climatic.  The mood and atmosphere play out nicely, with enough characters introduced to make the situation even more complicated.  It's easy to watch and is entertaining in a what's-going-on way more than a thrill-a-minute way.  The film almost harkens back to the 1950s in its stylistic set-up and gentle, uncompressed storytelling.<br /><br />Once the movie is over, though, a thinking viewer will see a tremendous amount of plotholes as well as scenes that were actually distractions from the plot and red herrings to the mystery solvers.  But it did play fairly so that going back and putting the pieces together makes sense.  The final resolution of the stand-off at the bank was played almost too low-key to satisfy.  If it hadn't been for the question about what was actually going on still in play, viewers might tend to be disappointed.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN is a good movie for an evening home with a buddy who loves movies, or with a spouse.  Fans of Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, and Clive Own can see their stars in some of the best on-screen presence they've had.tle, uncompressed storytelling. <br /> <br />Once the movie is over, though, a thinking viewer will see a tremendous amount of plotholes as well as scenes that were actually distractions from the plot and red herrings to the mystery solvers.

B000058983|3.0|while this Album sounds very much of it's time&place, there is no denying the Creativity&Overall sparks that are felt throughout this Album. Arthur Lee  RIP who brought the Vision. this Band's overall tone&Feel has been Covered by a wide range of acts over the years. this album has a certain mood&Feel that will stay with you.
1563899426|4.0|this was a very interesting read.I enjoyed it, it was a nice change form the typical fairytale story. The art work was descent and had a fare ammount of details. <br />over all it was good...I can't wait to read the whole series.
B000002LQQ|5.0|First I'd like to say that I am quite the Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan and own quite a few of DS and Mark's solo work. On Every Street is an album that unfortunately gets overlooked or dismissed by many people. It's definitely different than the more commercial-sounding, but good, Brothers In Arms album...so everyone expecting more of the same six years later when On Every Street was released were thrown a curveball.  <br /> <br />There are definitely some fun songs on the album, such as Heavy Fuel...which is a good, solid song, but it's not the end-all be-all of rock songs like the other reviewers make it sound. My Parties and The Bug are also fun to listen to.  <br /> <br />This album features a lot more blues and country than anything Mark had done previously and I think many people were put off by this. I understand why people wouldn't be fond of this album, as many have strong feelings against those genres. I love the bluesy, sensual-sounding You and Your Friend and Fade to Black. My other favourites include When it Comes to You and Calling Elvis. This album features songs which are pretty simple-sounding lyrically compared to much of what Mark has composed in the past, but there is still quality and substance here, especially in Mark's also often-underrated guitar work.  <br /> <br />I'm not incredibly fond of every song on here, but I find there are very few albums in general where you'd enjoy every single song equally. All in all, I'd say that it's worth at least a few listens for any Dire Straits fan who appreciates other musical genres as well.
B000GYI32M|5.0|Season three, while nowhere near the awesomeness of season one, had a lot going for it. With new characters Taylor and Volchok, things really got exciting. Though it had a few plain terrible episodes, there were a handful of great, season one-like episodes like The Game Plan, The Graduates, The Dawn Patrol, The Party Favor, The Aftermath, The Anger Management, The Cliffhanger, The Roadwarrior, The Undertow, etc. that make the overall season totally worth it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When RATM broke up I was disapointed to say the least. When I heard that Chris Cornell formerly of Soundgarden had joined up with them and then finally joined up and formed Audioslave, I was quite excited. I honestly didn't know what to expect from this band. Would it favor a more Nu-Metal sound like Rage or would it favor the grunge/alt rock of Soundgarden? Come to find out it would be neither. When I heard Cochise on the radio, at first I had mixed emotions, but the more I heard it the more I liked it.  Then I got my hands on the album before the actual release. I fell in love. This CD must have been the only CD I listened too for about a month before it actually came out.  Then I bought it and listened too it some more.<br /><br />The best thing about this album, is that they truly have found their own sound. Comparisons to their former bands cannot be avoided, but listen to Soundgarden and Rage and then listen to this album. Its different. They don't abandon what makes them great mucisians, but they take that and have created their own sound that expands on their previous bands sound. Audioslave is just pure rock and roll. Tom Morello even said this in a interview, that Audioslave does more rocking than Rage ever did, and they have also shed the political aspect that rage had, which is fine with me. Rage was Nu-Metal, Soundgarden was grunge/alt rock, and Audioslave is just Hard Rock.<br /><br />All the ingredients for a great band are there. Tom Morrello is still one of the greatest and most innovative guitarists out there. Timmy C is a very talented on bass and Brad is a great drummer. Those 3 have been playing together for a long time and have a great chemistry. Then add Chris Cornell who has one of the most unique and amazing voices in all of rock. He is also one of one incredible songwriter. The rest of the band were all in awe over how quickly Chris could come up with a song all in his head. All of that makes for quite a special band in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm not going to do a in-depth song by song analysis, but each song on this album rocks.  Some are like I said just in your face hard rock.(cochise, gasoline, show me how to live, set it off) others are more what you might call ballads. But each song sounds incredible.  The energy of this album is amazing.  In my book, this is a classic rock album, and Audioslave is easily one of the greatest bands to appear on the music scene since the 90's.  FYI, if you can, go see these guys live, they put on a amazing show.a in-depth song by song analysis, but each song on this album rocks.

0790729652|4.0|Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a \\"superhero\\" because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume. Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called \\"The Joker.\\" So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely scratch the surface of the character's background - we know practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne, he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman. That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but thankfully Bale was able to do it.<br /><br />Michael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong - they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much, and in Batman & Robin I found their characters annoying as hell.<br /><br />Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying, screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen.<br /><br />There's lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe. When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report of the movie. The way \\"URGENT\\" is written in messy crayon on the parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask of the Phantasm.<br /><br />And now a few complaints. This movie featured too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up - Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems.<br /><br />I always overlooked this movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring.

0151003084|5.0|I was very pleased with the product that I ordered as well as the time it took to receive it - hardly any time at all!
0385512058|5.0|I highly recommend Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi. Ferrazzi, the \\"ultimate networker ... reveals how to build a lifelong community of colleagues, contacts, friends, and mentors.\\"<br /><br />Basically, Ferrazzi claims that in these connected times, the best (and really only) way to get ahead and become truly successful in business and life is to build and nurture a vast network of friends and associates who are willing to help you when you need it.<br /><br />In order to build such a network, you should invest in valuable relationship-building, and personally connect with people, not just collect business cards and file them in your Rolodex.<br /><br />In my opinion, Keith Ferrazzi is like the Dale Carnegie of the social networking era and the information age. He's big on doing favors first, if you expect to ask for favors later. Remember names, birthdays, and focus on making friends, not exploiting contacts.<br /><br />Although he covers them briefly, I would have liked to have gotten more depth on what he feels about online social networking sites, like MySpace and LinkedIn.<br /><br />Otherwise, I think the book was excellent and very useful for anyone interested in building a brand for themselves. Some business books can be very dry ... this one is more like a series of stories. There are also several short profiles scattered throughout the text, focusing on the stories of such great networkers as Eleanor Roosevelt, Dale Carnegie, Dalai Lama, and Bill Clinton.
1592400876|4.0|Truss' book is aimed at people who are offended by frequent, often public, glaring punctuation mistakes.  The \\"good news\\" is that her treatment of the topic provides lots of useful illustrations and basic rules; the \\"bad news\\" is that I'm afraid that my grammar skills are not as I'd hoped.<br /><br />Ms. Truss reports that her passion for the topic intensified upon being invited to talk at the Apostrophe Protection Society to talk.  Shortly afterwards she began thinking of starting a militant wing issuing corrective stickers, climbing ladders in the dead of night with a stencil and corrective can of paint - in short a punctuation vigilante.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the problem is hampered by differences between experts and between Britain and the U.S.  Undaunted, however, Truss helpfully covers rules, exceptions, examples and history for commas, apostrophes, colons and semi-colons, question marks, italics, capitalization, brackets, quotation marks, ellipses, and hyphens.  She attributes the recent decline in punctuation skills to the rise of e-mail and text messages.<br /><br />In closing, Truss exhorts us to fight like tigers to preserve correct punctuation, and to start now.  Hopefully I have committed no errors in this review!

0393327655|1.0|Would you really teach you children that condoms are 100% safe?  Sam Harris is clearly trying to give us a false hope by critiquing the historical record without actually telling you what the alternative is. Apart from Communism, China or North Korea, I don't know what he is suggesting? It is not as if Atheist nations are peaceful and not executing anyone who dares practice a religion. He goes straight for controversial religious subjects like the Rapture which is rejected by most mainstream Christians to attacking Jews for claiming a right to Israel. I am not sure if he believes in his own legal rights to a home. He attacks the Catholic Church for rejecting the use of condoms but he also fails to note that the Catholic Church also teaches not to have sex before marriage and to get tested. Condoms are not failsafe but he doesn't mention that you can still contract sexually transmitted diseases while using a condom. He seems to have very little regard for life by lessoning it into a test-tube to experiment on. This is not just about morals. It is about life. Apparently the fact that the western free world is build upon Christianity is out the door. It is these effects that are still being talked about today but he jokes about this and kind of just says it is all inadequate. He then believes in Sola Fide and suddenly becomes a Protestant who can interpret what the Bible means. According to Harris, Jesus hates homosexuals and asks us to murder non-Christians. He distorts the historical record. He says that Augustine invented torture for the inquisition and that all heretics where burned for just talking about heresy. This was not the case. Heretics where condemned by the state for refusing to stop teaching heresy. This is why for example the west maintained a Christian belief and not some other. He tries to equate Islam's kill for God, with Christianities die for God. There are not the same. He also skips over the fact that Christian can be scientists and many Christians who contributed to science are part of the historical record. He reminds me of a stand-up comedian just throwing stones at whoever is in the audience to get some attention. What can this contribute to? The answer is... N O T H I N G. It is completely useless.
B00000K3D4|5.0|The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy.  This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen. <br /> <br />The film is supplemented on this DVD with a \\"Making-of\\" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986).  Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors).  It's a lot of fun to see this \\"inside\\" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him.  My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), \\"When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the thingsthat matter to me,\\" - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age. <br /> <br />Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more \\"real\\" than many of today's \\"realities\\" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting.  As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary).  Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :-)
B00005BKZJ|4.0|I can tell this movie is near and dear to manys' hearts.  I love this movie as well for its simplicity and caring ways in telling about the true meaning of friendship and belonging.  CCH Pounder and Marianne Sagebrect pretty much mirror each others' characters, Brenda and Yasmine.  Both women in  dire situation, Brenda stuck in the Mojave Desert with two teenage kids, a grandbaby and a pretty useless husband.  And the German tourist, Yasmine just stuck in the dessert after having a disaggrement with her husband: Las Vegas vs Disneyland.  These and  other characters sort of whirl around in this desolate place with the sand and solitude. The movie ofcourse  is  peppered with dessert eccentrics like Jack Palace, ex-Hollywood set painter lusting over the volumptous Yasmine, a skinny, whiteboy backpacker, and many others that sort of walk into the movie.  What makes this movie special is the director's ability to weave each characters' lives into each other, into their sorrounding, into their own longings.  I love the theme  music constantly being played \\"I'm calling you,\\"  I guess in many this is what this movie is all about, a Calling for someone to understand and be your friend unconditionally,  that true genuine friendships can cross racial, social and cultural barriers.  I love this movie, and I know some people might not get it, too bad.  The missing star is for the lack of DVD extras, it would have been nice to know about the actors experience in the making of this movie.
B0009P42S2|5.0|I loved this movie. Maybe some people are let down because they liked Akira so much and thought it would be similar. It's not. Which is fine with me because I honestly did not like Akira. Akira was a little over my head and not to mention nauseating in some parts. This movie was easy for me to understand. I felt what the characters felt. The little boy having to choose sides in his own family-how heart breaking. In the end I believe the father and grandfather both prove to be nuts. But it shows the humanity of people-how flawed we all are. Just about everyone in this movie seems real-down to the bratty little girl. She's spoiled rotten but how else would she act when everyone treats her like a little princess. There's a lot of action but it's never monotonous like some action movies are. I was glued to the screen the whole time. It really kept me interested and I get bored really fast if I think a movie is going no where. I don't know how anyone was bored watching this movie. If you are a fan of Miyazaki movies-you'll probably like this one too. I definately plan to buy it.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This movie's only redeeming quality is the visual effects... as an artist, I have to admire their efforts. But other than that, the movie is just unwatchably bad. <br /> <br />There just isn't a coherent plot. The movie jumps from place to place, throwing in random events that leave you staring in confusion at the screen. Every time you think the story has settled down from its bizarre wandering, another case of poor editing shows up to shatter that illusion. <br /> <br />Add in bad acting, awful \\"humor\\", and you'll be looking at your clock wondering how much more you have to sit through.

B00003CXAA|5.0|We have enjoyed the Godfather saga ever since it first came out in the 1970s. A young Al Pacino made his mark in this movie and we think that it was one of the roles that enabled to go as far as he has. Also, as a part of our family is from New Jersey, the period scenes of Ellis Island and New York City lets us remember what it was like growing up in that time and lets our family's new generation learn about it too. We have had the collection on VHS for some time, but the opportunity to have it on DVD was too good to pass up. The price was excellent as well, considering that it's all the movies plus the fourth DVD with the behind the scenes stuff. <br /> <br />This is a collection we'd reccomend to any Godfather fan
B0002858YS|5.0|I have a hard time finding an album that I love every track on it. The Killers \\"Hot Fuss\\" had me from the very beginning. I had flashbacks of sounds that filled my head in my childhood and teens. You can see influences here from: The Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Smiths, Joy Division and so on. Every song on this album is amazing! You can't help sing along and feel energized by music again. This is an album that lived in my cd player and is a must on my ipod.

B00006879E|5.0|What can I say about \\"Songs about Jane\\"? <br />This album constantly surprises me by how much I can listen to it. Every song has a unique and appealing feel to it. Adam Levine has an amazingly sexy voice that sounds like a smooth drink going down. My favourite songs on this album are: Sunday Morning, The Sun, Secret, Sweetest Goodbye and Not coming Home. There are also the radio favourites: She will be Loved, Harder to breathe and This Love. Maroon 5 manages to cover a variety of genres in this ablum: R'n'B, Funk, Blues and Pop, therefore feeding most tastes in one album.  I would recommend this album to anyone I know and have given it as a gift many times.

0143035711|5.0|I recently gave away my copy of this marvelous book to my son. It wasn't too long before I went into withdrawal and bought myself another copy. Bob Mason is a truly honest man, which is not to say that he never lied, cheated, or stole, but that he is one of those rare individuals who can look at himself in the mirror and see himself as he really is, warts and all. That takes an admirable form of courage that most of us don't have. I couldn't do a memoir the way he did. I had to resort to an alter-ego in my own book. I won't claim more warts than Bob, but the ones I have I don't like.<br /><br />Like Bob, I got into the Army Warrant Officer Helicopter Flight Program after high school in 1967. I was a typical wobbly-one, long on enthusiasm for flying, short on brains, experience, maturity, character, morals, and wisdom. Hey, I was only nineteen! But I sure liked to fly, especially choppers, especially Bell Helicopter's masterpiece, the UH-1 `Huey.' Bob was just coming home from Vietnam the year before I enlisted. He was one of the pioneers of the airmobile concept, assigned to the 1st Cav and traveling to Vietnam by boat with the unit's choppers lashed to the deck. I was appalled at the initial treatment he and the other warrant officers received once they arrived in country. They had to dig their own bunkers. Warrant officers are `supposed' to be officers, rating the respect and privileges of commissioned officers. Actually the commissioned officers used to joke that a warrant officer was just a spec-four with a club card. Still I had to admit that when a unit is freshly arrived in a combat zone, getting shelter up quickly is essential, and I would hate to have been killed in a mortar attack that night because I was too proud to fill sand bags that day.<br /><br />The real appeal of the book is the white-knuckle flying action scenes. They were often times hair-raising nightmares, and the crews were scared to death, but some how they got the job done anyway--hence, the name of the book, `Chickenhawk.' Warrant officers were funny that way--no mission was impossible. Commissioned pilots tended to fall back on the regulations when things got rough. They had college degrees and were smarter than we were. They tended to live longer too. There were exceptions in both cases, but what I said was generally true in Army aviation.<br /><br />I was saddened by the fall from grace that Bob experienced when he returned stateside. He had spent a year comporting himself bravely, and now he was haunted by that same bravery. I bought and read his second book, curious I guess, at just how far his downward spiral would take him. And he sank pretty far before he finally autorotated his life to a safe landing. I finally concluded that he was one of those guys who should have stayed in combat, extending his tour 12 months at a time, taking a month off in between to visit his wife in Honolulu. That was where he was at his best--impossible missions, tracers flying everywhere, too dark to see, too dangerous to turn on the lights, breaking every flight safety regulation imaginable, and then getting chewed out by the old man while he was pinning another air medal on his chest. Of course if Bob had done that, we probably wouldn't be reading his fine books today.<br /><br />--Ejner Fulsang, author of \\"A Knavish Piece of Work,\\" [...], the name of the book, `Chickenhawk.'

B000FS9FCQ|1.0|***** Spoiler Alert *****    See if you can follow this:    1.  The hero hates his government because it betrays, kidnaps, and tortures people.  2.  The hero betrays, kidnaps and tortures the heroine, offering the lame excuse that she asked for it.  3.  The heroine forgives the hero.  4.  The movie has a gross revenue of over 132 million according to Box Office Mojo.    My major objection to this film is that in my opinion there is never any excuse to torture a woman.  Apparently there are many young people around the world for whom torturing women is pleasant culturally accepted diversion.  If you are not one of these people, do not support this film.
B00005JOYM|5.0|In a lot of ways, the horrific events of September 11, 2001 are things that we as a nation here in America have still not yet come to grips with on any concise, clear-headed level without macho warmongering and bloodthirsty revenge intruding.  The bottom line is that, like the Holocaust, the 9/11 attacks were a prime example of Man's inhumanity to Man.  But there were acts of heroism that day that proved that there is more to us than murder and bloodshed.  This is what is at the heart of director Oliver Stone's film WORLD TRADE CENTER.    Naturally, Stone's reputation as a political lightning rod, with films like PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, JFK, and NIXON, makes him a perfect whipping boy for the right-wing fanatics who would brand him a loony or anti-American while at the same time hypocritically using the 9/11 tragedy as so much political propaganda.  But in telling the true-life saga of Port Authority officers William McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), he has given us an example of both American and just plain HUMAN heorism that those on the far-right couldn't manufacture on even their best day.  McLoughlin and Jimeno had gone in, along with 340 of their fellow Port Authority officers, to rescue people trapped inside the World Trade Center towers that day, only to find themselves needing help when the towers collapsed around them and they were trapped under thousands of tons of debris for twenty hours.  Stone, a native of New York, shows us what the Big Apple's finest and bravest had on their hands that day, and brings this whole terrible ordeal to where it OUGHT to be--a personal and human level, not merely a polemic about gung-ho American patriotism, save, loosely, for the Marine who went in there to help Jimeno and McLoughlin out of their would-be grave.  He also shows us the horror and distress felt by the men's wives and families, often through flashbacks during their nightmarish ordeal under the rubble.    Like the earlier 9/11 films of this year, the superb FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, WORLD TRADE CENTER looks at 9/11 from the point of view of what really matters--an apocalyptic event in human history in which brave people stood up and fought not only for their lives, but also to save hundreds, if not thousands, of others.  Cage and Pena do a fine job of portraying McLoughlin and Jimeno, respectively, and the entire cast and production move with deliberate pace under the careful direction of Stone, who has left the flashy but excellent editing style of JFK behind here for something much more contemplative.  This movie, as with FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, proves that Hollywood is ready to deal with the human nightmare of 9/11, and so too are the American people.  The question now is, Are the politicians out there ready to deal with it that way too?
B000FGGE7C|5.0|This was a quite a feat of filmmaking. It had beautiful art direction and stunning visuals. Milla Jovovich was wonderful - not only for her amazing abilities with a sword, but for her excellent, unique acting abilities where rich emotions swim under a cool exterior - part of Milla's trademark style but delivered here with absolute precision and total humanity. William Fichtner also has a great but understated role in this as a scientist living in a mobile trailer that expands into a voluminous laboratory due to the 'flat space' technology of the times, another fantastic metaphor extended throughout the movie with incredible beauty and humor. Milla has a lot of cool things to say about this (and the architecture) in the films commentary section. The film is visually the most elegant and stunning I have seen, largely due to the crispness of execution and the subtle intelligence of art design and choreography utilized throughout - the scenery and style of the movie are a \\"vision\\" - and the actors seamlessly make themselves part of this world. It is a very graceful yet cutting movie that packs quite a graphic punch but is also willing to explore great storytelling and is often highly poetic in dialogue and theme - half the story is interwoven in the visual narrative - so if you are not careful, some of the delicate nuances of this film can fly straight over your head. Do not underestimate this film or the story! Its sparseness of design and execution are part of what makes it wonderful. As an artist or photographer I think one could appreciate how every still from this film would make an attractive canvas or print. Visually it is just superb! The DVD has some very interesting special features about the filming locations etc...  <br />All in all - riveting plot for a sci-fi - full of depth and humor and cool ideas. The story line was rich and sharply executed, not laden down by excess and useless dialogue like so many films - instead it has minimalist yet powerful and understated dialogue where every word counts (like a haiku). This movie is light and graceful yet full of substance, and the fight scenes were awesome! If you don't \\"get\\" this movie, don't write it off - watch it again and come around! <br />

The pages are standard re-production for Shakespeare issues - but overall it is excellent value for money and is attractively bound. For those who want 'notes' and 'critiques' - look elsewhere. It is as described - a leather bound edition of the complete works of Shakespeare. I love it! Thank you Amazon USA, you cant get this edition in the UK.

But in the theater, realy i got sleep, becouse the screenplay is fool and the House by the Lake is the most vulgar than any house in any lake. <br />And the Keanu Reaves performance, is poor, i think this actor have a  terrible problems about his performance, becouse he have the same face in all of his movies. <br />

B000002H2H|4.0|LIGHTNING is classic metal. \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\" are headbanger delights. \\"Fade to Black\\" is gorgeous but still brutally heavy in lyric and melody. \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" serves as the record's dark horse. Rarely do you hear Metallica play this in concert. To me it defined their early persona as unforgiving bards of horror, and yet it still remained as catchy as possible for thrash metal standards. \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" showcases Metallica's gifted abilities as dark metal musicians. \\"Fight Fire\\" and \\"Escape\\" keep LIGHTNING from achieving a perfect mark, however. The tender acoustic intro to \\"Fire\\" is humorous as it turns into a blaze of metal fury after 40 seconds of gentle ear massaging. But the chorus lacks a knock out punch that \\"Creeping Death\\" or \\"Lightning\\" have. \\"Escape\\" has a killer verse reading, but again the chorus is substandard and generic in quality. I'm not saying LIGHTNING isn't a fabulous metal recording. It's electrifying. I would grade this platter a 95 out of 100 points. It's head and shoulders above anything Metallica released after the black album and better than anything Megadeth or Anthrax released, but it's not the perfect recording as indicated by most of the previous LIGHTNING reviewers. For a perfect metal album, pick up METALLICA, GN'R's APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, or Motley Crue's DR. FEELGOOD.
0517147688|5.0|I made the mistake of purchasing the paperback 8-in-1 Jane Austen book -  what a mistake!  It was sloppy and cheap-looking, with its unattractive, clumsy two-column format that didn't seem to show due respect to the material.  I found it too depressing and unpleasant to read, so I ordered this version, and I am so happy I did!  What a gorgeous book, classy and elegant, with lovely illustrations, nice typeset, padded leather cover and gilt edges.  And for only a few dollars more, it's a no-brainer decision to choose this version over the paperback.  Even if you go with a used copy, it's still a far better bargain than the other one, and something you'll enjoy reading with pleasure for years to come. I will definitely look into the other classics in this series.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|<br />A political rant about oil companies, which will be dragged out of the closet whenever a Republican is President and put back into the closet whenever a beloved Democrat is President. <br /> <br />The name of the oil company is, of course, \\"CON\\"nex, so that the political fanatics who this film was made for can be sure to instantly recognize the universal symbol of their devil, conservative businessmen who keep a woman and children in the house and who don't partake of the radical ideologies of communism, the welfare state or Islam that inflame all liberals. <br /> <br />The basic plot is idiotically childish.  There is no reform in the middle east because the United States in conjunction with big oil has assassinated the only liberal reformer, who believes in woman's rights, ever known to wear a white Arab's dress.  Why?  Because he was planning on selling our oil to China at higher prices than we pay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000BBOUU4|2.0|If you type \\"therapy,\\" \\"therapist,\\" or, \\"counseling\\" in to any search engine you will get, literally, millions and millions of returns, and you won't disturb anyone or air your problems in public.<br /><br />I guess no one ever told Tim Burton about search engines because he, evidently, views movie making as a bizarre form of public therapy for his unhappy childhood and, as a result, he continuously inflicts his parental issues on the movie going public by re-creating established icons in his own emotionally knee-capped image.<br /><br />This time around the classic he trashes is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Giving lip service to making a totally faithful adaptation of Roald Dahl's fantastic book, Mr. Burton instead took to immediately turning Willy Wonka into an emotional cripple because his daddy was too strict and wouldn't nurture his creative candy ideas. {replace the word `candy' with `movie' and viola' Willy Wonka becomes Tim Burton! How'd that happen?!}<br /><br />It isn't just Wonka whose psyche' has been converted to a dark abyss, no that would be to easy. All the parents who accompany their kids on the tour are totally worthless; they stand around and watch their children getting maimed and hardly raise a fuss or ask a question. They were pretty useless in the book too but at least they made some noise about their kids getting axed. Grandpa Joe is okay because he isn't technically Charlie's `parent' so it's alright for him to be nice in Mr. Burton's world.<br /><br />The ending from the book has also been cast aside so Mr. Burton can spend an extra half hour beating the dead horse of mean, uncaring parents and their emotionally stunted children. And what is the payoff for this extra time stolen from your life? We find out that Old Man Wonka has been secretly proud of his son's accomplishments all these years but he was too proud to say \\"I love you.\\" Dare to dream, Tim.<br /><br />Now let's talk about casting; Johnny Depp has no business in this film whatsoever, even on his best day he would be totally wrong for this part, and this is NOT his best day. His uneven and bizarre performance has an extremely creepy child molester quality that is very hard to watch and is about a million miles away from the character that Roald Dahl created. In fact the entire film is poorly cast with two exceptions; Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Julia Winter as Veruca Salt. Both did very well with what they had to work with.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's score, which is usually the one bright spot in a Tim Burton film, doesn't work at all here. It almost sounds as if Mr. Elfman has run out of ideas for making Burtons films palatable and just phoned it in to get it over with. The Oompa Loompa songs, however, are very catchy and pretty well done. The one complaint about them is that the words are important but they are frequently intelligible because of the music. In the book those lyrics, and Wonka's reaction to them, help set the tone of the story and establish that all is not what it seems.<br /><br />I have avoided mentioning the 1971 version until now because I wanted the majority of this review to deal with Burton's remake and little else, but it is impossible to ignore the other film because Burton made such a point of publicly distancing his version from it. And therein lies the biggest obstacle to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; the original adaptation of Roald Dahl's book nailed the magical yet dangerous feel of the factory so well and, Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka was so spot on with the book that when Burton distanced his film from them he, in effect, prohibited his own movie from capturing the nature of the book or it's lead characters.<br /><br />Avoid this film if you can.

It was a terrible thing that this happened on 9-11 and this movie deserves nothing more than an oscar. <br />Joel Segal gave this movie two thumbs up and you know what so do I. God Bless America and may all those people effected by the terror attack be placed in the kingdom of heaven. <br />Great Movie. Huge Tear Jerker and it is for a good reason \\"The Emotion and terror that was seen that day\\".
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears is a pop music phenomenom.  Her status as one of the world's most fascinating females in entertainment history is well-earned and deserved since, hey (let's admit it), she worked hard for it.  Though her singing abilities have been questioned often, it's time to put that oft-talked about subject aside for the moment and focus on the real thing Spears is--or was?--famous for before taking a hiatus to pursue a family: global smash No. 1 hit singles that stick in the mind like bubblegum.  Since her Grammy-nominated first single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" topped charts everywhere in 1998, Britney Spears has had a slew of hits.  Her looks certainly played a part in the mass amount of attention put on her shoulders from the start--but radio doesn't show images through its speakers, only music makes it through.  Despite of the amount of controversy this once-so-innocent sensation stirs, there is no doubt the infamous Britney Spears has had an impressive amount of international hit songs, be it the aforementioned classic \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" or the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic.\\"  Her Greatest Hits is a consistent and likable album worth purchasing despite one's personal feelings about the singer because, unlike most of her studio releases, every song presented here was (for some time) a serious chart-topper.  Considering adding a Britney Spears CD to the collection?  This one's it.
B00064WSNW|5.0|I like both the earlier incarnations of this band, and the eighties line up featuring Levin and Belew.  <br /> <br />This is an awesome recording. From beginning to the end, it commands your attention and takes you through a diverse collection of musical landscapes. There's some hard edged playing and incrediblly technical passages (still delivered with wonderful nuance), often with an ambient third world underpinning. Play it very loud.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Elephant Talk - sure the guitar work is top-notch, but check out Belews clever lyrics and impassioned vocals. Awesome.  <br /> <br />Frame by Frame - I love this tune. The architecture of the guitar lines is impeccable. These guys can play very technically challenging music, but they never loose sight of musicality. Great interplay of the two guitars.   <br /> <br />Matte Kudasai - very sweet ballad, maybe Belew's best.  <br /> <br />Indiscipline - WOW. This is some heavy stuff.Terrific. Crazy vox on this one!!  <br /> <br />Thela Hun Gingeet - Freaky stuff... Belew gets a clever, funny paranoic rap going on this one, over a awesome world beat vibe. Levin's bass playing here (and everywhere, really) is rock solid.  <br /> <br />The Sheltering Sky - awesome tune. An instumental where Fripps sweet guitar synth playing is featured with some exotic percussion and wonderfully played backing ensemble. While Bruford's percussion and Fripps guitar are at the forefront, the ensemble playing is perfect. Atmospheric music.  <br /> <br />Disclipline - Who else could create an instumental like this...these guys play in odd-time signatures so fluidly and naturally. Nice instumental ensemble feature to close things out with style. No one member stands out here, they all play as one instrument.     <br /> <br />The sound quality on this is impeccable. Incredible on 'phones, and even better on a great stereo when things are quiet in the house.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The infamous Britney Spears took two years making this record.  Though it's hardly as likable as her superb debut or as consistent as the two follow-ups, In the Zone remains to date her most controversial and inventive of works.  The standout track here is, of course, the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic\\" (which happens to be one of Spears' best songs)--it's fun, funky and sexy.  \\"Showdown\\" combines whispered coos and a cascading chorus to make a pretty likable track while the record's opener is one of its most club-ready.  Since ballads have never been Spears' best musical format it's surprising to say that In the Zone's two official ballads \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Shadow\\" are in fact two of the album's best moments.  Though the first became one of Britney's biggest hits, the latter is one of her most poetic songs and is performed well.  In the end Britney Spears doesn't have a superb listen, but one definitely that shows growth as an artist.

0440180295|5.0|I had not read a book by Kurt Vonnegut before and I did not understand what the big deal about his books were. When I first picked up Slaughterhouse Five I expected it to be like so many other standard \\"this happened, then this happened, and so on\\" books. After the first chapter though, I was hooked.     The character of Billy Pilgrim is perfect in that he illustrates the carelessness we have about war. The aliens and their perspective about \\"fate\\" also gives into this concept that \\"war is inevitable\\" which Vonnegut is in fact arguing against. I don't want to give away to much, so I'll stop here on the substance.    But beyond the \\"meaning\\" of the book the way it is written is also brilliant. The story goes back and forth and lets us see every moment in its full context. Also, Vonnegut does this clever tactic of bringing up seemingly small and irrelevant material in the course of reading the book only to bring it up again later in the book thus having you turn back the pages and ferociously look for the references.      This is at the top-tier of American literature and deserves all the praise it has received over the years.

B0007Y08II|4.0|Two classic songs came out of this movie: \\"Everyone Has AIDS\\" and \\"Freedom Isn't Free.\\" The second song is a parody written as a country song and the first doesn't really need any explanation.<br /><br />The movie was very funny all the way through and the special features that came with the film were outstanding. They mostly took the form of documentaries discussing the special techniques necessary for creating a film with all puppets. This behind-the-scenes stuff is extremely interesting!<br /><br />The movie was well above average in terms of it's entertainment value. There were some lame moments, but for the most part it was pretty funny all the way through. Probably the funniest thing is how everytime Team America \\"saves the day\\" they wind up doing more harm than good... hey, come to think of it, that's not that funny... it's too much like real life!
B000GIXEIG|5.0|If you expect this movie to remain faithful to the epic poem...live in the now!  What makes a great poem or a great book for that matter does not necessarily make a great movie.  The people who review this movie poorly are the same people that expected Thirteenth Warrior to be exactly like Beowulf and the writings of Ibn Fadlan.  I have studied Beowulf both in high school and at university.  At not time have I ever expected any movie to be anything like the original.  In the original, Grendel was violent with no explanation.  That lack of motive simply doesn't mesh in today's world.  For those who can't get over the fact that this movie is merely based on the original, get a reality check and enjoy the movie for what it is...entertainment.
B00005JOYM|5.0|Nearly five years after the tragedies of 9/11, we get two remarkable films that skillfully focus on a certain aspect of that horrible day.  Oliver Stone brings us the survival story of William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena) and John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) in every explicit detail.  The events develop quickly.  The movie focuses on short little scenes that work like snapshots from two family photo albums.  The day is recreated with all its mundane details, just waiting for everyone to have the rug pulled out from under them.  The unbelievable slowly reached our consciousness, and so it did even for those closest to the drama.  Just like 'United 93' we are given a section of the horror as it unfolds.  Both movies are reinactments; both use news footage and narrative to frame the story.  We soon see the building collapse, and the two brave policemen are captured beneath the rubble when they wisely ran for the elevator shaft.      Then, the movie moves slowly.  Their ordeal becomes our ordeal, and their waiting becomes ours as well.  Their interspersed memories fill the narrative as any life would pass before one's eyes.  It becomes unnerving as rubble and fire pass their way past both heroes as they cling to life.  A pistol goes off accidentally from a colleague who didn't make it out alive.  We go back and forth to the homes where the news is settling in, and it becomes more desperate as the hours go by.    People should decide if they want to see movies like 'United 93' and 'World Trade Center'.  One should respect that for some it is too early.  (It was/is an awful reality.)  But, for the rest of us, these movies are well-constructed and ably focused.  The former is more of a reinactment; the latter is more of a movie.  Both are both, and each offers a worthy chance to assimilate the events and grieve once more.  The world after the Millenium has reawoken us out of a dream state after 9/11, and movies that are this realistic can be healing and help us cope to the realities 9/11 presented.  A story of survival can plant the seeds of hope, especially when these seeds of awareness can help thwart a near disaster, like the one recently planned at Heathrow.  Oliver Stone says he has no political agenda.  This is no rationalization, but the blunt truth.  He even has two short, courageous speeches presented by President Bush and Mayor Guiliani meant to help us through the crisis.  He does the men, the families, the survivors, and casualties justice in his rendering of that awful day.  He also shows that the best of us can shine through in calamity.  In the end, just like 'Schindler's List,' everyone counts.
B000002JSJ|5.0|I have always believed Presence to be more powerful than its lack of publicity would suggest. I am a huge Zeppelin fan, but still I am able to lose interest in some of the more overplayed songs from various records. Presence, however, always keeps me interested. When it comes to seriously catchy-sounding guitar riffs and grooves, these guys were the masters. This album displays that wonderfully and there's truly not a bad song on the disc. They say a good ending is key to a good movie. Well I believe this holds true for songs also. To me, the endings of the songs on Presence are incredible. Most of them end so perfectly that it makes me want to play them again, immediately. Without mentioning individual tracks, I would just like to say that this recording is full of power, emotion and finesse. It is Led Zeppelin's little, overlooked masterpiece.

0446677450|1.0|I purchased this book, and it was fun to read, almost like a comic book. When I tried some of the ideas out, like so many other people, I got absolutely nowhere. <br /> <br />Why is it that the people who positively recommend this book have simply read it, then instantly raved that Kiyosaki is the messiah who will lead them to financial freedom? Aren't they supposed to also road-test the book in real-life as well, to prove that it works? The commonsense method is obviously to read the book and put the suggestions into practice. THEN when\if you become a millionaire using his (fantasy) methods, you can tell people how good the book is. For people to sing the book's praises before they have even made one ounce of substantial profit out of it makes no sense whatsoever. This whole Rich Dad Poor Dad \\"phenomenon\\" is nothing more than a cult. Most people do want to get rich, but this book is not the path to financial freedom, no matter how desperate you are. <br /> <br />Once people get past the joy of being told by Kiyosaki that they no longer need to work for money, they can then go on to test out his juvenile ideas in the real world and see what happens. One of my friends got well into Kiyosaki a few years ago. He got all the books, spent $300 on both board games, quit his job, and annoyed everyone by constantly boasting about how rich he was going to become, and how amazing Robert Kiyosaki is. Now, he's bankrupt and disgraced, as he found out that it's nowhere near as easy as Kiyosaki makes out. Now he's got no money, and he looks like a fool. Meanwhile the Kiyosaki circus rolls on.  <br /> <br />This book's high sales volume means nothing; billions of people used to believe the world was flat years ago, and that wasn't true either. Borrow this book from the library or from a friend, and attempt to try the ideas in real-life, and you will see how impossible they are in reality. If you are unable to put the principles in the book to good effect in real-life, don't worryits not you, it is Kiyosaki who is at fault.  <br /> <br />This book, and its advice, is over-priced, over-simplified, unintelligible, and completely impractical in the real world. Kiyosaki is not living his current rich lifestyle due to the advice in this book. His lifestyle comes from sales of the book, as he has obviously made millions of dollars out of it. <br /> <br />I have friends who read this book years ago, and purchased additional Kiyosaki materials. Nobody is a millionaire or financially free yet. In fact, every single one is either working in their exact same \\"crummy\\" job, or bankrupted. So anybody who thinks this book is good, please also reveal how much money the book has made you. <br /> <br />\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a book which preys on people's financial fears and weaknesses; a trick which has worked since time immemorial. Ask yourself why anybody who wants you to be financially free would tell you to pay $300 for his pathetic board games (he does this at the end of the book!). This is not a man who cares if you are unable to feed your children or pay your bills. Kiyosaki hit the jackpot with this book; I bet he still can't quite believe how many people bought it. He probably laughs himself to sleep every night. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki wrote, that following Rich Dads advice left him bankrupt, penniless and living in a car. I also watched some TV show Kiyosaki was on, and he talked about how he was broke and penniless when he met his wife. This was after 30 years of using the plans he is telling us all to use in this book. The sad reality is, that if you become bankrupt, employers are less likely to hire you for a job, it becomes EXTREMELY harder to get bank loans (especially at acceptable rates), and you may become homeless (like Kiyosaki) and never recover. If you want to end up on the streets and feeling like a fool, then follow this books advice.  <br /> <br />In summary, this book is all about a man who allegedly used his \\"Rich Dads\\" methods for years and only ended up bankrupt. He then wrote a book which became a bestseller, and the rest is history. Kiyosaki is rich now, but what he has written in this book, and stated on TV, proves that the methods in his book are not the path he took, as Rich Dads methods left him destitute. <br /> <br />If you want to be rich and happy, do not buy this book. Start by getting a job, and then save and invest your money like real rich people have done for centuries. If you buy this book, you will only be contributing to Kiyosaki's \\"ignorance tax\\". A book which IS worth buying, is \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" by T.Stanley, where the authors have done real research and provide concrete answers on how to get rich on planet earth. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have been a huge fan of RHCP since I was about 6.

1594830819|2.0|This one tended to be dizzying, with its involuted, convoluted, prevoluted, and retrovoluted wad of plot lines.  My limitted unravelling skills were overwhelmed by the tangle.  Hard to keep track of who's who in the zoo, and, of why one should care.  Weirdly, there seemed to be magical cross-linkages, and major difficulties impossibly easy to overcome in the midst of simple but immovable obstacles.  Love sprang suddenly and unquestioningly to life across the crowded bar, just in time to thicken the mix. I wouldn't go to the movie.
0767805712|5.0|I finally saw this film for the first time last night after hearing how wonderful it was time and time again.  I have to say that the reviews for this film are right.  It's very smart and excellently paced, keeping your attention and testing your wits.  Vincent Freeman was born into the world conceived in love.  His parents had opted to have a child naturally rather than have a child according to new procedures.  You see natural selection is the way to go, having your sperm and eggs inspected as to the perfect child, wiping out all disease and medical problems, mood disorders or any chance of early death.  These genetically altered children are considered 'valids'.  Vincent was born an 'in-valid', not expected to live more than 30 years.  Because of this set-back Vincent will never be allowed to realize his dream of space travel for only 'valids' are allowed to enter the training program.  You must be of the utmost physical shape. <br /> <br />This was until Vincent (Hawke) met Jerome Morrow (Law), a 'valid' who lost everything due to an accident and is now bound to his wheelchair.  He offers Vincent the opportunity of a lifetime, to take over his life, live as he should have.  He cuts his hair to look like Jerome, he gets contacts and he even has a procedure done to his legs to make him the right height (crazy).  Jerome supplies Vincent with enough blood and urine to pass any test.  To everyone around him Vincent is Jerome Morrow.  And now Vincent can realize his dream of Space Travel. <br /> <br />That was until the head of the department of space travel is found murdered. After a Detective (Elias Koteas) is put on the case he threatens to expose Vincent for who he is.  Uma Thurman does a great job as Irene, a fellow employee at Gattaca who befriends Vincent and understands him more than he knows.  Jude Law to me is who steals the show proving that he is as acclaimed as he is for a reason.  Excellent story line and execution that raises this film to the next level.  This film carries a ring of truth as new procedures are already making this possible.  As of now parents can go as far as to pick the color of their child's eyes, hair, his likes and dislikes.  With everything in the hands of the parents, nothing to chance, it's taking us so far from where we were meant to be.  What ever happened to accepting what God provides?  What ever happened to loving your children for who they are and not who you made them?
B0002DB0FO|4.0|\\"Everwood\\"'s first season is already almost classic. It is highly unlikely you haven't heard about this show, but just in case that happened I'll tell you some things about the plot, so you can decide whether this is the kind of show you might like.<br /><br />Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams) is a highly successful neurosurgeon that has neglected his family in order to take care of his patients. But reality crashes down on him when his wife (Brenda Strong) dies in an accident. He doesn't know what to do, and, in the spur of the moment, decides to move with his two children to Everwood, a little town in Colorado that his wife had loved when they saw it for the first time, a long time before her death.<br /><br />Leaving the big city and becoming a small town doctor will mean many changes Andrew, but even more for his teenager son Ephram (Gregory Smith), and his young daughter, Delia (Vivien Cardone), that have to leave their friends and everything they know in order to move to a strange city. What it is worse, they are not accustomed to actually spending time with their father, and miss their mother a lot...<br /><br />Will the Brown's become a real family? And will they find their place in the world in Everwood? These are some of the questions that this first season begins to answer, and the reason why you should watch this dvd. \\"Everwood\\" has a little bit of everything, drama and comedy, and specially that kind of moments that make a series stand out. Recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat

I've read other editions of Little Women and don't remember the word don't being used so poorly throughout the novel as it was in this edition. Are these the original words of Louisa May Alcott or don't people know how to use proper English back in the 1860's?

B00026W82U|5.0|Kings of Convenience is very much Jack Johnson plus Coldplay. Some songs are mellow/sad and others are almost T-Rex with peppiness.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|If I could throw BRICK through your window to insure you'd watch it, I would.<br /><br />I'm ordinarily parsimonious with \\"5 star\\" ratings. But as someone who discovered Raymond Chandler in my high school's library, BRICK got the drop on me early and wouldn't let up. This movie's transposition of the hard-boiled noir genre to a high school setting is completely successful on its own terms. And it avoids the pitfalls of parody to become a pastiche that can stand on its own.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to savor in this film, but the main one is the dialogue. (Be sure to turn on the subtitles to get their full flavor.) Flowery and anachronistic, writer/director Rian Johnson obviously had a great time getting these lines just right. The protagonist, Brendan, doesn't have a merely dry wit; this guy is downright dehydrated.<br /><br />And there is more to savor than the words. For some reason, I loved the way that the high school seems perennially deserted. Sure, the femme fatale could have been better cast, and the plot gets all \\"Scooby Doo\\" at the end. But I had enjoyed myself so much up to that point, I was willing to forgive anything.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I rarely walk out of a movie...I did with this one! It is totally BORING! People can wax philisophically about the deeeeep meanings but it is simply rubbish! Yes, the ladies are pretty and sexy, but you can get that from a whole lot of good movies, why waste your time with nonsense!
B000002H70|5.0|i have to say when i first got this album when it came out, i was extremely disappointed.  i was expecting something in the same line as 'KMKMKM' and this just seemed far too slow on first listen.  luckily i did not give up, because after a few weeks it finally clicked and the brilliance of the album shone through.  i have rarely heard such deeply profound and moving music and lyrics, and i have to say that RS just hit everything perfectly here.  from the opening notes of 'plainsong,' to the swirling dark beauty of 'fascination street' to the awe-inspiring opening of 'homesick.'  the album just has too many wonderful moments to discuss here.  sigh............... perfection.  cannot wait for the deluxe edition--bring it on!
0393316041|5.0|This is a fantastic book!  Richard Feynman is a fascinating person and an excellent writer.  His view of the world is exciting and interesting and his life experiences make for enjoyable stories.  One lesson that comes through in this book is 'Think', don't be afraid to stop and think about something, a problem, a point of view, etc.  Through these stories and the life of Richard Feynman, we are all shown what it is to live a life well.  Get this book! <br />
B000784WMW|5.0|I absolutely adore this version. NOT for the studio production (which is not what you would normally expect of BBC), but for the actors Timothy Dalton (who is all passionate male!) and Zelah Clarke who truly portrays the book's Jane Eyre like no other in it's purest adaptation.  The smokin' hot chemistry of Jane and Mr. Rochester from the moment Jane \\"bewitches his horse\\" *wink* makes you eagerly anticipate each scene they have together. Everyone I have given the DVD to has thoroughly enjoyed it and the story has stuck with them for WEEKS!    Although I believe a review should include quality and production information for DVD transfers, IMO to give a romance adaptation series a low star grade based solely on it alone, although the dialogue/set adaptation and acting is top-notch is VERY misleading to the MANY who read reviews to find out about the story, the dialogue, the acting and above all the ROMANCE between the two lead characters. The production doesn't take away from the aforementioned and the wonderful love story that truly unfolds. I'm glad most of the reviewers agree!    The dreariness of Thornfield Hall in the first few episodes matched what both Mr. Rochester and Jane's lives were until they literally cross each other's paths. Notice how after they become 'friends' they both light up the room and each other with what is going on behind her dimpled smile and his growing attraction for her. You ride the roller coaster of contradiction that is Mr. Rochester while also wanting to jump through the screen to protect Jane from the unknown. The entire story is no bubble-gum-happy story from beginning to end, but you walk away with a smile on your face because the journey they take you on is not one you will easily forget.    This is the romance of all romances - love it!!!      **ADDED 11/27/06**  I had a 5 day weekend and loaded up on all genres of movies and happen to catch TWO adaptations of Jane Eyre on cable this past weekend that I hadn't seen in quite some time. I watched the William Hurt version, as well as the Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine version and I can now remember quite frankly why both were so easily forgotten by me.     First and foremost, there's far too much NECESSARY information revealed in the BBC mini-series version that 2-3 hour movies simply cannot cover. In addition to that, I can't express enough how both Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's performances are truly believable and exceptionally performed on many levels.  You \\"get\\" the glimpses of warmth, the humor, the unfolding love and the sense of danger to her emotionally as well as physically. Due to the abruptness of the Orson Welles version (at no fault of it's own) you felt if Jane ended up with someone else, she'd actually be better off.  For me, William Hurt's Mr. Rochester didn't exude the warmth and sincere regret of the book's Mr. Rochester, nor did he embody his magnetism so I pitied that Jane's outcome as well.  This is not the case with the Dalton/Clarke version. I challenge anyone to compare their final Jane and Mr. Rochester scenes (when he realizes she is in the same room with him) to either the Wells or Hurt versions. During the very emotional scenes, Orson and William Hurt (although GREAT actors in other roles) were reading their lines while their beautiful counterparts were simply waiting for them to finish.  Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's scenes were performed with EVERY facet of their beings completely drawing you into the highly charged moment of what they were both experiencing at the time. At the end of this movie you truly felt there was no other woman for him, nor man for her. You also felt they were equals no matter the other's shortcomings.  Again, in my opinion, there's no comparison of this Jane Eyre to any other version performed. Do not cheat yourself - see this version!
0060005424|5.0|I was totally immersed in this book. It is about a confused and lost girl named Lirael who must find her way in a place she feels she doesn't belong. It is also about Sam who feels he is given a title that he does not feel like he can uphold. They go through many trials and start to learn more about themselves. There lives meet as they both set out on a quest that will forever changed their lives.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book. In reading the some of the other reviews, I do not agree that Sam seemed to be a coward or a whiner. I think what he went through was a horrible experience and it bothered him greatly. He always came through in the end.
B000006TRV|3.0|When I first bought 'The Wall' I loved it. Somes songs were familiar ones that I'd heard on the radio my whole life like 'Another Brick In The Wall Pt 2' and 'Comfortably Numb', other were great surprises, songs full of a sense of loss, rage and sadness. However as happens with some albums its effects on me wore off. What had seemed grand and poingnant now seemed pompous and overblown. Too much self indugence and no quality control and I pretty much consigned it to dusty end of my cd rack. Now relistening to it I find myself somewhere inbetween both opinions. There is great quality here, but little quality control. For every good tracks theres two that are either bad or not really anything special.  <br /> <br />However that's just my opinion. The Wall is a very divisive album and most people will fall in to one of two camps of thought about it. Those who love it as Pink Floyd's dark masterpiece and those who deride it as being the worst of Roger Water's egomanical excess. Over time you might even find your self having belonged to both.
B000C4SHRW|5.0|I just finished the Abhorsen. What a wonderful read. The book picks right up from where Lirael left off. We find Lirael, Sam, the Disreputable Dog, and Mogget off on their quest to stop the Destroyer and all that stand with It. I went through the book wondering if Lirael would be able to handle being the Abhorsen in waiting, what the role of Wallmaker, for Sam, would be, who really was the Disreputable Dog and which side is Mogget really on? It was very fast paced and I could hardly put it down. Sad to see it end though.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|This movie is the most awesomely bad movie in history.  I've never laughed so hard before from a movie.  I was in so much pain because I could literally not stop laughing at how bad this movie is.  The dialog is awful, (need i repeat the 'Dilly Dally' line?), the action is so fast you can't tell what's going on, the voice acting is terrible, the plot is extremely silly.  Some might say that you can't understand the plot unless you beat the game, but unless the game explains why so many explosions can happen and not a single person gets a scratch, or how nobody's hair ever gets ruined by anything, (what ever gel they use is water, wind, flame, bomb, fighting, and even getting hit over the head resistant!).  Maybe the game will also explain why Tifa is so worthless.  She fights one time and loses, then she basically just stands their whenever something happens.  Also in one part, the city is being destroyed and she is cracking jokes to a little kid like as if nothing is happening.  Maybe the game will explain why when that monster is summoned and blows up half the city, nobody gets hurt, not even the regular people,  and then when it sees all the side fights happen, it takes a nap until they are all done before it starts destroying the city again.  Maybe the game will also explain how one of the character's glasses are bomb resistant but not step-on proof.  Or how one minute Cloud can't fly but the next minute he can.  Or how that water just happens to be under his house.  Or how everyone has so many expensive things even though they are in the middle of a great depression. Or maybe it explains how the dead girl can leave Cloud a message on his cell phone's answering machine.  Or maybe it explains why the bad guys have Britney Spears hair.  I'm not even going to start my rant on the whole 'Mother' situation.  The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because the graphics are amazing.  That's it.  Even if they made this movie about Final Fantasy X, which I beat both and love the characters, I would still be disappointed because the only utilized character in the movie is Cloud.  Everyone else just stands their.  If this was a FFX movie I would be mad because I hated Tidus and liked everyone else.  This movie is so awesomely bad that I could watch it over and over again.  Its just that bad.and love the characters, I would still be disappointed because the only utilized character in the movie is Cloud.  Everyone else just stands their.

B000BTJDGC|5.0|This film has two plotlines--horror/supernatural and reality-based courtroom drama.  On the surface, the two plotlines can only work against each other.  How can the supernatural coexist with the courtroom?  In contrary, this is the film's strength.  The courtroom drama anchors horror elements in \\"reality,\\" therefore adds depth to the film.  It intensifies the terror.  As a bonus, the film avoids being a clone of \\"Exorcist.\\"      The courtroom drama is well-thought out.  It touches upon some enduring issues:  Good vs. evil  Religious morality vs. Human laws  Medicine vs. Spirit  Doctor's obligation to treat vs. Patient's refusal of treatment  As one watches the movie, he/she is inadventently taking sides, as one of the 12 juries selected.    The two plotlines in one movies does have its drawbacks, resulting in some awkward or underdeveloped moments.  For an example, the story suggests that the defense lawyer (Laura Linney) is under demonic attack during the trial, which engenders her spiritual growth.  The subplot adds emotional weight to the story.  However, this suggests that demons are real. The film is taking side of the defense.      Despite this, the film is a resounding success.  Scary moments are painful to watch.  Sound effects are creepy.  The acting is superb.  It leaves viewers a lot to think about long after the credits.

Everything suddenly takes a U-turn, in a direction the Baudelaire's would never expect. Their mansion burns down, along with their loving parents. So Violet, Klaus and Sunny face a new adventure, an adventure of unpleasant hardships, with moving around to new \\"parents\\", encountering Count Olaf and his henchmen, and trying to stay alive with the rumours about the Baudelaires. <br />     This serie was the first series I have ever started. This series influenced me because it showed me perserverance. It showed me to never give up when the going gets tough. This series also let me have a habit of reading and curiosity. Having to always wonder what's going to happen in the book. Before I read this series, I thought it was going to be another boring and long story. But I was wrong. After I was done with the first three books...I couldn't stop. Learning new words, having a great imagination and having a love for reading. This series tells me all people have to perservere, because if you quit, you'll be lost in this crowded world of temtation. I also learned that we should not also worry about our self, but to worry about those that care for you. Help them in their time of need, as they did to you. And I learned that reading is fun. The style of this book is Adventurous and Humourous. I recommend this series to all. Have FUN! -Celestine Perez

1400062071|5.0|Elizabeth Strout's \\"Abide with Me\\" is the story of Tyler Caskey, a minister in the small town of West Annett, Maine, in 1959. Tyler had been married to Lauren, a flighty woman from a wealthy family who could not adjust to living on a tight budget and acting the part of a \\"minister's wife.\\" Lauren bore Tyler two daughters before she died, leaving the widower bewildered and shaken. Tyler's overbearing mother, Margaret, takes in his toddler, Jeannie, while Tyler tries to manage with five-year-old Katherine. He depends on his devoted housekeeper, Connie, to keep things afloat. However, since Lauren's death, Katherine has been nearly mute with grief and she has begun to act out in school. Although Tyler has always been a popular minister whose congregation admires his impassioned sermons, rumors begin to spread that he is not the man they thought he was. Soon, Tyler questions his vocation, and his faith in himself and the townspeople he has served so well starts to crumble.<br /><br />One of Strout's strengths is her attention to detail. She describes West Annett so vividly that the reader has a perfect mental picture of this place and its inhabitants. Strout depicts the bored housewives who have little to occupy their minds other than shopping, cooking, cleaning, charity work, and gossip. Tyler's job is a difficult one. He has to advise his congregants when they are in trouble, keep the church going on the limited funds that are available, and withstand the barbs of certain outspoken individuals who have their own agendas.<br /><br />The author's portrait of Tyler is magnificent. He is a gentle and highly intelligent man, whose idol is the great Protestant theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Bonhoeffer, who was born in 1906, defied the Nazis and gave up his life for his beliefs. Tyler constantly quotes Bonhoeffer and thinks about his teachings, especially the statement that \\"man's sin was flight from responsibility.\\" Tyler wants to take responsibility for his parish and for his family, but he lacks the joy and enthusiasm that used to propel him.<br /><br />\\"Abide with Me\\" is eloquent, literate, and filled with gorgeous imagery. It has the ring of truth. We are all imperfect human beings struggling to live with our frailties, to give and receive love, and to meet life's hardships and obstacles with as much grace as we can muster. However, at times, we fail and what should we do when we disappoint ourselves and others disappoint us? How can we go on when our religious faith falters? Strout provides no easy answers, but she makes the reader empathize with her flawed characters, and we inevitably see ourselves in them. Although the book takes place in the late fifties, when women were repressed, racism was rampant, and the various social classes were strictly stratified, there is a universality in this work that still makes it worth reading today.he lacks the joy and enthusiasm that used to propel him.     \\"Abide with Me\\" is eloquent, literate, and filled with gorgeous imagery.

Eadie asserts that all people may not come to know Christ as the savior in this life but that they \\"must\\" accept his love in the next.  The implications of a continued denial are not addressed (along with many other things she supposedly gained insight toward).  I don't necessarily disagree with or discount Ms. Eadie's account, I simply find it to be overtly biased.  Her explanation of our ability to reconnect with past lives with the usage of hypnosis is in a word, weak.  She explains it as \\"cell memory.\\"  This I've never debated but, she goes on to assert that reincarnation does not exist, which left me wondering just what are we remembering then.  She contradicts herself greatly here.<br /><br />I would never call Ms. Eadie a liar, I don't believe that at all.  What I do believe is that we all have our own Truths.  For Ms. Eadie, her core truth is that Jesus Christ is the \\"Lord and Savior\\" of this earth.  Perhaps this is why it was He who appeared to her on the Other Side.  Perhaps on the inverse Jews will be greeted by Abraham and Moses, and Muslims by their greatest prophet, Mohammed.  I also have a problem with Ms. Eadie's small punch at abortion, saying that it is \\"against natural law.\\"  Again, I respect all opinions and don't negate any, but this theory seems contrary to her general theme that we choose our lives and the time we spend on this earth.  Nothing happens without our having pre-mortal knowledge of it she argues.  Thus, does it not make sense that the life that is given up to abortion chose that path as well?  Perhaps in its sacrifice, the mother gains some knowledge or truth?  Also, I suspect Catholics and other non-Mormon Christian churches will not like Ms. Eadie's testament that Jesus and God are not one and that there is no Trinity.  Also, I'm not so sure about her recounting of demons visiting her in the nights following her return from heaven.  There's an over-emphasis on Satan in the memoir in my opinion.  At one point she recounts seeing \\"huge\\" angels clothed in armor and head gear and she knows that they're going to fight the demons of Hell.  This to me is where her upbringing takes flight.  I myself choose to believe that God and \\"the Devil\\" cannot coexist; that there is only God and He/She/It is utterly whole and all that this world needs.  Again, I discount nothing Ms. Eadie attains, I merely believe we must all reach our own truths regarding the Other Side, which I have no doubt exists and no doubt that it, and God, are pure love.  It's a nice book that I read in about three and half hours.  It preaches love and compassion, but then, we should already know that.moir in my opinion.

006092988X|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  I have loved it for 20+ years and read it more than 20 times.   Every time, it is as if I become a part of Francie.  She is a daughter, a niece, a younger sister, the neighbor, the friend....she is so real to me.  Look beyond the poverty to the wealth, beyond the filth to the clean heart, beyond the wrongness to all that turns out right, all because of Francie's strength of character.  This is a story that may be over 50 years old, but is just as new as if it were written yesterday.

B0000028M7|2.0|This album is a little more stripped down than the heavier sounding \\"Facelift\\". This pretty much was the serious groundbreaking album, but to me there's plenty of misses. Starting with \\"Them Bones\\" which talks about abusing heroin I think. If they did a grunge version of a dog food commercial that was popular at that time I would've liked it better after all it had the same title. Then it struggles through tracks 2 and 3 before it gets down to good stuff with \\"Down In A Hole\\", and after a forgettable track number 5 it goes into the worst track on the whole album which is \\"The Rooster\\". This was written by Jerry Cantrell in tribute of his father who fought in the Veitnam war, and his nickname was \\"The Rooster\\". This cuts me to the core as the song is depressing even to the bones, and mostly becasue I have so many questions about the Veitnam war, and the top one was \\"Why?\\" I know I was told it was supposed to stop the spread of communism, but I want to know did it succeed? I found this to be a very disruptive war as I hear stories of families being split apart through divorce, and men coming home to physical ailments, mental ailments, and social ailments as they didn't come back home the same as flashbacks began to invade, and terrorize them, and the country I wonder why they didn't honor those who were over there, and I don't want to say we lost, but I can't say we won either. I only know depending on how you look at this if you want to say for family values sake it was a loss, for patriotism it was a loss, and while communism is still a force in America it's not widespread, so if there was a victory then I guess that's where it may lie. I guess I feel all the depression on this song because I was born in the thick of this, and hearing my parents talk about it I have so many questions that I wonder if they will ever be answered to my satisfaction. I know I've endured 2 major wars in my adulthood which was the Gulf War, and The War on Terrorism, and while I feel the Gulf War didn't last long enough the war on Terrorism has been going on now into it's 3rd year, and I wonder how much longer? That's why I cite this as the worst track on this album. Side 2 is pretty much a lost cause except for the last 2 songs which are: \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Would?\\".ulf War didn't last long enough the war on Terrorism has been going on now into it's 3rd year, and I wonder how much longer?

B00005JOML|5.0|I just got back about an hour ago from seeing the movie and actually I would rate it 4 1/2 rather than five but still, I can't get why so many people seem to hate it. I think you get a bang for your buck! The story isn't complicated nor confusing - I found it exciting / entertaing as a thriller of this genre should be - the film shots are great - and I found it well acted both by Farren and Foxx and even Gong Li. It was kinda cool to have an asian represent a south american drug ring... <br /> <br />It's not deep in the way say \\"the Hours\\" was, but definitely full of action and cool in it's devices. I think Michael Mann just delivered once again! <br /> <br />My recommendation: Go see it!

B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is undoubtedly a masterpiece. The sheer musical quality of this album is amazing, and after you listen to this album it will definitely change your life. The lyrics are alternately brash and painful; the music is sometimes haunting and sometimes takes on a more clearly defined pop music edge. The album contains several songs which have become anthems of the past three decades, including Another Brick In The Wall, Hey You and Comfortably Numb. The album also stands out for the sheer variety of sound effects used in its making, including planes, a school choir, televisions, films, synthesised effects and accompaniments to songs. The work was probably Pink Floyd's last truly great work before Roger Waters left. This album is definitely worth having, and will become a staple of your music collection.
0375423877|3.0|This is the first book in Alexander McCall Smith's extraodinary series, the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency in which Precious ramotswe sets up her detective agency using the inheritance from her adored father. While the subsequent books in this series, I feel, are lighter and perhaps deal with less weighty themes, this first book has some very unpleasant issues in the story lines. Ones I found personally depressing, but also felt leant a note of pathos and depression to the story. <br /> <br />The classic episodic writing smith uses is perfect for this type of book. Each Chapter deals with a case, or part of a case. It reminds me of Dickens writing which he used to publish week by week in the papers. I think Smith has published some of his writing like this. The writing is personal and Precious Ramotswe is a fully rounded character - the language is gorgeous too. The syntax and vocabulary is so reminiscent of the Africa and Botswana. <br /> <br />However as I said, I found the themes mostly disturbing - while some cases were small and their resolution simple (wayward daughter of an Indian businessman, Philandering husband, and putative father) the background to Precious Ramotswe's short marriage to the Note and the death of her child I found devastating. It was simply written, but very bleak and felt out of character to what was relatively light. The other dark theme was Muti - that is murder of children for witch-doctor medicine. It was grim. And Precious reflects on this herself at times that life is a cycle but it does not mean you have to ignore things which are not right. <br /> <br />Precious is honest, reflective and decent - even if she is unorthodox. I felt the later books in the series allow her to be happy as well as a fully rounded person. In this I felt too much pain for her.  <br /> <br />Personally I wouldn't recommend starting the series of No. 1 Detective Agency books with this one, even though it is the first. The rest of the series is much more enjoyable, come back to the first book once you love the characters.
B000E6UWE4|2.0|THE GOOD:  The only thing I can say good about this book is that I didn't - no, more accurately COULDN'T finish it.  Actually, that is unfair.  The writer does actually have a good writing style, I can't take that away from him. <br /> <br />THE BAD:  Even though the  writing style was good, I felt there were some scenes that, maybe I missed or read wrong, but as each scene ended I was left thinking, \\"What just happened?\\" I felt that some parts could have been written a little better.  But let me get to the reason why this is a 2 star rating... <br /> <br />THE UGLY:  There is nothing worse than sitting down with a book, hoping to submerge yourself in this new world, only to find that you can't for some reason or another.  Be it writing, maybe you don't like the story, or in this case, you can't figure out what the story is.  Erikson writes this book as if the reader already knows the world and characters involved.  He does not take time to explain things which drastically reduced importance of specific events.  There were times when characters are talking about people or events that have passed and I was lost because I didn't know why those were important.  I spent so much time trying to figure out what was going on, and only being mildly intersted in the characters, that I just never really got into this book - and I tried.  But reading it was an exercise in frustration because chapter after chapter just led me to more disappointment.  I waited for some string with which I could tie everything together but I never found it.  Finally I had enough and tossed the book into the fire...well, not the fire but the book shelf next to the fire.  Anyway, there are so many other fantasy novels out there that confusing yourself with this is not necessary.  In a series that is going to be drawn out like this one boasts it is going to be, why not take the time and break things down for the reader.  Oh yeah, and it does offer a snapshot of players and places in the front and back of the book.  But those introductions are so limited in information that it doesn't really tell you anything.  An example of this is:  Squint - a bowman.  Pearl - a claw.  That really doesn't tell me anything. <br /> <br />Ubermonkey says when you see this on the shelf, leave it there.  You don't need this kind of frustration in your life.
0743424425|5.0|I read this book in 1 day, which is a testament to how great this book is--considering its length.  This is the best Stephen King book I've ever read.  The story centers on recovering alcoholic Jack Torance, who becomes the winter caretaker of an isolated, snowed-in hotel in Colorado.  Soon, his young son begins to channel (\\"shine\\") some of the ghosts who died in the hotel (a mob boss' killers, a woman who killed herself in a bathtub).  Jack slowly begins to lose his mind, and terror ensues. <br /> <br />King successfully gets the reader inside the mind of Jack Torance as he slowly and believeably begins to lose his mind (something that the Kubrick movie missed).  The book is terrifying, smart, and a can't-put-the-book-down read. <br /> <br />The book was made into 2 movies--the Stanley Kubrick movie and the Stephen King TV miniseries.  The Kubrick movie is pretty good and scary even if it strays from the book.  The TV miniseries is much more faithful to the book and is a good TV miniseries, but it is nothing special.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Released in 1976 after the enormously successful Physical Graffiti, it is no surprise that Presence would struggle to meet the praise of it's legendary predecessor.  Closed minds and ears are to blame for Presence's status as an 'average' album; there are some who agree that Presence is very underated, I am one of them.  However, unlike those diehards who say \\"an average Led Zeppelin album is another artists best\\", I believe that Presence is by far Led Zeppelin's best album.<br />Some of you are thinking: \\"Is this guy high or what?\\" let me say a few things in my defense: a)I went through rehab three years ago, so I take offense to such a comment and you hurt my feelings with your thought  b)I take that back, I am high....ON LIFE! c)an album's greatness is not determined by how much it sells or how many people say it is great and if the critics give it good ratings.  Do You have any idea what Rolling Stone magazine gave Led Zeppelin's first album when it first came out? 3/5 chance they slandered it, just like every other great band!<br />Greatness should be determined not by status, but by the music itself: the sound, the energy, the chemistry, and the focus put in it.  This album is kind of like Fair Warning by Van Halen, didn't sell as much as all of the albums before it but the overall musical output is just that much better, because they didn't make music just to make sales, they made it because they loved it, they cherished it, and couldn't stand to stop making the music; they made music for music's sake.<br /><br />The main reason I like this album more than the other studio Led Zeppelin albums is simple, because it is louder and doesn't have the weird 'variety' sound found on other Zeppelin albums.  THis is the way Led Zeppelin was meant to be heard, not as folk music acoustic playing junkies who rip off Willie Dixon covers!  Heavy rock is the arena that is Led Zeppelin sound, not weird Middle Eastern sounding harps playing in the background.  Also, there are no acoustic tracks (thank goodness, if I heard one more Led Zeppelin album with two or more acoustic tracks, I would bludgeon myself with a bedpan!) and keyboards (which would return in extremely heavy use on their next album \\"In Through the Outdoor\\")<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />1.Achilles Last Stand (10:22): A fast paced epic opens up the album with some of the most amazing classic rock riffs I ever heard.  I think this is the same riff that Jake E Lee would use in \\"Bark at the Moon\\", only much faster and alot more chord changes.  I don't understand a single word that Robert Plant says, so I have no idea what it is about, BUT IT JUMPS OVER \\"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN\\" AND \\"KASHMIR\\"!  Even Jimmy Page himself has stated that \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is his favorite Led Zeppelin song.<br />2.For Your Life (6:20): Another hard rocker track, kind of sounds a little too much like a Who song; but I can actually understand what Plant is saying in this song as opposed to the prementioned track.  It is about getting rid of addiction in exchange \\"For Your Life\\".<br />3.Royal Orleans (2:58): The usual short track from Zeppelin that seems longer than it really is!  Sounds like the name of a hotel, the only real notable sound in this song is John Bonham's drumming.<br />4.Nobody's Fault but Mine (6:27): Once again Jimmy Page is too lazy to give credit where credit is due.  Originally a Blind Willie Johnson song, although it is only listed as having been written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.  And people wonder why I don't praise the crap out of Led Zeppelin!  I am a little disappointed that Led Zeppelin had to put a cover song on here, but it was a pretty good one, just ticked off that Page was too high to note his sources.<br />5.Candy Store Rock (4:07):Lyrics sound raunchy and so does the overall sound, reminds me of early Ted Nugent.<br />6.Hot on For Nowhere (4:43):I Don't remember exactly how this song goes, but it was pretty good.  Had a funk element that rocked, and had some ofthe same raunchy lyrics as \\"Candy Store Rock\\".<br />7.Tea for One (9:27):A return back to the blues element, another classic epic.<br /><br />Amazing how they made a better album when they were rushed.  Robert Plant was injured during this time too, which is even more impressive (although it was just his leg).7.Tea for One (9:27):A return back to the blues element, another classic epic.

0792165020|5.0|This is one of the best thrillers in recent years.  The story centers on Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who comes to Italy to befriend Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and persuade him to come back to the U.S. (at the wishes of Greenleaf's father).  Soon, Ripley becomes immersed in Greenleaf's style and doesn't want to leave.  Identity swapping, lying, and murder ensue. <br /> <br />What's great about the movie is how you identify with Tom Ripley even as he does many evil things.  The story also highlights great truths about social class, gender, and identity. <br /> <br />The cast is exceptional--Matt Damon and Jude Law are the best.  And the look of the film is wonderful.  If you buy/rent the DVD, be sure to check out the commentary by director Anthony Minghella, which is like a film class.  Minghella highlights how he uses performances, shots, music, editing, and backgrounds to highlight the many themes in the movie.
0792841344|5.0|Phasntasm, a little-known (outside of fans) horror fasntasy from 1979 is, simply stated, one of the most effective, atmospheric and genuinely scary movies to come out in a long long time.  Even after 27 years, it still holds up as a truly unsettling and thoughtful horror movie and, believe me, it WILL scare the bejesus out of you.  The thing I remember most about Phantasm was the normal, suburban culdesac surroundings where the film takes place.  I swear, it will remind you of the neighborhood you grew up in.  If you thought Spielberg's Americana neighborhoods seem real, wait til you check out the settings here.  The fact that the 2 boys live alone in this big Brady Bunch-type house makes the whole thing kind of dreamlike.  (Their parents died recently with little explanation). The acting is spot-on.  The guy that plays the little brother is completely realistic.  You will swear you know this kid!  Likewise his cool brother and Reggie the ice cream man.  These 3 genuinely seem like they have been friends for years. The acting seems very spontaneous and natural.  You totally buy into these characters. <br /> <br />Basically, Phantasm is a series of increasingly bizarre events surrounding the local funeral home.  You can get plot details from other reviews, but for me the power of this film is in the way it gradually builds dread and suspense.  It is obvious that it was made on a shoe-string budget but that only adds to the realism and charm.  There is one scene with a fortune teller that doesn't seem to make much sense but it is totally creepy and very unsettling.  Is the lady even alive?  And what's the story with the black box?  The viewer is left to decide but these moments only ratchet up the unnerving dreamlike quality that permeates the whole movie. <br /> <br />Personally, I think the FX stand the test of the time (the insect monster in the kitchen notwithstanding.)  Remember, this movie is pre-CGI and the effects are all animatronics and  makeup.  And the infamous silver sphere scene is, to this day, one of the most original, horrific and effective scare moments ever to come out of late twentiweth century American horror. Just watch it with somebody who has never seen it and watch them cringe. <br /> <br />All in all, a great little horror flick that positively exudes atmosphere and foreboding.  You can almost cut the dread with a knife. I compare it to Argento's Suspiria, Carpenter's The Thing and Craven's original Nightmare on Elm Street in its ability to just make you feel anxious and uneasy. <br /> <br />DVD comes with excellent commentary tracks (amazing input from director Don Coscarelli on how he got certain things done) and some cool deleted scenes.  HIGHLY recommended for any horror movie fan or just someone who likes being scared by a great movie! <br /> <br />

B00005JNRY|4.0|The courtship between the Walt Disney Corporation and Pixar Animation Studios has been at best a tumultuous one to say the least about it. Former-Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner deserves most of the blame however. He and Steve Jobs, Chairman/CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, were at each other's throats throughout their nearly decade long partnership together. Even after the astonishing break-out success of honorary Oscar recipient Toy Story in 1995, Eisner had yet to be convinced of Pixar's potential. Rather then buy Pixar straight-out, which would have been the smart and economically efficient thing to do, Disney instead negotiated to extend their three-picture distribution deal to five movies. Things became even direr after Disney theatrically released Toy Story 2 in 1999 which had been originally produced with the intention of it premiering direct-to-video. Pixar believed it should count as part of their five-picture deal with Disney but Eisner argued that it was negotiated outside of their contract and did not count. Disney's efforts to (no pun intended) drown Finding Nemo in the midst of the summer season, which failed miserably as it went on to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, surpassing The Lion King, further emboldened Jobs to seek a corporate divorce, if only to rid himself of Michael Eisner. Disaster was averted however when Michael Eisner chose, forcefully or not, to step down from his position aboard the Walt Disney Company allowing his replacement, Robert Iger, to woe Pixar back to Disney. With Eisner now out of the picture, Jobs, with no contention against the Disney Corporation anymore, agreed to sell the animation giant to the company for seven-billion dollars, far more then it would have been had Eisner chosen to buy them out ten years ago. <br /> <br />The story for Cars can easily be identified as the source of the movie's problems but precisely pinpointing the exact cause is a bit more difficult. While there is nothing particularly wrong with it per say - it is sweet and well meaning - it comes off as being far too generic. This is the exact same predicament the Brad Bird directed Pixar project, The Incredibles, was faced with two years ago. However, The Incredibles was in the end still able to be overtly entertaining in spite of this tremendous handicap. Cars, on the other hand, is not nearly as successful as its predecessor was. Time is not a factor, at least not on its face. Cars' one-hundred and fourteen minute time-length is on par with the running time for The Incredibles and yet Cars is the one that feels more drawn out. Lightning's trip to California, for example. While it does successfully `show off' Pixar's artistic prowess (emphasis added), it does nothing to better accommodate the flow of the story. Instead it smacks of pride and daresay smugness on the part of Pixar Animation and should have been shortened down. Even Lightning's community service sentence in Radiator Springs feels force fed. That said however Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway' is put to expedient use in this scene. And then unlike past Pixar films there is no distinctive villain to help chart the path of the film's protagonist. But then again this fails to explain Finding Nemo's success in terms of plot and character development. Regardless of what the true source of the problems is, Cars in spite of foreseeable plot devices still remains a cut above the rest of the mainstream box office. <br /> <br />The decision to cast comedic-actor Owen Wilson as the lead in Disney/Pixar's Cars did not bring quite the level of anticipation or enthusiasm as Craig T. Nelson for The Incredibles or Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo had in their respected roles. In spite of his fairly consistent appearance in such artistic independent films as The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums for director Wes Anderson, Wilson is judged mostly on his more frequent appearance in low-level comedies like Shanghai Knights, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Wedding Crashers which make the choice to cast him as the lead in a Pixar film a bit odd. Slowly but surely Wilson proves he is up to the challenge. Furthermore, there is more to the character makeup of Lightening McQueen then what lies on the surface. French political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous political analysis Democracy in America warned of the greatest threat facing the newborn nation America and its principles of liberty, freedom and democracy - individualism. Not the rugged individualism which vastly shaped this nation's western frontier throughout the 1800s but rather the individualism which leads people only to think of themselves and withdraw further from the community at large. It is the kind of `no-fault freedom' Senator Rick Santorum describes in his book It Takes a Family as the ability to \\"check out from the pursuit of the common good and to do what feels right for me, without regard to those around me\\". It is a bit of stretch, true, to go from discussing high-level political-science canon to a children's film about a world entirely inhabited by living, breathing cars. Regardless, the basic principle remains the same. Younger children will likely not pick up on the social-political implications of the message this film expresses just yet, maybe a few years down the road - if they are being educated properly, but adults will. Their embrace of the film and its message will make all the difference. <br /> <br />Cars will likely be one of the last, if not THE last, films for fellow car enthusiast and acting legend Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). He definitely goes out in style as the abrupt doctor of a simple town who hides a secret past. Say what you want about Larry the Cable Guy, even ardent fans would agree that his feature film debut, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, was a bit of an embarrassment, but there's no denying the fact that he steals theshow with his hick antics as Mater which is just like \\"tuh-mater, but without the `tuh'\\". <br /> <br />Few will likely notice without examining the cast list first that Michael Keaton (Batman, Mr. Mom, White Noise, Herbie: Fully Loaded, etc.) is the voice of the quasi-villain, or as close to a villain as the film gets, Chick Hicks. Kudos both to the casting director and especially to Keaton himself who disguises his voice brilliantly in order to create a rather suspicious character. <br /> <br />And hearing Formula One-winner Michael Schumacher as well as NASCAR legends Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Darrell Waltrip, and Richard Petty, along with his wife, Lynda, provide the voices of their motor-vehicle counterparts in the film is definitely a surprising added bonus. Even car enthusiast/late-night talk-show host Jay Leno gets in on the act making a very brief cameo as Jay Limo early in the movie. <br /> <br />Overall, Cars, the seventh computer-animated project from the creative and talented folks at Pixar Animation Studios, not to mention their very last film before the Disney buyout, is sadly their worst to date. This is more of an insult to the movie industry overall however. Even on their worst day Pixar still manages to produce a product that is superior then the majority of what is out in the market right now - animated or otherwise. Optimistically, it's about average. While some pessimists will be quick to label Cars as a step backward for the company and ultimately a failure, alternatively it can be said that director John Lassester, intentionally or not, successfully reintroduces the basic storytelling principles and heart which he himself installed in the company with Toy Story and A Bug's Life in 1995 and 1998 respectively as it makes the transition from an independent entity into another cog in the Disney machine. It is difficult to pin down precisely what is wrong with this film. For one it felt as the though the level of anticipation for this film was no where near as high as it should have been for a Pixar release in summer when everyone is out of school. Marketing may be to blame for dropping the ball on this one, at least in part. Cars was sold too much to the male-driven (no pun intended) NASCAR crowd that it practically alienated the female demographic. That said however it is not entirely marketing's fault. While it is not beyond reason to believe that children or even some adults for that matter may wonder what toys do when humans are not around or whether fish and bugs talk, it is quite a stretch to believe that someone out there truly wants to know what the world would be like if it was entirely inhabited by cars. And unlike fish, toys, monsters, and, yes, even bugs, cars are just not cuddly. It is therefore practically impossible to sell a love story to young girls when it is between two cold pieces of metal, essentially. In addition there is nothing in Cars - visually or otherwise - that really sticks out in your mind when you leave the theatre. Sure, the scene with Mater and Lighting sneaking into the field to go `tractor tipping' is cute and all but it's nothing compared to the scene in Finding Nemo with Dory speaking whale or Mike and Sulley `practicing' for the company musical called `Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me' from Monsters, Inc. Not to be so negative about Cars, there are some bright spots. Randy Newman returns to Pixar in top form with an incredible accompanying musical score. And the soundtrack to the film has to be one of the best in the studios' history. It features excellent new additions like Sheryl Crow's `Real Gone' and `Find Yourself' from country artist Brad Paisley as well as some classic tunes like `Route 66' performed by Chuck Berry and Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway'. Cars is no where near the disaster some had predicted it would be but neither is it the best we could have hoped for.

0618164413|4.0|I bought this book for my three year old daughter because she loves Curious George. It is a good book, but the stories are a little long, longer than the other stories of George that we're used to. Overall, it was a good purchase though.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Disappointing horror movie that lacks the scares and the tension and inserts a sense of humor that falls flat most of the time. Keanu Reeves is miscast as the hard-boiled Detective John Constantine and his acting is really laughable and down right bad. A better actor could have pulled off the role but the script is a mess in terms of it's narrative and certain things just don't gel in logic and common sense. His co-star Rachel Weisz gives a better performance and is one of the few good things that this movie has to offer. Her performance is much better than the film and she deserves better than the horrible script she has to work with. Djimon Hounsou is ok but under used, Shia LaBeouf, don't asked and Peter Stormare is fine for the five minutes his on screen but he does over do it a bit with his role. The special effects are fine but not earth shattering and it could have been better.  <br /> <br />See it if you have nothing to do. <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|...however I'm still (and probably hopelessly) waiting also for \\"Delicate sound of thunder\\" to appear on DVD... :) <br /> <br />But talk about \\"Pulse\\" is all done, all words have been said about that concert and the only thing what has been left, is to watch and listen the masters of rock.
B000G75AE8|5.0|I swear, somebody has been chipping these guys out of ice every few years so they can make an album and then they just freeze them back up so they can do it again in a few years.  Slayer has basically sounded like the exact same band for twenty years.  These guys make the same music every time out and every time it is freaking sweet.  They don't make mistakes like most bands who try to \\"expand their sound\\" or \\"mature\\".  When a band says that they have \\"made their most mature album to date\\", it means that they know it sucks.  Slayer doesn't mess with that.  They play thrash metal like it should be done and thats why they are the greatest metal band on earth.<br /><br />So now to the new album:  'Christ Illusion' is yet another example of what a quality metal album should be.  I would say that soundwise it is somewhere between 'Diabolus in Musica' and 'God Hates Us All'.  Its thrashy like 'GHUA' yet retains the groove that they had on 'DIM'.  It rips, it roars, its got awesome solo work, the riffs are brutal, the drumming is tight, the lyrics are great, and Tom's voice sounds really, really good.  While all the tracks are good, the standout tracks, in my opinion, are:  \\"Jihad\\"(which has quickly become one of my all-time favorite Slayer tracks), \\"Cult\\", \\"Flesh Storm\\", and \\"Consfearacy\\".<br /><br />From front to back, 'Christ Illusion' is yet another masterpiece unleashed on the world by Slayer.  All the members may be 40+ years old, but they are still delivering more brutal music than guys half their age.  Heck, they are still delivering more brutal music than just about any band working today.  These guys are legends for a reason and they don't seem to be slowing down at all.  Pure awesomeness.  Go buy it right now.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Was anyone else annoyed with the \\"American-teenager\\" accent and colloquialisms that Tom Hulce used in this movie? I remember watching the original theater-released version in 1984 and being so distracted by his portrayal of Mozart that it made it hard to really fully appreciate this movie. I still can't understand why he got an Oscar nomination.    F. Murray Abraham, however, really put his heart into the role, and the movie shines mostly because of his acting. The music brings me to tears each time I've watched it. This version, the \\"Director's Cut,\\" adds a new dimension to Salieri's supposedly hateful psyche, which I found stunning.     One thing that really bothers me is that the movie is totally fictionalized. It really plays on rumors going around following Mozart's death that Salieri had a hand in it, or that they even had an antagonistic relationship. Salieri was anything but \\"mediocre.\\" In real life he was the teacher of such greats as Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt, as well as having taught music to Mozart's son. If you research Salieri on the Web, you'll see how maligned his name has become as a result of this movie. Knowing that has sort of tarnished this beautifully-crafted movie for me. It just doesn't seem fair to ruin the man's name for the sake of artistic license.
B000002LFU|2.0|This sounds a lot like 'Out of time', but not quite as good in some  respects. 'Pop song 89' is a perfect opening to the album, it moves along nicely and is pretty catchy. Other highlights include 'World Leader Pretend', with nice percussion and steel guitars.  <br />There are three acoustic songs which began kind of a theme on the next couple of albums. 'You are the everything' to me has absolutely no melody and moves along rather boringly. 'The wrong child' attempts to utilise harmony vocals. They are completely out of key with each other. Another poor effort. The high 'OKAYYYY' parts are unbelievably out of tune. 'Hairshirt' is third cut in the same vein as the previous two. Same chordal structure without much melody going on anywhere. Clearly, the ballads needed to be perfected. <br />'Orange Crush' is a more catchy tune. Mike Mills can also be heard in the chorus and, at the risk of sounding controversial, he actually has a better voice. Much purer. Why he did not sing any lead until the next album, is just unbelievable. Probably the strongest track. <br />The best way of summing up this album is that it consists of three types of songs... <br />1) The Pop songs - Pop song 89 (good), Get up (ok), Stand (rubbish), The bonus cut (ok and catchy) <br />2) The ballads - Mentioned above, all rubbish. <br />3) The rock songs - World leader Pretend (good - toes line of being a ballad also), I remember California (grundgy, not too bad), Orange Crush (very good), Turn you inside out (rubbish)
B0006SSOHC|5.0|The movie overall is fabulous due to the plot and how the all the main characters are inter connected and how lawrence and adam continue decieving one another as the movie progresses. Although, you dont see any one in the act of getting stabbed when ever friday the 13th has that, but in this movie blood just squirts up and its the same ways when lawrence saws off his leg. So if you only like horror for blood and gore id reccomend the uncut version or another movie, but if you're like me then you can like a movie simply for its plot and characters
B000002IO1|5.0|Allanah Myles debut from 1989,is the real thing when it come`s to raaaaw female power rock, with light touches of heavy metal and blues riffs here and there. Oh yes, this is riffy and raffy in a very positive sense.  In other words quality shines from beginning to end . Track 1 Still got this thing, With it`s fuzzy guitar riffs in the background, the song sets immediate the quality standard . She has an unpolished voice which fits this kind of music. It`s compact and quite stylish. She roars like a rock scream queen, but never ever a false note. Track 2 Love is, is more into \\"funky\\" land, but with a bumble bass in the background , the heavy metal touches  is still intact. Track 3 Black Vevet is the best of the best. It was a great hit song back then, and still hits the mark. The bumble bass and the ready steady drum beat in the background still has the power to make the day for the one who looks for a great time. It`s very well driven, and moves you all over. Trembling good rock and roll. Track 4 Rock this joint, is more into funky territory<br /><br />of the Myles`es musical landscape, but certainly has the power to move you soul into happiness. Track 5 Lover of mine, is the first ballad on the album, that shows a more \\"soft singing\\" voice of Alannha that fits the song perfect. Track 6 Kick start my heart is more back to heavy metal land, with touches of the<br /><br />synth soundpicture from the 80 ths. Track 7 If you want to , has even more touches from the 80 ths. The mood is light and positive. Track 8 Just one Kiss, has also synth at the refrain, but the  rest is more into light heavy metal landscape. Sounds ok,but nothing extraordinary. Track 9 Who loves you is the second ballad, and shows a more softspoken and atmospheric side of Myles, until the refrain, when Myles is back in to roaring action once again. Track 10  Hurry make love, is a clever little blues acoustic gem, that makes it. Yees Allanha Myles still got this thing after all this years.
B000068OCS|5.0|I've been a great fan of this totally unique movie for years. It's like nothing you've ever seen. No actors, no script, no dialogue! Just brilliant, dramatic cinematography with a groundbreaking soundtrack to match. I showed this film to my daughters before they even attended Kindergarten and they have remained big fans now that they are college age. <br />What I love is the irony at work here. The filmakers attempted to draw a comparison between the natural and man-made world with the usual heavy handed Al Goreish leftist slant: Nature-good, mankind-bad! Open space-good, making products people want-bad! Mountains-good, cities-VERY BAD! <br />What happens, though is the opposite effect whether they intended it or not: beautiful rhythms and patterns are repeated not only in nature but also in industry! Time elapse photography will have you marveling at the graceful flow of such seemingly mundane scenes as thousands of people exiting Grand Central. It almost defies description. Have a look for yourself. <br />Highly recommended. A classic.
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|This film was based on a graphic novel (comic book) of the same name from the eighties. Apparently the brothers didn't feel the need to \\"dress-it-up\\" a little for the big screen. The whole movie ends up feeling like, well, a comic book. But not in a cool Matrix or Underworld kind of way, where you have characters that are so far removed from reality. Just in a kind of cheesy, one dimensional way. <br /> <br />It was hard to take this film seriously with its clichéd version of the big, evil government run amok. The big brother menace that was scary 2 decades ago feels fairly dated here. Due in part to lack of realism in the set decoration as well as the portrayal of the periods technology. I just can't buy that in an age of movies-on-demand, Tivo, pay-per-view, and hundreds of satellite and cable channels at our disposal, society progresses into a group of sheep-like morons that believe everything that is fed to them from the ominous government via one single TV station. Where is the internet? Once again, the graphic novel is now dated in its ideas and the movie makes no attempt to adapt to the ideology of the present day. This only works when filming period pieces. <br /> <br />This movie would have worked very well in the early eighties. It's just hard to swallow in today's world. <br />The acting was decent but shouldn't we expect that? No award winning performances. <br /> <br />All-in-all? Nothing special. The whole project felt like a big inside joke. To elaborate; I'm sure this was something dear to the Warchowski Brother's hearts and I'm sure all their nerdy friends who loved the graphic novel thought this was a great idea. However, it should have been updated, expanded upon and modernized to entertain the people who paid to see it but didn't already have fond teenage memories of the once groundbreaking comic.  <br />Let's hope that the brothers have another Matrix-sized hit with their next project. <br /> <br />
B0000CAQ27|4.0|I actually liked 'Try This.' I really can't tell you what those immature children are talking about when they start referring to monkeys when describing this album. The album wasn't the best, nor the worst I've ever heard by P!nk. All-in-all, I found that buying the cd/dvd combo was a good choice. The explicit version of the cd has a secret song called \\"Hooker\\" about a minute after \\"Love Song\\".  Also, the dvd has the 'Trouble' music video, behind the scenes footage, an interview with P!nk and an interactive lyrics menu.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I cannot understand why it was dismissed by critics.  A lot of the comedy is slapstick, with collapsing stairs, flying Perdue chickens and \\"weak\\" trees.  But in the context of rehabilitating the house, they can get away with it.   This is a truly funny movie with none of the grossness that usually passes for comedy in Hollywood.  And it is a must see for anybody who has ever rennovated a house.  We are currently remodeling our home and use terms from the movie all the time from the \\"Shirk Brothers\\" to \\"anybody call a plumber?\\"
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|I was a little hesitant in buying this album, even though there were so many good reviews. I just had a bad feeling. However, I am sitting here now feeling like a fool because this album is great. There were some songs that I didn't like (Creek Mary's Blood got old really quickly). Nonetheless, I am happy with it and now have a new band to enjoy.
B0000CDL93|1.0|Think of this, I am Garrison, in this movie played by Kevin Costner, and my hero JFK has been shot, so what do I do?  In my position as a prosicutor I go on a fanciful investigation of this horrible murder of a much beloved president, in which I find no real evidence but, prosicute someone anyway.  And then, at the end I run into this guy on the mall in Washington who no one else sees, says he is one of \\"THEM\\", wears a dark suit and confirms absolutely everything I already knew but couldn't proove.  Thats It I prooved it you must now beleive me!  I am now smarter than the Warren Commision.  Sorry for the sarcasam, the only thing that can be considered of any historical merit in this movie is the wonderful example of conspiricy theory mythology, which not only exists, but is held very sacred by some.
B000687M48|5.0|There is no question when I tell you that Amy rocks out loud live! She definately knows how to work the crowd. During her performance, she and the rest of the band do a KoRn cover of \\"Thoughtless\\" (which I LOVE) and also perform two other songs not found on the U.S. version of 'Fallen' including Breathe No More (from Elektra soundtrack) and Farther Away (from the Bring Me to Life Single and/or Jap. version of Fallen) Of course, any true Ev fan would already know all of that info. The dvd includes the entire live performance, all the music vids from Fallen, and some behind the scenes footage of the whole band. (Some of it is really funny) A great buy.
B00009W2GQ|2.0|I see no real point in jumping on the whole Matrix-sequels-bashing bandwagon, per se. Sure, it would be oh, so easy to do so, however, I feel that the sequels themselves do a far better job of cannabilising themselves without needing my help.  <br />Instead, I have chosen to limit my review to one aspect of REVOLUTIONS which I feel completely undermines the entirety of the (so-called) trilogy. Namely, the death of Trinity. <br />Sure, tragedy makes for great drama and what can be more tragic than the death of a main character? However, keeping in mind that the Wachowskis emphasised that RELOADED & REVOLUTIONS were in fact a single story/script that they chose to cut into two (Which in itself begs the question, does that mean there's still one remaining Matrix film left to be made? MATRIX RESUSCITATED, perhaps?), well, in killing off Trinity, the Wachowskis made damn sure that the whole dramatic thrust of RELOADED - namely, Neo dreaming of Trinity's demise and trying to prevent it from happening was really just a pointless exercise in wasting the audiences sweet time. And you can read into Trinity's (and Neo's for that matter) demise as much hidden meaning as you like. It still ranks as stupid! Which, ultimately, is all that the Matrix films really are. No amount of faux philosophical rambling (it's called HYPE, people!) can ever disguise the truth (or is that Truth?) - namely, if it smells like, looks like, feels like a turd, you don't have to swallow any coloured pill to make up your mind that it is, in fact, a TURD. You have all been warned. Oh, and steer well clear of chat-rooms inhabitted by sleazes signing on as Morpheus. There ARE laws against that kind of behaviour, you know! <br />Oh, and if you ever feel like watching films that are the real deal (ie: intellectually stimulating and mind bending) I recommend VIDEODROME and EXISTENZ, both great films from David Cronenberg.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've been waiting for a decent rock band to listen to and then came Evanescence. WOW. It was like nothing I have ever listened to before. Their music is enjoyable because you can tell that the lyrics came from their heart. In 'Hello' (the song Amy did as tribute to the death of her sister), you can hear the sadness in her voice. (Also notice that she's never performed 'Hello' live... bummer.) Also, those of you who HATE and LOATHE Evanescence for one reason or another hear this: GET A LIFE. If you hate them so much, then why do continue to 'waste' your life concentrating on them? Personally, I think your 'friends' hate them and you're just a stereotypical follower.
B000005QH3|1.0|My friends and I went to see this when it first came out in 1971 we alwayse wondered why there was never a movie that was one big chase. Vanishing point demonstrated why. This movie is absent of plot, substance and acting. When we saw this in the theatre the only high speed chase was to see which audiance member could get out of the theatre first. My only hope is that at last big firey crash that the script was tied to the front bumper. I like Barry Neuman and I will one day forgive him for being in this movie.I hate to waste a whole star on this movies rating but they wont let me give it a half. <br />
B000EGCIU0|5.0|The other reviews saying that this is one of the best CD's of P!nk's career weren't kidding. This album is my favorite and the dvd extras on the dual disc were awesome, too. If you are looking for something new and also like a variety of music, this is for you.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|\\"Dreams,\\" by Akira Kurosawa is a beautiful and breathtaking tapestry of cinematic expression. These are Kurosawa's dreams, and what he believed were the problems facing man and his environment. I was lucky enough to watch this remarkable film at a theater many years ago in Los Angeles, shortly after its release. I was so impressed with the visuals in the film that they stayed with me for days. Weeks even! If you have not seen this great work of art, I would highly recommend you do. I have always found this film to be one of the most beautiful films in cinema. There are many visually stunning films around, but this film is in a league of its own. The colors are so impressive, one could easily call it a 'painting on screen.' I also hope that some day CRITERION will take this film and give their touch. Not that I am complaining with the present DVD. However, the film does deserve better, and would benefit from that magnificent CRITERION touch that it so rightfully deserves.<br /><br />There are 8 episodes [vignettes] in this Kurosawa cinematic delight. Each are great in its own way. Moreover, they are ALL visually stunning and beautiful. Each have a story, yet all overlap with each other to some degree, and deal with mans disharmony with nature. Something that Kurosawa was deeply concerned about in his life. The film boasts some of the most wonderful and delightful colors on film that are sure to captivate you. Not to mention the stories themselves. The film is a visual painting on the screen. Everyone will have that one episode that they will like the most. And for me, that episode is the last one titled \\"Village of the Watermills.\\" I wish I could find such a place! Maybe in my dreams? And of course, the perfect choice by Kurosawa for the role of the old man is played by the late actor Chishu Ryu, who starred in so many great films, and was a favorite regular in many of the films by the late great Japanese director, Yasujiro Ozu.<br /><br />It was a delight for me to see Chishu Ryu in Village of the Watermills,\\" my favorite episode, as Ryu was in the classic Yasujiro Ozu film, \\"Tokyo Story,\\" which has always been one of my favorite films. \\"Village of the Watermills,\\" is a great episode that I have watched numerous times. It is an episode that celebrates life. Death is a natural part of the life cycle, and I especially liked the way that Kurosawa shows us this in the films last episode. And more importantly, how this community, which is in harmony with nature around them, are celebrating the death of a woman who has lived a long and joyous life. There is no sadness, but joy in having known her. The villages occupants treat her death with celebration--as she has lived a long life. Plus, I am always amazed by the interaction with the traveler to this village and the old man (Chishu Ryu). When the old man is being questioned by the traveler, he seems so wise.<br /><br />For example, when the traveler asks the old man \\"Why don't you have electricity?\\" The old man responds, \\"Because night is supposed to be dark.\\" Or, \\"If the night were bright you could not see the stars.\\" And when the traveler asks why there are no tractors for the farms, the old man replies, \\"Because they have horses and cows to tend the farms.\\" Ah, such simplicity. If it were only so. Kurosawa was truly concerned about mans disconnection with his environment, and this episode of this quiet and tranquil village really hit home with me. Peaceful serenity, with man and nature as they were intended to be--in harmony with each other, not at odds. This is a great episode and a magical film. ALL of the episodes are great, some disturbing and others magical.

I recommend this cd.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Or for that matter, what is the truth? Director Akira Kurosawa leaves this for the viewer to decide. As the films narrative moves forward, we all know that a crime has been committed, and more importantly, by whom. So what is Kurosawa out to prove in this masterful film? That everyone has a different view of the truth? Perhaps some of us embellish the truth? Or possibly something altogether different? In Akira Kurosawa's film, \\"Rashomon,\\" the viewer is introduced various witnesses to the rape of a woman, and the murder of her husband. Why are there different interpretations by the various witnesses to the crime in the film? Are they lying? Or is there a mixture of both lies and truths? Director Akira Kurosawa has left this for the audience to decide. This is a great film, however, I do not believe that it is Kurosawa's greatest film. \\"Ikiru,\\" holds that distinction---for me at least. \\"Rashomon\\" has always been one of the most talked about films in Japanese cinema, and many place it amongst the greatest films ever, be it foreign or domestic.<br /><br />This films narrative is an attempt to let the viewer decide who is telling the truth, or why the different characters each have a different interpretation. But why are they all different? There have been many different opinions of this film, and even after all these years since its release, this film has been discussed at length. So what is Kurosawa out to prove? That even the innocent may have something to hide? Or that our perceptions of reality differ? The film starts off with a man that has just testified to a horrible crime. And from here the film begins innocently enough with a woodcutter walking through the woods. This woodcutter is portrayed by the late, great actor, (Takeshi Shimura). He is a witness to a crime. But he is not the only witness. There are four different versions of a murder and rape: the woodcutter, the deceased mans wife, the killer (Toshiro Mifune), and the victim---through the use of a medium.<br /><br />The one thing I was really impressed with by this film, both at the time I first saw it many years ago, and recently again on this CRITERION DVD was the way Kurosawa used his camera. The way the woodcutter is walking through the forest, and especially the way the wind seems to capture the forest breathes life into the film. The forest appears to come alive as Takashi Shimura is walking through the woods. Plus, the way the wind blows and the sound of the rain falling at the beginning and ending of the film makes one feel they are part of the forest itself. This film will be talked about as long as cinema exists, and many will give their own interpretations of the film.<br /><br />For me, however, the film is telling in many ways, as each of the characters have something to hide: be it their own perception of the truth, or their unwillingness to come to terms with the truth: Be it guilt or shame. Moreover, I really like the way that Kurosawa uses the non-verbal area of the film: The visuals themselves. As in many Kurosawa films, the cinematography does much of the talking---and just looking at the scenery, and trying not to focus too much on the dialogue; one can see that Kurosawa relies heavily on the visuals themselves, as they are as much, if not more, of the story. As for who is telling the truth? And why are there different versions? This I leave for others to decide for themselves.

B0002UOK04|5.0|I bought this with the knowledge that it was primarily melodic death metal. This knowledge comes with another piece of knowledge, being that the melodic death metal scene is overcrowded with Gothenburg sound-alikes. At first listen, I was only semi-entertained by \\"Beyond The Dark Sun\\", but as I listened on to tracks like the Norse-like \\"The Death And The Healing\\" and the epic \\"Starchild\\" I realized that Wintersun is head and shoulders above the rest of their contemporaries. I should add that Ive never listened to any of Jari's other bands like Ensiferum. Anyways..the musicianship is absolutely top notch, Jari tears it up with chops never seen on a Telecaster(except for Richie Kotzen), and the lyrics are inspiring. Overall spectacular release, and Im looking forward to hearing more from Wintersun.
B000G75AE8|5.0|<br />The coming together of all the original members of Slayer had to spawn something great. Slayer has not made a \\"classic\\" album since 1990's \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", which blended Reign in Bloods sheer brutality and South of Heavens more sophisticated elements.  Now that the original line up of SLayer is back together, one can expect a great album. Christ Illusion is exactly what all Slayer fans and Metalheads alike have been waiting for for 16 years! <br /> <br />Christ Illusion opens up with the thrashy assault of Flesh Storm. Then the song goes into a great groove riffed chorus and then a solo that is like nothing we have heard from Slayer before (theres alot of those on this album). The guitar effects used are completely different from any others Kerry King has used in the past. Jeff Hanneman, however, has kept his sound back in the old school era. This is my favorite song on the album so far. Some instant classics on this album are Cult, Flesh Storm, Skeleton Christ (which reminds me somewhat of Dead Skin Mask), and Catatonic. Black Serenade is also very good as well. With all this being said, Christ Illusion will without a doubt go down as another Slayer classic. It blends the old Slayer sound with some of the new and makes for a great listen and a purchase worth the money. Own a piece of Metal history today, and dont have any second thoughts about it!
B000000Y59|5.0|I thought I knew Evans' music pretty well, but this disc (which I, too, sought out after hearing Paul Motian recommend it in his \\"Fresh Air\\" interview) came as something of a revelation.     Rarely have I heard Evans play with so much energy. Some of his lines here even call to mind Bud Powell, who is not someone I would ordinarily associate with Evans. His whole approach on this disc - attack, development of ideas, use of dissonance - is more aggressive than on most of his other recordings.     This energy, though, doesn't come at the expense of lyricism. This CD has more than its share of heartbreakingly beautiful moments. Is there any ballad more affecting than (in Evans' hands) \\"When I Fall In Love\\"?
B00005JNTX|5.0|I really enjoyed Sin City! Yes it was violent and gritty, but it was real and wonderful. I loved the visual stuff, the plot and the storyline. I thought Bruce Willis, Mickie Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were Brilliant! It reminded me of Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino had a little to do with this film and it shows)when you know the middle (because it is shown at the beginning), and you have to follow the story and arrive back at the middle and see it to the end. If you like movies like \\"Sixth Sense\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", and the \\"Others\\" (although that was not one of my favorites), you will understand and appreciate Sin City. Stated simply, everything is not what it seems.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|First off, I think every CD by this band is brilliant. Next, I want to say that this CD is the best CD of 2005. It's just so epic and awesome. Leave it to Sevenfold to bring back real metal to a Slipknot-addled world. The vocals are still amazing, i don't care what anybody says. This sounds like a modern fusion of Guns N' Roses and Metallica. Buy it!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I absolutely love Grey's Anatomy. I tell people all the time that what is so refreshing about this \\"medical\\" drama is that characters are \\"very\\" real people, most of which can be found in our families or lives. The writer of the show has found the perfect ingredients for success....a wonderful cast of characters (none of them are toooooo perfect..LOL. Just flawed enough to make them believable), a wonderful storyline and seemingly endless amounts of new material. It is better than ER in its prime.   <br /> <br />The story seems to center around Meredith Grey, an intense, lonely, resident who is broken emotionally by a series of events outside of her control (I think her parents divorce, her mother's illness, and a sex life that consists of meeting strangers in bars and taking them home). But while the story is about her, it is her interaction with a host of other characters that really makes the show good. The show opens with Meredith rushing to work after spending the night with a guy she met in a bar. Guess what, when she arrives to work, she finds that her new boss is none other than Dr. Shepherd, otherwise known as \\"McDreamy\\". Over the course of the show, we find that Dr. Shepherd is living and dealing with demons of his own. There are also her roommates, George (who is hopelessly in love with Meredith) and Izzy (the pretty girl who paid her way through medical school by modeling). There are friends Christina (a perfectionist), and an egotistical resident who would rather be nasty than nice. There are other people at the hospital, the Chief, Burke (a perfectionist with a heart), and Bailey (who everyone calls the Nazi). Grey's Anatomy is only getting better and I can not wait until the next season is available.
B00005JP7Y|5.0|Here it is. My favorite movie star is Ginger Rogers. Anybody seen a Rogers & Astaire movie? Their films go like this...boy meets girl, boy dances with girl, boy loses girl, boy dances with girl (again), boy gets girl. Put all that in a movie with slammin' beats, an ambitious dance student (Jenna Dewan) and a freak at freestyle street dance (Channing Tatum) and you got \\"Step Up\\". You'll enjoy it. Like I did.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|My two friends and I saw this concert at Radio City on April Fools Day and it was the best concert I had ever seen. These guys seem to get better and better as they get older. Petrucci's harmonic interaction with the orchestra was absolutley stunning and Ruddess was magnificent with his extended intro on Octavarium. Portnoy and Myung will always be one of the sickest rythem sections ever and they really show it on this DVD. Labrie, though probably the weakest of the five was very good as well. Overall, this concert was fantastic and worth having on file for years to come.
0375423877|4.0|This review is for the first Anchor Books paperback edition published in August 2002, 235 pages.  THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 98 weeks between February 2003 and August 2005, reaching the peak position of number 18.<br /><br />Around 1995, Mme Mma Precious Ramotswe opens the number one ladies' detective agency on the edge of Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, a landlocked nation in Southern Africa.  It is the number one ladies' detective agency not because it is the best, but rather the first in the nation and perhaps even the Continent.  As such, Mma Ramotswe's first cases do not involve the convoluted intrigue and red herring clues of the typical British and American private investigator novels.  Instead, they are vignettes of life, culture and tribulations in Botswana.  Instead of a puzzling mystery, the reader gets a strong sense of place.<br /><br />Although the first chapter opens with some action, the next three are devoted to the back story of Mma Ramotswe and her father.  The narrative flow is smooth, providing the reader, through story, clear insights into the lifestyle of the common peoples of Botswana after it celebrated independence from Britain in 1966 and up to the narrative present.  With this foundation, the author builds our understanding of the culture as Mma Ramotswe resolves varied problems for a half-dozen clients.<br /><br />The author reveals Botswana for us without being pushy.  The scent and feel of the country, and the author's obvious fondness for the place, rise naturally out of the story, although perhaps too nicely.  The bad guys are not insidious, threats are easily disarmed, issues resolved amiably, no one goes to jail and the only violence is in someone else's country.  Although nearly a quarter of the adult population of Botswana is HIV positive, there is only one oblique reference to the disease.  It seems this view of place is through rose tinted glasses.

B000002KDW|4.0|...what are you reading this for?  You know what to expect when you buy a disc produced by Rod Stewart's Faces: at least four or five hard-rocking party numbers ('Miss Judy's Farm', 'Stay With Me', 'Memphis', 'Too Bad', and 'That's All You Need') featuring Rod's raspy vocals, and heavy, pulsing guitar and bass lines courtesy of Ron Wood and Ronnie Lane; two or three irresistible love ballads ('Love Lives Here', 'Debris'); and to top it all off, some honky-tonk or boogie numbers ('You're So Rude', 'Last Orders Please').  'A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse...', released in November of 1971, charged up to number six on the US album charts, and stands as the most commercially successful of the bands' four albums. <br /> <br />While there isn't always great depth to the lyrics offered up by the three R's... Rod, Ron, and Ronnie, no one can deny that they often cut straight to the chase. On 'Miss Judy's Farm', Rod paints vivid scenario's such as \\"I was just eighteen and all I needed was to get my way\\".  Ironically, on 'That's All You Need', Stewart sings, \\"...my kind of music... you knew it wasn't gonna be simple...\\" when \\"simple\\" is exactly the form of music this band revels in.  That particular song drifts along on a masterful lead guitar riff that makes it one of the most under-appreciated epic rock tracks.  The second side of 'A nod...' (on the original vinyl version) opened with one of the bands' most successful single releases, 'Stay With Me', which climbed to number eight on the national charts in January of 1972.  Despite being mercilessly overplayed on both the AM and FM frequencies, 'Stay With Me' has proven powerful enough to overcome overexposure.  Stewart's barroom delivery takes lines like \\"I hear you're a mean old Jezebel\\" and transforms them into terms of endearment.  A honky tonk piano track and grinding rhythm guitar propel the number into a fantastic instrumental coda embracing several faux finishes.  'Too Bad' chimes in with a tale involvinga twelve foot tall butler, a colored queen, and sweaty girls over an up-tempo, party-rock beat.  Their cover of Chuck Berry's 'Memphis' plods along in the beginning, but confidently gains intensity as Rod tells the familiar tale about a phone call from southside Memphis Marie, all of six years old. <br /> <br />Among the better ballads are 'Love Lives Here', offering a melodic combination of guitars, piano, and organ, and Ronnie Lane's 'Debris', supported by more solid guitar and piano interaction.  While less entertaining than the surrounding fare, 'You're So Rude' blends a rocking rhythm guitar riff with a tight electric lead guitar, and tops it off with a harmonica in the coda.  Perhpas the weakest track among the nine performed is the side one closer, 'Last Orders Please', a break-up tale dropping some worn cliche's such as \\"you've got yours and I've got mine\\". <br /> <br />I was a senior in high school the year that 'A nod...' hit the shelves, and the disc proved to be one of the first to hit the platter at each and every party that brought closure to that most important of all years.  Whenever I see that cover (which always made me think of this as a live disc, which it isn't), surrounded by that distinct dark brown border, waves of memories and emotions from my youth surround me.  For that reason, my own perception of the quality of this disc may be biased, but with each subsequent listen I feel vindicated that it isn't just my associations to it that make 'A nod...' a rock and roll classic.  As many good times as this album must have witnessed in the early 1970's, it remains vital enough to produce many more to come. <br /> <br />
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I really liked their other releases, they seem to be less polished. all the songs on this cd start out strong and then end up going into the same repetitive riffs that make up this cd, fast solos and powerchords. listen there are so many other good bands out right now, like, soilwork,threat signal,mudvayne,killswitch engage and my favorite band of all time, MASTODON. now theres a band whos music is exciting to listen too. i guess im getting tired of all these repetitive sounding bands, im looking for more bands like Mastodon, who are trying to do more original music, not just trying to sell cds.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|As some people have said in their reviews, it's not quite what you'd expect a bank robbery movie to be. It's hard to explain why that is without giving away the whole plot of the movie. The f word is thrown around a whole lot. If you don't mind a little bit of violence and a lot of vulgar language, then I highly recommend this movie, especially if you enjoy a good bank robbery movie (even though this isn't your average bank job). It is a little bit slow at some points. Some parts could probably be taken out without really losing much. It can get a little confusing if you don't pay close attention to every detail. So, if you don't mind spending a couple of hours watching a thrilling \\"bank robbery\\" movie, Inside Man should definitely be considered.
B000FVBLEI|4.0|i have a question to pose to everyone, where did the bass guitar go in heavy metal, there are only a few bands who still make the bass a signature part of their music, now im not saying the bass has to be at the front of the music, but i play bass and wish that the new metal bands would bring back that fat bass sound. but i liked this cd, im glad the singer`s not just screaming through every song but hes trying to make their music more dynamic. now having said that, this band is still and i said it before, nothing new to the meatl scene, they bring nothing fresh, but they have their doing their thing and people are still going to their shows so, more power to them, keep metal alive, just try to do something more original.
B000FS9FCG|3.0|The bottom line for this film is going to be how you interpret it.  People who don't care about the current state of political affairs should enjoy this movie despite its rather slow pace and drawn out dialoge.  Good performances are provided by all, the directing is solid, and the action scenes, few that they are, are quite effective. The references to America crumbling under its policies of recent years, however, will make many uncomfortable.  At times the film feels like a left-wing fantasy of where they believe we are headed (with references to Nazi-ism and fascism), other times it just seems like an attack on Conservative ideas (mainly regarding the war on terror).  Two things to keep in mind;  Alan Moore, who wrote the original graphic novel, demanded his name be taken off this movie completely, and that it's fairly obvious a bold political statement is being made with this film.  You may applaude it or you may loathe it, depending on your views.  My opinion is that politics should be left out of comic hero/action flicks.  Save it for documentories.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I began watching Supernatural around midseason... I caught \\"Faith\\" by accident one night, half-watching while I was reading something else, and little by little, Jensen Ackles' fantastic performance drew me in. The next week was a rerun, and I thought, \\"Well, may as well watch that one...\\" The rerun was \\"Asylum\\", and although it wasn't as well-realized an ep as \\"Faith\\", the interactions between the characters, the genuinely creepy tone and the snark cemented this show as a must-see for me. <br /> <br />The quality in this first season tends to be uneven, both writing- and production-wise, and some of the acting is uneven as well (Ackles is the one who consistently impresses me, whereas Padalecki and JDM can range from quite good to disappointing, depending on the ep). The concept of the hunt, the obligation to do it and the toll it takes on the family, however, are edgy and compelling, and the tone of the show is excellently midwestern (even though it films in Vancouver :P). Overall, it has more of an X Files than a Buffy feel, if that helps those who are on the fence about watching... kind of a younger, snarkier, less governmentally sanctioned X Files, with less science and aliens, and more front-and-center family angst.  <br /> <br />Oh, and did I mention hot boys with guns? There's that, too. You know, if you're into that kind of thing.

B000G75AE8|3.0|I still like slayer for some reason. I like how they just dont care about protecting anyones feelings. They just sing about morbid angry society and are still hard hitters. For all those people out there saying this album is fast im not really sure where there getting that from. For slayer this album is on the slower side. Its not any better than god hates us all. In fact when i herd it thats what it sounded like to me. I still like the album but the guitar work has sloped down through the years and the intros arnt as cool as they used to be. This is still a good album but i had expected a little more especially waiting a few years to release a new album. If your looking for old school slayer you wont find much here but its still good to listen to new ideas.
B000EULJLU|5.0|My best advice for those who are planning on buying this cd or are about to listen to it is: dont be prepared for another schism or laterus. This CD is far removed from that style. 10,000 days isn't thrass, it isn't deathmetal, or even traditional hard rock. <br /> <br />Tool has taken on an almost arcaeic style for this album (moreso than usual). The beauty of this CD is not heavy fast pasted chords and rapid drum beats, but rather the impressive but slower instrutmentals with removed vocals that support the instrutments. This is different than most albums out today because the guitars, bass, and drums are often always done to support and emphasize the lyrics and vocals. <br /> <br />This CD will take a few times listening to before you will really appreciate it. It is well done and well produced, but is so much different than what you would typically expect that you have to get used to it.
0596007124|5.0|I once heard about a school that was built but the landscaping was left until the following spring.

B00062IVKS|5.0|Raging Bull is #24 in the 100 Best American movies ever, and it is among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. Later on was named the best movie of the decade (80's), which I think is true. I rate this movie 5 stars or 9.5/10. It was nominated for eight 1980 Oscars, but won only two: De Niro for Best Actor, and Thelma Schoonmaker for her editing (the Academy seems to have a problem with Scorsese). Schoonmaker appears on one of the audio commentaries of the movie, along with Martin Scorsese, producer, the real LaMotta and others. This DVD is exactly what we collectors like about special edition DVDs. The package is beautifully done (Yes! The package matters a lot), containing a small booklet with some short essays and pictures of the movie. Then, this special edition comes with a second DVD full of special features, such as 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes, a making of documentary, trailers, and some other very interesting stuff.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece. The acting is perfect, and I don't only mean De Niro, who got the Oscar for this role and is in my opinion one of the best actors ever, but Joe Pesci, who is as always sensational, and Cathy Moriarty in the role of Vickie. The shooting in black and white is a very wise decision, the photography by Michael Chapman, the music (Cavalleria Rusticana fits perfectly), the editing that got an Oscar is also a great job well done, the story, the screenplay, and even the fight scenes are just absolutely amazing (and I just hate violence ...). As The New York Times put it \\"Though it's a movie full of anger and nonstop physical violence, the effect or Raging Bull is lyrical\\".<br /><br />I recommend this movie to absolutely everybody. You will like it for sure. If you can, get this special edition (though while I am writing this review, it looks it is not available anymore at amazon).<br /><br />P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I had never really followed the series in BBC's earlier incarnations and I was only lukewarm about it the evening it premiered on Sci-Fi channel.  One viewing changed my mind.  The series has great energy, excellent acting, superb production values, creative scripts, and a sense of fun.  When I found out the DVD set was coming out I did not hesitate to order.  I haven't viewed all the extras yet but have really enjoyed the ones I have.  Not only do I like the characters, I think I really like the actors who portray them.  If you like the series, you will want this set in your sci-fi collection.
B0009X7664|5.0|I read this book as a boy of 14. And read it and read it and read it again! When I saw the movie I couldnt believe it,there were all of the characters just as they were in the book! This is my favorite book and movie and now here is a DVD with little Scout and Jem all grown up and talking about their experiences making the movie. I only wish that Harper Lee had been coaxed to do a segment on the extras too.  The DVD and Extras are superb! What a thrill to experience this awsome movie again! Has there ever been better opening credits in any movie ,ever?
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|I'm not going to re-iterate who was in the movie, or re-hash the story...you can read the other reviews for that. I am here to tell my opinion on the whole situation regarding V for Vendetta. <br />Great message. Freedom is a must, and people do have to care to make a change. We have to shake ourselves out of complacency and indifference to make change. We must think for ourselves and regain our humanity.  <br />I also agree that the movie is taking a stab at our government, which is neither good nor bad. It is what it is.  <br />I am here to just review the art. <br />The story of V for Vendetta is so over-played and over-done, it is just plain annoying. The drama inherent within the movie is cheesy and the whole FREEDOM thing is done out of proportion. Like another reviewer stated, this movie as about revenge, not freedom. There is no freedom in revenge, revenge is another emotion that holds you captive, just like indifference. Therefore, I felt that the message of the movie was largly inconsistant. And throwing in Shakespearian quotes does not make the movie any better. <br />The dialogue is horrible, and the action sequences are yawn inducing. Bullet-time is used again(!) but this time knifes replace bullets. <br /> <br />What's the message of the film? Freedom or violence to reach freedom? Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the fact that they used violence to gain freedom in the movie, I just think that many misguided people will take this movie as true and think violence will \\"free\\" them from their \\"oppression\\". <br /> <br />The writer and directors seem to have executed certain parts to tug at the heart strings of the audience, which failed misrably in my opinion. The writer tries to make a sentimental moment out of every scene, and it just doesn't work. <br />Largly un-original concepts and over-done plot make this a very weak movie that too many people think too highly of, Probably because everyone loves to bash Mr. Bush and America, even if they have no clue as to why they are doing it. But hey, everyone else is:) <br />Don't get me wrong, I am just as anti-anti freedom as any other lover of freedom and humantiy, but just because a movie features action and some guy fighting for freedom, does not make it a great movie. <br />Decent film, worth renting. Provides a nice release to rebel-wannabes who are too afraid to help make change and would rather dream about it, a large reason why things are the way they are:)
B000GFLKF8|3.0|With Inside Man Spike Lee certainly managed to disguise a regular bankjob story as a flashy accelerating action movie.  Nevertheless the result he came up with is still worth watching.  The New York police has trapped a small group of bankrobbers led by Clive Owen inside the bank they were trying to rob. Denzel Washington is in charge of the police squad sieging the bank. As time passes by he begins to realize, that the robbers aren't the type of criminals they pretend to be. Spike Lee is still a great director, but Inside Man clearly tries to be too many things at the same time. There a too many subplots in there , that could have easily been removed from the final cut. Shame though...because the cast is great...even Jodie Foster is fun to watch for a change. Normally she tends to play women that could burst out crying at any time.(SARR)

B000F0UV0E|5.0|At a certain point, in the Martin Scorsese film about The Band's farewell concert, The Last Waltz, Levon Helm says that what else could he have expected from life, after sharing the same stage with The Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris. Me, myself, after seeing that same movie for so many times, still under the impact of Emmy's performance and stage presence. After all, it was the first time I could actually see the woman of my dreams live (with all the due respect Emmy, I was 20 by then and when we're 20 we have the right, almost the obligation, to dream), even through the silk screen. Ok fellows, I think I've made my point. 165 reviews. Wow! That's a lot. What was left for me to say? When I first heard that Mark Knopfler (another hero of mine) and Emmylou Harris were about to release an album together, I must confess, it scared me a bit. I was afraid to be disapointed. I mean, a lot of famous duos have failed along the way. Fortunately, I was damn wrong. This album is just perfect. From the gorgeous opening track til the beautiful \\"If This Is Goodbye\\", everything went right. Beautiful music. Simple and yet great lyrics. The appalachian influenced \\"Red Staggerwing\\" is one of the greatest country-like songs written in decades. It has an hipnotic mood all the way. The two songs penned by Emmylou \\"Love & Happiness\\" and \\"Belle Starr\\" are among the finest tunes she ever written. \\"Donkey Town\\", \\"Beachcombing\\" and \\"All The Roadrunning\\" have the kind of flavor that recent Knopfler albums brought back to us all. If I had to describe this album in one single word, I'd say \\"mature\\", but it isn't enough to describe it. Great music by two great artists that, brought, when they first appeared in the musical scene, a good amount of fresh air and hope to the future that was yet to come. And it sure came, alright. Thank you guys, for making us still believe.

B00005JNRY|4.0|Cars (John Lasseter,2006)<br /><br />The main problem I have with Cars will not be shared by the majority of its viewers, nor even the majority of Americans. It's the naked end result of a love affair with NASCAR, and all NASCAR represents. Still, if anyone can take NASCAR and make it worth watching, it's Pixar. And they do a relatively good job of it, despite the instant-death casting moves of putting Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy (are you getting the \\"all NASCAR represents\\" vibe yet?) in two major roles.<br /><br />Cars is the story of Lightning McQueen (Wilson), a self-absorbed rookie racer who overcomes overwhelming obstacles to finish in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup, racing's greatest honor. (That he put himself in the position to be burdened with overwhelming obstacles is a minor, but important, point.) The talking heads decree that The three finishers-- McQueen, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton)-- will have a race-off in California in one week. On the way there, thanks to various shenannigans, McQueen finds himself stranded in the town of Radiator Springs, having caused a great deal of damage to the stretch of Route 66 that passes through the town. The town judge, Doc (Paul Newman), sentences McQueen to repave the section of road he destroyed. Which, of course, leads to McQueen getting to know the locals and coming to care about something other than his own existence. Roll credits, another happy ending in the books.<br /><br />So, yeah, it's predictable. But the predictability doesn't take into account the Pixar magic, which flows as strongly as ever here. And I mean strong-- if it can make me like anything even remotely NASCAR-related (or Larry the Cable Guy related), there's some serious mojo workin' in the Pixar studios.<br /><br />It's not much of a surprise that Cars works as well as it does; Lasseter was the guy behind both Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life, three of Pixar's strongest offerings. He uses the same formula here: lovely animation with a great deal of subtle detail to captivate the eye, fantastic voice casting for minor roles (and little details added by those voice actors that brighten everything up a bunch), and realizing that if you're going to do formula, the best way to do it is to stick with the formula. After all, it's a formula because it works.<br /><br />Pixar strikes again. *** ½same formula here: lovely animation with a great deal of subtle detail to captivate the eye, fantastic voice casting for minor roles (and little details added by those voice actors that brighten everything up a bunch), and realizing that if you're going to do formula, the best way to do it is to stick with the formula.

B000AP04L0|4.0|Office Space is a brilliant parody of life in corporate America.  While funny, the movie conveys the soullessness of commuting to work, putting in 8-10 hour days doing tasks you hate for a boss you hate even more, only to have to wake up the next day -- sometimes on weekends -- and do it all over again.  Even though it's clearly a comedy, Office Space has caused me to stop and consider (more than once) how I want to spend my work days.<br /><br />The comedy is brilliant.  There aren't too many movie scenes funnier than Peter, Michael and Samir exacting their revenge on a bothersome piece of office equipment.  The rest of the movie hums along at a great clip, lampooning the sameness of office and service industry job environments.<br /><br />The humor is a bit raw in spots.  If you are concerned about language, Office Space has its fair share of \\"F-bombs\\". Unlike some movies that need raunch to carry them, Office Space would be funny as a PG flick.<br /><br />Office Space is one of the best comedies of the last decade. Watch it!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Forget all the other reviews which say this album is lacklustre. I would give 7 stars for this album. This is not your typical everyday rock album which you can listen to while throwing a party. It needs your attention and devotion. The album grows into you. I got this same feeling with Lateralus as well. At first it may not grab your attention but the music has so much  depth and substance that it moves your soul. This is very typical of Tool's music in my opinion. The album has a similar structure to Lateralus but has elements of Undertow, Aenima, Lateralus with the X-factor thrown in.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I have just recently bought this movie. It was fantastic even though the releasal year was 2003, I have wanted to see it but never got the chance. And I absouletly adore it! My mom thought this was a childish movie and actually told me to grow up! But after forcing her to watch it I caught her laughing in so many scenes and smiling too! And I just had to rub it in her face saying that I knew it was a good movie. She became angry of course, lol. <br /> <br />This movie is a wonderful movie for any age. My three old sister does not watch anything but cartoons but had actually sat there quietly and watch the whole movie. She couldn't help but giggle through the whole movie.  <br /> <br />It has any emotion a human can feel; love, sadness, jealousy (that you can't work in the movie ;) happiness, energy. But of course it's lacking one emotion..hatred. You have to love the movie of course!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I don't usually buy CD's based on only hearing one song but I am glad that I did. This is the best CD that I have bought/listened to in years. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00003XAVA|5.0|When I listened this album first time I was twenty and now at fourty seven I felt the urge to buy it once again on CD. Being a sensitive individual on environmental issues, my favourite song in this album has always been the \\"The Wind On the Water\\". Any concious person has a lot to learn from this great album. <br />
0634049011|5.0|I've been playing guitar many years, and along the way have made some ill fated attempts to learn the fretboard. This book is the one that finally taught me what I wanted to know. That little switch in my brain that was stuck off finally got turned on. If you work step by step through this book you WILL make progress. Give it a shot.
0553804367|5.0|A phenomenal description of the basics in physics and science. Hawkings new version is a tell all for Science beginners such as myself. After years of not understanding or not putting effort into understanding science I now have an excellent overview of why and how we exist. Definitely a great read!
0684824906|5.0|This was an exceptional book which I found to dispel many of the myths about Lincoln.  The impression of a depressive, well-intentioned prarie lawyer who simply had a good heart, tenacity and was lucky to be in the right place at the right time - was completely dispelled.  His shrewd political sense, campaign ability and skills in managing those around him were well described, enlightening and entertaining.   <br /> <br />Lincoln's understanding of the populous and political sensitivity is also well reflected by his selection of the appropriate time for the Emancipation Proclomation, arming black troops and the replacement of Chase as his Secy of Treasury.   <br /> <br />If there is any criticism I have, it reflects a personal preference to have a more limited discussion of the intrigues/issues of the family lives of the principle players.  While important in the overall environment - I thought this aspect could be somewhat shorter. <br /> <br />In general - this was an outstanding and enjoyable read.
B00005JOML|2.0|This movie was ok at the beginning but than it just got boring and the story became confusing and hard to follow. There was also very little action in it and it was just boring. The ending was good but that still doesn't make it worth it. I recommend buying the Miami Vice seasons on DVD or the PSP game. If your a die hard fan, well than go for it.
B000E41MS6|4.0|Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper star in this wonderfully bizarre, colourful new series of Doctor Who.  If you loved the previous seven (or is it eight?) doctors you'll love Eccleston's interpretation of this loveable eccentric.  The Complete First Series is packed full of absurd plot twists, zany characters and goofy special effects that Doctor Who fans have come to love over the years.  The signature BBC cardboard scenery has been partly replaced with CG and the special effects are more high tech but that doesn't detract from the unique storylines.  You'll meet all kinds of evil villains, updated for the \\"me generation\\", not forgetting the Doctor's arch nemeses, the Daleks.  Rose (Billie Piper) is a perfect companion for the Doctor.  She's street smart, sassy, cute, and brave.  You may notice some sexual tension between the good Doctor and Rose later on especially when a third character comes on board.  Rose's down to earth Mum is also an enjoyable character.  Other notable chars. include Rose's jealous boyfriend who comes through in the end, a wonderful group of flatulent mobsters, Charles Dickens, and a cute ex-con.
B0002W18MU|2.0|I don't know what I expected, being that Johnny Cash was in such bad shape when these songs were made.  The songs are really slow and he sounds very tired.  I listened to it one time and probably will never listen to it again.  Get a greatest hits cd.  All singers are the best when they are young.
0770430074|2.0|It doesn't matter whether what you tell people is truth or fiction, because there's no such thing as truth, no real difference between fantasy and reality, so you might as well go with the more interesting story. That's \\"Life of Pi\\" in a nutshell. Sorry to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet.    Remember that season of the TV series \\"Dallas\\" that turned out to be just a dream? That's kind of how you feel after you've invested hours of your time reading page after page of a quite engrossing survival narrative, only to find out that it was all something the survivor made up.     Or was it? Ah, there's the twist that we're supposed to find so clever. But the officials from the ship company who tell Pi they don't believe his story are such hopelessly weak strawmen that the author pretty much forces you to accept the \\"better story.\\" Pi, and, by extension, Martel, have no patience for the \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\" that the ship officials want, you see. Never mind whether it's closer to the truth -- it's just too boring, and we need colorful stories to make our lives richer. Besides, Pi and Martel say, as soon as something leaves your mouth, it's no longer reality -- it's only your interpretation of reality. So why bother grasping for the truth? You prefer the Creation story to the Big Bang? Then go with the Creation story, even if it defies logic and scientific discovery.    That's all well and good. Everyone likes a good story. But there's a time and a place for them, and the ship officials didn't need a story -- they needed to know what happened to their ship. To that end, Pi's entire tale is irrelevant anyway. And that, in turn, makes you wonder what the whole point of the book was. Other than, maybe, to laud the power of storytelling in a really hamfisted manner. Or to advocate for taking refuge in fantastical fiction when reality is too harsh. Or to champion shallow religious beliefs (\\"Why, Islam is nothing but an easy sort of exercise, I thought. Hot-weather yoga for the Bedouins. Asanas without sweat, heaven without strain.\\"). Or to bash agnostics. Or something.    Be advised that this is not a book for children or the squeamish. Pi's transformation from vegetarian to unflinching killer, and Richard Parker's dietary habits, are rife with gratuituously gory details about the manner in which animals suffer and are killed and eaten.     The story promises to make you believe in God. Yet with Martel's insistence that a well-crafted story is just as good as or even preferable to reality, he leaves us not believing in a god of any kind, but rather suggesting that we embrace the stories that religions have made up about their gods, regardless of those stories' relation to scientific knowledge, since the stories are so darn nice, comfy, warm, and fuzzy in comparison with real life. Whether the God in the stories actually exists, meanwhile, becomes totally irrelevant. So ultimately, Martel makes a case for why he thinks people SHOULD believe in God -- it's a respite from harsh reality, we're told, a way to hide from life rather than meet it head-on with all of its pains and struggles -- and that's quite different from what he ostensibly set out to do. He trivializes God into a \\"nice story,\\" a trite characterization sure to offend many readers.    Pi sums up this postmodern worldview by telling the ship investigators, \\"The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no?\\" Well, no, the world IS just the way it is, in all of its highs and lows, triumphs and tragedies, happiness and sadness. But Pi and Martel's solution is to avoid the whole messy thing altogether, pretend that the way things are don't really exist, and pull a security blanket of fiction over your head. Create your own reality as you see fit. That's called escapism. It's fine when you want to curl up with a good book on a rainy day and get lost in the story for a few hours, but it's a lousy way to try to deal with real life.     Pi would tell me that I lack imagination, just as he told the investigators they lacked imagination when Pi claimed he couldn't \\"imagine\\" a bonsai tree since he's never seen one, as a way of mocking the investigators' reluctance to believe in Pi's carnivorous island. (Nice cultural stereotyping with the bonsai, by the way -- the investigators are Japanese.) But you see the problem, right? It's not a matter of lacking imagination. It's a matter of conflating things that are obviously imaginary with things that are obviously real. They're not one and the same. It's ludicrous to suggest otherwise. You might as well say that the story of Frodo and the Ring is every bit as real as the American Revolution.    Pi also tells us, quite pointedly, that choosing agnosticism is immobilizing, while atheists and religious folks make a courageous leap of faith. Yet immobility is precisely where Pi places us, so that by the time the book ends, you're stuck not knowing what to think about what you've just read. Do you accept the original shipwreck story just because it's more engrossing, even if it's less believable? Or do you accept the plausible but boring story Pi gives to the officials after he's rescued? Fanciful religious allegories or cold, scientific recitation of facts that might come from the mouth of an atheist -- we're expected to pick one or the other.     But it's a false dichotomy. We needn't make a choice between embracing religious tales merely because they're more interesting or settling for the sobering realities of science and reason. We can go as far as our reason will take us and then leave ourselves open to further possibilities -- just as Pi himself suggests. That's not immobility. That's intellectual honesty -- an admission that I don't know all the answers but am willing to keep an open mind about whatever else is presented to me.    Seems better than saying you might as well just accept the better story since it really makes no difference. That's laziness. And it doesn't make for a very good story.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder is a must -- his music defined a segment of my life.  His sound is distinctive, clear, and penetrating.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|The first time I heard Corinne Bailey Rae sing, I was surfing the channels and I stumbled upon her video \\"Like a Star\\" and her raw singing immediately reminded me of Sade.  I was determined to purchase her CD.  Unlike most new artists with only a couple of hits on their CD, Corinne's CD is the bomb from beginning to end.  The words of her songs would touch anyone's heart no matter who you are or what you're going thru.  There's only 1 or 2 songs out of the 11 that Im not too crazy about, but overall it's a great listen and it's worth it!
B000G75AE8|4.0|I actually give this album a 4.5.  It's pissed off and angry, sounds like a Slayer album.  Awesome cover art, completely blasphomous lyrics, and Dave Lombardo back behind the drum kit.  What more do you want?  The only reason I can't give this album a perfect score is because it's not a career-defining album and isn't Reign In Blood, but that won't stop you from listening to it a million times, it hasn't stopped me anyway.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|For those of you who longed for the sounds of the old time jazz singers like Billie Holiday, here it is!  Peyroux's sound is distinctly of Holiday with not only the lazy words sang, but with the very essence of her sound.  When first heard, you might think this as a new release of Billie Holiday and begin to enjoy the sounds you've starved for before you remember that Holiday has been dead for over fifty years. <br />This is truly a long awaited music style that captures a time long gone while providing a new touch to an already perfect sound.  <br /> <br />If you love Holiday, you will adore Peyroux.  Enjoy this album not as a copy or knockoff, but as a new fresh addition to a historic and classic sound.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why, why, why, why did FOX cancel this show, and when, when, when will the absolutely deserved popularity of the DVD boxed set prompt someone in TV-land to re-engage and continue this saga?  How much does it take to show that there IS an audience... a huge, devoted audience for Josh Whedon's genius writing, and the loving performances by the cast. <br /> <br />I want MORE.
B000068IEU|3.0|(2.5/5 stars)  Even though there are some 263 reviews on Amazon as of the writing of this review, I thought I would throw in my own thoughts. Normally I can give my opinion on a movie after I have seen it and explain my reasoning behind it. With \\"Last House on the Left,\\" I had such an ambivalent feeling afterward it that I am still struggling to come to grips with it, even though I have only watched it once and that was about at least two years ago. In a way, writing this review will help me sort out my own thoughts. If you have watched this film or have read some of the other reviews here, you know it is difficult to watch because of the rape, the gore, humiliation, violence, etc. Usually when I watch a movie, I liked to be entertained; being subjected to the aforementioned acts is not my idea of a good time. I do enjoy horror movies, but I find the scariest horror is that which is unknown. This movie has me re-evaluating and redefining my own definition of \\"horror.\\" What happens to the young ladies in this film is truly horrific and, from what I understand, left one of them in fact emotionally scarred. With so much talk today of torture (at Abu Ghraib, etc.), grisly war crimes, videotaped beheadings, Geneva Convention principles being purposely and expressly ignored, etc, what else is there to shock us? Have we become so inured to violence that our brains can accept and rationalize anything? I have been an admirer of horror films since I was very young for many reasons, such as the supernatural elements of some, the suspense of others or the good vs. evil conflict in still others. Normally what keeps horror movies in check is a sense that the filmmakers also recognize the atrocity being committed and they attempt to validate it; not so with this movie. I genuinely got the feeling the filmmakers relished torturing and mutilating those women, even if it was not real. Apparently they claimed they made this movie to protest the Vietnam War, which was in progress at the time. I could get behind that justification if it were true. For those who didn't need to be shocked in order to find reason to protest the war, why not show how senseless, grim and utterly repulsive killing another human being is? Yet, I am not so certain I accept the argument that this was a war protest. It seemed as though they had too much fun making the movie and invested too much energy making it seem realistic for that argument to seem plausible. Is it fair to judge a movie (for better or worse) based on the intentions of the filmmakers, or based on the quality of person s/he is? I have enjoyed other Wes Craven movies, such as \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" and \\"Scream,\\" though it seemed difficult to believe the same person was responsible for all these films because those movies adhered to the normal Hollywood conventions. While some will undoubtedly see that as an undesirable trait, for me it adds an element of fun. (See Universal monster movies for further examples)  Ultimately for me, this film was highly effective at being horrific, and succeeding at its goal of horrifying earns this film 5/5 stars. However, a movie should not be an excruciating experience, as this one undoubtedly was for me. For that, it deserves 0/5 stars, for an average of 2.5/5 stars. One final note: many have used the term \\"disturbing\\" to describe this movie, and I agree. To me, \\"disturbing\\" and \\"enjoyable\\" are mutually exclusive. I'm not certain which is more unsettling, this film or the people who said they actually enjoy watching it.e time. I could get behind that justification if it were true.

0060887966|5.0|Simply from a story telling aspect it is a kin to Kipling and others of the 1800s.  From an adventure aspect, it rivals Burroughs.  From a philosophical aspect, although it is very fatalistic as spoken by the characters i.e., 'It is written,' it still describes that one's destiny is in one's own hands.  It is a great old fashion, exciting, and hard to put down book.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Muse. You know I can't write this review without saying Radiohead, so I'm just going to get it out of the way early. Yeah Muse is that band that's been peeking around the corner for the last few years. The one that sounds like Radiohead if \\"they hadn't lost their guitars\\" or \\"they had Balls\\" or the ever eloquent \\"they didn't suck\\". Yes, lead singer, , does sound a little like Thom Yorke but on this latest and undeniably greatest album by the British trio they have finally grown into a sound they can call their own. <br /> <br />You remember that old cartoon bravestar? It was about a cowboy, in space. He had lazer guns and all that but he rode a horse wore a cowboy hat and stir-ups. He was a sheriff and didn't tolerate \\"space lawlessness\\" Well that is what this record reminds me of. It's sci-fi! It's full of synth, freak out beats, strange ambient noise and lyrics about black holes. But it's also a sort of concept album firmly rooted in rock with a western feel. One can't help but think that these guys would write a great soundtrack to the new Transformers movies. Especially in the first single \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" when the music cuts to a vocal breakdown and everything the transformers stand for comes blaring through your speakers in a spine tingling fashion.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to lie to you, on my way home from work the first day I bought this record I listened to that song on full blast and let visions of the Transformers movie (cartoon version with Robert Stack) dance through my head. And I shed more then a single tear. <br /> <br />So I guess...if you want a killer rock record that will make you think of cowbos....giant robots and bring out the saddoe kid in you. Pick this up. You wbn't be sorry.

0689859414|4.0|Tony DiTerlizzi has created a beautiful visual display of the mythological creatures we all met as young children. His interpretations can help spark the flame for a new generation to fall in love with the mystical stories of folklore and fairytales. This book is recommended for all ages, and is an excellent companion to a Monster Manual for all Dungeons and Dragons Players. (The artwork is of the utmost quality)
B000002U82|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  If you aren't familiar with this album you either: <br /> <br />1) Are and don't know it... OR <br />2) Haven't listened to any classic rock in the last 20 years.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|<br />I like the confidence of a band that will start out a CD with an almost a spoken word intro to a song. It shows that their willing to take a risk, grabbing you with the words rather than the hook. FRANZ FERDINAND gives the listener a band that takes the current formula of throbbing beats and anguished vocals and still stands out because they can take risk. Is that \\"Hava Nagilah\\" I hear in \\"The Dark of The Matinee?\\" \\"You can feel my lips undress your eyes?\\" These guys are not typical of the genre. Sure they \\"could  \\"die\\" or be killed in a number of songs and \\"This Fire\\" sounds like something you'd hear in a club rather than from a rock band, but  they are definitely new sound and one I find a lot of fun to throw on.  <br />
B00005JOYM|1.0|The first 20 minutes were very good as were the last 20. The 1.5 hours in the middle, however, were long and tedious. Basically the story of 2 trapped men and their families who wait for answers. No inspirational story of courage under fire or of men who risked and/or gave up their lives saving others. Just 2 guys at the wrong place and at the wrong time who got lucky, when thousands of others didn't! No heroics here except for the people that rescued them. DON'T GO SEE IT; DON'T EVEN RENT THE MOVIE! WAIT FOR IT TO COME TO HBO.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I first listened to this cd when I was 13 and now nearly 10 years later my feelings are the same.  No other album has wowed me and caused me to think about the highs and lows of life in such a profound manner.  I have had friends listen to it and this album has literally changed lives.  Some people even reported not committing suicide after hearing it.   I know when I listened to it I never listened to music the same again.I think if I didn't listen to that album at that time in my life my musical choices further down the road would have been completely different and not as good as they have been. I have even cried listening to this album.  I thought it was just me but then the assload of grammys and great reviews for it confirmed my feelings. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS ALBUM BEFORE ALL THE HYPE!! You MUST listen to every song and in order.  If you don't you won't appreciate the experience known as \\"Ok Computer\\".  You have to really sit and listen.  There have been stories of people that had this album  for years and hated the first song and didn't listen to it for awhile went back and listened to the whole album and fell in love..........and gained a whole new understanding of life.  Every song has meaning and depth, even the weird ones lol.  BEWARE IT IS REALLY WEIRD BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT A CHANCE AND GET INTO IT LOL.  Once you \\"get it\\", something clicks inside of you and you say, \\"Oh my God\\" and you realize so many new things about yourself and life.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink continues to write biographical songs that hit you in the heart.  She takes a more lyrical approach on this album but still keeps her hip hop roots.  Not a bad song among the bunch --\\"Stupid Girls\\", \\"Dear Mr. President\\", etc.
B00005214X|3.0|<br />George Harrison's contributions to The Beatles albums were always standouts; the judicious use of a few of his strongest numbers made each song an important contribution to the whole. ALL THINGS MUST PASS gives you an understanding of what the unchecked Harrison was going to accomplish without the confines of \\"The Beatles committee\\" judging his songs. While there are a number of wonderful songs here, this much Harrison is not always a good thing. With all-star band backing and co-production by Phil Spector, ALL THINGS MUST PASS succeeds in unleashing all of Harrison's pent up creative energy, but it also lacks the self editing that would have made this a truly stellar work. There are wonderful melodies here but there is also a dated quality; when you run into a song like \\"I Dig Love\\" you can immediately date it to a certain era. I understand Harrison's need to create this work, but taken as a whole it just doesn't hold up as well you would hope. <br />
0893860220|5.0|I teach comparative religion at the university level and I have personally studied Advaita, Zen and Taoism since I was a teen-ager (I'm now 54). A woman introduced me to this book 30 years ago, but I wasn't quite ready for its exquisitely simple and profound message. Then, at age 41, after a couple decades of sadhana, I had a huge awakening. At the time, I subsequently looked for books that would help me to convey my understanding in clear English, and I returned to \\"I AM THAT\\" by Niz. Wow! Every line in the book resonated at the deepest level of enlightenment. I consider this the single best book on Advaita ever published. It cuts through illusion like a buzz saw. Also highly recommended: \\"Pointers from Nisargadatta Maharaj\\" by his most famous student, Ramesh Balsekar.

I think Mr. Puzo <br />has a good book here. Not a masterpiece, though I <br />don't know exactly how it could have been written better. <br />It just seems to me a little more overdramatic and <br />unreal than it did back when I first read it. 'Over the <br />top' might be the best way to describe it. I could not do it <br />as well, not even close, either writing it or imagining, <br />but I can't give it more than 3 stars.

0761129235|5.0|This book is not like reading a novel, it is more of a working manual. I've enjoyed the easy to read chapters about taking small steps.  The Kaizen way is like eating an elephant...one bite at a time.  The best part of the book is the Kaizen Techniques located at the end of each chapter, the \\"how-to\\", which describes how to put what you've read into practice.  This book enhances my personal development and compliments Purpose Driven as well as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  Robert Maurer is on the right track and I will share and recommend this book to both family and collogues.

B000DWMN2S|4.0|Elijah Wood stars in \\"Everything is Illuminated\\", a rather quirky film, apparently based on Jonathan Safran Foer's book of the same name. <br /> <br />Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Safran Foer, a young Jewish guy who is quiet, awkward and prides himself on being something of a collector. He collects bits and pieces that evoke memories of his family, anything from a piece of jewelery, to a handful of dirt, even pieces of food - anything that was there during the many and varied moments of their lives as well as his own. He's not exactly sure why he does it, it's just something to do. Jonathan's collecting takes him to the Ukraine, to find the woman who saved his grandfather's life during the second world war. With the help of a tour guide who can speak \\"premium English\\", and the guide's near-blind grandfather to drive them both, Jonathan makes his way across the beautiful country. As they go, there is many a discovery, many a culture shock and many a shocking revelation. <br /> <br />It took me a little while to get into the film, but I liked it when I did. It was mainly the sense of humour that it took time to key into, and the slightly odd characters. Everyone plays their part well, particularly the Ukranian cast, who seemed very genuine indeed. The scenery is lush and beautiful, and its filmed very nicely. The Ukraine itself is also a star of this movie, I think. Though I couldn't understand the lyrics (I don't speak Russian, but I'd like to), the music playing on and off in the background was pretty neat, and fit the atmosphere of the film well. There's a lot of emotion in the film, and it all ebbs and flows well. There's the occaisonal arty flourish in terms of direction, but I don't think it gets too pretentious anywhere. <br /> <br />Special features include the original theatrical trailer and a lengthy montage of deleted scenes. The most notable of these includes a fantasy of Jonathan's while at his grandfather's funeral, where he receives an award from Hitler for keeping the most comprehensive record from his family. Among the crowd at this fantasy awards ceremony are famous faces like Mother Theresa and Gandhi. It's very, very strange, and I'm not really surprised that it got deleted. <br /> <br />Worth a look, I think.
B0002KVULG|3.0|When I saw first saw this version of Dracula it wasn't remotely scary.  The movie definitely had a strong budget and it showed, when they didn't use excessive shadows.  They even had a few good shock scenes like the life or death struggle on the boat, and Mina as a vampire, (reversing which woman became undead), but that's not the same thing as good suspense and sense of dread.  New Dracula films make the mistake of trying to make him too human and sympathetic.  I considered this to be the worst version of the horror classic until the Gary Oldman fiasco.  There were no scenes in Transylvania.  Again Universal studios saw fit to adapt the Dean/Balderston stage play, not Stoker's book.  So the movie seemed too stagey.  Tony Haygarth basically played Renfield as a lower-class thug.  Renfield has never been played exactly as he was presented in the book.  In Stoker's novel, R M Renfield was 58, and incredibly stong, even when he wasn't in one of his murderous rages.  He could be clever, conniving and sadistic.  He showed on occasions that he may have come from a gentlemanly class, but otherwise the cause of his mental illness was never explained.  Sometimes his discussions bordered on the intellectual.  He even dies as a hero.  Jack Shepherd in the 1977 BBC production, \\"Count Dracula,\\" probably came closest to the character, although he didn't seem particularly strong.  Donald Pleasance essentially played Dr. Seward as he would any other role, but brought an unfortunate sense of humor to the proceedings.  He was also too old for the part, because in the novel the character was only 29.  Trevor Eve and Kate Nelligan only delivered functional performances.  Unfortunately, Eve played Jonathan Harker as a jealous jerk.  Nelligan played Lucy as some kind of prototype feminist, and even runs off with Dracula, instead of being actively involved in hunting him down as in the book.  Lawrence Olivier was a disappointment as Van Helsing.  He did a good job with the accent, but making his Van Helsing a frail, vegeance seeking, elderly man reduced the integrity he had in the book. Interestingly, when Lawrence Olivier died in real life, most recaps of his career that I've read didn't even mention this movie.  Frank Langella seemed miscasted in the part of the demonic Count, but I always thought he would make an ideal Lord Ruthevan if a movie studio made a film version of the Dr. Polidori tale, \\"The Vampyre.\\"  Even more annoying was that they were continuing the deadly sunshine nonsense, albeit with some slight changes, first introduced in Nosferatu Eine Symphonie des Grauens.    This movie continues the trend of trying to create familial relationships between characters that didn't exist in the novel.  In the novel, they were all moving in their own circles with some friends in common, but only gradually pulled together as a fighting team.  Usually one or more of them are dropped from the film adaptions.  The only exception was the Oldman version, but the characters were so different from the book they could just as well have been different characters all together.  My favorite Dracula of 1979 was George Hamilton in \\"Love At First Bite.\\"  He admitted patterning his performance after Langella's stage version of Dracula, but he was doing it in humor, and with an outrageous Hungarian accent.  He also brought something new to the part, a strong sense of lonliness.
B000002J2D|4.0|This disk is just what I expected from the old Genesis, which was perfect. That old Genesis sound, which disapears with later work, is still here. Great to just listen to and get into it.
B000HCO840|4.0|Still greatly entertaining, even though, not the best of the 3 films. I will have to have this film in my collection and will watch it at home again and be totally entertained. I am sure there will be a forth and I cannot wait. I so enjoy these cartoon characters, come to life movies and I will always be a fan of X-Men. Such a wonderful escape for me. Sit back with a bag of popcorn, a soda and just exist in the amazement of modern technology combined with old comic books. :)
B00005JLEU|5.0|I don't know anime but I know what I like. I liked Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and a lot of other people must have too, because this particular anime won an Academy Award. <br /> <br />Chihiro is moving a to a new house, and soon she'll have to start a new school too. She is not happy about this at all. On the way to their new house in their car, her father decides to take a shortcut through a forest full of strange shrines and statues. The road they take ends all of a sudden at a tunnel, which they follow through to what appears to be an abandoned village full of restaurants. They find one of these restaurants filled with delicious food, which Chihiro's parents sit down and begin to eat. Chihiro tries to get them to stop but they don't, and soon turn into pigs. Night falls on the town, and the restaurants become filled with spirits, come to feast and to relax. It turns out that this place is part of a bathhouse complex for spirits, run by a very large headed woman.   Chihiro doesn't want to be turned into a little piglet girl, so she is forced to get a job at the bathhouse. While she works in this thriving colourful place, she will meet many strange and interesting beings, make all sorts of friends, and uncover several mysteries. Changing schools is easy compared to all this business! <br /> <br />It seems to be a trend in Japanese films I've noticed that they don't really explain what's going on in great detail. The ins and outs of things are really only divulged on a need to know basis. They expect you to catch up as you go, which is basically what Chihiro, our main character has to do too in this strange world. There are stacks and stacks of ideas here. It's a very colourful, very imaginative place, with full of weird and fascinating creatures and beings. They don't only look interesting, but many of them have a very interesting motion, if that makes sense. They move in a unique way, thanks to some clever animation. Check out the \\"Stink Spirit\\" and the mud and gas flowing from his mucky body. Check out how the boiler man uses his \\"four-arm\\" strength without batting an eyelid (not that you'd be able to see his eyelids, he's wearing glasses). The score is good too, orchestral, though unlike some recent Western films, doesn't get in the way and does actually enchance what's going on. <br /> <br />I've been going through Miyazaki's back catalog of films lately, and I'm noticing a few themes and motifs going through his work. Here in Spirited Away we have a dramatic scene around a simple flight of stairs, just like in \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", which he'd do later. Also like he'd go on to do in Howl's, there are curses that transform people and people who can turn into flying creatures. There's a lot of flying in his films, actually (\\"Nausicaa\\",\\"Porco Rosso\\"). I kind of thought \\"Porco Rosso\\" too when I saw the parents turned into pigs. What an odd world the man must have going on in his head. Got a few more to hunt down and watch of his, and I very much wonder what I'll see next. <br /> <br />Anyone interested in a good fantasy, interesting animations or some fresh imagination, I recommend you check this film out.
B000005RQT|4.0|THE BAND: Ian Gillan (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1970) Originally 8 tracks long clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. This digitally remastered (UK) version released in 1995 adds 12 bonus tracks bringing the total listen to just over 78 minutes. This is the band's 4th album. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/time/credits, numerous photos (some unreleased); a brief insight to the making of and happenings during the time the album was made - by Roger Glover and (writer) Simon Robinson (with quotes from Gillan and Lord as well); and the discography of \\"In Rock\\" in various countries. Label - EMI Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: After purchasing the \\"Machine Head\\" and \\"Fireball\\" deluxe anniversary packages... I couldn't wait to get my mitts on \\"Deep Purple In Rock\\". Every song is a fast paced rocker here with the exception of the ten minute \\"Child In Time\\" - one of my favorite slow rockers... and one of Gillan's many highlights vocally, as well as Lord's wonderful slow intro and Blackmore's guitar solo once the song picks up. For some reason, I was thinking Roger Glover cold fix the original tapes and make these songs sound like they were recorded last year. Not so. The sound is still as muddy as ever. In many places, Ian Paice's cymbals & hi-hat are non-existent. Lord's organ/keyboards are mixed so poorly at times it's tough to distinguish between his high notes and Blackmore's high notes. Disappointing to say the least - it still sounds like a.m. radio. I grew up with Deep Purple and I have 17 of the discs. \\"In Rock\\" was easily not my favorite, but it was definitely top 5 due to great songs like \\"Black Night\\", \\"Speed King\\", \\"Flight Of The Rat\\" and \\"Child In Time\\" (check out the live version of this song on \\"Made In Japan\\"... I'll go out on a limb and claim it's better than the studio version here). \\"Black Night\\" and \\"Speed King\\" made it to most of their greatest hits compilations, while \\"Child In Time\\" made it to a few. The bonus tracks are a plus. Though the sleeve will have you salivating at \\"12\\" bonus tracks, it's really only \\"6\\". The other \\"6\\" are intro's to each song lasting on average 20-30 seconds each. Various chit-chat and Blackmore fooling around on his guitar. These 6 bonus songs sound great... slightly different, and much improved sound over the original 8 tracks. 2 of the tracks are unreleased - \\"Jam Stew\\" and \\"Cry Free\\"... both treats! Two bonus versions of \\"Speed King\\", and an unedited remix of \\"Black Night\\" are the highlights. In my opinion, the back photo is very telling... Glover is front and center and the backbone of the band - perhaps the glue keeping the 5 members together (knowing how Blackmore and Gillan got along). For me, this is a very good album, but the poor sound quality keeps me from rating it any higher. The lone track \\"Child In Time\\" and the bonus songs make this a must-have disc.f their greatest hits compilations, while \\"Child In Time\\" made it to a few. The bonus tracks are a plus.

B00005JOYM|4.0|Amazingly filmed and acted.  Nicholas Cage is at his best.  The special effects were incredible.  It looked just like what we saw on television when it was happening.  I found it amusing that actor Peter McRobbie played the father of Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jimeno's wife) and he also played the father of Jake Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain.  Maria Bello was great as always.  A fine movie.
B0009R1T7M|1.0|I don't ususally write reviews to put things down, figuring that if I don't like something, perhaps I just don't get it, so I should keep thoughts to myself.  But this album topped so many critics lists for 2005 that I feel compelled to comment:  It's just not that good.  It's not that I don't get it.  Yes there are a lot of clever things going on, and I've really tried to like it.  But what does it all add up to?  What's the point?  Try as I might, I find it boring and tedious.  For me it completely lacks any true soul of what music should be about and be trying to say.  I realize that is a personal observation, so you may still really like this.  For me, I'll stick with my own favorite of 2005, \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" by Franz Ferdinand.  I guess I like to get my fill of clever lyrics with rocking guitars and cool dance beats rather than flute recorders and choirs.
B00003CXD5|5.0|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) I'm not a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart's works with the exception of this classic John Huston production, which won Oscars for both John and his dad Walter Huston. Walter overshadows Bogie as Howard, the grizzled and wise old prospector. Former cowboy star Tim Holt provides solid support for both men. The movie is notable for John Huston's use of veteran Mexican actors who speak (and carry) the film in their own language with no subtitles whatsoever needed to understand the proceedings. A true rarity for its age and a film way ahead of its time.
B00005JOYM|5.0|There is a key scene missing from Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER.  It's the scene that is forever burned in my brain.  We saw it hundreds of times, over and over, the local news couldn't help but show us it with a frequency that could only be called sadistic.  Since the scene is not present here the film works. Because it's not there the film has a resonance much higher and more powerful.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that has all the cards stacked against it and succeed because it remembers that 9/11 was not a day about politics, it was not a day about heroes or villains.  No, 9/11 was a day about people doing their jobs and stepping up in the face of tragedy.<br /><br />When John McLoughin (Nicholas Cage)and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) showed up for work on this morning they never expected to find themselves buried under the rubble of the Twin Towers.  They assumed the day would be pretty uneventful.  They kissed their wives, hugged their kids and went to work.  But, when duty called these men answered it, and found themselves trapped.  Leaving their families wondering, their friends comforting, and a country mourning. In a matter of hours these two Port Authority Police Officers fought for survival, and made themselves and many other men heroes.  A lot can happen in the midst of evil, and sometimes it can inspire the greatest good.<br /><br />What WORLD TRADE CENTER does best is transport us back to that day.  When we woke up that morning all was well, by the time we went to bed the whole world felt the repercussions. On September 11th politics was put on the back burner, our petty differences fell away, and we became united.  Some gave blood, others cleaned up, for one grand moment America seemed like one.  American flags flew, police and rescue workers streamed into the city to help, the once loathed Mayor became a hero, and the President's rally cries were heard and accepted.  Oliver Stone's film captures those moments with such reckless ease, its amazing he got away with it.<br /><br />The film is the embodiment of people who are holding onto the mundane problems in the world.  Holding onto the mundane because the gravity of the world around them is too much to bare.  My favorite moment involves Jimeno talking about the theme song to Starsky and Hutch.  On the surface it's a man trying to use comedy to quell his fear, but the scene goes deeper, this man is holding onto a stupid television show because it proves he's still alive.  Hollywood has given us heros whose lives are so exciting and are always exciting.  But real people have down time, they laugh, they go see stupid movies, and watch stupid television shows.  The only way to hold on is to revert to the mundane, it's the only cure for a world gone insane.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena embody McLoughlin and Jimeno with real humanity.  The film traps them under rubble for most of the films running time, so all they have is their voices, their emotions, and their humanity to get them through.<br /><br />On the surface,  Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play these men's wives with a vulnerability and fierceness.  We see their pain, none so clear, as when Gyllenhaal as Jimeno's wife wanders aimlessly around a pharmacy trying to clear her head, or getting out of the car because the red light is too long.  That light never seems so long as when you need to get somewhere fast.<br /><br />I've heard many say \\"how dare they make this movie?\\"  \\"How dare Hollywood profit from this tragedy?\\"  I say \\"how dare we leave our history to be written by people with an agenda., by people who didn't live through it?\\"  Ten years from now I would be proud to show this film to the next generation, to show them that amidst all the upheaval, amidst all the tragedy, America was united for one brief moment.  WORLD TRADE CENTER has no agenda except to harken back to a time we've since lost.<br /><br />WORLD TRADE CENTER is missing one key scene. It's missing the planes flying into the building.  This is not a film about terrorists, or evil. This isn't even a film about the Twin Towers.  This is not a film about planes, presidents, or what has happened since.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a deeply moving example of people who wanted only one thing: to get home from work that day.ssing the planes flying into the building.

6303334598|5.0|If I could make one change to this movie, it would be near the end when Angel (Isaac Hayes) tells what happened to each of the characters...I would have added a brief cameo of Muriel (played brilliantly by Rosie Perez) getting her just desserts...I would show Muriel, working in a nail salon, with a bitter look on her face, slamming things around, with a rude customer barking orders at her.  Other than that, great movie!
B000002AZX|5.0|I'd lost track of Mr. Cohen until the new movie \\"I'm Your Man\\" came out this year.   The movie goes into the back story on a song I'd never heard before \\"Hallelujah\\".  I had to have it and found it here on 'Various Positions'.  <br /> <br />You HAVE to buy this CD for the song \\"Hallelujah\\".  Hear it once and you will never get it out of your head (dare I say soul?).
B0001GF2DS|5.0|You know you love a flick when you've watched it over fifty-something times over your life. Such is the case of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, (1966) my favorite film of all. This was the third and final installment in Sergio Leone's Man With No Name trilogy which turned Clint Eastwood into an international super star. This film has it all: Action, adventure, humor, plot twists, and the best western showdown ever. Eli Wallach practically steals the film from Clint, but it wouldn't be the top Western at the Internet Movie Database if all three actors didn't give it their very best. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are a trio made in heaven. Sergio Leone's genius (which influenced the likes of Quentin Tarantino) only adds to the equation. You owe it to yourself to OWN this masterpiece. But also watch \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" and \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" to truly appreciate Leone's groundbreaking, revolutionary work. Fans of other sagas with similar elements such as the Star Wars Trilogy may prefer watching these films in their proper chronological order for greater effect: First \\"TGTB&TU\\" followed by \\"Fistful\\" and finished up with \\"Dollars.\\"<br /><br />Note: This version contains scenes that never made it in previous cuts. They add to the story in certain ways, but I believe they seriously detract from the characters in others, particularly in Tuco's and Angel Eyes' cases. Leone aficionados who own both the regular and extended versions know what I mean. Wallach and Eastwood's voice overs sadly point out that the men have truly aged and simply sound out of place. The worst part is Tuco singing. It goes against everything the character stands for in the story, turning him into that typical Hollywood cliche: The merry Mexican bandit. Contrast this with Tuco's dramatic reunion with his brother at the monastery and you'll understand why this scene was left in the cutting room. Nonetheless, you should own at least ONE version of this classic. You won't regret it!
B000FSME1A|3.0|I was very excited to see this \\"Complete Dossier\\" version of when checking out Amazon.  I cannot tell you how bummed I was that the \\"Hearts of Darkenss\\" documentary was not included in this.  I have the VHS edition of it, but would really like a DVD version.  It truly is one of the best filmmaking docs ever.  i am a huge fan of documentaries, and the fact that Hearts can only be had by finding a used VHS copy off of Ebay is just tragic.

006056251X|5.0|By far my favorite of the Wallflowers. Sebastian is the epitome of a bad boy, wild rake, and the differences between both of the characters and how they are drawn to one another is such a passionate novel is wonderful. Its nice to see each others qualities bring out the best in one another, and this novel was written beautifully on top of it. The wallflower series is one of my favorite because Kleypas finally hit something on target that I frusterate over since college...she write series without skipping a beat. Each novel literally picks up from the last page of the previous one in sequence. I love it! Definately don't wait for your copy at the library..buy this one..its worth it and I am sure you will want to read it over and over again!
B00006DEFA|5.0|Amadeus (1984) The epic (and at times, darkly comedic) story of classical music genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Milos Forman directs F. Murray Abraham in the role of his career. Abraham bested co-star Tom Hulce for the Oscar as Alberto Salieri, Mozart's greatest rival and (in an ironic twist of fate) his fiercest admirer. The opening narration by the demented and destitute composer, his closing views on life in general and his absurd surroundings are worth the price of admission alone. If you have ever read anything about Mozart you still need to see this grand epic of triumph and tragedy, joy and sorrow, loyalty and betrayal. In short, the essence of life itself.
B000E1MTV8|4.0|This is one of those movies I like while watching it, but soon after forget the plot.  It has a great cast, lots of action, but leaves me feeling a bit empty afterward.  So for me this is a rental and will not be added to my collection.  The picture quality is decent, but I'm not sure I would replace the SD DVD with the HD version (if I owned it.)   <br /> <br />The whole Blu-Ray vs. HD DVD argument is getting a bit tedious, but I'll weigh in.  I've owned my Toshiba HD DVD player since launch day and I've enjoyed it.  I was originally going to wait until a format \\"won\\", but the release of Serenity pushed me off the fence.  If HD DVD dies, I'll still have a collection of dozens or hundreds of movies to watch-much like I did with laserdisc after DVD killed it.   <br /> <br />Right now, Blu-Ray only has single layer 25 GB discs and Sony is using the inefficient MPEG-2 codec (compared to Microsoft's VC1 used in nearly all HD DVD titles).  This has resulted in a poorer picture and fewer extras.  Dual layer discs are on the way, but studios may not use them (they may be too expensive in the near term.) Also, the studios could switch to VC1, but again that is up to them.  While the picture quality on even the best HD DVDs is excellent, most will not notice the improvement over standard DVD unless they view both side-by-side.  This makes an HD DVD player purchase difficult to justify.  The lower picture quality of Blu-Ray, combined with the much higher player price is even harder to justify and will keep me from getting Blu-Ray until it can at least match HD DVD's quality.

1400079179|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is a lively suspense thriller that brings up a multitude of sensitive issues.  The #1 thing to remember when reading a Dan Brown novel is that it is fiction. It is designed to shock, entertain, and make you think.  Sure, it purports to be based on historical research and it doesn't do a bad job, but it isn't a reliable source for history like so many naïve people take it for.<br /><br />Robert Langdon is called in to observe a murder that has taken place at the Louvre museum.  Langdon becomes a fugitive and with the aid of the murdered man's granddaughter, seeks after a hidden secret that has the power to change the word as we know it.  This leads him on a path involving conspiracies, secret societies, and plenty of puzzles.  I am amazed at how much negative feedback the recent positive reviews have garnered.  People don't seem to understand that the book is fiction and is aimed to entertain.<br /><br />I deducted a star due to the cookie cutter formula Brown uses early on. The story is sometimes so similar to Angels & Demons its ridiculous.  For example: Langdon is awaked by an unexpected phone call, he receives a grotesque picture of the victim, the villain is some mysterious persona that communicates via the telephone, and the heroine (in this case, Sophie) has a special relationship with a murdered father-figure.  Despite these glaring similarities, the novel makes for a fun read.  It brings up points that any Christian should consider.<br /><br />This book has generated some serious buzz due to the whole Jesus Christ-Mary Magdalene thing.  I get the impression that several believers hate the book because of this.  While the book brings up some serious points, it isn't anything a good Christian shouldn't have already come to grips with.  Are we really so insecure that we have to tare it down and call it trash?<br /><br />I watched two Christians (a Catholic and a Born-again) loose their cool in my medieval history class in college.  Learning about the Council of Nicea absolutely rocked them.  They were so angry at the professor for teaching history as it happened.  Get a grip, people.  Knowledge is powerful.  Faith is also powerful.  They don't have to be at odds.  I'm not saying what this novel suggests is true, but we shouldn't be so insecure about it.  You don't build faith by avoiding the uncomfortable questions.lutely rocked them.  They were so angry at the professor for teaching history as it happened.  Get a grip, people.

B00005A0V0|5.0|Without fluffing this up too much, I just want to state that the reason this album works so well is because of one man: Richard Sinclair. Perhaps I am partial to his music and achievements outside of Caravan, but I can see no other reason why this album has succeeded where many others in the band catalogue have not. The previous two albums in the Caravan discography are nice enough and worth checking out, but they seem to be lacking. The band was fully entrenched in the quirky psychadelic music of the late 60's, but aside from some moments on \\"If I Could Do it All Over....\\", there aren't any strong, distinctive elements that set the group apart from its peers. <br /> <br />During the production of this album, \\"In the Land of Grey and Pink\\", for whatever reason, Richard Sinclair came into his own as a songwriter. His writing and performances on the album are far from stunning: he's a decent enough singer, can pluck out a few chords on the guitar, but certainly no virtuoso. No, what Sinclair brought to this album was his sense of humor and fun. The whole thing begins with the classic \\"Golf Girl\\", a silly and campy song about a man who falls in love with a golf course employee. The melody and chord changes are nothing revolutionary, but again there is a light-heartedness to the song that is instantly appealing, even if the lyrics make little sense. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the best track on the album is \\"Winter Wine\\", another Richard Sinclair composition. The song begins with Richard plucking on an acoustic guitar and singing a folk-sy tale of yearning, castles, dragons, and various other fantastical things. The song picks up steam at roughly the 1:00 point, with a strong guitar riff and drum beat. The progression is pretty steady throughout its length, with plenty of jamming on organ & guitar, courtesy of Dave Sinclair (Richard's cousin) and Pye Hastings, respectively. The key to this song is that it is lovely, it also grooves, and it is fun. <br /> <br />Pye provides his sole contribution to the album \\"Love to Love You\\", which has a simple but catchy feel to it. The song has its own sense of fun, and the music is strongly appealing, but lacks the absurd humor of the Sinclair tracks previous to it. Coincidentally, the shortest track on the album. <br /> <br />The title track: again, nothing ground-breaking in terms of song writing, but it is good fun and Sinclair sings about all sorts of strange nonsense. The wonderful thing is that the absurdity is never off-setting. <br /> <br />The monster on this recording is \\"Nine Feet Underground\\", courtesy of Dave Sinclair. This is among the fan favorite recordings of the band, and it's not hard to see why. Unlike the previous tracks, it has many extended instrumental passages, with plenty of organ playing and grooves from the band. Strangely enough, the song doesn't FEEL as long as it does, and almost places the listener in a trance. The solos are never overly complicated, which is sometimes a fresh change from the million-notes-per-second mentality of other prog groups. <br /> <br />Plenty of bonus tracks here, but I won't get into them (this review is long enough!). My overall feeling about this album is that, although it doesn't have a ground-shattering effect on the music scene, it does present Caravan as a fresh and unique voice in any field of music. Unfortunately Richard Sinclair would leave the band after this album, and Caravan would continue to provide us with catchy, sometimes epic songs with Pye Hastings trademark dry humor and arrangements (see For Girls Who Grow album). This is so much fun, very much a product of its time and almost Brit-centric humor, but a worthy purchase!
073933235X|5.0|Wether or not you have a interest in cooking or if you are a accomplished chef this book should be of interest to you.It starts out with the authors realization that food was sdomething more then a item that is shoved in your face. Just being out of high school and not having much success with college so he goes to a resort with friends and through his start out job as a dishwasher notices that that the cooks or chefs are treated as rockstars and this sets his career choice in motion. You follow along as starts out in culinary school with the CIA when it was not so prestiges and takes various jobs starting his own catering business, working at various high end resturants along with those he started you hear about his success and his failure with in the business and personal life. <br /> <br />He introduces you to quite a cast of characters that he has worked for and with and those who with undying loyalty work for Mr. Bourdain. You are given helpful hints and information for those who want to be cooks  in their own homes or want to progress to open there own eatery. I found the info about eat fish in resturants and which days are recommended and why.  <br /> <br />Mr. Bourdain and his cast at times are quite crude but i feel this make this book all the more humorous to the point you will have tears in your eyes. He does state for the record that his kitchen is probably unique as far as that crude and straight forwardness and yet they work so well together. They could not have done this book justice by having anybody else read it so it is good that mr. bourdain reads this it seems to make it more complete. I deifintely and highly recommend this book

B00004XPPC|4.0|The Bridge On the River Kwai (1957) William Holden and Alec Guinness clash while prisoners of war at a Japanese camp. Loosely based on a true story, the movie takes some liberties with the leading characters, so for you historical buffs out there research is recommended. I'm not too keen on Sir David Lean's epics due to their tendency to drag on for quite a while but I do admire the vast scope of his productions. The famous \\"River Kwai March\\" is just as memorable as the film's literally explosive ending. Although Holden is billed as the lead here, it was Guinness who grabbed the Oscar gold as a veteran Brit with a bridge to build whose duty places him at odds with Holden and the true goal of the film: To destroy the bridge at all costs. Jack Hawkins co-stars as the only character with enough common sense left by the end. Perhaps the most watchable of Lean's films on a repeat level.

I bought a copy for my homedawg, DJ Honeybear, and the UMD version for myself! I could not believe the cinematic brilliance of this movie! Truely one of the best cinematic features I've ever seen in my life!<br /><br />Somebody else said \\"jawdropping video presentation\\" or words to that effect, and I would have to agree with that!

B00005JOML|2.0|I sat in my seat at 9:15 pm and didn't leave the theatre until 12:10.  When you go to see a good movie, usually that's not a problem.  When you go to see a movie like Miami Vice, it's a huge problem.<br /><br />There isn't a whole lot to add to the other reviews here.  I stopped caring somewhere around the halfway point.  Jamie Foxx mails this one in.  It almost seems as if he's trying to keep from laughing throughout the entire movie.....as if to say \\"yeah I know this movie stinks, but hey, it's a paycheck.\\"  Colin Farrell.....my god, Colin Farell.  His performance was the most cardboard I've seen this year.  No, seriously, I think he spent his entire time on the set drunk out of his mind and it came through in his acting.  Honestly, I can't recall any good Colin Farell movies now that I think about it.  In my mind, he's the male version of Milla Jovovich (whenever you see her name on a billboard, run the other way screaming).  Back to the movie though.....in short, it's your typical Hollywood remake.  No creativity, no relation to the source material whatsoever, and incredibly forced and cheesy.<br /><br />Once you get past the terrible acting, the story kicks in.  It's not a bad story, but it was poorly executed.  The movie is painfully slow and takes forever to get to the point.  Once you make it to the second half, it does manage to turn up heat/pick up the pace during the action scenes.  The trick is staying put long enough to make it that far.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend going to see this movie.  Wait for the DVD instead....and be sure to buy a used copy.
0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai (1954) Akira Kurosawa's cinematic masterpiece, featuring the talents of Toshiro Mifune and some of Japan's greatest actors. It's a timeless tale of seven men who are hired by poor villagers to protect their homes and lives from rampaging warlords. Remade in Hollywood as The Magnificent Seven which pales in comparison to its original source material. Quite simply, one of the greatest films of all time. It is extremely long but so are the finest of novels so keep this in mind. If you don't understand Japanese subtitles get you there. But the acting and storyline flow so well that you'll hardly notice. There's a reason this film is right up there in the Internet Movie Database's Top Ten. Check it out and you'll know why!

1400079179|4.0|The Da Vinci code; a truly brilliant book filled with modern day religious icons, is a type of book that has been turned around in a mischievous way. Dan Brown, the author of this book, begins this ambitious piece of literature by centering all the main events in Paris. He also makes the plot of this whole story to revolve around a character named Sophie N., of who is supposedly the descendant of Jesus Christ. She is pursued by an insane monk, who was hired for as a cleanser from a bishop {of whom is under the reign of the \\"teacher\\"), and Sophie is accompanied by a cryptologist, Prof. Langdon. This story suggests that it is up to the both of them to reveal an ancient secret that may either disrupt or revolutionize the current religions of our time.<br /><br />This book contains accurate information based on the reading of the bible. Unexpected events, twisted plots, and etc. help endow the fantasy of this whole story become seemingly true; though it technically isn't. Secret societies, Mary Magdalene being married to Jesus, and the Holy Grail being a woman is just one of Dan Brown's many ways of affecting the human psyche into thinking as if this story were actually true. This book influences me to solve what's out there, and not to bury myself into the religious-slurs and etc. from what this book is. This book is not supposed to revolutionize the world's religion but rather revolutionize the world's intellectual curiosity; especially in the fields of entertainment.
B000EHSVQE|1.0|Godawful, unwatchable, un-funny, and just plain yucky.  I don't think filmmakers can guarantee their cleverness will come across to viewers.  In this case, any cleverness failed to find its way to me.  The characters are unlikeable and don't seem to like themselves or each other.  Animals are treated cruelly in a gratuitous attempt to make humor out of nothing amusing. <br /> <br />When I think of yucky films that work anyway, ones amused and entertained me, I think of John Waters' \\"Pink Flamingoes\\" & \\"Female Troubles\\" and Pedro Almadovar's \\"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\\" & \\"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down.\\"  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" does not even merit mention in the same paragraph as those films, except as an example of what DOESN'T work.

I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say, you will be shocked!<br /><br />Rent this one, and enjoy an excellent movie!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check yoself, 'fo you wreck yoself!
0780626966|5.0|This is a great product for any horror fans, or those who love great stories in films. A must have for my collection.
B000089RVX|5.0|I got this CD for my birthday last year, but didn't get round to playing it until about 11pm (promptly fell asleep and Haunted gave me nightmares). And I've got to say that save Origin, this is my favourite CD in the entire world, full stop, no questions asked.  <br />GOING UNDER: Didn't like this one that much at first, and it's only recently that I've really started to appreciate the phenomenal vocals on this track, possibly the best vocals on the whole CD. Amy belts out the chorus with everything she's got, growls the dark verses to great effect and the whole thing climaxes with 'I won't be broken again!' and a decent riff from Ben Moody. 8/10 <br />BRING ME TO LIFE: Aha. People generally have one of two grudges against this song, one that it's overplayed, in which case I can point out that it's overplayed for a REASON, because people LIKE IT. The people who complain that this song is too 'mainstream' are generally the type that shun anything that is popular regardless of the quality because they're so desperate to be different. The other problem people have with this song is the whole tired Christian debate. I am an athiest and personally I think that just because she's begging to be saved, that does not necessarily imply salvation through religion. She wrote this about a PERSON who she believed could see into her, so suck on that, biatches! I love this song, it grabs me from the first gentle piano notes, building into a passionate chorus interpersed with some reasonable rap from Paul McCoy of 12 Stones. 9/10 <br />EVERYBODY'S FOOL: This one really spoke to me - in it I can see stupid shallow celebrities *coughParisHiltoncough* and all those cows who pissed you off in high school. The song lashes out and reinforces the image of the Amy we love - the strong woman who shuns the pressure to be a size zero blonde who sells her body to the media, does her own thing and looks damn fine! I loved the choral work in the background. 7/10 <br />MY IMMORTAL: What can I say?The vocals are weaker than on the whole band version, but the piano is a lot more delicate, so each has their redeeming features. Those bloody strings are irritating though... 8/10 <br />HAUNTED: Kills the peace of My Immortal totally. Personally I find it a bit too dark, a bit too wild - Watching me/Wanting me/I can feel you pull me down/ Saving me/ Raping Me - it's an unsettling song. I have to be in a certain mood to listen to it, but I loved Moody's riff, not to mention the fabulous choral work that makes this album so unique 7/10 <br />TOURNIQUET: It's a bit emo, I've got to say, and it's not my favourite. It plays around with the Christian view on suicide and it's definitely interesting, if not quite my cup of tea 6/10 <br />IMAGINARY: This is the most metal of the three released versions of this song, very gothic and very whimsical. I loved the lyrics and I think this track would do great music video material. Great riffs again from Moody <br />TAKING OVER ME: My personal favourite. It's quite simply a love song, passionate and beautiful and achingly sad. It deserves more credit , despite its slight poppy feel because it's so vivid and genuine. I especially love the lines You saw me mourning my love for you and touched my hand/I knew you loved me then. 10/10 <br />HELLO: Beautiful rippling piano, sombre cello undertones, low vocals that climb to a climax at 'Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken!' Sure, it's depressing, but it's not exactly going to be a cheerleader chant if it's a tribute to her dead sister, is it? It's a personal song for Amy and I think it was very brave to put it into the album 7/10 <br />MY LAST BREATH: A desperate attempt to convey a message of love at the deathbed, with Amy's soaring, passionate vocals, strong drumming and an interesting techno intro. Great song 8/10 <br />WHISPER: This one really rocks, powering in with a strong guitar intro and Amy's breathy 'Catch me as I fall'. The verses are great, and the chorus has fascinating background vocals that give the whole thing a new resonance. The strings and the Latin chorus that close this track showcase the uniqueness of Evanescence. <br />MY IMMORTAL BAND VERSION: Bloody beautiful. I read some review saying that Mozart could write the piano part in his sleep and I'd just like to say - WELL DUH! MOZART WAS POSSIBLY THE GREATEST MUSICAL GENIUS IN HISTORY! EVANESCENCE AREN'T CLAIMING TO BE MOZART, YOU IDIOT!!!  <br />What else is there to say about this song? What CAN you say? You just need to listen
B000GCFO0I|5.0|For those of you who have played the game, the visual images in the movie will remind you of your gameplay as if you were immersed in the world of Silent Hill.  For those of you who have never played a Silent Hill game, the images are still quite disturbing but may not have the same resonance as those who have played.  Bottom line, this movie is well worth seeing.<br /><br />Silent Hill (The movie) doesn't suffer from the usual video game to movie translation issues... if you want to see a bad example just rent DOOM or Street Fighter.  Although there are some dialogue issues (\\"Everything will be alright\\"), the movie moves along at a brisk a visceral pace.  The action, the visual effects, keep you glue to the pace of the movie and the mystery deepens and grabs you as you peel off each mystery behind Silent Hill.<br /><br />Overall, a great cinematic experience that is made even better because of its reflection of the original games' concepts.
B000002UAU|2.0|For many years 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' topped nearly every single magazine Best Album list, which amazed me since 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul' were far superior and were usually relegated to much lower positions on these lists. But lately, music critics have realized that this is, in fact, not even close to a top-ten album.  <br /> <br />By Beatles standards, this is the second worst album they released (Abbey Road finishes dead last). While I admire the experimental recording techniques, the bulk of the songs are twee and silly. Plus, there are NO rockers on this album! At least the Stones indulged in some rock riffing on their own sub-standard psych record 'Their Satanic Majesties Request'.  <br /> <br />For some GOOD psych, research The United States of America, Love, Silver Apples, Tomorrow, Red Crayola, Hollies, Amboy Dukes, The Creation, Smoke, The Move, The Action and West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. These bands have what the Beatles failed to deliver.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really missed this show, I am so happy that they released it for DVD! I just hope fox re-releases this show (with the same people) anyway if you really like SciFi you will love this show.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show is incredible. I absolutely cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. It's one of the best shows on TV since Angel was cancelled. \\"Scary Just Got Sexy\\" is right, with the amazing talents of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki the characters take a life of their own. It's a down-right scary show with plenty of \\"chick-flick\\" brotherly love moments to balance it.  <br /> <br />This DVD set will pull me through, waiting for Season Two to air on the New CW.  <br /> <br />I recommend it to all viewers! This is a must-buy for anyone who loves the supernatural/sci-fi/humor genre that was created by the amazing Joss Whedon and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  <br /> <br />Best Episodes: (my opinion) <br />Pilot, Dead in the Water, Bloody Mary, Skin, The Journey Home, Asylum, Faith, Nightmares, The Benders, Something Wicked, and Devil's Trap. <br /> <br />Quotes: <br /> <br />Dean: \\"Sweetheart, I don't do shorts.\\"  <br /> <br />(Sam and Dean are posing as potential homeowners) Lynda Bloome: \\"Well, let me just say that we accept homeowners of any race, religion, color or...sexual orientation.\\" Dean: \\"Hmm, right. I'm gonna go talk to Larry. Okay, honey?\\" (slaps Sam on the butt)  <br /> <br />Dean: \\"I hope your apple pie is friggin' worth it!\\" <br /> <br />Harry:- \\"W. W. B. D- What would Buffy do?\\" <br /> <br />Dean: \\"So, Sam. Who do you think is the hotter pyschic, Patricia Arquette, Jennifer Love Hewitt, or you?\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000GFLKF8|3.0|Not sure how to say it, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. Not sure where some of these rave reviews are coming from either, it definitely wasn't that good. The movie was not bad, nor good, just OK. The performances were fine, as you would expect from the names, but somehow the movie didn't quite come along. <br /> <br />Yes, the plot was different than I expected, and that added a little intrigue, but in the end, it just didn't amount to much. Denzel is always good, and without him, this movie would probably have gotten 1 or 2 stars. The bad guy was good also (i.e. the acting), but Jodie Foster's character was a little stereotyped, not real believable.  <br /> <br />Back to the plot. As I said I liked the concept, again though, in the end, they just didn't pull it off. At times it wanted to be funny, at other times gritty and tough, at other times smart and interesting. However, it was actually a little predictable in places, corny and naive in other places, and OK in some places. The net result, just an OK movie....in places. <br /> <br />Go for it and watch it if you like the actors, but don't expect any fireworks.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just watched this again recently when the History Channell was having a marathon and I have to say it is one of if not the best WWII epic of all time. It is right up there with such classics as The Longest Day and Tora Tora Tora in my opinion. The acting is superb and each episode draws you in with each story. Also I must say this was a bonding moment with my dad and I. We are both big history buffs but this set is a true experience.
0060920084|2.0|Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.  <br /> <br />My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here.
0880794968|5.0|You can't go wrong in buying this deck.  If you're just starting to learn about Tarot, the Rider-Waite (and this Universal Waite, nearly identical except for better coloring), is classic and basic, while still containing amazing subtlety in the imagery and meanings.  Not that there is anything wrong with the more unique decks, I have a few myself, and enjoy them all the more in comparing the symbols in other decks to this deck.  It's the classic symbolism that holds true so long after the deck was made that makes this such an excellent deck for reading or meditation.  Even though I own other decks, and am sure to collect many more, it's the Universal Waite deck I turn to when I want clear-cut readings or want a meditation key sure to work.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend Rachel Pollock's `Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom' when you purchase this deck.  She uses the Rider-Waite deck in her book, and since they're nearly identical, all her explanations of the symbolism carry over to this deck seamlessly.  In reading with other decks, the foundation of learning Tarot with the Universal Waite or Rider Waite is valuable in learning to look for the details in other decks as well.<br /><br />The backs are fully reversible, and one of the prettiest around in a simple, but elegant, stars-on-midnight-blue pattern.  The cards seem to stick together slightly when they're new, but after about a month of handling them a few times a week, the shuffling is much smoother.  They're also laminated lightly, so sure to stand up to years of constant use, and even resist a splash should someone clumsy spill their tea around you.
B000021Y77|4.0|Lola needs to get hold of 100,000 Deutschmarks because her boyfriend Manni left a bag of money on the subway (or light rail). If she doesn't get it in 20 minutes, he will rob the store near the phone booth where he called her. The money belongs to a gangster who will kill Manni if he doesn't get the cash. <br /> <br />There are three different scenarios on Lola's mad dash to rescue her boyfriend. It shows how each encounter with people changed their lives. <br /> <br />I liked it because it was different from any movie I've seen. It got a little too far out with the very brief moments she brushed by people. But the main parts of the story was good. <br /> <br />Well, great idea for a script. Just needed a little tweaking.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series had such potential...it is an absolute travesty that it was pulled as early as it was.  The episodes in the DVD collection, including some that were never aired, take you on a fantastic journey and introduce you to characters that you care about after the first episode.  Joss Whedon does it again.  This series is a must see.
B0000640VO|5.0|I though it was a charming film. A young woman who is an daydreaming introvert (perhaps in part due to being raised by self-absorbed parents and having no friends since she was home-schooled). She moves away from home as soon as she is old enough. She finds a box in her apartment that belonged to a boy who lived there in the 50's. Amélie goes on a crusading mission as a do-gooder when she finds the now middle age man. Why? Because she enjoyed seeing his reaction of being reunited with his lost childhood treasure. During this time of her life, she develops a crush on a man similar to her and tries to hook up with him.
0393317552|4.0|In GUNS, GERMS and STEEL, Jared Diamond brings a unique perspective to the long debated question of why certain societies (those in, or derived from Europe and Asia) are dominant in the world today. Unlike our history classes, which state proximate causes (science and technology, writing, political organization, etc) Diamond seeks to define the ultimate causes.<br /><br />Basically, the ultimate causes boil down to the fact that certain continents (particularly Eurasia) were more conducive to food production and animal domestication, as well as the diffusion of food products (due to an east-west axis verses north-south axis with climate and daylight variations) than others. Food production entailed sedentary large populations and food surpluses, so (certain) people in food producing societies could shift their attention from getting food to serving in armies, inventing technology, organizing societies, and so on. Thus, food-producing societies with their large populations, standing armies, and better technology overcame hunter-gatherer societies wither smaller populations with poorer technology.<br /><br />Diamond's theory applied to the real world is as follows: Eurasia historically had an environment packed with domesticable plants and animals as compared with other continents, and thus Eurasians became food producers long before Native Americans, Native Australians and Africans. Thus, Eurasians were able to expand their population and focus on things other than food gathering, such as technology, and political organization for a much longer period of time than members of other continents. Eurasia's east-west axis promoted not only the diffusion of domesticable plants and animals but also of goods and ideas, allowing societies in Eurasia to improve on each other's technologies. Thus, by 1492, Eurasia was greatly advanced technologically and politically as compared with other continents. The 'Clash of Continents' could only have one result: the victory of Eurasians.<br /><br />His theory is simple, but extremely provocative. It does a great deal to explain why the world is as it is today- continents did not start on a level playing field- and differences in environmental 'endowedness' has translated differing levels of societal development/dominance.<br /><br />Note, Diamond uses his theory not only to explain the rise of Eurasia over other continents, but also explains intra-continental shifts as well: ie, why the Bantu became dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, why Austronesians became dominant in South-East Asia but not New Guinea, and why the Maori people conquered the Moriori people in Polynesia. Its focus is refreshingly non-Western, quite unlike my 'Western Civilization' history class I took in high school.<br /><br />The book also gives a nice introduction to subjects that many of us are not familiar with, such as geology, linguistics, archeology, cultural anthropology and evolutionary biology. (I never thought linguistics would be so fascinating!)<br /><br />However, as provocative as the book is, it is flawed in several respects. One is Diamond's curious decision to make the book about 400 pages. This is too long to describe his basic theory (which, as I mentioned above, is actually rather simple) so there is much repetition of his basic idea. On the other hand, 400 pages is not nearly enough space to provide comprehensive explanations of various other fields of inquiry (ie, linguistics, anthropology, geology, etc) needed to back up his basic claim, along with a thorough review of world history. Thus, his forays into these other subjects as well world history feel incomplete and rushed.<br /><br />More importantly, Diamond makes a critical, but completely unnecessary decision to view human history through the lens of science. Thus, he sees explaining human history as on par with explaining glaciers, nebulas, hurricanes and biological species. Concepts such as human choice (culturally and individually) and free will arerelegated as `idiosyncrasies' and 'wild cards' to be examined only after environmental variables are exhausted. Even these factors are ultimately determined (say by quantum mechanics), if not always predictable.<br /><br />Yet, for all his purported enthusiasm for turning human history into a science, Diamond started the entire project based on a rather unscientific assumption- that people of New Guinea are likely smarter than the average American and European, which led him to ask, why did Europeans rather than New Guineans end up with more 'cargo?' Yet, a truly scientific explanation of historical trajectories of different societies needs to methodically explore possible differences in intelligence among different peoples.<br /><br />Furthermore, Diamond's decision to ally with science prevents him from making explicit value judgments on different societies, historical events or future prognoses.  However, throughout the book, one can sense a rather unscientific bias towards simpler societies, simpler times.  New Guineans hunter-gatherers are smarter than Euro-American TV watchers.  Hunter-gather societies are 'egalitarian' while modern states are all 'kleptocracies.' Hunter-gatherer societies do not have organized religion (which Diamond views, negatively, in a narrow sense) while states depend and thrive on it.<br /><br />Finally, Diamond's deterministic view of human history completely prevents him from suggesting possible corrective measures to the problems arising from world inequality.  He alerts us to the crucial fact that the playing field was not, and is not, level. However, the only conclusion he can possibly reach is quite pessimistic: the environmental 'haves' will generally end up dominating and conquering the 'have-nots, although human/cultural 'idiosyncrasies' may alter affect this pattern in some unknown way.<br /><br />But perhaps this is not necessarily the case. Rather, with proper motivation and encouragement (from human individuals and groups who are not satisfied with the passivity brought on by determinism) perhaps environmentally well-endowed societies can assist their less favored counterparts both environmentally and technologically. Rather than being resigned as 'wild cards' of history, perhaps we as members of the human race should help each other level the playing field, and work to create a better world for us all.be examined only after environmental variables are exhausted.

B000EOTTV8|5.0|<br />It was funny and heartbreaking. Felicity Huffman plays Bree/Stanley, a transsexual days away from her operation to turn her into a physical woman. Her complicated life becomes more complicated when her son from her one sexual encounter contacts her for help. He's a sexually abused child who is barely an adult. She bails him out of jail but keeps secret who she is. Lots of unusual situations come during their ride to California.  <br /> <br />This is a fantastic movie! I like how people were people instead of stereotypes. This isn't a typical Hollywood movie. It gets you to think and feel complex emotions.  <br /> <br />If you are willing to open your mind and heart, this is an awarding movie to watch.  <br />
B0002W18MU|5.0|I love the sound of singers as they age and although Johnny's voice does not sound as good as on the other American Recordings, it is deeply profound. Lots of deeply spiritual material on this album. I can't stop listening to \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\". I've listened repeatedly and am not tired of this one yet.
B000022TSY|3.0|I was 11 years old when this came out. So of course I heard a lot about it but didn't see this movie. So when I had a chance to watch it I decided to see what the fuss was about. Well, considering the times it was made, it was a radical departure from the norm. Nudity, pot smoking and perhaps other no-nos of that period.  <br /> <br />The story is kinda boring. Two motorcycle enthusiasts take a trip to New Orleans to go to Mardi Gras. There is tragedy because of prejudice and so there is a sad quality to this film. Still, it's not a great movie just ahead of it's time...maybe. Plus it introduced the great actor Jack Nicholson.  <br />

B000DWMN2S|5.0|A young Jewish-American man (Jonathan played by Elijah Wood) goes to the Ukraine to learn more about his grandfather who escaped the Nazis. He hires a young hip-hop loving Ukraine native and his curmudgeon grandfather to drive him around. All three find out more about themselves on this journey. <br /> <br />The first 40 minutes or so was very funny. The absurdity of living I guess. The young Ukrainian man seemed more American then the stuffy prematurely old Jonathan. Then it becomes somber when some hidden truths are revealed.  <br /> <br />I really liked this movie. I liked it enough if I was visiting someone and wanted to see this movie I would watch it again.
084317689X|5.0|This is another great book that I had when I was a child. And once again, I purchased it for my daughters to enjoy.
B000BZIST4|3.0|I was only 14 when this movie came out. I did see it either as a teenager or in my twenties. To be honest, it's as difficult to keep track of now as then. <br /> <br />I think we all know what it's about and if not look elsewhere online. What I noticed was this wasn't a film aimed at my generation (Baby Boomer). It was for middle age people at that time tired of what they perceived as permissiveness. These guys were cracking down on drugs coming into our country. This movie came out when Nixon's modern-day \\"War on Drugs\\" began in 1971. Personally, I think it was a waste of time and money. Even in this film (fiction), nobody served in real time. Four years was the maxim given to one out of several people they were after.  <br /> <br />One odd thing I noticed was Popeye Doyle's hat. He wore a pork pie. My dad wore a fedora until sometime in the '80s (he was born 1910). Men started to stop wearing hats when Kennedy came into office because he didn't were one. This film was made at a time men's hats were almost out of vogue. I noticed that men wearing them were at least 40, most closer to 50.  <br />
B00005JKES|5.0|I love Twin Peaks, the creepy weird town created by David Lynch and Mark Frost.  WHERE IS #2? and Pilot episode releases?  <br />Just hearing the Theme song makes the hairs of the back of my neck freeze.  FREAKY........

B000002MP2|5.0|Im having a blast from the past listening to this album. i defenitly recommend it. BEFORE BUYING AMERICAN IDIOT SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CLASSIC! its the best album by them. u wonder why it went diamond and is their most successful album? this is one of those albums that u must include in a time capsule. here we go. ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls....WELCOME TO PARADISE <br /> <br />1. Burnout-A great opening track. i strongly relate to it. I'm not growing up, i'm just BURNIN OUT <br /> <br />2. Having A Blast-An awsome song to listen to after you've been dumped. it keeps me going. <br /> <br />3. Chump-I relate to it. i always have as0sh*oles that steal the girls i like. and not to be conceided but im a lot better looking than those guys that the girl pics. <br /> <br />4. Longview-I dig the drums and bass. I relate to this and like most of the songs on this album its fun to sing along. that bass is so signature and recognisable. <br /> <br />5. Welcome To Paradise-Another exciting tale told by Billie about living in the town he and Mike lived in before they we're big. highlight of the album and a singalong favorite. a little polished and the kerplunk! version is better. <br /> <br />6. Pulling Teeth-I love this song.it's not a song that u'd picture green day singing. its about a pillow fight Mike and his then girlfriend we're having that ended in the accident-proned Mike breaking both his arms. (I'm all busted up/Broken bones and nasty cuts/Accidents will happen/But this time I can't get up.) fun to sing and i like to dedicate this song to my girlfriend because it's also a love song. (She takes good care of me/Just keep saying my love is true.) (Courtacy Reprise Records, 1994) <br /> <br />7. Basketcase-This song couldn't get better. It's probably the most-known pre-american idiot green day song. the video is classic, too. very wierd and dream-like. <br /> <br />8. She-I used to really like this song but im kinda sick of it now. its really short at 2:13 <br /><br />9. Sassafras Roots-The title has nothing to do with the song and the song is not that great. i usually skip this. <br /> <br />10. When I Come Around-Once upon a time, me and my then girlfriend got into a fight (No, not a pillow fight like in Pulling Teeth, a real fight) and i didn't talk to her the rest of the day. that night, i heard this song on k-roq and i realised i related to it. i stood outside her window at 9 P.M. singing it as loud as i can and the neigbors called the police and i got arrested. but the happy ending is we got back together cas she fell in love wit the song and my character. <br /> <br />11. Coming Clean-Really short. but i like it. a song about billie coming to terms with his bi-sexuality. u rock, billie! <br /> <br />12. Emenius Sleepus-thats latin for something. anyway im not too crazy about it. <br /> <br />13. In The End-I like this song and relate to it. <br /> <br />14. F.O.D.-Stands for F0uck Off and Die. written about billie's stepdad the chorus was deemed so offensive that they didn't copy the lirics, but they didnt censor it on the cd. whats so offensive about it? billie is saying what he thinks of the stepdad. i don't blame him. <br /> <br />*bonus track* All By Myself-Echoes the sub-idea of the album about masterbation which billie apperantly loves to do. tre sings this one. he plays this geeky guitar playing underdog singing a song about a girl where he finally ejaculates at the end of the song indicated by the POP! <br /> <br />good record and ultimately the best these guys are lyrical geniuses.  enjoy    buon appetito!
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is a very well-done, powerful movie.  It kept our attention until the end.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This neglected Kubrick classic, based on Thackeray's picaresque novel about the rise and fall of a wild Irish boy in 18th-century Europe, is a gorgeous study in the beauties of light and stillness. You could probably say that about all of Kubrick's films but the formal elements stand out especially strongly here, where there's not as tight a narrative---or an actor as charismatic as Jack Nicholson, Malcolm MacDowell, James Mason, or Peter Sellers---to pull you along as there are in some of his other films.<br /><br />Kubrick resolved to film with exclusively natural light, a challenge for any director but especially tough when you're shooting a period piece by night in grand European castles. Kubrick's devotion (obsession?) was such that he had a special lens created---now known as the Lyndon Lens---for shooting the candlelit night scenes. Many of the exterior shots are set up in deliberate imitation of 18th-century landscape paintings, and at times the film resembles a moving painting more than a talking picture. Seeing a picture shot in natural light, where shadows shift and move at random across the actors' faces, reminds you just how artificial the \\"normal\\" light in movies really is.<br /><br />While the visuals are through-the-roof great, and set a new standard for costume dramas, I had a harder time caring about the story. I couldn't figure out what drew Kubrick to Thackeray's novel; it didn't seem to touch on his pet themes as clearly as some of his more famous films. Maybe he was attracted to the duels: there's something about the combination of brutality & violence with the civilized trappings of rules, codes of honor, and glamorous hardware that reminded me a little of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"2001.\\" Ryan O'Neal does a fine job as Barry, but he seemed to disappear once he married the rich widow and the story lost a lot of its interest for me after that. Warts and all, it's a memorable movie by an undisputed genius of film.
0553214632|5.0|Is all intelligence not God? <br />Is all scientific explanation not for understanding the way he works? <br />I know that science and religion go hand in hand. <br />God is the word. God is light. This we all seem to agree upon(?). All matter, as proven by science, in it's littlest form is light. Then everything is God. We are all gods. That is what we are here to realize. In my perspective -- where I am in my current state of spiritual evolution, the way I see the whole creation debate, directly mirrors the illusion of duality.  Adam and Eve are symbolic representations of the male and female aspects of the universe. Ying and Yang. Shiva and Shakti. There are many terms that God has brought into manifestation by means of our human brothers and sisters. These terms are to help us understand. Storytelling. What is it's purpose? These are all stories. This is one big story. (or \\"interpretive dance\\" as i like to call it.)So why must the story of creation have a scientific explanation? The reason is religion. God is the doer of all. This is only one of millions of lifetimes that we have experienced on our journey back to him. In the beginning, we were all one, all home with God. God created the universe in six days and rested on the seventh. And ever since then, his cosmic energy has brought into manifestation, all that is. The planet we live on is evolving.As humans in our current lifetime, we have the power of will and the freedom of choice. Any intelligence that we may posess is of God. He is omnipresent. he made souls in his own image. How can one deny that apes have no souls? I believe that every living organism, even germs have souls. Whatever form we have come to be now is what we have chosen to be, and why? So that we can learn the lessons that we must, to overcome the illusion of duality. Good and Evil. For God is niether, he is neutral, he is love. And so are we! The kicker is in our consciousness. If you can meditate until God speaks with you, he will probably tell you what you need to know. About evolution, about anything. He doesn't want us to fight. He is peace. I haven't even read or purchased this book yet. But in response to the reviews that I read, I just had to say (jumbled up as it may seem) my thoughts. [and if they make any sense at all, that's God's voice speaking.] The science of religion can be and has been discovered by many. I am in the beginning stages of my practice. It is the most personal science out there (in here...). Yoga is the scientific method for God or 'Self-Realization.' Most of the wisdom as posted above, is unfolding in my consciousness due to God presenting me with a book a few years ago at a neighborhood yard sale, called \\"Autobiography of a Yogi.\\" The author, Paramahansa Yogananda was a fully God-Realized man, who came to the west to spread the philosophy of yoga through his organization that is based in Los Angeles, California; called the 'Self-Realization Fellowship.' In regards to evolution, Paramahansa Yogananda has spoken with God about it. Maybe we should too.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|If you have ever wonder, just how Peter Pan came to be. Well you are going to get pretty much the story in this movie, Finding Neverland. The movie takes place in London of 1903, and don't you noticed, how there are authors that sets thier story in thier hometown or country, like J.K. Rowling does with the Harry Potter movies, but I had better get back on subject, before I fell off of it too much. The movie stars with another play on openning night written by Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp), we met his wife Mary Ansell Barrie (Radha Mitchell), that once an actress, but retired from the stage, and vmeets an eldry woman, that was a big fan, and tells her that she misses seeing her on the stage, she sends one of the crew members to look for her hushband. The play ends up a flop, and now he needs a new idea, he walks his dog to Kensington Gardens, where he meets a young boy being held as a prisoner under the bench, and soon he meets the whole family headed by widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her sons George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Peter (Freddie Highmore) and Michael (Luke Spill). He becoems quicky friends with this family, and at dinner, his wife tells them to invite the whole family for supper, inluding Sylviana's disapporving mother  (Julie Christie), who both end up not liking the idea that James spends his day with the family, of course, he does anyways, and well I let you watch the rest of this movie to find out what happens.
B00005JLXE|5.0|This film has to be about the best action movie I have ever seen (bar fast and the furious: tokyo drift). <br /> <br />I enjoyed every minute of this film and I especially liked Evenesence's Bring Me To Life video.  <br /> <br />The storyline is original - I haven't seen any other films about blind superheroes have you? <br /> <br />PLOT: <br /> <br />Matthew sees his father helping to beat up someone else when he is a boy. He turns to run but trips over a barrell of toxic waste, blinding him.  <br />But his other four senses are enhanced to superhero level and he uses it to fight crime.  <br /> <br />A great stoy , I recommend it to all ages.
B000GGSM76|4.0|After releasing the bleak and unconvincing collection of songs called \\"The Top,\\" something extraordinary happened to Robert Smith. In a manner that was almost completely unpredictable, Smith abandoned his own prejudice against acoustic instruments, hummable melodies and `pop' arrangements. The result was \\"The Head on the Door,\\" the most accessible Cure album yet. Maybe it was because Smith finally found bandmates who were willing to wear their hair in the same ridiculous bat's-nest style that he was known for (the photos are hysterical), but there is a simpatico sensibility to the look and the sound of this band that makes \\"The Head on the Door\\" the most fully realized collection of songs released by any incarnation of the Cure.<br /><br />Things are immediately promising when the lead-off track is as compelling as \\"Inbetween Days.\\" The subject matter is rather typical for Smith, dwelling on his own misery, but here he actually manages to make the listener feel sympathetic as he extrapolates past self-loathing and toward genuine emotional expression. \\"The Kyoto Song\\" regresses back to the bleak hopelessness that Smith lapses into too easily (\\"A nightmare of you, of death in the pool, wakes me up at quarter to three...\\"), but \\"The Blood\\" once again finds something deeper than hopelessness for its subject, utilizing religious imagery as a metaphor for dichotomy, and it is all the better for it.<br /><br />\\"Push\\" may be the most hook-laden song ever recorded by the Cure, allowing over two minutes for the music to develop and set up the vocal melody. Tonally, it falls somewhere between the Psychedelic Furs and early U2, which makes it a perfect snapshot of `80s pop music. Just as convincing is \\"Close to Me,\\" which utilizes a maddeningly simplistic keyboard riff and drum-machine rhythm to express self-doubt, while unconsciously convincing you to dance. Coming on the heels of such bleak fare as \\"Pornography\\" and \\"The Top,\\" it is a bit of a revelation to hear Robert Smith find his expressive voice in settings that are so pop-music friendly, but that is exactly why \\"The Head on the Door\\" is so accessible, and why it holds up so well even after twenty years. The bonus disk offers an additional eighteen tracks of demo recordings and live material.<br /><br />B+ Tom Ryanxpressive voice in settings that are so pop-music friendly, but that is exactly why \\"The Head on the Door\\" is so accessible, and why it holds up so well even after twenty years.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars purists were a bit put off by The Phantom Menace when it was first released.  But I liked the film and felt that it was a wonderful way to introduce new characters and new generations to the Star Wars universe.  The special effects have finally caught up to George Lucas' visionary imagination, so unlike the first series of films, nothing feels particularly forced or hokie, not even the much maligned Jar Jar Binks.   <br /> <br />To be sure, much of The Phantom Menace feels like a live action cartoon.  Still that only adds to the fun of which focuses on the adventures of an adorable and unusually gifted young Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd).  The surprise of this film are the strong female characters, Anakin's mother Shmi, played by the noted Scandinavian actress Pernella August, and the young Queen of the Naboo, the brave Padme played Natalie Portman.  Padme and her character's body double, famously portrayed by Keira Knightley, manage to create interesting personas out of characters who are outrageously overdressed in a variety of elaborate costumes.   <br /> <br />Still Lucas' film settles into a series of set pieces which feature two Jedi Knights, Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor as the young Obi Wan Kenobi, assigned to rescue and protect a young Queen, who stumble upon a young boy who may or may not be the fulfillment of a great prophecy.  The Queen turns out to be perfectly capable of taking care of herself and her sworn enemies.  The little boy, born a slave on an outer rim world, proves to be much more of a problem.  The hidden enemies include not only the hideous Darth Maul but also a much oilier Sith Lord who masquerades as a sincerely ambitious politician. <br /> <br />Considered within the context of the Star Wars entertainment universe, Phantom Menace serves as an opportunity to rekindle interest in the franchise, introduce new characters and provide substantial back stories for the beloved characters of Obi Wan and Yoda.  On a deeper level, PhantomMenace also restarts the legend of a the holy child, a once and future hero whose fate is to serve as the essential character in a fable about the nature of good and evil.  <br /> <br />We already know how one part of the story ends: Anakin's children, particularly his son Luke will help to restore him to the Light side of the Force. What this story fills in are the key elements of the beginning of the tale.  What was there about young Anakin that created such a fatal flaw that the greatest of Jedi Knights would become the monstrous tool of Imperial authority Lord Vader?  To care about that part of the story, we have the genuinely like young Anakin and the other key personalities in the fable. To that end Portman and MacGregor have the most work to do in creating the emotional framework that will center the next two stories.   <br /> <br />Lucas, the storyteller, waited a long time to tell us what happened then.  The movie leaves us wanting to find out what happened next.
B000GGSM7G|2.0|I believe that virtually all negative reviews are borne from prejudice, and this one is no different. When I say \\"borne from prejudice\\" I mean that pre-formulated impressions or an innate inability to understand the artist's intent are usually a factor in developing negative opinions, so it is imperative that all negative reviews be interpreted with the understanding that it is more than likely the reviewer is completely full of s#$%.  Regarding \\"The Top,\\" the fifth album credited to the Cure, I already had my mind made up about the record before I even heard it. In their earliest years, I thought the Cure were an interesting band with little technical ability but a unique sensibility that set them apart from other bands. I sort of liked them for their first three albums. Then, during a trip to England in 1982, I found myself in a London record shop on the day that the band's fourth album, entitled \\"Pornography,\\" was released. Oh, lucky me.<br /><br />I hated that record. To my ears, it sounded like somebody took the band's first three albums and blasted them through a garbage compactor and into a canyon, resulting in an unbearable noise that never relented (you can read my review for \\"Pornography\\" elsewhere, if you wish...). I never really forgave the band for this, and as a result, I more or less abandoned them...which is why I never heard \\"The Top\\" until twenty years later.<br /><br />Do I think I missed much? No, unless I can quantify the comedic aspect of listening to something so bleak, self-obsessed, and disorganized as if it were meant to be funny. I am sure that my attitude will only add to the alleged horror that is experienced on a daily basis by Robert Smith and his uber-depressed fans, but parts of \\"The Top\\" are so `over the top' that I can't help but laugh out loud. The affectation of Smith's voice when he sings \\"Dressing Up\\" is one of the most un-deliberately funny moments I've ever heard. \\"Give Me It\\" shares the relentless penchant for noise that made me hate \\"Pornography\\" so much, only it adds disgusting imagery into the mix, with lyrics like, \\"Slit the cats like cheese, then eat the sweet sticky things. Suck Harder! Suck Harder! Suck your insides out...\\"<br /><br />\\"Piggy in the Mirror\\" is meant to convey an emotionally harrowing moment of self-loathing, but it comes off like another bad-hair day for Robert Smith. The album never gets any more emotionally compelling than this, either, and the extra disk of `bonus' material adds little except half-baked demo versions of songs that should never have been extrapolated on in the first place. The album's best track, \\"Shake Dog Shake,\\" opens with a self-mocking \\"Ha Ha Ha\\" that more or less defines my own attitude about the entire album; It's funny, but it isn't `Ha ha\\" funny...or, at least, this is what my predisposed prejudice has me thinking about \\"The Top.\\"  C- Tom Ryan\\"Pornography\\" so much, only it adds disgusting imagery into the mix, with lyrics like, \\"Slit the cats like cheese, then eat the sweet sticky things.

B00005K3OT|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  It's not your average love story of tortured hearts.  It is mixed with some fun whimsy and a sexy Gypsy.
B0002W18MU|4.0|The album's producer described this collection of songs perfectly.  Johnny Cash's voice is both strong and struggling, depending on the notes and phrases he belts out. <br /> <br />There is no other artist that can break an audience's heart just by listening to the telltale words of the song stories.   <br /> <br />The most refreshing part of Johnny Cash's music is that he covers song titles so well that I forgot who the original artists were.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Although Boston's debut album is by far their best seller, and seems to be the favorite Boston record of everyone I know, it's not mine. In my oppinion, \\"Don't Look Back\\" is Boston's best. I played this baby constantly in college, and it still sounds fresh today. Every song is so good, it's difficult to say which one is my favorite. Objectively, I would say \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\" may be the best written songs, but \\"Don't Be Afraid\\" is the song I can't listen to sitting down. I'm not sure if I've heard that song in a long time without my voice screeching along with it. <br />All in all, \\"Don't Look Back\\" is THE classic Boston album for me! <br /> <br />
B00005V9IL|4.0|I gave it a four stars because I haven't actually watched the movie yet.  I saw it several years ago when it came out in the theaters and remember some of the plot, but I haven't watched the movie after receiving it.
B00024I31C|4.0|Great music for a relaxing sunny day at the beach.  Despite some serious themes in the lyrics, you can put a smile on your face, have your favorite beverage or whatever, and kick back for the sunset.  Having owned Clapton's 461 Ocean Blvd. album for 20 years, I see why people compare Cale to Clapton, though it should be the other way around.  Great album from start to finish.

B0002O06N0|4.0|This is the only Black Keys CD I have listened to, though it will not be the last.  It was great on my latest road trip.  It rocks with a fresh, raw sound from start to finish.  70's blues rock meets White Stripes ~ Rolling Stones from the 70's.  There are so many \\"alternative\\" sounding bands, it is nice to hear some unbridled bluesy emotion in music.  Create some space in your living room and get out your air guitar for this one.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|A little slow and confusing in spots, and pretty hard to believe Portman as a lowly office clerk.  But a very interesting plot and premise. Good story about an idea and trying to make a difference.
B000002JS6|5.0|It is definately their best work. The songs were written for Bon Scott to sing, But he died,so Brian Johnson became lead singer. He puts all he has into this recording!
0783225547|4.0|Dante's Peak is as about as good as disaster movies get.  First, Brosnan is very good as the hunk expert with a hunch; he's certain that that volcano's gonna blow, but is not egotistic about it.  He pairs up with Hamilton very well, and is extraordinarily good in the scenes with her children. <br /> <br />The special effects in the movie are absolutely first-rate, and the movie uses these with great energy and excellent pace.  There are a few wacky, completely-forget-about-science scenes, but not too many to be overly bothersome.  Bottom-line is that Dante's Peak is a lot of fun to watch, and it easily passes the watch-again test.  Recommended.
1594200823|4.0|The first two parts of the book are well written and extremely informative, revealing the mostly hidden world of industrial and \\"industrial organic\\" food production, respectively. Everyone should learn these things. <br /> <br />The second part also gives a grand tour of local, pastoral farming, and it shows how such methods may truly be best for every member of the food chain. However, the writing sometimes crosses over into hyper-idealized fantasy; another reviewer was entirely correct when he called the book \\"a hagiography of Joel Salatin,\\" the miracle farmer of rural Virginia. Time to come up for air, Mr. Pollan. <br /> <br />The third part, unfortunately, is just so much urban intellectual navel-gazing. These 130+ pages can be summed up in a single sentence: \\"Ooo, hunting is intimidating and disgusting.\\" To anyone who hasn't spent their entire life sequestered in a Blue State megalopolis, the author's tale reads like the noodlings of a dilettante -- as if simply walking through the forest was a wondrous revelation. Thoreau you ain't, Mr. Pollan. <br /> <br />Of course, this book -is- primarily targeted at other urban intellectuals, so my frustration with the third part may be my problem and not the author's. Fair enough. My advice to readers, then, is to know when to stop reading.
B0007GADZO|5.0|Steve Vai. What ISN'T there to say about him? He played with Frank Zappa, David Lee Roth, was taught by Satriani....... hes been a genius since he first entered the scene. But this is a whole different level. People will complain about it not beign heavy or anything, and how the \\" envelope is being pushed the wrong way\\" but I have one thing to say to them : Grow up! <br /> <br />This is music for people who love music, not just in for a cheap adrenaline rush. There's a little bit of shred, a bunch of cool whammy tricks but most of all a true embracing of the instrument vai has come so close to mastering. <br /> <br /> <br />In short : This is the best vai disc since Passion and Warfare.  <br /> <br />Buy this if you're open to true music, and inventive musical ideas....NOT if you just want to hear someone play fast, though vai happily does do just that on some tracks.
0393317552|4.0|Though there are many comments already published on this site that will help you decided about this fabulous creation, of which I may have difficulty to shine much more light onto subject; except, that it will educate you and make you think. However, if you have not already read this book, I would recommend that you may want to look at Mr. Diamond's earlier creation (if you have time to read only one) which some would consider his genesis for Guns, Germs & Steel, and that is \\"The 3rd Chimpanzee\\". This lesser known book and its many subject matters provided (for me) a more educational value of the concepts which Mr. Diamond goes into further and more defined details with the publications of Guns, Germs & Steel.<br /><br />Either case, Guns, Germs & Steel or The 3rd Chimpanzee or both books are worth one's time if you want to learn about how and why things are as they are. Or as the first chapter of Guns, Germs & Steel sets up your journey for is, of New Guinea's Yali's question of \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, and we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" Either book will give you the answer, or at least make you ponder the question. Two (2) great books.

6304602944|2.0|I'm surprised by all the favorable reviews.  I typically like \\"buddy movies,\\" \\"cop movies,\\" and action thrillers -- even when the plot runs out midway through the flick.  This, though, was so goofy (Stallone's lines were wooden, all the characters were patently cliche, etc.) that I found myself skipping through chapters because my gut hurt watching various scenes.  There's a scene where (yet again) Kurt Russell dresses in drag; there's a ridiculous scene in a prison where countless inmates were able to get out of their cells and meet the stars in a Batman-esque laundry room to do battle; once the stars escape from prison, they freely walk around town talking and meeting with people (despite the fact that they previously were high-profile cops who everyone in the city presumably would recognize); Jack Palance (one of my favorites) barks out nothing more than expected tough-guy lines while kissing mice and putting them in a maze (like some diabolical James Bond plot); and, speaking of James Bond, there's a ridiculous sequence where the stars visit a goofy \\"Q-type\\" who gives them a GMC Jimmy with a gatling gun welded on the side -- as though that's supposed to \\"wow\\" us in this day & age.  All in all, while I'll confess to owning more than my share of Sly Stallone & Kurt Russell movies, this one was absolutely awful -- even when treated like a Saturday matinee when the rest of the family is gone and you're laying on the couch with nothing better to do.  A far cry from any of the Lethal Weapon movies....
B0002EXH40|5.0|This CD isn't \\"selling out\\". Sure, this CD is different from their past releases, but it kicks a s s in a different way. The complex solos and awesome riffing are still here, just at a more mid-pace speed. This CD also includes the awesome yet beautiful ballad, \\"A Tout Le Monde\\". This CD isn't without heavy tracks, such as \\"Reckoning Day\\" and \\"Train of Consequences\\". Overall, I feel that this isn't their best work, but it's nothing short of awesome. This CD should be yours if you like Megadeth.
B000AP04FG|2.0|If you like your movies to be full of whizz-bang escapism, no major storyline or ponderables then this is the movie for you. Plenty of guns, action, comedy, good looking stars, and Vince Vaughn adds his usual spark of comedy. But in the grand scheme of movie making it is pretty much a throw away item, a good example of the current Hollywood movie making standards. Turn on and dis-engage brain.   <br />
B0000CDLA7|5.0|So what if Dream Theater got a bit heavier? That doesn't make this nu-metal. In fact, this is my second favorite DT CD next to Images & Words. James LaBrie sings in a bit raspier tone than usual here. I actually like it better, as his vocals are a little less pretentious. Petrucci isn't nu-metal at all. He still shreds and solos like a monster. There's still awesome keyboarding, and the rhythm section is tight. This CD kicks a s s. I highly reccommend it.
B000002J27|1.0|This is one of my favourite albums from Genesis. Songs are typically progressive and the melodies are cativating. Instrumental playing is the finest. The lyrics tell stories which reach our feelings. Phil Collins sings soft and blends into the melody and instruments, never fighting. Immediate recommendations for listening are Mad Man Moon keyboard-based melody, Entangled, a thrilling story and charming melody and Ripples, a cry about our limited lifespan. Anyone familiar with Smashing Pumpkins, Coldplay and Radiohead, just to mention a few more recent rock groups, should like this album, as would enjoy Genesis' Wind and Wuthering and Seconds Out.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|Lets face it, even the people who haven't seen JAWS are still humming that unforgettable eerie theme. DUN DUN, DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN!!! And thats not the only thing America isn't forgetting. It's that feeling watching JAWS gives you. That tense, anxious, painfully exciting, agonizing joy where you can feel your heart pounding right through your chest. <br />    Speilberg's JAWS, is a down-right brilliant film. You'd assume so too because the summer of the film's release, tourism in beach towns went WAY down.  <br />    The plot is fairly simple. A happy summer beach town gets hit with a leathal shark attack just off it's beach. Since then, 2 more occur, causing Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) to worry. Resulting in the classic trio of oceanographer Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and local fisherman, Quint(Robert Shaw) <br />teaming up to go hunt down the famous deadly shark. I apologize that my summery of the plot is really just a breif overview, but I fear that nobody will read it unless I keep it snappy.  <br />    All in all this is a great film, filled with thrills, romance, comedy....but mostly thrills. It's a true american classic that is to be shared with generations and generations to come. I highly reccomend it.
B000G03RJA|5.0|Fans of Laura still miss her.  It's sad to know there will never be new music from this amazing vocalist.  She was so talented and had one of the most under appreciated voices around. <br />This also, would be one of the first Greatest Hit cds of an artist, where I feel there isn't a song missing.  Usually in a music review, I'll highlight 3-4 of my favourite songs, but I have so many favourites here, I'll list them in order of top favourite.  First, Self Control, Solitare, Ti Amo, Spanish Eddie, Shattered Glass, Gloria and the sexy Moonlight On Water.   <br />This is an amazing album that every fan of hers should own.  Her voice is so powerful, she suited ballads mainly, but did great jobs on the faster songs.  This is an album with 18 of her best songs and I hope everyone will enjoy it as much as I do.
B000002N2P|3.0|INSOMNIAC is part of the record product that has led Green Day to be the band that it is today. Released in 1995, this album showed that Green Day still had a lot to learn in performing to the top of their genre, but the band was good at what they already knew. With a hard grudgy punk sound, the rock band played their hardest on their guitar, bass, and drums. Joel added his own uniquality to the group with his upbeat and entertaining lyrics. His words are what made this punk band stand out from many of the others they were in competetion with. A great apsect of the group is that they are in time with each other. That in itself is an accomplishment in the style this band performs in. INSOMNIAC is a fair rocker album, and one to give some attention to.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"Brat\\" <br />\\"No Pride\\" <br />\\"Stuart and the Ave.\\" <br />\\"Westbound Sign\\"
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I am a lifelong Pink Floyd fan - I loved the classic stuff with Roger Waters. But I have always been a big fan of Gilmour.  Although Waters is not featured in this title, Gilmour and crew bring it home.<br /><br />\\"Pulse\\" does not disappoint.  One song after another in total synchonicity with the visuals.  The 2 DVD set has a great bunch of extras as well.  This is truly a classic.
B00004XQP4|4.0|WARNING: is a major progression in the sound and style of the punk rock band: Green Day. The players still had the grudgy and edgy sound of guitars, bass, and drums. Excpet this time around, the band had obviously searched for a further progression in sound. At times, the band is accompanied by horns, harmonicas, strings, mandolins, and it greatly improves the originality to Green Day's performance. Joel still leads the band with his gritty vocals, but at times he adds more heartfelt lyrics than he has ever done in the past. It is the beginning to his path in expressing his personal and political thoughts. The band itself is well formed and play together remarkably. WARNING: is the record before Green Day's major breakthrough as a politcal rock band, and an album you have to hear.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include; <br />\\"Church On Sunday\\" <br />\\"Cast Away\\" <br />\\"Misery\\" <br />\\"Hold On\\" <br />\\"Waiting\\"
B000FGGE68|5.0|To me, well worth the wait,plenty of action, and Milla Jovovich in those slinky costumes, va-va voom, what a great bum that girl has got.As I said, plenty of action, gore, costumes etc, and is as good as most of the similar vampire films out there. I would recommend it, but that of course is only my opinion, buy it , and try it,
B00002E224|5.0|This movie, along with its sequel \\"Before Sunset\\", works on two levels. First, it deals with two people who, in the course of less than a day, find a deep, personal connection. One could call it a connection of the heart and mind, but that doesn't really define it. It's more a connection of tolerance and interest in each others differences. Their enjoyment of each other and what each has to offer is contagious.<br /><br />The second level is the presentation. The entire film is almost exclusively of these two young people walking through beautiful Vienna conversing in a way that is both intelligent and natural. There is no contrived drama here, only the kind of interaction that is very believable to any of us watching. As he is flying out the next morning, the only question hovering over the couple is whether their relationship will survive after separation. Their connection is special enough that you invest yourself in the characters and hope that they do. However, both the storyline and the characters are realistic enough to know that they may not. It ends on an ambiguous note and you are left to your own conjecture, at least until you see the sequel.<br /><br />I have seldom enjoyed and related to a movie as much as I have to \\"Before Sunrise\\" and \\"Before Sunset\\". The performances of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are as natural and understated as is the dialogue. I have watched these movies several times and each time I walk away with a feeling that I had witnessed something that could have and probably did happen to me. What more could you ask of a movie?

B000089RVX|2.0|I found the album to be too much of the same thing.  Each track sounds too similiar and I was very disappointed since I think the lead singer is very talented.  I was sorry I purchased the CD without testing it out first at a Borders store.
B000BT97AO|4.0|It is an ok movie.  I own about 90% of all sic-fi and fantasy movies ever made.  This one is better than most.  It is not a Dark Crystal or a Labyrinth.  But it is worth watching.  The special effects were not as good as I was hoping for, but they were ok.
B00004CS13|5.0|An excellent film, Leon a.k.a. the Professional, brings to the screen the story of a loner Italian hit man who moved to the U.S. to get away from his past, only to become attached to a little orphaned girl who will change his whole outlook on life...  <br />Jean Reno, (a young) Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Leon is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! <br />

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|I'm typically quite critical with music.  I listen to so much of the stuff that I've found my standards rising with every passing year. <br /> <br />So maybe my expectations were a little high with this one as well, but, let's be honest: The Strokes are past their prime already.  Now, before you, the diehard Strokes fan reading this, decides to tear my head off, let me explain: <br /> <br />The Strokes' debut was impressive: no real filler at all.  Their sophmore contained a hint of that cliched sophomore slump, but it wasn't bad by any means.  This album lacks a lot compared to the other two though. <br /> <br />The album starts out strong.  By the end of Vision of Division (track 6), I had a smile plastered on my face, thinking this was the best album the Strokes had released and definitely a candidate for my album of the year. <br /> <br />Then the experimentation started.  The Strokes clearly were trying something new throughout the last 8 tracks of the album, trying to experiment with their sound more.  And I do give them props for that: I really enjoy when bands try and shift their sound. <br /> <br />The problem: it doesn't work here. <br /> <br />The last 8 tracks are boring, oftentimes meandering, tracks that really fail to materialize into something that warrants repeated listening. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a fairly solid effort but, much like U2's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" would have been better as a 6-song EP.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" effectively mixes courtroom drama and affect from \\"The Exorcism\\" and other spooky films for a cinematic, or DVD, experience that is enthralling until the very end, when it seems to unwind and turn vanilla.<br /><br />The story traces the actions of a priest that performed an exorcism on the named character and the courtroom drama around his work, which the prosecution suggests led to the girl's death. The courtroom drama  takes up most of the scenes, which are interspersed with reconstructions of Emily's takeover and the exorcism.<br /><br />The film effectively eschews most of the gore, blood and guts that have appeared in many of these movies and is still effective all the way through to the end, where it lets the viewer down by trying to satisfy everyone.<br /><br />Two wonderful actors -- Laura Linney and Campbell Scott -- play the attorneys on each side of the court case in this thriller. Linney, coming off her Oscar-nominated work in \\"Kinsey\\" is more multidimensional than I can recall seeing her before. Campbell, a terrific supporting actor who has appeared in a lot of movies, takes on an older, more mature, more conservative appearance in the movie playing a God-fearing lawyer than must bebunk a priest whose actions, he believes, led to Emily's demise.<br /><br />The interaction between the two attorneys in the courtroom is what drives the action in the film. There is a subplot of demonic possession that transcends the titled character, a plot contrivance I've never before seen in an exorcism-takeover movie. It adds somethig fresh to the overall horror production.<br /><br />However, an equivocal ending -- apparently based on what happened in real life (the film is said to be based on true events) -- robs the movie of forward motion, bringing everything to an unengaging stop. It gave me the impression that everything leading up to it was less important than I previously thought.<br /><br />Still, this is an effective thriller with riveting performances by the two lawyers and a convincing plot built around real events. There are epilogue scripts onscreen after the flick that tell you what happened to everyone after the court case.<br /><br />This is a good movie, very effective until the end, where I felt like a deflated balloon. Not all viewers will have this feeling, of course. Check out other reviews for other reactions.hriller with riveting performances by the two lawyers and a convincing plot built around real events.

B000059XUI|4.0|In the first entry of this saga, a handful of villains were accused of betrayal and attempts to subvert the order in Krypton. The last person of the Council was precisely Superman' s father, and they return to the Earth in search of their revenge.<br /><br />Finally we will witness the expected concretion of the romance between Lois and Sup.

B00005AXEL|5.0|This album completely wipes out the memory of 1994's disappointing \\"Street Angel\\" (which I, even as a Stevie fan for two decades and more, have to say is the worst of her solo work) and handsomely matches the gold standard set by \\"Bella Donna\\" and \\"The Wild Heart\\".  Stevie demonstrates in convincing fashion that she's come out of the Klonopin funk that bedeviled her throughout the late 1980's and early 1990's (and which, by her own report, damaged her work worse than cocaine ever did; whoever prescribed that stuff for her to wean her off coke ought to be sued for malpractice).  Since 2001, she's been keeping quite busy, spending most of her time working and touring with the revived Fleetwood Mac to back up their excellent 2003 album \\"Say You Will\\" (as well as touring on her own and with Tom Petty), but all of us fans hope she'll get out another album soon!  For me, the particular highlight of this album is the official release of the song \\"Planets of the Universe\\", well-known to hardcore fans from the demo form that circulated on bootleg tapes for years, and Stevie's own version of her song \\"Sorcerer\\", originally recorded by Marilyn Martin for the \\"Streets of Fire\\" soundtrack.
B00005JOYM|5.0|Oliver Stone's World Trade Center may be considered one of his best films as well as one of the best films to come out in 2006.  Stone presents a no nonsense and no politics film that focuses on two PAPD officers, Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage).  This is their story as well as the story of those who attempted to help and save those who experienced the destruction of the trade center buildings.<br /><br />Indeed, World Trade Center will hit an emotional nerve for those who remember the day.  Stone relives the vivid moments of that fateful day, September 11, 2001, with meticulous detail -- the terrifying scenes that many would like to forget when the towers fell and the aftermath when all that was left was its skeleton structure. The film simulates the horrifying moments, and one may feel like being on a rollercoaster ride of emotions as a result of the content and special effects that accompany the film.<br /><br />Andrea Berloff should be commended for the screenplay for the film.  It is the most poignant aspect about the movie. He captures the very real and humanistic side of Jimeno and McLoughlin, and the family and friends who went through the terrifying ordeal, such as Jimeno and McLoughlin's wives, Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and  Donna McLouglin (Marie Bello).  There are lighter moments of brief comic relief that is exchanged between Jimeno and McLoughlin while trapped under the enormous debris, and serious moments where the men were near death.<br /><br />Another significant aspect of the film is the underlying camaraderie that existed with the people that helped during the rescue and recovery.  With the appearance of former Marine, David Karnes (Michael Shannon), Stone adds a somewhat mysterious and subtle feel to his presence and participation.  In essence, the film emphasizes the main themes of duty and hope amongst those who reached out to help.<br /><br />World Trade Center is a unique film.  It has been a while since a film of this caliber has been made. Oliver Stone adds another perception of the event that deals with the real people who were involved.  And while this story and event may still be fresh in many minds, it is now a part of history. As a warning, this film may not be suitable for young children.caliber has been made.

0385512104|4.0|At first, I had a difficult time \\"getting into\\" this book and I'm an avid reader. But, as I continued reading and became accustomed to the writing style (that of an adolescent with a form of Autism), it drew me in. <br /> <br />I think I REALLY got \\"hooked\\" from the middle to the end of the book.   <br /> <br />A little slow at first but, in my opinion, if you just \\"hang in there\\", it DOES get quite interesting and exciting!
B00005JOYM|4.0|One thing you won't see in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is multiple explosions and images of planes flying into buildings. In this evocative reenactment of that fateful day, the director uses a lot of restraint, consequently we hear the planes hit the buildings but we never see them and we see the people racing from the scene bloodied and battered, and we also get the immense scale of the disaster through a spectacularly recreated set piece.  <br /> <br />With moderation and tact, Hollywood sentimentality is largely kept at bay, as the viewer is swept into a very personal account of what it must have been like to be trapped inside the wreckage and rubble of the giant towers.  The movie opens on the morning of September 11th and it's just like any other day in New York, the sun comes up, the Fulton Fish Market opens for business, and commuters get on the train or the Staten Island Ferry. <br /> <br />Two Port Authority cops, Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) go to work but little do they know what was to become of them that day. A tremor is felt in the P.A.'s offices within the World Trade Center, followed by confusion as McLoughlin leads his men from the Port Authority bus terminal toward the towers. They thread through fallen debris with the intent of evacuating office workers,  <br /> <br />McLoughlin, Jimeno and three others get to the concourse between the towers. Then the columns buckle, the first tower begins to collapse and the men are trapped. Their wives - Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello) and pregnant Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal), along with thousands of other families have know idea where they are and what has happened to their husbands and scenes alternate between the trapped survivors who are trying desperately to stay awake and alive and their families who anxiously wait by the phone.  <br /> <br />The acting in this movie, particularly by Gyllenhaal and Bello is quite phenomenal - no mad histrionics here, just a deep anxiousness, confusion and sadness as both wives try to cope with the magnitude of the disaster in different ways. Donna sort of shuts down and goes into a state of temporal denial, whilst Allison ponders how she can begin to raise her children without a father.  <br /> <br />World Trade Center is far from a gripping and fast-paced thriller, and it doesn't glamorize or even cheapen the events of that day, rather the drama comes from how these men survived - keeping each other's spirits up when they were pinned down in pain and suffering internal bleeding. And these scenes, shot in a re-creation of Ground Zero masterfully built by production designer Jan Roelfs, are simple and direct in their concentration on the immobilized policemen. <br /> <br />I have just one problem with this movie and that was the decision to cast Nicolas Cage as Sgt. McLoughlin. Maybe I'm biased, but I just didn't buy him playing a Port Authority Cop, his performance, especially in the opening scenes come across as a little forced. Still, the movie as a whole is generally well done with Stone successfully anchoring us in the chaos of ground zero.   <br /> <br />World Trade Center certainly isn't out to make a political statement about terrorism or the inaction of the government leading up to the disaster and the only view of the outside world comes from Cable TV which becomes a refrain of information feeds and sober political analysis, including a brief speech from the President.  But Stone is largely determined that his movie be about all of us, showing how these events happened to everyone, everyday people doing their jobs and living their lives.

I have a dozen or so of Van's CD's, but this is one of my all-time favorites.  Every song on the CD is masterful.   <br /> <br />When the mood strikes me, I like to put on this CD, pour a glass of wine and sit by myself for some pleasurable listening.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|Save you money and rent or buy The Thirteenth Warrior instead, a Beowulf adaptation that is a cinematic masterpiece by comparison to this drek.  If you want  to see Gerard Butler ina medieval film, then rent Timeline, also a masterpiece by comparison. The highly repetitive soundtrack, stationary camera work, constant use of the same lng and medium shots (where are the close ups?),  and snail's pace editing make this low budget Beowulf & Grendel unwatchable.  Shots of Bowulf and his gang riding shetland poneys are truly laughable, as are the fake blood and severed limbs and heads and he bearded boy at the start of the film. The glowing reviews on this website are no doubt written by relatives of the cast and crew or by employees in the marketing firm paid to plug this sorry excuse for a film.
B0002S94OS|5.0|When I got this cd, I expected it to be really good. Not great, but boy was I wrong. This cd greatly exceeded my expectations. I received \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" at the same time I got \\"Ashes.\\" And after listening to both many, many times, I can definitely say this is the better of the two. The music is extremely technical and every part of the band is very talented. I especially love most of all the guitar. They are so quick and fast that it's amazing. They also have great, simpler heavier riffs to go along with the more complicated high-speed guitar chase. The drums are also amazing. When that double bass kicks in you'll be head banging all the way through. Randy Blythe's vocals are unique and hoarse sounding. I love it. These guys are really leading the future of heavy metal along with Slipknot and Shadows Fall.<br /><br />I don't really have any complaints for this album. Every song is heart-pounding, in your face, fist full of metal type music. Favorites of mine include the single-Laid To Rest, Hourglass, The Faded Line and Ashes of the wake(instrumental). And what an instrumental it is. It's targeted against the war in Iraq, as is much of the album. Remorse Is For The Dead is a great album closer. It starts off with a slow acoustic riff, than breaks into sheer madness. If I had to choose one song to be my least favorite, it would probably be the other single off the album-Now You've Got Something To Die For. Now don't get me wrong, it's a very good song, but I'm saying if I had to pick a worst song, that would be it. Lamb Of God didn't sell out one bit on this album, and they never will. The production is great. Every instrument is easily heard. So you don't have to listen for a certain instrument while missing parts of the song.<br /><br />These guys really are innovators of the genre. One of the most talented metal bands out there right now. If you don't have a cd of LOG's yet, get Ashes Of The Wake. It won't dissapoint you. Also check out As The Palaces Burn, which is another great album. This cd really surprised me and was even better than I thought it would be. It's one of those cds you can pop in the stereo and listen to the whole way through without skipping any tracks, and those types of albums are starting to dwindle.

I don't need some crazy ipod that holds 3,000 of my favorite songs...just give me something simple...something uncomplicated...something that puts me in touch with my soul and I'm quite the happy guy.<br /><br />This album is free from all pretenses. It's sad and yet it's beautiful. It's alive and yet it feels like death is its closest companion. I'm not being maudlin, here, that's the way it is. We go through so many mini-deaths during one lifetime. We make friends. We lose friends. We're riding high one moment and the next we're flat on our backs. But it's all part of the whole. Black and white with a million shades of gray in-between.<br /><br />I put on this album that I've had since the fourth grade. The record cracks and creaks, it moans and groans...it's a lot like me...but just like this record, I'm always ready to start from the beginning and be me. Who else could I possibly be?<br /><br />I'm tempted to buy a brand new version of this classic on CD, but I wait until the feelings pass and cling to something I've owned for the last thirty years. I don't have much left from those days gone by. But again, that's life.<br /><br />This is probably the best album that Simon & Garfunkle put out. It caught them at a time when they, too, were going through changes and transistions, endings and new beginnings.<br /><br />Life's a trip...pack accordingly.
B000002C1W|4.0|If you do not yet own Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by comparison. <br /> <br />That said, very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three, and AMLOR certainly has its bright spots. \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\" are as good as anything Pink Floyd has ever produced. Some of the other songs are adequate, but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier Floyd releases. It's definitely worth having, but make sure that you have the others first. <br /> <br />
B00005JOYM|5.0|This movie should join Spielberg's Schindler's List and Munich - as well as Hotel Rwanda, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and perhaps El Norte - as required ID for the historically literate American. No drinks without a card. No driver's license, no graduation party, no nuthin'.<br /><br />Released just five years from 'the events of September 11', the film jolts this viewer with just how easily one slips into a blurred memory of something that might have happened.<br /><br />It happened, all right. And it matters that it did. The credits remind us that 87 countries lost citizens in what must be remembered as nothing less than blood-curdling mass murder.<br /><br />The world is indeed at war after 9/11, though this one is far more complex than nationality and creed can capture. It's a matter of decency versus barbarism.<br /><br />World Trade Center fixes our gaze on the decency, self-sacrifice, and regular people's loss that was New York in September, 2001. Not to be forgotten are the world's tears, as one of Stone's compelling sequence reminds us in what appears to be real footage of people around the globe absorbing the shock of a news event like no other.<br /><br />Buy tickets for your whole family.

They do, and it is.<br /><br />No movie, no ID, no ticket to life.
B00003CX95|5.0|Probably my favorite movie, but I enjoy so many different types of movies it really is difficult to list them in order of preference.<br /><br />Mel Gibson and Catherine McCormack, a winning combination. This movie was released in 1995. I can't believe it's been over 10 years! It should capture audiences with at least one of its story ingredients (romance, action, adventure, epic, battles, based on the life of William Wallace for history buffs), and will succeed in several at once.<br /><br />In particular, the love theme encompassing the two stars, whose characters are William Wallace and his wife, Murron, is quite memorable and poignant. A good movie score adds so much to our enjoyment, and this one delivers. It is rated \\"R\\" for \\"brutal medieval warfare,\\" and yes, there are some pretty vivid injuries in the battle scenes.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|If you like to be entertained this film is worth renting and if you are a big fan, like I am, of Jessica Alba this film is worth buying.  I didn't see this film at the theater, but after renting it, I immeadiately bought it.  You can read the other reviews here from the psuedo-critics who pan the film, but the bottom line here is:  Was the film entertaining?  The answer to that question is yes!  The reason why most of us go see a film in the first place is to be entertained, and this film delivers!  If you are someone who likes to have fun and likes to be entertained I guarantee you will enjoy this film.
B00000G3I2|4.0|Very high on my list.<br /><br />All star cast: Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldbloom, William Hurt, Tom Berenger, JoBeth Williams, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly. Kevin Costner is uncredited for his role...sssh, those in the know...those who don't know, try to find him in the movie.<br /><br />I just adore this movie. Witty, intelligent, the dialogs are marvelous, and the comments quotable:<br /><br />\\"I don't know anyone who could get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations. They're more important than sex.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ah, come on. Nothing's more important than sex.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh yeah? Ever gone a week without a rationalization?\\"<br /><br />\\"It doesn't always happen the first time.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's not what they told us in high school.\\"<br /><br />\\"Amazing tradition.

1401302378|4.0|While some try to dismiss the message of this book as merely an article about a statistical graph, I found the ideas in the book interesting and some of them powerful.  There are many books on the Internet and what it can do to open mass customization, how it impacts the economic doctrine of the allocation of scarce resources (although the concept is almost universally misunderstood in these discussions), the need to open a digital front to your customers, and so forth.  This book could be lumped into this group and stuck on the shelf next to them, but I think that would be a mistake.<br /><br />This book deals in specifics about what is happening with real businesses rather than with what could happen.  Chris Anderson shows us how the small volume items can generate significant aggregate sales.  Even the seemingly vast selection offered by the big box stores and Wal-Mart ends up being only the surface of what is actually available when one is not limited by shelf space and transportation costs.<br /><br />I think the great examples the book offers are Wal-Mart and Rhapsody.  Wal-Mart sells something like 20% of all music sales in America, yet it carries only 4,500 titles (Amazon.com offers 800,000 music titles).  Of the 30,000 new albums released each year, Wal-Mart carries only 750 (pages 155-156).  Yet 40% of Rhapsody's sales come from titles not available in retail stores.  These are titles that individually only sell a few times each, but in aggregate become a huge revenue generator.  In the digital world, it costs almost nothing to keep these titles in inventory, but providing them a physical presence in thousands of stores cannot be justified.<br /><br />Some retailers are tapping into this effect by offering a much wider variety of products online than are available in even their largest stores.  Manufacturers are also offering products online that are not available through any retailer.  Anderson reminds us that when you go to your local store to buy a Kitchen Aid mixer you will likely find only three colors - white, black, and something else (he also shares why retailers choose this selection).  If you go to the Kitchen Aid website you can choose among fifty colors.  Similarly, Lego has a specialized set of offerings for its hobbyist force that are not available anywhere else.<br /><br />The author also discusses the varying studies that seem to say contrary things about customers and choice.  It turns out that customers show their preference for lots of choice over and over again.  But successful offerings of choice also have to provide help for the consumer to find what he or she is looking for.  It involves search, product information, even samples.<br /><br />The last chapter offers nine rules for functioning in the world of the Long Tail.  I think the book is quite interesting and appropriately sized for the insights it offers.  There are some helpful charts and graphs, as well.  The hard part is thinking through the implications of this reality for your business and for your competitive situation.<br /><br />Good strategizing!a Kitchen Aid mixer you will likely find only three colors - white, black, and something else (he also shares why retailers choose this selection).

B000E15JY2|5.0|Dr. Victor Frankl was a successful psychiatrist in Vienna, Austria with a wife and child before World War II. As a Jewish family, his wife and child were murdered in the Holocaust but he survived by being a doctor in the camps. While most of us would probably curse the German Nazis who killed his wife and child. He uses his suffering and examines how suffering can help better a person's life in this book. He doesn't recommend everbody suffers but his voice is one of reason, kindness, forgiveness, and gentleness. He describes the horrors of World War II and the camps. He also gives a detailed account even criticizing his fellow Jewish prisoners who play favorites with prison guards. Not all the Germans were cruel and mean, one even got medicine for them and they paid by trying to save his life after the war. It's a war and people were both inhumane and humane to each other despite their ethnic differences.
6305263248|4.0|The entirety of Ronin involves a narrative that exists on just the other side of \\"real\\" -- competing political factions vying for a metal briefcase whose contents are a perpetual mystery.  The \\"good guys\\", if they can be called that, are a small coterie of mercenaries who were presumably relieved of their legitimate jobs with the winding down of the Cold War.  They're hired by an Irish faction operating in Paris represented by Dierdre (Natascha McElhone) via the unseen \\"man in a wheelchair\\", an agent for these \\"ronin for hire\\".  (Ronin were the ancient Japanese samurai who were cast out of their fiefdom for failure to adequately protect their liege, essentially becoming free-agent wandering warriors.)  They are of different nationalities, backgrounds, and possess different talents.  Sam the American (Robert De Niro), develops a kinship with the Frenchman Vincent (Jean Reno) and becomes de facto leader of the band. After a planned exchange for the briefcase goes awry, they devise and execute a violent ambush in the streets of Nice to get the briefcase and take out its current possessors.  When Plan B fails, the fun begins.    Through double-cross and intrigue, the briefcase remains elusive.  Plans are revised, payments are \\"re-negotiated\\", and hunters become hunted to the point of making for a five-sided chase. Even the Russians become involved, including an unassuming touring figure skater played by Katarina Witt.  It all sounds very contrived and even trite to a degree, but attached to this story are some of the fiercest street gunfights and most exciting car chases any action film fan could hope for!  Many innocents (and vehicles!) become victims, but these adversaries in espionage openly shop, dine, and roam the streets as if they're tourists and the French authorities are on some far-off planet. Through death and deceit, De Niro and Reno eventually form a buddy-buddy duo to exact revenge and extract payment.  \\"Old friends from high school\\" appear out of nowhereto aid in the alternating pursuits and escapes. Ironically, actor Michael Lonsdale, who was so great as the assassin-pursuing French Inspector Lebel in Fred Zinneman's The Day of the Jackal, does a marvelous turn as one of these convenient \\"friends\\", providing refuge to the pair for some do-it-yourself surgery.  While the hunt and chase is on, viewers are also treated to some marvelous French town and cityscapes, including the ancient Roman amphitheater at Arles and the traffic tunnels of Paris.    Ronin is a film for those who can suspend their sense of logic to allow themselves to be taken for the ride.  Thankfully, nothing devolves into outright camp a la James Bond. The danger of this approach is that for the film to be effective, the viewer must be held in thrall by these contrived characters and their actions to the point of being oblivious to their real-world consequences. De Niro, director John Frankenheimer and company manage to pull it off.  Because of its sheer unabashed cinematicism and no-holds-barred direction, Ronin succeeds in pushing this reviewer's grade one star above average when the film's holes could just as easily have let it fall one star below.
0553804677|4.0|THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA is a fairly-well-hyped fantasy debut about the charismatic leader of a gang of con artists in a city that does (or tries to do) for renaissance Venice what PERDIDO STREET STATION did for Dickensian London. Overall, I enjoyed it - the prose was technically proficient, the plot hummed along efficiently, the setting was considerably more interesting than the usual plate-mail-and-offal-carts business, and there was a good deal of welcome humor. As debut novels go it's a promising start. <br /> <br />On the other hand, it really doesn't amount to much more than an entertaining confection. The book's apparently been optioned for a movie already, and I can see why: the dialogue's relentlessly effervescent, occasionally stretching credulity past the breaking point (characters have one-liners for every occasion even while collecting broken bones and concussions like trading cards) and the screenplay-friendly three-act structure is too often embarrassingly visible underneath the flesh of the story. <br /> <br />It's difficult to articulate my feelings on books like this. On the one hand, Lynch's technical talent clearly elevates him above the great gormless herd of modern fantasy writers already. And there's no denying that the book is very likeable indeed, while it seems unfair to fault it based only on what it could have been. On the other hand, it's just *too damn safe*. Lynch is going to be a major player in the genre - that much is obvious already - but he has it in him to do something Seriously Good rather than settling for being the next RA Salvatore. But it's not gonna happen until he gets over his fear of failure. PERDIDO had parts that worked and parts that didn't but Mieville wrote his ambition on every page in letters of fire, and the excitement swept me, the reader, away with him. Whereas LOCKE LAMORA felt like Lynch was parceling out his ideas and his talent and calculating every story beat based on whether it would make a good start fora franchise. <br /> <br />In short, it's worth the money, even if you're not big into fantasy - I'm emphatically not, aside from staples like Tolkien, Moorcock, and Martin, and I still enjoyed it. But it's not a *necessary* book.
B000002GVO|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this CD, I guess I was hesistant becuase of the possible \\"just okay\\" sound quality like some of the CD's I bought that were recorded in the 70's and transferred into CD, which inders one for appreciating the music itself.  Well \\"Hotel California\\" is beautifully transferred to CD, I don't know if it was remasterred but the sound quality is awesome.  You can hear every drum, guitar, background vocals, ascent and descent in the tittle track and that goes for the rest of the CD.  Then ofcourse the music is stellar, not every song is a stand out like \\"Hotel California\\" but pretty darn close.  This album defines a generation, an era, a style of music, maybe American music as we know it.   You can go to every corner of the world and I  can bet you that you can get a few hopeless crooner to sing a few lines from \\"Hotel California.\\" Careful, you might annoy someone if you play this CD a bit too much.
6305736650|5.0|\\"Casablanca\\" is a landmark film. It's 64 years old and yet most of the dialogue is still quoted today, it's #2 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (just directly below \\"Citizen Kane\\"), and is a true masterpiece of film. <br />I typically don't watch films from this era, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman; This is not the most entertaining of several of my favorite movies that are on AFI's list below this film, nor is this the second most entertaining film ever made...But it is an important one; But that's not why I'm giving it 5 stars. The biggest thing I look for when reviewing a film in the quality of entertainment; I don't care how important the movie is, if it's kind of dull I won't rank it that high. This film is a beautiful and entertaining film; The cinematography/lighting is beautiful, the dialogue is beautiful, the acting is wonderful, the film is incredibly influential. Anyway; The movie is set against the backdrop of World War II in Casablanca and takes place mostly in a gambling/gin joint owned by Rick Blaine (Bogart), a distant kind of guy who \\"doesn't stick his neck out for anybody\\" and seems to find no enjoyment in life. He runs his gin joint and that's it. After some transfer papers are stolen (and are subsequently being looked for by the Germans) and are given to Rick, the man who gives them to him is arrested shortly after and Rick awaits the gentlemen who will pick them up. That man is Victor Laszlo, who is famous for having spent a year in a concentration camp and escaping; Also along with Laszlo is his beautiful wife Isla Lund (Bergman), who is tied to Rick's past. Back in 1942, the film won 3 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. How it lost (although I'm not sure if it was even nominated) Best Cinematography and Best Actor is beyond me. As I said, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart before but the man is an amazing actor. He has this way of speaking and a way of moving thatreally sucks you in. Some of the dialogue (although it is great) wouldn't work coming out of other actors mouths; Here, it's perfectly fine. \\"Here's looking at you kid\\" and \\"I believe this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\" is classic movie dialogue that we will no doubt here for a much longer time. This isn't a movie the whole family can rent for a night of Saturday night entertainment; But for film buffs and classic film mongers, this is a film you can't miss. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
B00005V1B1|4.0|I don't disagree with the majority of the actual review of Camel 'Mirage'.  I simply don't understand the opening.  If you only think of three bands, Yes, Genesis, and ELP, when Progressive Rock is mentioned, you need to check into the genre a bit further to find someone you like since you next state you don't care for any of these bands.  The tag at the time these bands were most popular was Art Rock or Theater Rock, not that the classifications are all that vital.  As I said previously, the bulk of your review beyond this is agreeable to me. <br /> <br />Now, the real point of contention for me is the mention of Ian Anderson.  I am reasonably certain the Jethro Tull front man did not contribute to King Crimson's debut, 'In the Court of the Crimson King'.  If you'll check the liner notes for that release, I believe you must be confusing Ian McDonald, who is credited with playing 'reeds' on the King Crimson title.  Small point to readers perhaps, altho definitely not one to the two Ian's.  If you're gonna drop names, get 'em correct, or get 'em out by Friday... <br /> <br />Regards, <br /> <br />PP
B000002UCN|5.0|\\"The Best of George Harrison\\" is a wonderful compilation of his best Beatles and post-Beatles hits and songs, but I find myself agreeing with other reviewers on the choice of Beatle songs.  \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"Think For Yourself\\" could have been replaced with \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" which deserves to be here even more since the \\"My Sweet Lord\\" 45 was a double sided hit with that track.  This would have also tipped the scale more toward George's solo sides, to make a more even handed comp.  Also, this CD has been out forever, it not only needs to be recompiled, but REMASTERED!!  It pales beside the remasters of the original albums.  But if you cannot buy the individual albums, \\"The Best Of George Harrison\\" is a decent pick for someone wanting to check out his music for the first time.

B0002I10RW|2.0|I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a \\"1 + 1 = 3\\" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is \\"If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie.\\"<br /><br />As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.<br /><br />I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.<br /><br />As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?<br /><br />I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right? Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.<br /><br />In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want. Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.<br /><br />In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.ht. <br /> <br />In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want.

0440224764|3.0|This book was a nice change to most of Grisham's other books because it starts out with the lead character already in trouble, instead of getting into trouble as the book progresses.  The majority of the book was a enjoyable as a light read, but the last chapter ruined the entire story. That dropped it one star.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />  There was no evidence in the entire book that Eva would take the money and run.  She was worried about Patrick throughout the entire story.  In the first half of the novel I thought for sure that Eva would just take the money, but as the story progressed, I realized that she was in love with Patrick, and became more and more convinced that she would stay with him.<br /><br />  Sure, when she is being held in the prison in Miami she says that this was beyond the call of romance, but she said she was still in love with Patrick.  What I don't understand is that if she was planning on screwing him over anyway, why make the reservation at the hotel (maybe to torment him)?  And going back even further, why did she give the $113 million back to the US government? She could have taken the $140 million and gone.<br /><br />  The most important thing though, is that she would not have been able to just pick up and leave her father.  This probably irked me the most, since Grisham makes it a point to show the reader several times that she was not willing to let any harm come to her father, going so far as to wind up being put in jail to try to save him.<br /><br />***End Spoilers***<br /><br />With all that said, I don't always expect a happily ever after ending in novels, but the entire story was building toward one in The Partner. The ending does not totally ruin the book, but it does detract from the overall quality of the book. 3 Stars.
0767812387|5.0|Good movie to show people the difference between ballroom dance and fun dance. Best dance movie I ever seen.
0812550706|5.0|The main characters in the story Ender's game are Ender, Peter and Valentine. The basic plot for Ender is to beat the problems given to him by the teachers, while Peter and Valentine try to spread the \\"truth\\" by using the Internet. The setting is at a \\"Battle School\\" in space. A problem Ender gets into is bullying. People bully him around because he's small, but he learns how to deal with it, sometimes in a violent way. <br /> <br />This book will teach you about intellectual perseverance, to keep trying. When I saw this book, it looked like a long book that had little promises. After I started reading it, I couldn't put the book down. It felt like I was Ender, facing all of his challenges. It told me that everyone would be human, in just about any situation, like when Ender hurt the boy bullying him, just so he'd stop taunting him. I learned that mostly everyone has someone they rely on, like how Ender relied on Valentine, but when that's taken away you will have to learn to rely on yourself. The length of paragraph and chapters is not just full of extra words and texts, but it presents wondrous pictures, especially about the Battle School since that's where most of the story takes place. I would recommend reading this book even if you aren't interested in science fiction. It will take your imagination and expand it in ways you never thought of.
B00028HBKM|4.0|What the world needs now is one more opinion on Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", right?<br /><br />I am adding mine because some have asked for it. But, as has been noted hundreds of times over, the movie itself is only part of the experience that is \\"The Passion.\\" At this point the publicity, the prevailing Church attitude toward movies and celebrity, the accusations of bigotry, the accuracy and theology of the film, and the personality of Mel Gibson are of one cloth with it. So this will be a longer than usual review. It's taken me six months to write it.<br /><br />MEL - As Seattle film critic William Arnold says, \\"I've been reading a lot about how Gibson has a martyr complex. I think that's ridiculous. Gibson is less a would-be martyr than a provocateur. There's something in his nature that delights in being abrasive and politically incorrect...He loves to light up a cigarette in places where it's forbidden.\\"<br /><br />I agree. Mel loves to goad people then gauge their response.<br /><br />Is that what \\"The Passion\\" is about? I honestly don't think so. Mel seems to have put an earnest effort into realizing his conception of Christ on film.<br /><br />MARKETING - Of far greater concern to me was the rush of devout, well-meaning Christians to this movie's defense and its propogation - before it was even released. Gibson's passionate creation of this film was an overt mainstream validation that many orthodox Christians had been starving for. His Icon production company leapt on this fact and created an enormous grass-roots marketing campaign that was wildly inexpensive considering the saturation it achieved. With volunteers fanning out across the suburbs bearing posters and leaflets and churches eagerly buying billboards that had Mel's name next to the name of their church, it was probably the biggest publicity coup of the decade.<br /><br />ANTI-SEMITIC? - In my humble Gentile opinion? Not that I can see. Apart from the Romans, virtually every character in the story is a Jew. Besides the disciples, there are good and kind Jews depicted throughout. The Sanhedrin, the religious and civic governing elders, are even conflicted over whether to put Jesus to death, with several arguing against it. Their initiation of His crucifixion to eliminate a religious threat is not a Gibsonian invention, however. It is written in all the gospels. If this film reflects poorly on anyone, it's the Italians. The maddeningly sadistic scourging and crucifixion are their doing. Which brings me to the next point.<br /><br />SHOCKING - One alarming facet of the evangelical reverence of this movie is the prima facie acceptance of the blanching gore and violence that permeate the \\"The Passion.\\" Most viewers have to shut their eyes at points throughout the film and a few have even left to be sick. Yet some parents (who would never allow their kids to hear a swear word or a discussion on married sex!) took their younger children to it because \\"they need to see what Jesus went through.\\" This simply floors me. Yes, as a Christian I believe Christ's death and resurrection are the preeminent events in human history and the deciding factor in every human life. But Little Timmy is still wrapping his head around Sunday school stories about the sweet, smiling cartoon Jesus who coddles lambs in his coloring books being killed because Timmy stole his friend's Hot Wheel car and lied about breaking Mom's favorite vase. Although it is true, the concept alone is often confusing and worrisome to them as it is.<br /><br />Am I objecting to an honest and unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering on my behalf? If it evokes repentence, gratitude, and adoration, then not in the least. But if it lingers on it salaciously, then yes. I think that - by and large - this film accomplishes the positive results. But it sometimes veers into the gratuitous, too.<br /><br />I often compare \\"The Passion\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" That film and its chilling brutality were both an awe-stricken acknowledgement of the sacrifice of the veterans of World War II and a visceral repellant against war itself. It was shocking but vitally necessary. So it can be argued for \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Jesus died a vicious death to rescue all of us. We should be reminded of that and be repelled from taking its cause - our sin - lightly.<br /><br />But young children should not watch either movie. Period. And I hope never to watch them (along with \\"Schindler's List\\") more than a few times in my life. Any more than that and I might become desensitized to them and thus their central purpose. And that would be unwise.<br /><br />ACCURACY - It gets much of the biblically supported material right. BTW, the dream of Pilate's wife IS in the Bible (Matt. 27:19). The merely interpretive parts are often astonishlingly moving, even if they didn't necessarily happen that way.<br /><br />How does it fare theologically? Depends on your theology. \\"The Passion\\" makes it clear that Christ died to save the world. The most gutwrenching scene for me was when Jesus stumbles under the cross and tells Mary, \\"See, mother. I'm making everything new.\\"<br /><br />Those who complain that Gibson has minimized Jesus' message of \\"peace, love, and understanding\\" in favor of sin and death need to 1) See the movie again and 2) Read the Scriptures again. If Christ's was not the ultimate example of nonviolent conviction, I don't know what is. As the Son of God, He could have struck His executioners dead at any point along the way. But Jesus was not a first-century hippie, either. He spoke more of a literal hell and of complete obedience to God than anyone else in the New Testament. And, honestly, the last twelve hours of His life weren't very conducive to preaching on diversity.<br /><br />This is a decidedly Catholic film. For example, the Stations of the Cross (a sequence of passion events enumerated in the Catholic prayers of the same name) are dutifully enacted, even at risk of creating cinematic redundancy. Mary seems able to locate Jesus through solid rock floors by \\"sensing\\" Him. But the scenes and events based on the extrabiblical writings of mystics and on later traditions that are regarded as history by some Catholics are alternately distracting and disturbing.<br /><br />BUT IS IT A GOOD MOVIE? - There may be no objective way for me to watch this. I suppose the only way I can answer the question is by rephrasing: Was it a successful movie? Did it have it's intended effect on the audience?<br /><br />Yes. And then some.ns of World War II and a visceral repellant against war itself. It was shocking but vitally necessary.

B000E6UWE4|2.0|I agree with other reviewers here on this main point, the characters are not fleshed out enough for me.  I don't care about them one bit because I know nothing about them! (Except who they hang out with). Yes, there are exceptions like Anomander. But I still don't even know what a Trell is!! Erikson will say \\"The Trell held his sword menacingly\\" or something and I don't know if that's an ethnicity, a species or what. <br />I guess he was trying to have us just go along for the ride, and he does write an amazing ride with original magic and history, etc...  But I need more than that.
B00005JP7M|1.0|This movie was probably the worst I've seen -- at least in the last decade.  I had high hopes for it -- the story line was inventive and could have been very enjoyable if written appropriately.   <br /> <br />But, instead of a tight story line with a few nods to Allen's antics woven in, this movie was solely a series of Allen's (badly done) vaudeville acts with a few minor plot elements thrown in so that the viewers wouldn't walk out.  Allen's monologues (of which there were myriad) were trite, repetitive and added absolutely NOTHING to the story.  Unfortunately, they were all that the story offered. <br /> <br />All in all, I was extremely disappointed.  I should have known that the movie wasn't worth seeing when I walked into the theater (at 9:45 on a Saturday night), and only 6 other people were there.
0385512104|4.0|I don't recall ever reading another novel quite like this one. Its told from the view point of an autistic teenager when he decides to investigate the mystery of who killed his neighbours dog in the night. <br /> <br />This book presents a rather alien point of view, but conveys a mindset so different from \\"normal\\" that you feel you have been given a window into a different world. <br /> <br />This is far from you normal mystery novel and its format is different from any other mystery novel I've read - but I'm glad I took the time to sit down and read this book. Its a quick read, but well worth it if only see a world you wouldn't normally have access to. <br /> <br />
B0002W18MU|4.0|very emotional CD, songs were selected with care and both joy and sadness.  a good CD, and a must have for collectors.
0345349571|5.0|Tuchman is a brilliant historian, a sensational writer and this is a wonderfully complex (and fascinating) period which she illuminates in the most interesting way. Another Bravo for Barbara!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This fun, funky, fabulous CD has me groovin' all through rush hour. It's bluesy but with danceable beats.
B00004SC3M|5.0|A fasinating Film. Had so many twists and turns and wondering who's working or betraying who without getting confused. Very enjoyable.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Excellent- I expected it to be great, but it was even better than expected, I received it must faster than I anticipated. The show is just great. I have seen the shows I missed and  I am looking forward to completing the entire series of the show.
B00005221M|4.0|The Last of the Mohicans was a great movie and the acting was superb very enjoyable.
B00004VXF2|1.0|It is not my fault, but I own this CD. <br />This is the kind of cd that people pay just to get rid of it.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This young Johnny Depp is amazing.  He draws you to him like a magnet.  Aidan Quinn is always wonderful also.  It's a \\"feel good\\" movie that leaves you smiling for hours afterwards.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Wow, i defintely got more than i bargained for with this movie. The story seems so unreal. But makes you realize that this could be someone who is related to you. It's great that they effectively show how this one subject impacts so  many people's lives for such a period. It was great. I'm glad i finally got to see that it lives up to all the press.
0792164903|5.0|Funny, a little scarey and just plain entertaining. Can't miss movie.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|Trust me, I like Clooney, but this movie is aweful. I kept wondering when the storyline was going to tie together, but it never really does. It looks just like another political movie trying to get their conspiracy out. It is not action packed either like the previews suggest and is instead dull and very uneventful, much of the movie is blogged with pointless rhetoric. Very one sided whether you are democratic, republican, independant or indifferent. Two thumbs down. Not worth watching for free let alone worth paying for. Clooney's worst flick. If you like Clooney and the middle east may I suggest Three Kings and The Peacemaker.
038560176X|5.0|My son get's two books read to him every night, and since buying this book, he ALWAYS chooses this, plus one other!  He loves the interactiveness of it and the fact that he can ask mummy or daddy what THEY would choose to eat, wear, do for a living!  A great, great book that gets imaginations working overtime!
B000FGFSPG|5.0|Wonderfull DVD/CD set, well above my expectations.  DVD is PAL only, but, plays in a DVD-ROM drive, so don't be afraid.  This set is a must for all lovers of prog metal period.
B000002MNL|5.0|MOZ has always been a Poet and he always will be. Vauxhall and I is a collection of Songs and different settings from aucustic to Hard Core Rock that is classic to say the least. Billy Budd and the Billy Sheenan like Bass rift that makes this such a Hard Rock anthem, is a masterpiece with the song ending with a frightining \\" DON'T LEAVE US IN THE DARK!!\\" out take from a film as MOZ always gives us, and always has since his THE SMITHS days. My favorite song after Billy Budd must be Used to be a Sweet Boy, and then it must be Speedway or I am Hated For Loving. This is a collection of Poems and Music to be listened to time and again, but not studied so that you just enjoy it, for the same is with anything by Springsteen or Dylan as well as THE DOORS and Jaques Briel plus Berry White and Leonard Cohen.
B000009ED0|5.0|when i first started listenin to Kid Rock, i was blown away. it was something totally new for me. well, heres my review <br /> <br />Bawitdaba-5/5 probably one of the greatist opening tracks of all time. has the famous line \\"MY NAME IS KIIIIIIIIIIIIIID...Kid Rock!\\" <br /> <br />Cowboy- 5/5 my 3rd favorite song. kid starts out with some slow rap then at the end it gets great. <br /> <br />Devil Without A Cause- 5/5 wow..this really shows Kid's ability to rap. with joe c finishing things off with a rap then starts yellin \\"WHO LIKES TO PARTY ROCK THE PARTY!?!!?\\" and stuff like that. R.I.P. Joe C <br /> <br />I Am The Bullgod- 4/5 a pretty good song but after awhile it gets old. <br /> <br />Roving Gangster(Rollin) - 4/5 like Bullgod, it can get repetitive, but still its good. <br /> <br />Wasting Time- 3/5 sounds like filler material to me. a decent song, but i usually just skip over it. <br /> <br />Welcome 2 The Party (Ode 2 The Old School)- 5/5 a pretty long song with some woman (trying to) rap in the middle, but still one of my favorite songs on this album. he raps for 2 min straight the first verse, then kicks things up a notch in the last. <br /> <br />I Got One For Ya- 3/5 More filler material. sounds like it shouldve been on cocky or his self titled cd. usually just skip over this song too. <br /> <br />Somebodys Gotta Feel This- 5/5 My favorite song. this song kicks so much arse its not even funny. its pumpin til the very last. <br /> <br />Fist of Rage- 5/5 a real heavy song with him screaming in the chorus. a long guitar solo in the middle. <br /> <br />Only God Knows Why- 5/5 the first Kid Rock song i ever heard. this is my 2nd fav. song on this album. this is actually a slow song used with a voice box( or something). I love this song. i cant skip it. <br /> <br />F-ck Off- 4/5 An angry song that features Eminem at the very end. An ok song, but i usually skip it. its kinda hard to hear kid's voice in this one. <br /> <br />Where U At Rock- 5/5 i really likethis song. it ties with the title track for the best rhyming. wow <br /> <br />Black Chick, White Guy- 5/5 a slow song, but he still raps. 7 minutes long, he raps a story of two lovers and their problems. at the very end theres a remix of I Am The Bullgod, although its not as good as the original. <br /> <br />well there u go. this is Kid Rock at his best. If  your a Kid Rock fan, GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!
B000BB96MG|5.0|This new film version of the much-loved children's classic book<br /><br />\\"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\\" by Roald Dahl from director Tim Burton (\\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" \\"Batman,\\" \\"Batman Returns,\\" \\"Edward Scissorhands\\") is more faithful to the original story than the much-lauded 1971 film \\"Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory\\" starring Gene Wilder, which the author disapproved of. I've seen both movies and I can honestly say that, while the screenwriter made some changes (including-SPOILER!!!-expanding the original ending to include an important message about family-SPOILER OVER!!!), they help, rather than hurt the film and do not detract from the novel in any way. In his third family movie, Johnny Depp (\\"Finding Neverland,\\" \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl\\") plays the lovable chocolate maker with indelible charm. Freddie Highmore, Depp's co-star in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" is a joy as Charlie Bucket. The other child actors are supported by an A-list adult cast which includes David Kelly (\\"October Sky\\"), Helena Bonham-Carter (Franco Z.'s misguided \\"Hamlet,\\" Kenneth Branagh's excellent film version of \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,\\" TV's \\"Merlin,\\" the upcoming \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\"), Noah Taylor and horror master Christopher Lee (Sir Laurence Olivier's masterful version of \\"Hamlet,\\" the 1958 film version of \\"Dracula,\\" the James Bond adventure \\"The Man With The Golden Gun,\\" the 1973 version of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and its two sequels, \\"STAR WARS Episode II: Attack Of The Clones\\" and \\"STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\"). Rated G.
0316172324|5.0|Blink is a quick read.  I had read some of the information before, so I skipped parts of it. But the new stuff gave me much to think and talk over with friends. It has some eye opening info.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Donald Fagan is without question one of the great Master rock/jazz composers of the modern era. Often combining rock and jazz, the tunes on this CD are full-bodied, loaded with story and pleasing to the ear. You want to listen to them over and over again.  'Morph The Cat' opens this latest Fagen solo effort and you immediately are pulled into the driving bass followed by superb vocal arrangements and guitar work. The 'H Gang' is another terrific song with great lyrics and a rythym that moves you along. 'What I Do' is a medium tempo song about Donald talking to the ghost of Ray Charles. 'Brite Nightgown' is somewhat comical in it's presentation but is actually a trilogy of tales about a run-in with the Grim Reaper. You will love the vocals shared on this between Fagan and the lovely and talented Carolyn Leonhart, a regular vocalist with the Steely Dan team. 'The Great Pagoda Of Funn' is slower paced ballad about lovers pushing troubles away. Nice tune! 'Security Joan' is a 60's style rock song about a meeting with a female airport security guard and the love the follows. 'The Night Belongs to Mona' is an excellent piece of writing about a woman's night only lifestyle due possibly to post 9/11 fears. 'Mary Shut The Garden Door' is a fantastic arrangement with jazzy-Latin rythym and haunting vocal work, about  the take-over of the government by thugs (a well-placed poke at the current administration). There is not a single weak point on this CD. Donald Fagen's work here is diversified, carefully thought out and well placed. He never misses. And above all remember, You Can't Fight With the Fella in the Bright Night Gown!
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album is amazing.  It took me about 3 listens in order to fully appreciate the album, so don't give up on it if you don't get it at first.  I listened to it so much that I wore out my first copy and had to buy a second.  \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" and \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" are two of the best Wilco songs ever made.  Jeff Tweedy is at his best.  I'd also suggest watching the documentary \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" which chronicles to making of the album and the troubles that went along with it.  It gave me a new appreciation for my favorite artist.
B000G759LW|5.0|This girl does not disappoint! An absolutely stunning CD from the most talented voice of our generation! <br /> <br />Highlight for me is Save Me From Myself
1594481938|5.0|this is a very well written, very funny book.  and even if it was not so funny (which it definitely is) i would still love it.  4 very different voices tell the story and each is believable and different.  great book!
B0001I561E|5.0|Walt Disney Pictures struck gold yet again (as they've done since 1937, when Walt Disney released the comnpany's first animated feature film &quot;Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs&quot;) with another delightful animated family film, a classic alongside &quot;Beauty And The Beast,&quot; &quot;The Lion King,&quot; &quot;Toy Story&quot; and many other Disney favorites. The story is timeless, like &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; so I won't summarize it. &quot;Come on down, stop on by. Hop a Carpet And Fly To Another Arabian Night.&quot; Be prepared to discover &quot;A Diamond In The Rough.&quot; The special features (beginning on Disc 1 and continued on Disc 2), along with the movie, are &quot;A treasure-trove of riches&quot; destined to please everyone. The voice cast includes Linda Larkin, Scott W., Jonathan Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried and Robin Williams. I love this movie. Rated G.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just like the entire series before it. It is a must have.I enjoy watching it alot.I wish there were more coming up....
1587990717|1.0|Apparently Taleb never holds anything longer than a few weeks. A total gambler. Of interest to option players. Doesn't understand business. A suck-up to Mandelbrot. Egotistical. Spend your money on Levy's Mind of Wall Steet. Would give it minus thee if Amazon permitted.
B000GFLKF8|1.0|I know I've heard of Spike Lee before, so he's definitely not a new director, which is why he should know better than to make a ridiculous movie that I don't like.  He may have made the original \\"Shaggy Dog\\" or \\"Shaggy D.A.\\" movies but I'm not positive. <br /> <br />I don't like bank robbery movies, because I'm always thinking \\"yeah, right.  I'm so sure.\\"  Sometimes I'll be thinking \\"no way, Jose\\"  These are both problems that Spike Lee does not address in his movie called the \\"Inside Man.\\" <br /> <br />First of all, there are no inside men, so the movie is a lie.  Second of all--how come Spike Lee is making Jodie Foster play somebody who isn't 110% nice?  Come on!  Everybody loves Jodie Foster!  Spike Lee, you really should worry about believability in your next movies, if they allow you to make more. <br /> <br />Denzel Washington (\\"Heart Condition\\") is great as always.  And the guy with the mask on his face that's the lead mask-on-his-face guy is really good (especially when the mask is off his face). <br /> <br />I think bank robbers are immoral, and even if they steal from the rich and give to the poor (like Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) they are bad men who should be punished and I don't want to support their nasty habits by renting movies about them anymore. <br /> <br />Bottom line: This movie is a lie.
0375751513|5.0|I listened to the audio version, which was a delight.  This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul?  Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body.  This is a book to read and re-read.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I was a little hesitant to purchase this CD after hearing her debut track Like a Star. It didn't \\"grab\\" me in any way, but then I caught a listening party for the CD and I was hooked. My favorite tracks on the CD are Enchantment, Breathless, Butterfly, and Put Your Records On. Her voice is beautiful. The music is soft and relaxing. She posesses a simple elegance that reflects through her music. That's what I connected to as I listened. I would definitely recommend this CD.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is the best science-fantasy, for me, since LOTR... I was absolutley riveted by Chritian Bale's performance.  He simply morphs into the John Preston character. I rented this movie purely by accident and I have since bought a copy for my collection.  As a person who typically hates ninety percent of the movies I watch, this one has sailed into my top ten list.  I hope the studio releases an extended version of the DVD with deleted scenes and interview with Chritian Bale.  Gun Kata is way cool!
B000EULJLU|5.0|1. Vicarious - 5 out of 5 - I like the bass solo  2. Jambi - 3.5 out of 5 - I like the guitar solo, but the rest of the guitar playing is very simple.  3/4. Wings For Marie/ 10,000 Days - 5 out of 5  5. The Pot - 5 out of 5 - Extremely impressive vocals and lyrics  6. Lipan Conjuring  7/8. Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman)/Rosetta Stoned - 5 out of 5 - My favorite songs off the album. Extremely creative, especially the whole beginning of Rosetta Stoned in which Maynard uses a megaphone to distort his voice, insane drumming!!  9. Intension - 2.5 out 5 - not one of my favorite Tool songs, don't really like it, doesn't sound like the Tool that I'm used to from the past years (sounds too modernized).  10. Right in Two - 5 out of 5 - amazing tabla solo by Danny Carey, great vocals, alot of referrances to monkeys  11. Viginti Tres    All in all, those of you who don't own this album should buy it right now
B00006879E|5.0|I'm a confirmed baby-boomer and usually buy only 60's and 70's music, but after I got XM radio in my new pickup truck I started hearing a few newer songs that I liked and almost all of them were sung by \\"Maroon 5\\".  I didn't even know who they were.  I do now!  \\"Songs About Jane\\" is a great CD for playing over and over on a long drive or a boring commute.  It will keep your foot tapping and (weather permitting) you can roll down the window and slap the side of your door!  There are a couple of soft jazzy ballads mixed in to get your heart rate back down to normal.  The beat is usually relentless, the chord and key shifts beautiful and often unexpected, and the high vocal harmonies (wish there were more of them) are as precise as Lennon-McCartney or Heart.  Each week, a different song from this CD will find its way into your subconcious and refuse to leave!  OK, so a few of the songs do have a \\"Motown\\" aura to them...after Motown got mowed-down by rap, we need someone to revive the original Motown sound anyway.  Way to go Maroon 5 -- there is some hope for the music of the \\"X\\" (or is it \\"Y\\"?) generation!
B000G759LW|4.0|Mrs. Bratman's double-disc jazz throwback album is one of the freshest sounding albums to be released this year. With her mile-high pipes and chameleon-esque style, it's no wonder Christina is probably the only pop-culture icon that could pull off such a feat. Although it isn't perfect, the album does exceed this reviewer's expectations.<br /><br />Disc One of 'Back to Basics' is the modern take on jazz. Christina looks to hip-hop producers and heavy samples to make the first half of the album sound fresh and radio-friendly.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is probably one of the strongest tracks on the album. With it's heavy horns, sampled vocals, and tight-cut, fast-paced beats, it's no wonder it's one of the more prominent singles on the radio.<br /><br />Other tracks on the first half, like \\"Slow Down Baby\\" and \\"On Our Way\\" manage to stack-up against \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", and ballads like \\"Oh Mother\\" and the hip-hop R&B-tinged track \\"Understand\\" also stand-out.<br /><br />There is also an interlude on this half called \\"F.U.S.S.\\" that is kinda low-key. The initials of the track stand for \\"F*ck You Scott Storch\\", the hip-hop producer that refused to be a part of the project. But as she says, she 'still got the record out'. Gotta love it when artists call people out like that.<br /><br />But perhaps the strongest point on the first disc is \\"Still Dirrty\\", on which Xtina argues that she's 'still got the nasty in me'. The horn sample is crazy and the beat really swings the hips.<br /><br />Closer \\"Thank You\\" samples her previous hits 'Genie in a Bottle' and 'Can't Hold Us Down', over an old-school groove. It also samples messages from fans and is a very beautiful way to close the album.<br /><br />Disc Two is produced by Linda Perry, the woman responsible for \\"Beautiful\\". This disc is the actual jazz half of the album. Switching into a circus groove and old-time blues, the disc is rather short but very well-done.<br /><br />The intro is Linda Perry inviting you to the 'greatest show on earth' and is followed by a very fun song titled \\"Welcome\\".

Although the music is great, it was recorded with cloth over the mic to create a vintage sound. It wants to succeed, but becomes annoying much faster. If it had been recorded more like the previous tracks it would have been great, but it falls flat.<br /><br />The next track \\"Hurt\\" is Aguilera re-calling a love lost.

0375812024|4.0|This book has a cute, fun story with good illustrations like the other Scarry titles I've seen.  I don't know how much my daughter is learning from it, except that Mr. Frumble is one unlucky guy.  I haven't gotten tired of reading it, as happens sometimes, and that's as important as anything in the long run.  It takes me 5-10 minutes to read, and I don't get into some of the outside-the-story details which I think would only distract my daughter from the story at this age.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Perfect movie for everyone. No matter how many times I watch the movie it is always funny. Whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good.
B00005QFE5|4.0|This a tribute to pure, honest, life lasting love but at the same time it is a tribune to the liberation of women from the customs of a society that predetermined their entire life and behavior. <br />There is something beautiful in every aspect of this film, something that we enjoy and something that we can share with the heroes of this story either this is happiness or sadness. <br />And yet, one thing stands above all.  <br />The fact that this film can be considered as a an eulogy and tribute to the teachers the world round. <br />This is where one can see the difference of the teaching as a profession and as a rite, a service to community. <br />This film says the story of those brave teachers who were ready to dedicate their entire life in order to give to the deprived children of the countryside the basics of education. <br />My parents were teachers too and in the 30s when they started teaching they too had to accept as part of their salary a daily contribution from the villagers in the form of foodstuff.  <br />I thought of it as degrading and when I saw the same story, told in this film I realized that there were no budgets for education during those years and there was a different approach to contribution either for the survival of the teachers or for building a school etc. <br />This beautiful story is told in a perfect way through the brilliant directing of Zhang Yimou  and the acting of Zhang Ziyi  and Zheng Hao  <br />But the one who must be awarded with our respect and admiration is the director of photography Hou Yong who captures light and details in both colour and black/white in such an intensive way. <br />His ability to reverse the expected and use black/ white for recent scenes and colour when referring to the old story telling is exceptional. <br />This film is highly recommended for those who love Chinese quality cinema and for those who want to have an introduction in the best the Chinese Film Industry has to offer. <br /> <br />
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's world is a wonderful book that shares an appealing adventure of a little girl named Sophie Amundsen in search of herself and her role in the world that bore her. Sophie comes home from school one day to find a letter from a mysterious man Alberto, asking her two questions that we often overlook in our daily lives; \\"who are you?\\" And \\"were do we come from?\\" Thus, leading Sophie into an adventure of a philosophical journey gaining knowledge and wisdom from studing such philosophers like Plato all the way to contemporary thought of existentialism of Satre.<br />  The book has a mindbending twist that will expand the mind to another channel of thought that will leave one in utter suprise. The book is well written, and written by one of my favorite authors, but it does have weaknesses.<br />  The book is very informative about the history of philosophy and the study of ideas by many important philosophers, but at times it seems that your reading out of a school textbook rather than adventurous story. Jostein Gaarder wastes no time in getting the reader's attention at the beginning of the first chapter, but towards the end it seems some parts of the story comes out of place. For example, the folk story characters that Jostein uses to get his point across in the book  at times seems kind of childish and silly. But none the less, this is a an amazing book overall and should be read by anyone who has a interest in philosophy, because this book helps people establish a fine grasp of western philosophy in laymen's terms.<br />  Jostein Gaarder is an amazing author and I recommend his other great novel, The Solitare Mystery, another amazing philosophical book filled with hope and belonging. I hope this review is helpful and encourages you to read this wonderful book.<br />-\\"know thyself\\"
B000G75AE8|4.0|I have to say that compared with other bands out there and compared with other comebacks from thrash bands of the 80's, Slayer demonstrates that have not loose a gram of quality, energy and violence, they return to claim their seat as kings of the genre they invented and definitely a must-have album for this year. Now, having said that, compared with Slayer itself, the album fails to meet the expectations around this \\"good old times\\" mantra they tried to create with the return of Lombardo and the return to the traditional art cover. The album stays on the same line with their two previous records God Hates Us All and Diabolus, same level of aggression and energy, but quite predictable. They just have lost that capacity to create those multi-dimensional journeys as they used to do it with the pre-Seasons era. You will not find the speed of Reign in Blood, the scary atmosphere of South of Heaven nor the punch of the riffs of Seasons. This is a good record, no doubt about it, but gets short to reach Slayer's golden years.
B000002573|5.0|Even thirty years later, this is still one of the greatest hard rock albums ever. My cassette tape (yes, I still have one of those machines) may be showing its age, but this album isn't! Every song is a grand slam. When I need a shot of youthful enthusiam, I pop in this tape and I feel energized again! No other album can do for me what this eponymously named album can.<br /><br />ROCK ON, BOSTON!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you have ever seen Pink Floyd live then this will bring back wonderful memories.  The picture quality is great, especially when viewed on a high quality television or monitor.  The two disks are packed with so many hours of extras it is almost too much to take in one sitting so give yourself time.  Pulse is well worth the price and belongs in any true Pink Floyd fan's collection. <br /> <br />I only regret not seeing them live again.  Will it ever happen?
B00005JP0A|5.0|This movie shows us a transformation of Andy(Anne Hathaway) a beautiful, sweet, and all American young lady, with a laid-back approach to life who has just graduated from college with a degree in journalism, into a totally commited and dedicated professional who becomes the envy of many in the fashion world.  Perhaps the catalyst of this transformation is Nigel(Stanley Tucci) who is the only person willing to mentor Andy.  In one very crucial scene, when Andy comes crying to him(she has no one else to turn to in the firm) He tells her that she needs to understand that she must see the value in her work and the fashion industry, that it is immature to degrade an artform because it has been kept at a distance from her all her life.  This is the time in her life that she needs to step up to the plate and hit a homerun!  She shows the very important trait of genius:  the ability to listen!  She shows us that she can rise to the challenge and we can't help but feel proud of her.  Does she become spoiled by all this?  No!  She gets through it all with all her values intact and remains the wonderful woman that she is.  What a wonderful success story for feminism!  But what about her friends?  Instead of being happy for her, all they do is whine that she works too hard, and can't spend enough of time with them!  They tell her that her values have been distorted, but what do they expect from her?  She is still shown to us as her sweet self, just very busy and professional.  This is the only problem I had with this movie.  Does she give in to her friends at the end?  It would seem so, but this idea appears to be unjustified by the events of the movie.  There seems to be some confusion on this point.  Other than this(perhaps a little confusion is good!), the look and flow of the action were very pleasing, with wonderful fashion photography, set design, and effective dialog.  This movie should appeal to all interested in art, fashion, and strong female characters.
B000002B35|5.0|****1/2 <br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that this recording of the 1994 Earl's Court performance \\"seems to lack energy at times.\\" It sounds great, don't get me wrong, but the crowd doesn't seem particularly enthusiastic for most of the performance. Yes, they cheer, but I like a live album where you can hear them singing along faintly in the background and where the cheers following the performance of a song reach the same volume or a greater volume than the song itself. This is one of the things that separates a live recording from a studio album, and that energy is somewhat lacking on this CD. I can only conclude that none of the mics were angled towards the audience, but I get the impression that seeing this show live must have been incredible. <br /> <br />That said, Floyd sounds as good as ever on this work. The biggest attraction here is obviously the live performance of the entire \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" album, which is utterly fantastic. PULSE is worth owning for this live rendition of the Floyd's masterpiece alone. The rest of the material on here is an added bonus. PULSE includes what I believe is the best-ever recording of \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" but I do think it should have been the last encore rather than the first... but that's just me. In any case, it sounds better than the studio recording, which was fantastic to begin with.  <br /> <br />Floyd fans really can't go wrong here, especially those who enjoy the band's post-Waters work. Those who prefer the Waters-era Floyd the most will want this just for the DSOTM performance. This is a great live CD by any standard, and is well worth picking up.
B00000DLV1|5.0|This disc was the first one I heard from Portishead. After a couple of listenings I was kind of confused about the rhythms, voice tones, samplers and musical instruments. At the end you would love all this stuff and how they have conceptualized the idea of music without barriers, without all that common rhythms that have appeared in music history. I would strongly recommend this disc for every one who has never listened to Portishead, it is the starting point to enjoy all their creations.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Great being able to watch them one after another with no commercials.  Can't wait for the Complete 2nd season to come out.
0449911357|4.0|I had never heard of this book before and simply picked it up on an impulse. Boy, was I lucky! Fannie Flagg is an amazing author. I sunk into the world of the book everytime I picked it up and by the time I was done, Idgie, Sipsey, Ninny and the other characters had become a part of my life!  <br /> <br />I would have given it five stars but for the totally predictable and cinematic ending. Nevertheless, it was feel-good - so am not complaining too much. Overall, if you would like to transport yourself to another age and place right from the comfort of your arm-chair, Fried Green Tomatoes would be a very good choice indeed!
B000028U0Y|5.0|Then we started fighting, and Cash started singing about stomping in his old dog's head, and all of a sudden I was on top of this guy, punching him in the face, like full on bum fight style. Then I ran across the street and kicked a kid off his bike. Hee-yah! I tied my stereo to the bike, cranked it to ten, and rode off, flipping off several old people as I rode by them. The chick old person was peeved, but the old man gave me a thumbs up. Johnny Cash fan, I thought, and peddled away.
B000062YAY|4.0|This was actually the first Slayer album I bought. Up until that point I was mainly into slower stuff - things with a heavy groove, stuff with breakdowns, really tight rhythm sections, etc. <br />Slayer was and is a whole different ball game than that. Since that time I've gotten into heavier and heavier music [while at the same time stretching further into the world of jazz (I'm a sax player by trade, as well as a bass player). However, every time I crank this album up, I get this feeling like \\"Man, what have I been listening to the past couple weeks?! Emperor?! Killswitch Engage?!\\" <br />Emperor and KsE are two excellent bands [especially Emperor's final album; it was an absolute masterpiece], but you can hear Slayer in both bands [and every other modern metal band on the planet]. <br />It's always amusing for me to note one thing. I've heard bands try to cover Slayer tunes live (usually Raining Blood or Angel Of Death, etc), and they just sound terrible. Not necessarily for lack of technical ability on the part of the bands, but for the vocals. I've heard vocalists try to do a hardcore or death metal interpretation of Tom's vox, and it just doesn't fit. There's a certain thing about his yell (you can't usually call it a scream, exactly...); it makes him more ominous-sounding, more believable half the time, than most metal vocalists to come after him. <br />If you've never heard much Slayer, I would tell you to get this album, along with Seasons In The Abyss and the new cd, Christ Illusions.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I was glad to find this on CD and feel that the product was a reasonable price and good quality.
0743454537|4.0|I loved this book from the first time I read it.  It's one of the most emotionally sincere works I've seen in a long time.  To see daily life through the eyes of the different characters is as true to \\"real life\\" as it gets.  Wonderful!
B000007T2Z|5.0|This is headphones music. To be listened to alone as it takes you on a trip over the landscape, full of valleys and peaks. A natural orchestra of modern life, that picks up and tranmits bits of radio static as it flows out. More like a painting or a collage of images than traditional music that if you're lucky will inspire you to do something yourself.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|'Brick' is smart.  It's a twist on the general crime noir, giving it an all too real feel by involving our deteriorating youth.  The majority of this film takes place on school grounds or in mom and pops basement, but it never feels amateur or immature.  This is mostly due to the cast of young actors who play their parts with sincerity and caution, not to appear too 'high-schoolish' while never crossing the line as to appear 'too old for the game' if you know what I mean.  These are the high school students of today. <br /> <br />When Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets a message from his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin) claiming to need help of some sort he finds himself delving deep into the underground ring of high-school crime, and when Emily shows up dead this leads Brendan to encounter and befriend (sort-of) all sorts of twisted teens, from the 26+ drug king known as The Pin (Lukas Haas) to his impatient strong arm Tug (Noah Fleiss) to the mysterious rich girl Laura (Nora Zehetner) who seems all to eager to help Brendan in his journey to uncover Emily's killer. <br /> <br />Joseph plays Brendan, the loner student who always hangs on the outskirts of trouble, with enough subtlety and lax to make him believable.  You know he wants to help but you get the feeling it's not just because he feels he has too; I think he just knows that he can.  I've been a fan of Joseph's for a while now, favoring his brilliant work in Mysterious Skin over unworthy Oscar nominee Terrance Howard last year, and with 'Brick' Levitt continues to prove his weight in gold.  Meagan Good also turns out a convincing conniving manipulative tramp in the form of Drama Queen Kara, and Mike O'Leary does a great job as Brendan's confidant and friend The Brain. <br /> <br />The script is also a major plus, creating an almost poetic lingo for today's teens, giving the film an interesting perspective and leading to some very interesting conversations.  Since there are a lot of those it's good tohave dialog that grabs you and holds your attention.  Some of the best dialog is shared between Brendan and The Brain, the both of them spitting off line after line fluently and effortlessly.  As far as plot boilers go 'Brick' pulls no punches and it delivers 100% giving us something new, fresh and unique, something that if done wrong could have been disastrous, but with a brilliant script and acting to boot 'Brick' easily becomes one of the most fascinating and memorable thrillers in the recent years.
B000001A3H|4.0|Much has been said about Kyuss having been fuelled by peyote, various hallucinogens and other drugs. And like a drug trip the best way to actually understand it is to experience it because words just don't really express or explain when. This is hard rocking psychadelica at its best with no bull. Even better Kyuss don't take them selves too seriously, which translates here to the band not only playing brilliant but playing with great enthusiasm because there having such fun.  <br /> <br />This is joyous blissed out music which deserves a spot in everyon rock fans collection
0792164903|4.0|Depp did a string of adaptations in the late 90's early 00's, 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'From Hell' to name a few.  I hadn't until the other night seen this film, but I had heard mixed reviews regardless.  It's by no means a wonderful film, but its stylish take on the classic tale is a bit intriguing.  Depp plays Crane, a detective sent to unravel the mystery behind recent beheadings in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.  The townsfolk all know it's the work of the headless horseman, but Crane isn't convinced.   <br /> <br />Depp plays his character as only Depp could, with that awkward feeling permeating every move that makes his characters appear more natural than rehearsed.  Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's mysterious love interest, does a decent job as well, carrying her weight in a Depp driven project, but its Burton who really steals the show.  Tim is one of our finest directors, and as was mentioned, he is over-the-top, but that's what makes him so enjoyable.  There's no subtlety, and like with most of Burton's masterpieces it is layered with humor which adds to the atmosphere only Burton can paint. <br /> <br />I didn't find this to be a scary film, not in the least, but it was an interesting film with enough entertaining value to keep the viewer watching time and time again.
B0000039QA|1.0|Honestly, tell me what is musical about this. The only thing that changes through any of these \\"songs\\" are the lyrics.  <br />Let's summarize: some tub of goo talking about being a low-life to the same beat for a few minutes at a time. I'll stick with music.
B000G759LW|5.0|This cd is great. Every song on this album is good. Christina's vocals are amazing and powerful as they always are. You can hear the passion in her voice as she tries to capture the sounds of old school r&b and soul music. The production is really good too. DJ Primiere and Linda Perry really delivered some genius work for Christina on this album. I think she did a wonderful job paying tribute to her inspirations from the past, as well as proving that she is a talented artist. This is a must have for your end of the summer collection. Hot songs: Understand, Back In The Day, Mercy On Me.
B00009W8N2|5.0|A supreme piece of music from this amazing band. Has a much more shadowy, midieval feel to it, portraying a cold, archaic, beautiful landscape. Production not as lush as subsequent releases, but perfectly suits the mood of the songs. Each song is outstanding, right down to the interludes \\"Silhouette\\" and \\"Requiem\\". My first Opeth album, a great place to start for fans of any kind of Scandinavian metal. Not a weak point to be found in the entire disc, you cannot be disappointed.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This movie is really timeless and the acting is superb. At the time this was made, Gloria Swanson and William Holden were actually romantically involved which makes the movie even more interesting. She was also involved with Joseph Kennedy, Sr., and one has to wonder how he would have reviewed this movie. The part of Max was skillfully played by the actual director and the settings were indicative of an era long past in which Norma Desmond lived in her heyday.  This was one of only 2 movies where a corpse did the narration;the other being \\"Laura\\". Though I've seen this many times I see something anew each time I watch it.  This was the day of real actors who knew how to act.  A very well-acted movie.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I have a hard time listening to this CD when not in autumn or winter, because memory really ties this album to those seasons. That said, this is a relaxing disc worthy of any collection. Warm yet depressing, Damnation brings elements of Pink Floyd to the accessibility of the modern listener. If you are looking for something exclusively heavy, Opeth is not your band, especially not this album. But fans of Opeth or any other metal with multi-textural taste, pick this up right away.
B000EWBNMS|4.0|Alison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) is a medium (someone that sees dead people) and also a psychic that sometimes can see things that might happen in the future. As if that were not enough, she is a law student, and most importantly, a suburban mother that must take care of her family. But how can she help others with her abilities without looking strange to others, people that would very likely consider her a freak or a liar?<br /><br />The solution to Alison's problem comes rather easily, if not too conventionally. She convinces the Phoenix District Attorney Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) that her unusual skills can be very helpful to find and trap criminals, and is afterwards employed by him, without unveiling the real reason of her presence at the District Attorney's office.<br /><br />The first season of \\"Medium\\" shows us some of the cases Alison helps to investigate, as well as her family life with her husband Joe (Jake Weber), and her two daughters, Ariel (Sofia Vassilieva) and Bridget (Maria Lark). It is interesting to point out that this series was inspired by a real life story, that of a research medium also called Allison Dubois.<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you will enjoy \\"Medium\\", provided that you like a well-written and produced series that has all the ingredients of a great whodunit, but also some supernatural aspects that make it different (even if you don't believe in mediums!). For my part, I really enjoy it, and I'm very happy that this show already has a second season. Of course, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000301YY8|1.0|It would be hard to imagine a whinier record by a male performer. It's hard to believe this guy was a British army veteran. One would think they would have knocked all the whimpering out of him in boot camp. This is the music they play in Loserville.
B000G759LW|5.0|Nobody has ever doubted whether or not Christina Aguilera had the vocal chords to succeed in the industry. From the moment she set foot in the industry, we've all been awakened by a voice that is simply so intricate, unique, and refreshing. A truly gifted talent, the only question surrounding this one-of-a-kind perfromer has been whether or not she would ever put together that timeless classic that would thump the eardrums of listeners forever. Well, fast forward a near decade and the times have come full circle, Back To Basics is undoubtedly an instant classic. <br />   For her follow-up to the very impressive sophomore album Stripped, Christina Aguilera enlisted the help of two of the industry's most creative songwriters/producers, DJ Premiere and Linda Perry, to create the unique sound of the double-disc compilation. DJ Premiere does an admirable job fusing the sound of the 20's, 30's, & 40's (mostly through samples) with the drums, synth, and bass-heavy vibes of our modern sound, ultimately bringing about an exhilarating vibe to Disc One. Meanwhile, Linda Perry (who many will recognize as the composer of Christina's former #1 hit, \\"Beautiful\\") manages to recreate quite a replication of the music of the laissez-faire age. Nevertheless, it should be noted that while the motive behind the second disc is first and foremost to bring the sound of that era back to life, there is certainly much more than swing music and muffed mics. In fact, while Back To Basics is undeniably a throwback album, what ultimately separates it from everything else on the market is that it is much more than the simple covering of an era.  <br />   Disc One starts off with a simplistic, bass-knocking intro, as an announcer comes onto the record and introduces, in his words, \\"The one and only, there will never be another... Christina Aguilera.\\" Fitting that he would say this, for these words set the tempo to the rollercoaster ride of a classic that every listener will surely never forget. Fromthere, the throwback begins, as Aguilera belts, \\"I've waited for some time/ To get inside the minds/ Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside.\\" In fact, Aguilera pays lyical tribute to her idols twice, because on the head-bobbing \\"Back In The Day\\", where she endlessly boasts of how important it is for us to recognize the sounds of the past, she sings, \\"So breakout your Marvin Gaye, your Etta James, your Lady Day, and Coldtrain/ Turn up your 45's, bring back to life the sound and vibe of yesterday.\\"  Seemlessly flawless, track-after-track moves with ease, from the horn-blasting, throwback lead-single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", to the catchy, hip-hop influenced and yet still retro jam \\"Slow Down Baby\\", to the soothing vocals of the beautiful ballad \\"Without You\\".  Disc One is such an invigorating replication of an often disregarded era of music in our society that it's almost as if Aguilera has created an all new genre of music, as the thirteen tracks should win over legions of fans both young and old.  <br />   Despite the lively, stimulating vibe of her upbeat records, perhaps Aguilera is at her best when she is not belting, but rather softly singing, thoroughly allowing her emotions to do the talking instead. Disc Two happens to showcase two of Aguilera's most emotional records ever recorded, \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Save Me From Myself\\". On the former, singing over the backdrop of a melancholy beat, she speaks of how she's so sorry for hurting and blaming a man she now desperately needs. On the latter, which is a pure dedication to her husband Jordan Bratman, Aguilera puts together perhaps the greatest vocal she has ever strung together. While it doesn't contain any of the signature belting we've become so accustomed to hearing from her, it's the softness of her voice that brings about a certain vulnerable tone that we've probably never seen from her, or better yet, maybe any artist over the past generation. <br />   Although \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Save Me From Myself\\" are the peak of Disc Two, one can be assured that Disc Two still has much more to offer. The infectious, swing-dance vibe emitted by \\"Candyman\\" should be an instant crowd pleaser, as should the jazz-club sexual nature of \\"Nasty Naughty Boy,\\" where Aguilera sultrily sings, \\"Ooh, there I go again/ I need a spankin' cause I've been bad/ So let my body do the talkin'/ I'll slip you that hot, sweet, sexy lovin'.\\" Finally,  \\"Trouble\\", undoubtedly the most authentic throwback on the album, should attract the curiousity of listeners everywhere, as the voice of Christina over a muffed mic and a static-laden backdrop should interest many.  <br />   Ever since Aguilera put out her self-titled debut, we've been patiently waiting for her to revive and refresh an industry that has quite frankly lost it's touch. In less than a decade, the former Mousketeer has delivered with an album that speaks volumes to her peers. Back To Basics is not only the best album to be released this year, it's the greatest release of the 21st century! <br />
B000002I97|5.0|I first saw John Prine on the old Phil Donahue show.  I immediately bought this record.  The date on this must be wrong because I know it came out in the 70's.  There is not a single track on this album I did not love.  I can say that on only a handful of CDs.  However, those other CDs cannot draw you in like Prine's stories.  In the 90's I got to see him perform in Orange County, CA.  Huge expectations - no disappointment.  Thanks John.

I sacrificed sleep going over every meticulously-produced song on this two-disc (2!) wonder. 2 was also the hour of the morning when my head finally hit the pillow after finishing this musical feast.<br /><br />Forget iTunes. Don't even bother with Limewire. Get out the wallets and B-U-Y the physical copy at your nearest retailer. The thick CD booklet is just as amazing, filled with a gorgeous high-gloss photo spread and actual lyrics for all 22 tracks (yes, actual lyrics!). All in all, possibly the best pop album of the year...actually, scratch that; it transcends pop. To simply call it pop would be like calling Mount Rushmore a pile of rocks.<br /><br />Normally, I wouldn't push a CD so strongly. But \\"B2B\\" deserves the praise it has been receiving from reviewers. The standard has been raised. Bow your heads in shame, all you Rihannas/Nelly Furtados/Cassies of the world.<br /><br />Christina, get your dress and acceptance speech ready NOW for the 2007 Grammys.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />H.P.M.
B000G759LW|5.0|You absolutely have to get this album. Regardless of any reservations you may have, this album is endlessly wonderful. From the first song, Christina unleashes a vocal power that captivates you, preventing you from skipping to other songs before each song ends. A continuous playback of great tracks. It will definitely become a classic. To be honest, however, Christina's attempt at being retroactive with her music into the 50's era has failed. The album possesses only 3 or so songs which bring about the retro feel, two of which you already know, \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"I've Got Trouble\\". The music has a current appeal, but still makes for great listening nonetheless. So don't go expecting the album to be making you feel as if you're watching a black and white television set dripping in 30's, 40's and 50's sounds. Christina is still in 2006. She may have missed at the \\"retrospective\\" part, but she's got the great music on point like a pin! You won't get bored. Believe me.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I have been waiting for 90210 to come out on DVD for years. This was my favorite show for it's entire 10 year run. I am a huge Shannen Doherty fan and can't wait to watch all these old episodes again and again. I never understood why it took so long to get this fabulous show on DVD. I can't wait until November...I am sooooo excited!
1400032717|5.0|I used to volunteer with disabled children, some of whom were autistic, and must say that Mark Haddon gives readers incredible insight on how these people see their world.  The reader is able to understand Christopher's logical approach to the world, taking of everything literally, and difficulty of understanding other's emotions both from his point of view, and see how frustrating this can be for others, which is essentially the premise for the entire plot.  Some of Christopher's ramblings can become tedious, but at the same time offer even more insight into his world.  Highly recomended.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|If you're looking for a movie that will keep you thinking until the last minute (and then some), this is the one!  Denzel Washington does a great job as NYPD detective.  Not a lot of special effects or shootem up.  But more of a \\"what's going on here, this is isn't a typical robbery\\" type of movie.<br /><br />Great music soundtrack as well!<br /><br />Go on and order it!  Or both, the soundtrack as well! You won't be sorry!  Keepers for the libray here!
0307120007|5.0|WHAT A GREAT BOOK. Toddler gets to touch and feel stuff just like Paul and Judy.  I think this book also makes a perfect gift for new moms.
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Deep was great in this film! It really did justice to the stephen King novella. What else is there to say, the film is highly recomended to anyone who likes Stephen King.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyds last tour is the most amazing spectacle of light and sound ever created. There is not one bad moment on this DVD. Plus it has some great extras.
B00000ILDF|1.0|Aliens was the perfect conclusion, but this ruins it. Bad effects, plot, and etc make a bad film. It only deserves one star for Sigourney Weaver and thats it. <br /> <br />P.S. Stay away from the fourth at all costs unless you are either a diehard fan of this series, Sigourney Weaver, or C.G.I. exploitation.
0802714544|4.0|Brilliant story of espionage during the Cold War.   <br /> <br />The second last chapter is the book's only flaw as le Carre uses a conversation between Mundt and Liz to hit the reader over the head with the message that the spies of the East and the West are alike in that they both believe the means justifies the ends.  This was unnecessary and a little insulting to the reader's intelligence because le Carre has already made this point with the story itself.  However, I'll chalk this up to an author in his youth.   <br /> <br />All in all, I cannot recommend a better spy story.
B000G759LW|5.0|After Christina's long 4 year absence from the music scene, people wondered if she still had \\"it\\".  Well, this album proves that she has \\"it\\" with more than enough to spare!  \\"Back to Basics\\" is truly an amazing album, each song speakes to your soul and makes you feel something, whether it be sadness, hope, or pure fun.  With this album, Christina has entered the level of Mariah and Madonna, she's now an icon!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Boy does this band have a heck of a time living up to not only the expectations of their fans, but the critics too. That is very understandable since their 3 studio albums (excluding their debut EP) are considered to be masterpieces. \\"Undertow\\", \\"Aenima\\" and \\"Lateralus\\" rank as classic releases and cemented Tool's reputation as the best alternative metal band of all time. And the fact that Tool takes their sweet time putting albums out (an average of 4 years between CDs) only serves to enhance their reputation.  <br /> <br />Given such lofty standards, \\"10,000 Days\\" doesn't quite measure up. However, it still ranks as one of the best releases of 2006. The main complaint I have repeatedly seen from the so-called 'music critics' is that Tool has failed to make every second of this 78 minute opus perfect. GIVE ME A FREAKIN' BREAK! If there is a minimum of 45 to 50 minutes of great music on a CD, it has to be considered a success. 10K Days easily achieves this goal. Compare that to the critically acclaimed Jack White/Raconteurs debut: their album clocks out at 34 minutes! Would you pay $12.00 for what, no matter how good it might be, is essentially an EP? <br /> <br />But this latest Tool release does have a number of flaws that put it one category below their other full length albums. First off, no song can remain completely interesting for more than 11 minutes (the title track and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\"). The slow tempo intro of the title song goes on WAY too long. If these still excellent songs had been about 20% shorter, you could tack on an entire 1/2 a star to 10K Days' rating. Tool should have considered reducing the average length of the \\"real\\" songs on this CD just a bit. In the same vein, the experimental/filler tunes are extraneous, unnecessary and add nothing to the overall quality of the album.  <br /> <br />My biggest problem with this album is a complaint that I never thought I would utter. Maynard has become the weak link in this group of virtuosos and he appears to have \\"phoned in\\" his vocals on 10K Days. Keenan was, up until recently, hands down the BEST vocalist in modern rock and one of the greatest of all time. With his efforts on this album, his reputation will no doubt suffer (maybe he was distracted thinking about the next A Perfect Circle CD). I would rate Josh Homme, Serg Tankian, Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale and few others above Maynard now. Compare the power and range he showed on \\"Undertow\\" to this release, and it is obvious that Keenan's vocal ability has fallen off a cliff. Its either that, or he just decided to put in a subpar effort. His vocal style on the first few minutes of \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" almost ruin a potentially world-class track. What a huge disappointment Maynard is on 10K Days. His only saving grace is that the lyrics on this CD are fairly compelling and interesting. <br /> <br />So, regardless of how mildly dissatisfying 10K Days is, Tool are still far and away the best band in rock and deserve comparisons with such all-time great groups as Zeppelin, Sabbath, Floyd, Yes, etc. The problem with rock critics is that they will listen to a release a few times over the span of a few days and decide its intrinsic quality and worth. You cannot be so superficial with a Tool release. It usually takes me a lot longer to get my head around all the subtleties and nuances of a Tool CD in comparison to most of the music I buy and this album is no different. All the \\"real\\" tracks on 10K Days are symphonic in nature, with complex movements and fascinating time signatures and changes. And the musicianship reestablishes the fact that Adam Jones, Justin Chancellor and Danny Carey are probably the most accomplished guitarist/bassist/drummer combination in rock music today. It is undeniable that Maynard Keenan's effort on 10K Days doesn't match his bandmates' achievements. Its a real shame since we probably won't be in line for another Tool release for quite some time (2010 if their history is used as a time frame). Hopefully those who have disparaged 10K Days will have the decency and common sense to give this album another chance and allow its intricacies and unparalled musicianship to change their feeble, shallow minds. They won't be dissappointed if they allow the subtle majesty of 10K Days to penetrate their jaded souls.
1400032717|5.0|I originally purchased this book because I have a nephew with Asperger's Syndrome, but took forever to read it.<br /><br />Let me say that I read quickly, but I finished this novel in one afternoon, it was that compelling and that good.<br /><br />Christopher Boone is 15, autistic, and a mathematics genius.  He doesn't understand humor or social interaction but still interacts with the world in his own unique way.  One of the things in the book that was the most touching, and untimately heartbreaking, is his relationship with his parents.  It is very realistic, including how the average parent copes (or does not cope) with an autistic child.  The way in which Christopher relates his Father's conversation with the schoolmaster is disjointed and very literal to Christopher, but we see it as a very plain example of his Father's love for him and his determination to do the best for his very different, very special son.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough.  Even if you don't have a motivation to read it from the autism angle, the novel itself is such a wonderful and wonderfully written story that anyone should enjoy it.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is truly a book that you can't put down. The second book in the triology shifts perspectives and is no longer shown from Sabriel's point of view. I personally thought that was a let down, but this book is good.
B000E8N690|5.0|I'd bet i'd move it all a little farther down the line, far from Folsom Prison, thats where I want to stay.    As I write this review I'm listening to Walk the Line soundtrack, Cocaine Blues, great song.  \\"I was dressed in black\\"  Sorry I'll try to refrain from writing any more song lines down.  Okay first of all, I think Joquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in this time.  I mean, I thought he was good in Gladiator and the Village, in this he should have got an Oscar.  Singing all of the songs and acting awesomely at the same time!  That deserves a ZOUNDS!    Reese Witherspoon is very good too.  She doesn't sing as well as Joquin, but she still gives a great performance.  The movie chronicles his entire life from his rise to fame, to his struggle with drugs, to him rising up again.    Overall watch this movie, it gave me a much better appreciation for Mr. Cash and his life.      \\"You'll wake up some cold day and find your alone, you'll ask for me but I'm gonna tell you BYE BYE BYE, When I turn around and walk away your gonna CRY CRY CRY.
1904920209|5.0|...I just got a replacement copy for the DVD which played badly (freezing, pixelating, sound continuing but picture stopped) and the new DVD is just as bad. I play DVDs in my computer, not a DVD player...but every other DVD I own works just fine in my computer! I'll let a neighbor, who also wants the book, try it in her DVD player.   Anyway, I made a bread without the help of the DVD and it was excellent. I love all the different recipes in here which are breads I want to make and eat, plus none really seem too involved, including the ciabatta. Great photos. 5 stars for the book, 0 stars for the DVD. (Edit: I finally got a working copy of the DVD, which was helpful in showing his kneading process. It was not essential to have the CD to make use of the book and to make the breads. The CD is general in nature, and is not a replacement for the book.)
B000294SFW|5.0|Now THIS is what Motorhead's all about. After a looong time Motorhead is sounding like Motorhead again. This stuff just KILLS the new stuff by Metallica (St anger..puke!) and Megadeth (TSHF). Funny how the band (Lemmy of course) who inspired them all is now beginning to actually surpass their inspirations 20+ years later.  Truly standout tracks on this release are ''Lifes a Bitch'', and ''Killers''. Best rock album of 2004 IMO. Buy or POSE, choice is yours..
B00004RF97|5.0|I am a huge James Stewart and Cary Grant movie fan. This movie has one laugh after the other.This is a great love story that the whole family can watch and enjoy! The way the movie ends is the way you want it to.There is a time when you think that it is going to go the opposite way for Cary Grant...He gets the girl!
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Really bad thriller that makes Keanu's last two-matrix movies look like masterpieces compared to this film. Keanu is miscast to the point of hurting the film and his performance as John Constantine should be considered a criminal act. I agree with everyone who have seen this film that Rachel Weisz does do wonders for this horrible film with her amazing performance but she is by herself in the good acting department and does not get a real actor to play with until the end where Peter Stormare shows up as the king of darkness himself but with only four minutes of screen time, he does not make an enough presence to give Weisz the support she needs to save this film. <br /> <br />See the film in order to witness a great actress who's trying desperately to save this film but other than her grant effort to give the audience something to watch, she's let down (as well as the viewer) by a badly written script and a leading man who can't act.  <br />
0920668372|5.0|My kids loved this story as small children, and asked me to buy it(they're now 27,20,&18) It's a classic, with a rhythm to the words that appeals to toddlers and preschoolers...the art work is more modern than our original copy but bright and cheery
B000HCO840|5.0|This is a five out of five film. Did anyone stay until after the credits? The professor returns! <br /> <br />If you are just one of those people who love movies then this is a great movie for you. I never read the comics but I love the movies; this one is no different.
0679441018|4.0|Anne Rice's novels have always dealt with evil in relation to good and have always carried with them the massive Catholic undertones of her childhood.  This novel brings those questions, and in essence the very nature of our existence, into the forefront of her vision.<br /><br />I'll admit that the novel was hard to sink into in the beginning, but there came a point sometime in the middle where her vampire hero finds himself face to face with the devil as he recounts the tale of Genesis from what he claims to be the true story, and I found myself utterly enthralled.  It's an incredibly sympathetic view of the devil, painting him as an angel who could not comprehend the nature of suffering as it relates to God's vision.  But all the while, there exists a distrust amongst the two partners, as Lestat questions the impact of what he's been told and the implication of a devil who could be more pure of heart than his God.<br /><br />Some compare the dialogue between God and the devil in this novel to a debate between two philosophy majors.  I myself don't see the problem with that.  If anything it adds to the uncertainty of every piece of knowledge that we claim to possess, and nothing is for certain when the matter pertains to our Gods.  There's already tremendous fear and distrust in this world when it comes to the nature of God and the devil and their relationship to one another.  There's a grandiose horror in Rice's speculation that they know no more about the workings of this world than we do.  An experiment gone wrong, if you will.  Still, the characters are at all times long-winded and this book won't be a winner for everyone.  If you, like myself, already had an acute interest in both philosophy and more importantly, theology, I think you'll enjoy this book quite a bit.  Recommended to the interested for my part.
B000002JPA|5.0|In 1992, prog metal masterminds Dream Theater released their sophmore album Images And Words. It's by far their best and is arguably the best prog rock album of the whole 90s.<br /><br />Even though I don't do this often, I'll review the musicians before the album:<br /><br />James Labrie - Vocals. His vocals work perfectly with Dream Theater's music. You gotta love his falsetto. It works great with songs like Another Day and Take The Time.<br /><br />John Petrucci - Guitars. Honestly one of the greatest guitarists I've ever heard. He just proves that if you learn classical trained instead of.... modernly trained, you can do some crrrrrazy stuff with the guitar!!<br /><br />John Myung - Bass. Even though his bass may be hard to hear over John's wailing guitar solos, whenever you hear him, his work is VERY impressive (and this is coming from a bassist)<br /><br />Kevin Moore - Keyboards. An awesome keyboardist. He often trades off solos with John Petrucci in songs like Take The Time and Under A Glass Moon. He can make the keyboard sound angry and thrashy (like in Pull Me Under and Take The Time) to soft and soothing (like in Another Day and Surrounded). He also wrote DT's biggest hit Pull Me Under<br /><br />Mike Portony - Drums. Probably my 2nd favorite member of DT (Petrucci is #1). Even if you know nothing about percussion or rythm, you can easily tell that he's a killer drummer.... maybe even the best drummer of the new generation!<br /><br />Anyway, the album. Believe the hype! DT are masters of both their lyrics and their instruments. The way it usually works in I&W is that there is a heavy song, then a softer song, then a heavier song, etc. At times the songs may sound somewhat cheesy, but you can't deny what visionaries the 5 of them are. Even though DT is a prog metal band, if you compare this to their heavier albums like Awake and Train Of Thought, this is more of a prog rock album. But that doesn't take away any of the album's stength. Now onto the songs:<br /><br />Pull Me Under - 10/10 Easily the catchiest on the album, and DT's biggest hit to date. Pull Me Under is obviously about death, or dying, or thinking about death (\\"Every breath leaves me one lat to my last!\\"). It starts of real slow with an acoustic guitar and a piano, but quickly turns heavier. The chorus is also very catchy and memorable (\\"Pull me under! Pull Me Under! Pull Me under, I'm not afraid!\\"). One of the best off the album and one of DT's best songs even today.<br /><br />Another Day - 10/10 Why do people hate this song so much?! I thought it was beautiful (for lack of a better word). It was written by John Petrucci, and is about his father's stuggle with cancer. There's a great slow and wailing guitar solo by John and a memorable chorus (\\"You won't find it here, look another way. You won't find it here, so die another day!\\"). Also, you just gotta love the saxaphone throughout it.<br /><br />Take The Time - 8.5/10 Imagine that Slayer and Yes teamed up and made a song, because that's exactly what this song sounds like. While this song has a catchy chorus and meaningful lyrics, it gets a little silly at times, like before James sings the lyrics there's some crazy dialogue. And this is just my opinion, but I think the song should've just ended after the piano interlude. Still good though.<br /><br />Surrounded - 9/10 Probably the poppiest off the album. From what I hear, it's about the AIDs virus spreading. I like the piano/keyboard intro, and I prefer this songs over Take The Time, but a bit too poppy for my tastes.<br /><br />Metropolis - Pt 1 \\"The Mircale And The Sleeper\\" - 10/10 BAM! Easily the best song since Pull Me Under. It starts off with some percussion and a keyboard which both give the song a sort of a mystical feeling. But then it quickly becomes heavy with some great guitar riffs. It's basically the entire SFAM album in a nutshell. This is also where John Myung shines. Nothing needs to be said about this song that hasn't already beensaid.<br /><br />Under A Glass Moon - 10/10 One of the heaviest off the album, and in my opinion, the best. John performs his best solo and the whole album. And you gotta love the chorus: \\"Outside the soundness of you mind, bathing your soul in silver tears, beneath a blackened summer sky, praying for time to disappear!\\"<br /><br />Wait For Sleep - N/A Basically the intro to Learning To Live with James singing over Kevin's keyboard and piano. Most people tend to skip it, but if you pay attention to the lyrics, it's really a fascinating song.<br /><br />Learning To Live - 10/10 My 2nd favorite off the album (UAGM is #1), and the longest. According to popular belief, it's also about the aids virus, and the chorus probably represents that belief the most: \\"The way your heart sounds makes all the difference. It's what decides if you'll endure the pain we all feel. The way your heart beats makes all the diffrence, I'm learning to live. Here before is my soul I'm learning to live. I won't give up. 'Till I've no more to give.\\" An awesome way to end the album. Instead of just ending, the songs slowly fades away until you can't hear it.<br /><br />Well, that's my take and I&W. It's worth you $11, and was one of the best of 1992... dare I say even better than NIN's Broken and Alice In Chains Dirt?... I dare! Anyway, this album is recommended immensly and I doubt you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Long live Dream Theater!!!st. John performs his best solo and the whole album. And you gotta love the chorus: \\"Outside the soundness of you mind, bathing your soul in silver tears, beneath a blackened summer sky, praying for time to disappear!\\"    Wait For Sleep - N/A Basically the intro to Learning To Live with James singing over Kevin's keyboard and piano.

B000286S8S|3.0|Since their debut album in 1978 Van Halen has changed how rock music was played blah blah blahdededa!  Since this is a greatest hits album the formula is different, instead of writing an intro just to take up space and a track listing; instead i'll write an intro that takes up space and then do a pro and con chart, if you want to know what the song is about either read one of my normal reviews or do one better and buy the album!<br /><br />Here is the pointless intro:<br /><br />In 1995 Van Halen started planning the creation of a greatist hits album; it revolved around the idea of releasing a double disc album, one with Classic Van Halen material, one with Van Hagar material.  After much dispute they put that idea back on the shelf and instead went with a single disc compilation called \\"The Best of, vol.1\\", supposedly with a \\"volume 2\\" to be released sometime in the future.  Details on that album can be found in my review on \\"Best of Vol.1\\".  The band then waits 8 years before the decide to go ahead with the compilation project they originally intended, how does it hold up?<br /><br />Judge for yourself:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />36 of Van Halen's amazing catalogue can be found here on this two-disc compilation, a lot more than on the first compilation album.<br /><br />3 of those songs are newly recorded tracks with Sammy Hagar and they're pretty good.<br /><br />Also includes live versions of \\"Aint Talkin Bout Love\\", \\"Jump\\" and \\"Panama\\".<br /><br />16 classic Van Halen era songs<br /><br />14 classic Van Hagar songs (excluding the live songs and the new tracks, a total of 20 Hagar tracks)<br /><br />Professional music review in the liner notes.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The end of \\"Eruption\\" sounds weird if it is followed by any song not from their eponymous debut album!<br /><br />\\"Finish What Ya Started\\" has an abropt ending, as opposed to it's normal OU912 version that faded out!<br /><br />Unlike their first compilation, the history detailed is not \\"Balanced\\", David Lee Roth is almost treated like a secondary character in the account: \\"Exit Roth.

The sets and special effects are on par with big budget action films, and the marionettes do things you wouldn't expect they could do.<br /><br />As you might expect from the creators of South Park, there is some crude humor and foul language here, but despite that this is a surprisingly mainstream movie. I find it more entertaining than South Park, and it will probably appeal to a wider audience.<br /><br />I recommend it highly for those who enjoy action films or animation (although technically it's not an animated feature) and aren't easily offended. The only disappointment is the lack of a commentary track from filmmakers Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
0930289528|3.0|\\"V is for Vendetta\\" is a a dystopian tale of Britain under a fascist regime.  In true comic book fashion, a character named \\"V\\", who wears an unsettling, always grinning, theatrical mask is setting out to topple this totalitarian empire. The combination of a larger-than-life Shakesphere-quoting hero and an Orwellian near future (or more apparent present) makes for fun and somewhat grim reading.  It remains suspensful as you are brought into \\"V's\\" elaborate plan to topple the government and bring about anarchy and also as you try to figure out who it is under the mask.  <br />The art is dark, spare and flat and works well with the story. This book is no where near as good a read as \\"1984\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" but what it lacked in substance it made up for in style. It was, sticking with comic book form, a tale of good and evil, the twist being that the evil is a totalitarian state and the hero is a anarchist bomb-throwing radical. <br /> <br />I have one complaint, the print is really small and after a bit reading, I found it made it hard to concentrate.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Although she is still a big artist album wise, Madonna has only released 3 great albums in her career, i.e. True Blue, Like a Prayer & Ray of Light.  All the other ones have had great songs but lacked consistency (Like a Virgin did though come close being solid). <br /> <br />Having heard Hung Up and reading rave reviews of Confessions, I hoped, as a fan ever since she sang Holiday on TOTP eons of years ago, that finally another solid set was in the works.  Sadly, she disappoints again. <br /> <br />There are 4 great songs on this album; 3 have already been released as singles and I am sure the 4th one will be as well.  The songs are Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry and Forbidden Love.  A couple of decent songs are also included but the rest is, regrettably, filler material.  These (great) songs salvage the whole set, justifying some love and 3 stars, thus being in whole average but Madonna really should do better. <br />
0395645662|5.0|Imagine trying to function in a world without color, love, pain, or emotion. A world without life. Imagine living in Jonas's world; the world of the Giver. Jonas did live in a world like this and because of his secretive government he thought nothing of it until he turned twelve. When each child in the sommunity turned twelve they were given a career. Jonas was given the job everyine thought they wanted, the job of Receiver of Memory. But Jonas soon found at that receiving the society's lost memories is not all fun. With every memory of color, joy, and love came a memory of war, pain, grief, and sorrow. <br />     Readers with interest in any type book would love to follow Jonas through his enlightening yet agonizing journey of discovery. I recommend this book to people of all ages, young or old.
0465011047|5.0|This book is must reading for those who do not believe and those who believe all of these horror stories coming out of North Korea. The book is written in great detail about the harsh conditions present in this North Korean concentration camp.
B000FSME1A|4.0|I agree with everyone here how this is far from \\"Complete\\". However if you are as big a fan as I am, you will pick it up anyway. My advise is to get it from Circuit City. They are marketing certain copies with a bonus third disc. This has the trailers from both versions (which aren't included otherwise), the commentary of the destruction of the kurtz compound (from the original release) and extra scenes. Make sure it has a sticker mentioning the bonus disc. At my local store they only had about five copies with the third disc. The set is still far from \\"complete\\" but it is the best buy available.
B000002J1U|3.0|Led Zeppelin III is undisputably a rock and roll classic. It is not, however, the band's greatest album. Even at the sale price of US$13.99, this purchase really cut into our music budget for the summer. It is hard to imagine who would purchase an album of this calibre for the full price of US$18.98! <br /> <br />I am going to look harder for the next album we want in vinyl.
B00005JP7Y|5.0|I had the strongest urge to break out in dance in the theater.  I'm sure my husband would have just loved that.  The main characters have some serious chemistry.  The music and dance can appeal to you no matter what type of music you're into.
B00005JOQS|5.0|***WARNING-CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />Superman . . . What does it mean to be \\"Super\\"?  What characteristics does it require to meet that standard?  What actions does one have to take in order to be considered \\"Super\\"?  Is it based on an individual's physical prowess and strength?  Or is it measured by one's intellect, wisdom, knowledge and understanding?  Perhaps it is one's spirituality setting moral/ethical codes and boundaries that determine it?  How do we define such an idea as \\"Super\\" be it man or woman?  And I'm sure that most everyone has already given up on the idea that your nationality has anything to do with this.  So, what is it?<br /><br />I personally am an avid comic fan of years past.  I can recollect my childhood on through adolescence buried in one comic or another.  The pages that unfolded before me contained all the magic and idealism of right vs. wrong/heroes vs. villain splashed in all their Herculean, muscle-popping glory.  Back then these pages were filled with social and moral uprightness along with the consequences of living unjust and wicked (even if it always required the heroes to pummel the justice back into the unjust).  Movies and media followed suit with the 80's blasting \\"bad guys\\" away in the most extreme of extreme prejudices.  Rocky, Rambo, Indiana, the original Superman films, Star Wars all embodied these characteristics.  These stories told classic heroes tales, the heroes tales that are easily traced back to classic Greek mythology.  These were simple to understand: do good in spite of the circumstance and in the end you win (or at least the world wins by not being overthrown, enslaved, or just blown up) or do evil and you will be stopped one way or another.  Personally, I believe OUR WORLD today needs to return to these basic, simple principles.<br /><br />Now, finally the movie-Superman Returns does just this.  It demonstrates that in a world full of crisis, turmoil, distrust, hatred, death, war, violence, racial/ethnic/religious prejudice, pain, depression, over-sexualization, rampant drug-use, lack of self-responsibility, over-fascination for body modification, low morals, low self-esteem, low-education levels, and low expectations of ourselves and our futures that we absolutely need to look for a \\"Super\\"-anybody to help point us in the right direction.<br /><br />Brandon Routh's performance is dead-on to the late, legendary Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the \\"Super\\"-boy scout.  His presentation of sacrificing Superman's personal love of Lois Lane to her current love-interest is a clear act of selflessness.  By putting aside his own personal feelings and acknowledging that James Marsden's character, Richard White, is a good man through the slightest glance Superman gives him; thus handing over the care and upbringing of his greatest love along with his own son.  By today's standards he should fight for his love and ignore the emotional ramifications that this would pose on Lois in order to hide such an enormous burden as well as their son having that strained weight of discovering the father he believed he has in not really his father and not to mention that this would most certainly place those he loves most in constant danger from anyone who wishes to destroy Superman.  The film also demonstrates this same selflessness in Superman's decision to prevent Metropolis's destruction before going to rescue Lois Lane.  He must put aside his personal feelings for the cause of the greater good.  Unfortunately, most people today lack the courage to make such hard decisions instead opting to ignore problems hoping that eventually they'll just vanish.  Sadly, that never happens.  And once again the movie establishes what is \\"Super\\" by showing that in spite of the fact that Superman loses his super powers and is beaten, kicked, humiliated, and stabbed in the lower-back with a 6 inch piece of kryptonite that is broken off to be left inside his body he still fights to get up, never quittingto stand up for what is right.  The film then represents what is \\"Super\\" by demonstrating Superman's selflessness once again after being rescued having the piece of kryptonite removed out of his apparent kidney by Lois, Jason (their son) and Richard that he immediately chooses to go back to face Lex Luthor in order to save \\"billions\\" even with his impending death most likely ahead.  I will not mention any other spoilers from here, but instead go back to my original questions?<br /><br />So, where are the \\"Super's\\" of today that embody this?  I believe many are fighting hard for my 1st Amendment right as I type this over in Iraq and across the world.  There are also many who do their best to maintain order, defend civilians at the potential risk to themselves and bring peace to our communities.  These civil servants do so much and yet we as a free speech society, who live in an era that has knowledge at our fingertips and proclaimed equality out of our mouths, turn a blind eye when our neighbor is in need.  Or we just say to ourselves \\"Oh, too bad for them, hopefully someone will do something about it.\\"  Why do we always have to put \\"it\\" on someone else?  When will we return to having a standard of justice, moral rightness, friendliness and samaritanism that waves proudly and boldly for others to see?  I believe that when that happens that others will begin to join in and before you know the world will not need a Superman, because it already has a Supereveryone.what is right.

B0009WFF7M|5.0|There isn't much to add about how great this CD was and is, however if you are wondering if the CD side is HDCD encoded, then the answer is YES for the DVD Audio / CD. I don't know if the SACD version is also HDCD Encoded. <br /> <br />Hope this is useful for those with an HDCD CD player.
0380002930|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I've read it three times and it continues to grip me and keep me at the edge of my seat (so to speak).
B000FSME1A|2.0|This is my favourite movie of all time and I was really looking forward to the release of this box set. I was truly dissappointed that the two versions of the movie were split in half over two discs. This really spoils the enjoyment of watching the movies and I have never come across this on any other DVD. Also, the lack of the \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" documentary or ANY decent documentary about the film (s) in the package is a huge wasted opportunity. The deleted scenes should definitely have been cleaned up for the fans too. Most of the other extra features were largely uninteresting and criminally short or dated. I asume \\"The Ultimate Dossier\\" will be out at some future point but I'm baffled why this wasn't so much better.

0714834491|5.0|The Art of Looking Sideways is fascinating.  A Potpourri of different treasures, from written words to visual art.  After buying a copy used, I was so impressed that I bought seven more new copies, one for each of my adult kids.  I'm sorry I can't describe the book in more detail, but each page is a different detail.  If you want a wealth of ... well, just a wealth--I recommend this book.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|When I heard that Keira Knightly was going to be Eliza Bennet in P&P I was excited. I did not see it in the theater so I rented it, and was very disappointed. I was already a huge fan of the Firth/Ehle version and I think that the Keira Knightly version was too modern. When Eliza walked into Netherfield with her hair down made me cringe. Women in the 19th century, of her standidng, did not wear their hair like that in public. I also didn't like the fact that Miss Bingly wore dresses w/o sleevs. the ending was good, though highly romanticized. This was the only good thing about this movie. All in all it was OK, but if you want a version that followed the book very closely, go for BBC with Firth and Ehle.
B00000JBFW|5.0|This record reunited Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Gillan, and the finished product is by far the finest work by this band. Musically, Ritchie was hitting everything, by far his best since Rainbow. Ian was in top form, just after departing Black Sabbath after one album. The solos were tight, the vocals sounded like Ian back in the 70's. The rhythm section of Glover, Paice, and Lord was second to none. People will think Machine Head was their shining moment, but one listen to this and I guarantee you will shake your head with amazement.
B000EGDAI4|1.0|I've tried two copies of this new Rollins (RVG) remaster. The left channel flutters and fades in the same places throughout both discs (e.g., track four, 2:20 - 2:30). I've heard from third parties that this is a problem with the master tapes.  I find it makes the reissue distracting and unlistenable.
B000A0GXGA|3.0|I was a big fan of the series when it aired, but had a strong preference for Bret episodes over those of Bart and Beau.  Consequently, I was disappointed by this collection because of the heavy presence of Bart.  3 Stars because the selection of episodes does not reflect my recollections of the charm of this series.<br /><br />I was prepared for certain other disappointments - recollections are of the improvement/innovation, and not of the absolute quality itself.  Thus the innovations of a show such as Maverick can get swamped by decades of other shows building on and improving what made Maverick so special.<br /><br />The episode \\"Shady Deal...\\" stood up surprisingly well.  I had expected the subsequent \\"big con\\" movies (eg The Sting) and TV shows to make it seem trite and/or amateurish.  While there weren't the big surprise twists of successors, it was emotionally satisfying (Bad guy get his...).<br /><br />The episode \\"Gun shy\\" was cute enough but the comedy was badly muted because \\"Gunsmoke\\" had become an ancient memory for me (and I wasn't a fan of Gunsmoke).<br /><br />I found the episode \\"Pappy\\" disappointing and flat.<br /><br />Biggest of what is missing is the genesis of the heroic coward character that James Garner perfected in subsequent movies and TV series.<br /><br />My other strong recollection of Bret Maverick was the \\"small con\\" and the cool demeanor but frantic calculating and maneuvering to keep the bad guy from winning.  There is some of this in \\"Gun shy\\" and \\"Pappy\\", but my recollection is of episodes akin to highwire acts.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pulse is the best concert footage ever produced by Pink Floyd. <br />The unbelievable sound and sight production is unmatched by anyone in the business. Pink Floyd has always been legendary for their \\"spare no expense\\" concerts, and this production <br />will not disappoint. <br />The superb David Gilmour guitar solo on Comfortably Numb along with the visual effects is as good as it gets. The entire Dark Side of the Moon album is performed in the concert along with many other favorites. Well over two hours of Pink Floyd bliss! <br />As a Floyd lover for 30+ years, This gets top billing.
