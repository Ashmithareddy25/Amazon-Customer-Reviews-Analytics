B00ANGICRE|5.0|Since  I only use a wheelchair I understand and feel the same emotions. It is a moving film that speaks of another kind of heroes with other kind of goals in life. Really worth a while.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This guy emerges again as someone conneted to his life even at an age when others would pigeon hole him in as an oldies but goodies act. Fat chance.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|Rather diffecult to monuvier the screen.It is so so and not so good  not so good at this time for now
B008BM9L72|3.0|The first book - I felt not really a story but as I got into 2nd and 3rd - enjoyed better
B000I9U972|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I literally never stopped laughing. I still laugh when I watch it.  It is a classic.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I choose this rating because this man has a voice like no other.  His renditions and appreciation of the Memphis sound speaks to his talent as a musician and singer.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Being a long time David Bowie fan, I eagerly looked forward to his latest creation. David never fails to enchant. It is interesting to hear over the years his influences over styles and music choices. He is once again magical in his lyrics and the weaving of sounds is mesmerizing into instant addiction. I appreciate his maturity as well as his ever youthful energies. This is a Masterful man. He knows who he is and what he has done. He does not need to compete with what is considered 'alternative' or even contemporary today.<br />My favourite tracks are the highly decorated 'The Stars (Are Out Tonight)', the incredibly intrepid 'How Does The Grass Grow?' and the volcanic '(You Will) Set The World On Fire'. These are his identifiable signatures on the music world and on our culture.<br />I do recommend this CD for not only the solid Bowie fan but for the newcomer who wants to hear what a lifetime of singing sounds like.  Long Live The Legend..today..and The Next Day..and ALL the days after.
B004LWZW9M|2.0|I did not like the movie, it was truly a waste of time and money. Returning it. You might want to advertise better movies on you website.
B004CUVRF6|5.0|I liked the movie because it shows that right, in the long run, wins over might.  In spite of everything, the younger brother tried to save the older one.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book was just as engrossing as the previous three, in my opinion.  I liked the variety of locations and views into major characters.  I was shocked at the demise of one, but this is in the style consistent with other deaths you don't see coming.  No spoilers here.  I can't predict what's next.  I am ordering Book Five now.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great game to pass the time. My daughter loves to play this  never run out of adventures.  A+ + +
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone! I love it! I don't think I'll ever get tired of reading The Twilight Saga !
B009RH973I|4.0|I chose this case for it's ability to be almost completely sealed when you are transporting it - such as in your purse - the full coverage prevents it from getting wet (mostly) or getting scratched by the myriad of things I keep in my satchel! However, I chose the white and I am so sorry I did since it is getting absolutely filthy. It doesn't seem to wipe off very well either. Thinking about looking for a new case with the same features. Also, wish it was able to be propped up vertically for reading. Another thing, if it had a handle on it's side for when I am lying down reading a night, that would be great. Maybe I need to design my own case.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read at every minute i could get... even while blow-drying my hair.  That's how good this book was!<br /><br />The characters and their stories are very relate-able to real life.  The twist is a little expected, but the way Gillian Flynn did it... it came out perfect.<br /><br />MUST READ!
0143119680|4.0|Diana Bishop is not your typical witch. Born to a long line of witches, she decided to give up witchcraft at a young age, in an attempt to live a normal, magic-free life. But I guess normal is all relative, and witchcraft may be more impossible, and more dangerous, to give up than she ever thought.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was like historical fiction meets magic, thus combining two of my favorite genres. The history comes from Diana herself - she is a quirky, independent, strong-willed and totally lovable character (who seems way more like a high-schooler than a full grown historian), and she has given up the life of magic to lead a totally ordinary life in academia, where she studies, of all things, alchemy. I immediately connected to her.<br /><br />The book starts when Diana uncovers a book, Ashmole 782, that just so happens to be a book all the witches, demons, and vampires have been searching for for ages. How did she get her hands on it? Will she do it again? Suddenly, the library where she is working is FILLED with all sorts of magical creatures trying to figure out the answers to these questions. And of course, one of the creatures to show up is, naturally, a REALLY HOT vampire by the name of Matthew Clairmont. And, as must happen, because he is a vampire and a creature of lust, and despite Diana's natural and understandable fear of vampires, they fall immediately in love and, within 3 weeks, are wondering how they could ever be separated.<br /><br />I understand that vampires supposedly have that effect on people, but I'll admit it - I'm sort of tired of reading about it. Diana is witty and charming and, most of all, INTELLIGENT, and I just can't believe that she would allow herself to be enamored so quickly. By a vampire. I know, I said I loved it, and now I'm ranting - this bit really did bother me, and I wish Harkness had managed to make this book happen WITHOUT vampires and love-at-almost-first-sight, but I also understand that it was necessary to set things up for the rest of the book.<br />Which was AMAZING!<br /><br />Harkness uses lavish descriptions, painstaking and well-researched details, and witty conversation to move the plot along. And even though it was only her first novel, she masterfully weaved the world and idea of magic together with the world of academia and logic. It's beautiful, historical paranormal fiction, and I loved it. I'd read a lot of reviews that said some of the research and detail was overdone, but in the end, I totally disagree. I had a great time imagining all of the beautiful places, the intricate architecture she described. And I was presented with just enough information on the history of alchemy that I found myself wanting to actually research it myself.<br /><br />So, the verdict - this book was amazing; I loved the detail, I loved the information on alchemy, and the only things I would change are the love story and the vampires. And I will definitely be reading the sequel just as soon as I manage to catch up on all the other books I have to read.to set things up for the rest of the book.<br />Which was AMAZING!<br /><br />Harkness uses lavish descriptions, painstaking and well-researched details, and witty conversation to move the plot along.

B002RKSZS0|3.0|Northanger Abbey's Catherine just doesn't seem to have the same depth as Eleanor or Elizabeth. The villains are too caricatured to be genuinely interesting, and it doesn't seem as if anyone changes all that much, except Catherine. Even she doesn't grow up all that much. It seems as if Jane Austen was writing it as a tongue-in-cheek version of the typical fairie tale where boy meets girl, they fall for one another, run into some obstacles, and then, of course, end happily ever after. In that context, it works, but it wasn't much to my liking. If you are looking for an intro to Jane Austen, don't pick this, and if you are thinking you've missed something by skipping it, don't worry about it.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The novel is named the orphan's master, written by Adam Johnson. The focuses of the mishaps of a man called Jun Do, who is a man from North Korea and was raised within an orphanage. It is highly imperative to note that Jun Do is the son of the director of the orphanage. The father usually burned his own shoes and manages to burn them with his own shovel. In the novel, Jun Do had never gone to any of the car or a park. In addition to that, Jun Do had never even met his own mother. It is told by the author that his mother was a singer, who was of great beauty. But it is highly imperative to realize that his mother was shipped to Pyongyang, which was the capital. Jun do himself lived in Chongjin, within an industrial region. This was a time, when people used to eat grass and bark along the street. This is even highlighted in one of the quotations, \\"The loudspeakers called the famine an Arduous March, but that voice was piped in from Pyongyang. Jun Do had never heard anyone in Chongjin call it that. What was happening to them didn't need a name - it was everything, every fingernail you chewed and swallowed, every lift of an eyelid, every trip to the latrine where you tried to s***out wads of balled sawdust.\\"  The major theme is the realization of a military soldier, who had been well trained and equipped by the army of North Korea. However, this soldier manages to realize that he is after a man and he could feel the pain of the others. In one situation, he kills a Japanese girl, but realizes that the girl was innocent and could feel her parents' voices inside his head. Another major thing to realize is the soldier's guilt, which is extremely hard to find, but Jun Do is man, whose humanity is still alive and perfectly working. Later on in his own Jun Do is also shown to highlight a factor which would be highly significant, considering the poetry of the time. It was quoted in the book, \\"below raked obsidian bluffs was a steep, glassy black beach whose glint looked sharp enough to bleed your feet\\".  As time progresses and Jun DO continues to portray excellent results, he is promoted and given tougher missions. However, it is highly imperative to note that in the 2nd phase of the novel, Jun Do is shown to impersonate a military commander of Korea. The atrocities committed on the captured individuals are highlighted within the book and them unexplainable as well as too violent for the critics to explain. It may be facts but the scenery at the time has been devastating and exploiting. The structure of the novel has been somewhat disturbing as well as appealing to some of the audiences, but the novel basically highlights the experiences, expectations as well as the exploitations of the soldiers, who were captured within any of the wars. This especially include the region of North Korea, where numerous atrocities were highlighted and Jun Do, though realized what he did, was considered to be an important part of this torture. This novel basically portrays every torture and highlights the significance of the time period, which is of critical importance.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Remixes are known to be based off of something that has already existed but I wasn't expecting to have things taken away from this new edition to the series.<br /><br />Perhaps on other phones and tablets the imput for words works well but for my Galaxy S2 I found that you can't just simple enter the word and then press submit. It'll enter the word into the box but it will not actually enter it into the game. You have to use the enter button on your keyboard instead. It's not the biggest issue of all but it did take me a little bit to figure out why I couldn't get the game to make items. Hopefully this can be fixed in an update sometime in the future. They've already made their money on this game once before. Must we be sucked dry over a simple port?<br /><br />Secondly, finding out that I could only choose from three different avatars and had to pay for the rest instead of just unlocking them like in the original game was saddening. While I understand apps look to make money off of people buying extra items, this is a game that we've already had the pleasure of unlocking new content just by playing and using the in-game currency. To have to buy something we've already had elsewhere just makes it so much more unappealing.<br /><br />On a similar note I've have yet to find anything in-game where I can use the game's currency to buy things. The avatars must be bought, the shop is using real money, hints unlock after time, and... that's it? What's the point of solving puzzles in the fastest time and getting game money if there's nothing to spend it on?<br /><br />The game's graphics are updated nicely and not pixelated at all. HD if you will. I admit I've had some fun playing the god avatar, wielding some questionable items for various tasks, and posted the pictures with captions to Twitter. Who doesn't want to see god save a kitten by chainsawing the tree down?
B004UID2LC|3.0|My son uses my iPad and gets on YouTube ll the time. We downloaded this app when we got him a Nabi. So far it is kinda hard for him to get on to this YouTube app.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|The microphone have a great 5m of wire from device to the microphone... It is so cool to work with.<br />The recorded sound is so clear.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I like the music very much.  And the characters of Bilbo and Gandalf were all I could have wanted.  The dwarves were a bit unexpected, but ok.  Sometimes I felt the portrayal of them got in the way of the story and the character.  Can't wait for the next part.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very fun &amp; entertaining game. Definitely worth trying. It's a good way to pass time and it keeps you thinking.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run is a great story and very informative at the same time.  I've been recommending it to everyone.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is an action film right from the very beginning and everyone should enjoy it if you like action movies. The cast is great, story line is great.Vendor delivers dvd just as described and you will not be disappointed in the movie or the service of this vendor!!
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is the ultimate chick-flick. Its funny, tear jerking, and has amazing actors! Super cute and will always be a favorite of mine!
0060874775|5.0|Crichton does it again. I have this on an audio CD, and I never get tired of hearing it. I have both the abridged and unabridged editions (sometimes I need to get to the ending faster). Nanotechnology gone amok. This is an exciting subject and plot. If you're going on a trip, this is a must-have story. Crichton also provides an interesting prologue on the state of science and this technology. I love this book!
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It was ok. I liked it in some parts. I wish they told his story and not just psycho. But I what I liked most no cussing. Overall ok.
B003UYV08E|5.0|This is a great series , wonderful actors and story line, action all the way. This vendor however, took almost a month for me to get the movie so unfortunately will not be buying from them again, but the movie was as stated, .
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Most amazing movie ever!! Joseph and Zoey and two extremely talented actors and great friends. Their performance is pretty much priceless!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I always enjoy Michael Connelly.s books. This book was no exception. The retrial of a man who had been in prison for 24 years for a crime that today's DNA say.s was not his kept me turning pages until I had finished the book in a day.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|I love anything by Michael Bolton.  I could never be disappointed with any of his albums. He is great - YAY
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Once again my favorite vendor has come through for me, exactly what I wanted when I wanted it and always great service
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert, I have always been very aware of how much my life was affected by this. Mostly I have felt that it limited me and often caused me much pain and stress. As an educator in elementary school, I have seen little introverts overlooked so many times as the louder, more demanding children get so much more attention (negative or positive - it's still time takes time away from everyone else). I will definitely pass this book on to the administration of my school district - a district that prides itself on being fair and equal to all. This is stressed in religions, races, cultures, sexual preferences and disabilities. Somehow shy and introverted people don't usually enter the conversation. It's time introverts get their fair share of attention and get learning styles aimed at ways that will most benefit them. We have a very popular high school senior girl helping in our kindergarten class. Today she was telling me how terrified she was of public speaking. I told her of this book. She said her shyest brother (6 children) just gave a copy of this book to their mother. Thank you for saying what so many of us have been living with our whole lives.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The author has a lot to say about his many deployments in Iraq, but his writing style is fragmented, piecemeal and scattered. Rather than a narrative of his career he mentions moments in his life of war fighting in disjointed vignettes. Still an interesting read for those wanting to know more about life as a sniper and SEAL, this is not a literary work nor a biography, but rather the individual and isolated recollections of a valiant individual who has dedicated much of his life to serving his country.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Wife really love this &#34;CD&#34; copied onto her car's HD and she listened to it since the release date. she likes it.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|It was a very good movie, not at all boring or dull and arrives in the time  you are told it will be delivered. Funny movie, and goes along well with men in black one. Very funny
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Wonderful  casting,  locations,acting, cinematography, singing!  Great film! I'd never understood the plot before from seeing it on Broadway. A sad story.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|OK, first off, what this game ISN'T.<br /><br />1. It's not a ripoff from another game. The original developer (ClockStone) seems to have official licensed HeadUp to clone the game into this version, so stop panicking there<br />2.It's not a data miner. It has internet access to connect to Facebook. Dunno what other libraries are contained within but look at what the app can't do - it can't scan your SC Card, has no access to Contacts or accounts. Just what sort of data mining do you sheeple think it's doing, extraction by ozmosis? Good lord people. Stop panicking about what's not and enjoy what it is.<br /><br />So, what is the game?<br /><br />It's somewhat annoying yes, but a pleasant way to pass the time. It starts off easily enough and it's hard to mess up the first couple of bridges or so, but when you progress you begin to find designs that may not work as well for trucks as it does for cars.<br /><br />The controls slightly irritated me until I realized that you can zoom in and out which makes creating longer spans a bit easier to accomplish. However I'm still left a bit puzzled on how I'm meant to achieve certain goals since there is no obvious marker as to what one has to do to achieve some of the badges.<br /><br />All in all it's not a bad game, normally I'd give it a 3 but budged it up slightly to offset the sheeple (yeah, I know - so sue me)<br /><br />Personally I'm not sure yet if I feel it's worth money to play. Perhaps as the game goes on I may change my mind. As a AFAotD though I have no complaints.<br /><br />Verizon Galaxy S3
B00BESM14U|5.0|Brilliant. I was the John Hughes generation -- I turned 16 the week Sixteen Candles came out for Pete's sake. While Hughes is praised for speaking for teens, this film - while about teens, is SO much more. Frankly, I found The Breakfast Club to be cliche and kind of trite. Perks reminded me that when someone reaches out, I need to reach back. Everyone needs to have a group of friends like this at least once in their life. Everyone needs to be a friend like these all the time in their life.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I love this album it's original JT but, he has a whole new sound all at the same time, my favorite is Blue Ocean Floor it's AMAZING!
B0011MZOEI|5.0|He is not getting any younger but still keep up the action and thrills of the first movie.. hoping to see the next one soon :)
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about, but finally sat down with my 10- and 16-year olds last weekend and gave it a whirl.  My teenager was curious because there has been lots of buzz about the movie on Tumblr.  I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as my kids, but I really did!  Just really great graphics and a refreshing new take on a rather predictable story line.  Very entertaining movie.  (I was rather regretting having bought Les Miserables instead of this one--as good as that movie was.  I think Wreck-It Ralph would probably be watched more than once!)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Perhaps, my expectations were too great.  I found the movie to be too slow to start and the plot somewhat disjointed.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo Blitz is by far the most exciting bingo game I have found in my two years of being on facebook.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Because this novel is written from the perspective of the amnesiac, as readers we know as much as she does. Which leaves you as desperate for her to remember as she is!  As the story unfolds, she (and you) don't know what to believe or what is real.  You won't want to stop reading...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|All the time reading and imagining it could be your own child. Heart  rending. Poor mother having to kill her own son- that is pure desperation. Ver interesting novel, worth reading.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|The last of the saga had a great ending.  The fight scene was fantastic.  Too bad it has ended...or is it a setup for another saga?
B00486070K|5.0|Well, not really.  But, it does work well.  Apple should include this with their Airs, and it is overpriced.  Other than that it's swell!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Just wonderful!  Seeing this on blue ray is just spectacular.  I hope you enjoy it as much as my family and I do.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I have never before read an epic fantasy novel of anything resembling this size and felt &#34;cliffhangered&#34; at the end. Tremendous work. A tremendously sympathetic protagonist, A sprawling world and interesting magic system.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Brandon Sanderson, and find this to be one of my favorites.
B00B2166BS|4.0|This cable charges as it is supposed to do the magnets work well. I don't know if it chages any faster than USB. It is in the way, if you need to charge while using the tablet.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is to die for! Literally! In this game you grow by eating swimmers,fishermen,and sea creatures. You begin as a shark pup to become a 10 ton great white shark! I think this game is amazing.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|The music on this album is what stands out the most.  The musicians are extraordinary and the sound comes out Chrystal clear; the production by Buddy Cannon is amazing.  Willie's voice is superb, sounding no different then he did 20 years ago.  It's just an astounding rich and full sound
B008602KQI|1.0|I rented this on Prime Video last year when it became available here. I will admit that I have not read the book(s), but I fail to see how watching young people hunting down and killing each other gets such high marks. The whole thing is just sick to me. With all of the real-life violence going on today, including school shootings, etc., I fail to see how this kind of thing is entertaining in the least.<br /><br />With a continual stream of blood-soaked movies and TV programs produced today, it little wonder that I watch very little TV, and find few movies that are worth my time, with the exception of films such as Lincoln, The King's Speech, etc. As far as I am concerned, The Hunger Games was a waste of my time and money. And now I see that a sequel is coming out.<br /><br />Maybe I am not getting it, but to me, this is a terribly sad story and a very sad depiction of a future humanity!
B000FP2OPY|3.0|I love the series, but Season 1 Disc 3 didn't play right for me.  I think the disc in my set is flawed.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|A young girl, given up at birth by her Indian  mother, is adopted by an American couple. The story changes with each chapter, between the family who gave her up and their struggle to survive, ane the couple who adopted Asha. Her adopted father, also from India, understands Asha's longings. Her adopted mother, who is Caucasian, fears that she will be rejected if Asha finds her roots. After years of fantasizing about her birth family, Asha travels to India to search for them and her identity. There she discovered that a family is the people who love you.<br />The themes of identity, love, a woman's place in two different cultures are explored in this moving novel of discovery.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|love the interpersonal complexities between characters...worth getting addicted to! I enjoy the portrayal of a strong, bright professional woman who wants her husband to know what he has done to their marriage but also isn't ready to call it quits. Her sense of justice is fine tuned.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|CLASSIC SCREWBALL COMEDY.  YOU CAN'T BEAT HEPBURN AND GRANT.  THIS IS ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT COMEDIES AND DOESN'T RELY ON SEX, NUDITY, OR FOUL LANGUAGE TO BE FUNNY!
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. So simple yet so addictive! Once I start, I just can't seem to stop. All you Hexaholics out there know what I'm talkin' about. I will say that it's better to play on a tablet, the wider the FOV the better. Best mobile game I've played hands down, no mobile game has grabbed my attention and held it like Super Hexagon does. This game is WELL worth the $3.00.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I love all things Sherlock Holmes - stories, films, coffee table books... When I was in England I stood across the street from what would have been his rooms if there was really a 221B Baker Street. Even the Charing Cross tube station had little Holmes tiles on the walls.<br /><br />I am so intrigued with his powers of observation - do you realize that it's really Conan-Doyle's power!<br /><br />The stories are interesting and don't get bogged down with superfluous nonsense. I would recommend this set to anyone, regardless of age, who enjoys reading mystery stories.
B000I3UMLQ|4.0|This is without a doubt the worst of all the classic Star Trek movies.  However it's still much better than all that garbage JJ Abrams is coming out with, with his wooden actors who look like they'd be more in place on the cover of &#34;Teen Beat&#34; magazine, than on the bridge of a starship.  The cast is what makes Star Trek, and this movie still has the best.  :)
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Awesome series.  I am anxiously awaiting season 2 to be released on blue ray so I can purchase the series!
B000I186FW|3.0|V for Vendetta is a 2005 action thriller film directed by James McTeigue and written by The Wachowski Brothers, based on the 1982 comic book of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Set in London in a near-future dystopian society, Hugo Weaving portrays V — a bold, charismatic freedom fighter, attempting to ignite a revolution against the brutal fascist regime led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt) that has subjugated his country. Natalie Portman plays Evey, a working-class girl caught up in V's mission and Stephen Rea portrays the detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once I started watching, I was addicted to all the characters and their plights.  This show does an amazing job of weaving so many different story lines together in a compelling way, as well as giving us a taste of a time in history that doesn't always get focus.  I have enjoyed every minute of this show, and find myself watching episodes again to staunch the gap between seasons. I miss seeing the characters each week!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the most comfortable headset I have ever used. It sounds really great and can get very loud - I've actually set the headset on my desk and turned the volume to max at times and essentially used them as speakers. I've broken a lot of wired headsets by standing up too fast while wearing them, so a wireless headset was a must for me. I love that it can also be used while the battery is charging (my last wireless headset couldn't and it was such a pain to have to switch headsets whenever the battery died).<br /><br />At first I had a lot of issues with the receiver, sometimes it just wouldn't pick up the signal no matter what I did - the light would just blink endlessly. Around 8 months in it stopped working completely. I was pretty bummed out because (other than not working :P) I loved everything about this headset. I had heard some bad things about customer support, but contacted them by email anyway and was shocked that literally 2 days later I had a UPS return label (they paid the shipping) to send it back and they sent out my new headset as soon as they received notification that mine was en route to them. It's been 6 months with the new headset and I haven't had any problems. I can even go two rooms away before the signal starts cutting out, which I've never been able to do with any wireless headset before.

B000NY12LO|3.0|This book is ok. It was an insight to the mind of a kid bullied his whole life. But, as a teacher, some of the situations were a bit far fetched for me. It did, however, make me stop and think about the long term effects of a bully.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Stumbled upon this looking through Prime movies and fell in love with it. This movie is incredibly well written, shot, and acted (for the most part... still not a huge fan of Kristen Stewart). The story brought me to tears (especially the very end) and excited my inner desire to leave civilization. Excellent film.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I felt like I was walking through the movie but could listen while working. Could sing along with the actors.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is excellent well thought out and plays out consistently. It keeps my attention and leaves me wanting to watch more after every episode.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Just like Lord Of The Rings it has to many scenes that dont truly add to the story and are there to add more character and make it a 3 part series instead of 1 movie. I watched it in a plane and it was still a good movie. Still recommend it just have an open mind.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|it is more than I expected the music is fun with just enough heart felt  crooning thrown in love it
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Considerations<br />1. Quality of the movie<br />2. Building library of good movies<br />3. Ease of ordering from Amazon & trust
B004WO57E4|5.0|I ahve been a long standing fan of the HOMM franchise. I am stoked that it is available, and I have spend a ton of time playing. With Heros III being the one I am playing the most at the moment, I will comment that it crashes a lot due to me running WIN 7. I knew going in that the game is 20 years old, so it would probably have these issues.<br /><br />I love the games, and I intend to revisit 1 and 2 as some point, but 3 and 4 are my favs, not sure when that will happen. BUY THIS GAME!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote all the time now.  It is so easy to use and the convenience of synching notes to all my devices so seamlessly has made it invaluable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard so much about this story and wanted to see it so much. I am so happy that I did as it lived up to my expectations and more. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a series as much as I enjoyed this and it did remind me of some of the rules I was brought up with. Anyone who watches with an open mind of the time and culture will enjoy this series.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was informed about Lee Child by several neighbors who share my interest in good thriller novels. I have enjoyed reading Nelson DeMille, Fredrick Forsyth, and Robert Ludlum, and Lee Child ranks with them. One point a neighbor made was he didn't start at the beginning and regrets not having done so, so I decided to do just that. After reading the first two, &#34;Killing Floor&#34; and &#34;Die Trying,&#34; I couldn't wait to start &#34;Tripwire.&#34;
0385363125|3.0|Put it down, got kind of boring.  This is not the greatest book.<br /><br />I've had better flings than this, maybe I should write one.
1616550414|5.0|Almost all of your sick little puzzlers about the Zelda world will be answer by this book. Libro is Spanish for book.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|The story line was imaginative and compelling.  The execution of the screenplay was excellent.  All actors and the actress were enticing in their respective roles.  Most interesting was the background score, all electronically generated and far from the main stream movie score.
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|Uncle Acid's new album is every bit as good or better than the last one. This album is great. I recommend it.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Pilot pulls you right in. It reminds me of lost meets X- files. Solid show, well at least season 1 is thus far
B00633W614|4.0|Can't wait for the third --- Best Kept Secret<br /><br />Hard to put down. Interesting characters.<br />Plot filled with lots of twists and turns. Suspense!
B0037471TE|5.0|This is the first of the Bourne books.  This is my favorite Ludlum book.  I have 25 of them in my Kindle.  This is my second favorite book of all time.  For those of you who watched the movie it is not the same.  The only thing in the movie that is the same as the book is the initial part with Bourne getting shot and going into the water.  This book is an absolute thriller.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Denzel is the man.  He absolutely kills this role.  I would honestly watch any movie that hes in because hes so dynamic.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is a fun game. I think people should try it because it is free. It is a little hard. Anyway fun game.
0062082353|5.0|Although I had already read this book on my Kindle, I ordered the hard copy when I read about the author's horrible death last year. All those years as a sniper and he is killed by someone he was trying to help. The book is a very detailed account of Chris Kyle's life in Iraq. He really takes you through what it takes to become a Navy Seal, training to be a sniper, then to be so good at his job that insurgents had a bounty on his head.<br /><br />Coming home from the war, fitting back into family life, starting a training company, and most of all, his efforts to help those returning from war with PTSD,and a wide array of medical and psychological injuries. Read this book and learn about Chris Kyle.
B003GK212G|5.0|Number three of the Camel Club series.  It is great and I had trouble putting it down.  I have read it more than once and it is in my Kindle forever.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|TOO MUCH SEX AND NOT ENOUGH STORY . HE WAS TOO PARANOID ABOUT HER SAFTEY.<br />FOR SUCH A YOUNG GUY HE HARDLY HAD ANY FUN, EXCEPT FOR THE SEX THAT IS.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|From what everone who has read this series has told me, the movie did not dissappoint.  I took my son to see this when it first came out in the theaters.  He was 17 at the time, so the beautiful girls in the movie weren't lost on him, and he enjoyed the plot line as well.  I think the movie spoke to the value of friendship, love, and family.  Definitely recommend for pre-teens through adult.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|My dog trainer noticed that I had quite a collection of mystery books, including the entire &#34;Spenser&#34; series from Robert Parker. He asked if I had ever read any of the Lee Child series featuring Jack Reacher. He began to bring me some of the books and since I now have a Kindle, I decided to start over with the first &#34;Reacher&#34; novel. His style is more graphic than Robert Parker (who passed away in 2010). One of the things I really liked about Mr. Parkers' &#34;Spenser&#34; character was the banter between Spenser and his sidekick &#34;Hawk&#34;. Jack Reacher is much more a loner, a rambling man. This story was very interesting and easy to follow, even with the twists and turns. I could do without the graphic parts, but they are very well written. It was a fast read and I will continue my plan and download the next book. (And yes, this is the character they based a recent movie starring Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.)
B00000DWHH|5.0|One of my top ten CD's of all time.  My top ten cannot include a greatest hits.  It cannot be multiple artists.  This CD by the Who is well done and every song is great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|IT WAS BETTER THAN THE LAST IN THE TRILOGY.<br />WHAT I DID NOT LIKE WERE SOME OF THE MESSEGES WERE WRITTEN IN A LINE DOWN THE PAGE WHICH IS DIFFICUT TO READ ON THE KINDEL.
B0095P33IW|5.0|No worries about some naked body popping up for nothing in this one.  Great for older children (I'd say maybe 10+), has action and stuff blowing up, and I think I remember a bit of colorful language...but forgive me for being old-fashioned, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE when the character (Captain America) stays true to his time/upbringing/values!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a marvelous book!  Witty, intelligent, intriguing, and a page turner.  Sloan draws the reader in immediately and you stay there! It's all about Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore with its thousands of books on shelves reaching up, up, and up; and, a young man who goes to work there and starts to wonder about this strange little place with its handful of quirky patrons.  The mysterious journey takes him from the land of Google to an odd NYC destination.<br /><br />Have fun and enjoy!
B001MSMULG|5.0|One more book about Gabriel Allon.  The character is good and the stories are great.  There is new one each year and I have preordered the one in July.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I KEPT FORGETTING HOW YOUNG THEY BOTH WERE. I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SO RICH.<br />ONCE I KEPT THAT IN MIND THE BOOK MADE MORE SENSE TO ME.<br />ANA HAD A LOT TO CONTEND WITH FOR A GIRL SO YOUNG. BUT BECAUSE OF HER AGE SHE WAS MORE WILLING TO TRY NEW THINGS. AN OLDER  WOMAN WOULD HAVE PROBABLY RUN AND CALLED THE COPS.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I've listened to this album countless times now. It prompted me to go see them in concert last month, and is now one of my most liked bands.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this show even though it took me three seasons to finally watch it.  Can not wait for the new season
B003GDFQX4|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  I have read it at least five times.  It will be in my Kindle forever.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Love the comedy, love the passion, love the characters, love the fights, love the intrigue... I loved this movie! It was refreshing!<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=requisition+for+a+thief
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I loved the concept of this movie, I think it was very well made. Its a good movie for both kids and adults. It puts a new spin on old ideas.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games!!!!!! I loved it. This book was awesome!!! I definitely would recommend it. It should be called The Awesome Games!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|One of my top ten CD's of all time.  In my top ten it cannot be a greatest hits CD.  It can only be one singer or one group.  This CD has many of the hits of CCR.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Love Robert Downey Jr.! Love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle! Love what the writer's did with the story--made Sherlock a real man! Picked the right guy to do it, too!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I loved this movie. I wasn't sure about the concept at first, but being a fan of classic video games I had to watch it and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely a move that I can watch over and over. Great job Disney.
B005PK57NU|5.0|the characters in the show are complex. this would appeal to anyone who is interested in a show with varied points of view and a wide range of characters.
B003B02O0U|4.0|This is my 3rd favorite novel by Grisham.  Only The Firm & A Time To Kill are better.  This book is a page turner.  Another book I wanted to have stored in my Kindle.  For those of you who watched the movie the book is even better.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie, and the streaming was smooth.  I love the books and this movie is a great adaptation of the book.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I like this group. The album wasn't what I expected but, i was pleasantly surprised, especially at the price I got it. Cant go wrong.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|great movie...i recommend this movie to everyone i know...handles the time travel paradoxes well...unlike a lot of movies these days..everything comes full circle at the end..and most importantly..makes sense...
B004GXAZL6|5.0|It is number five of the Camel Club series.  I hope it is not the last one.  I could read about the members of the Camel Club until I die.  All five are in my kindle and I will read them again.
0062082353|5.0|Having been trained as an Army sniper at Ft Benning GA. I found this book to be right on the mark. Chris Kyle was a great soldier and a great person. He will always be remembered by his kind actions.
B008B3F38C|4.0|I like this album, sticking with your roots, and keeping to the style that your fans like, keep it up.
B003405MF6|4.0|i have all of Jeff's albume...i will always buy  Jeff beck albums...you're nuts if you don't like jeff (last words added to fill word requirement)....
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is the best music DVD of the Eagles.  All the great songs are included.  Joe Walsh is great.  The quality is great.  No complaints about this music DVD.  It is a great show.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|Was it a black comedy....action....horror? I don't know as it never really came together.<br />I was expecting a twist at the end that never came, like it was all a fictional in a movie being made, or a dream or something that could explain all the stupidity....but nope. Also I hate alien, moster,..etc movies that never show you the monster. During the whole movie, every time the monster or alien showed up it was so quick & dark that you could never get scared by it...that is if you were supposed to be scared. Many things happened that were never explained through the movie. It was like &#34;Stand by Me&#34; with a train crash instead of a dead body, but not nearly as entertaining. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B005IEGUDY|3.0|A huge readable  tome<br />But maybe a bit to long.Rutherford has put together a massive tale of English history told from Prehistoric times to the 20th century through several families.<br />Many themes abound from the contrast between America and England the role of religion the ability to reform government and society the role of women etc etc. You got to stay with it for around 1000  pages. The author keeps your interest but I think a little shorter would have been perfect. If you know Rutherford and have read his other works you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|another movie that i can hardly remember...don't think it was really bad..but not rememberable for sure...there may have been a good looking starlet...
B003B02O0A|5.0|My second favorite Grisham book behind The Firm.  The movie was great and the book is even better.  It will be in my Kindle forever.  It is another book I have read more than once.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just wanted to rate, but I like this app. I don't mind the advertisement. It's a free app. Yea. But I'm already a huge solitaire fan.
B004GHODRO|1.0|I only got the color kindle to be able to get some children's books as well. So far, they are not worth the money including this one.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|my review of this is actually in the part 2 review...it's ok..but i wasn't happy with it being a two parter..with part two taking forever to be relased....it's animation..so there wan't a real reason for that...oh as i said in part 2..the animation isn't that great..on par with the tv show....
B00001ODGR|5.0|I thought I was in paradise or heaven when I watched this music DVD.  It is Styx at its best.  It includes all of their great songs.  The music is great, the show is great and the quality is great.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|What a hook line. I kept hearing that line on ad's for TV shows, so I finally google'd it and it lead me to these guys. WOW, what a great album. Don't know what else to say. If you like Coldplay, then you will really LOVE these guys. Listen to the free sample, and then BUY this. Oh and don't forget their is a Deluxe Edition. I wish I would have know about it before I got this one, but still, you must buy this one. It's that good.......<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004J4XGN6|4.0|This book introduces some fresh new ideas to any kind of product development. These ideas will save managers and start-up owners a lot of time and money. Good introduction to this new concept of lean product development.<br /><br />Not 5 stars because: It is not a complete startup book covering many essential subjects like management. The author holds back a lot of information at some points, which is understandable as you can't expect to get full consultancy from a 15 dollar book.
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|ok..the animation isn't the world's greatest..the plot is from a graphic novel..but it's Batman man...lol...had to wait too long for the second edition though...
1475972350|5.0|If you like murder mystery you'll love this book. Lots of action, very suspenseful, extremely descriptive so much you can actually picture the scenes. Good flow and interesting twists and turns. Can't wait till the next one!
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|consider the bullying. consider the anger expressed through beating. consider the goal of having the best prize. No. This is not what need our future to be absorbing through media. Unfortunately my 5 year old child was exposed to this in a situation out of my control -  I am appalled that he was because &#34;Disney&#34; seemed save enough to show a child. NOT pleased.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am so glad I stumbled upon this book. It relieves some of the guilt arising from being a mom, wife and manager at the same time. More importantly it gives courage and heads up to all the women who really need to &#34;lean in&#34;. A great easy read with a lot of life improvement potential.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|first craig bond..great...2nd craig bond..huh?? this craig bond?? ooohh noooo...i had heard all of the great reviews of this movie and was anxious to see it...what a let down...maybe they will come up with a real villian next time..this time was laughable at best...please please hire some writers....
B009YG2ND8|5.0|best game I have. I have loved ff sense it first came out on nintendo.  now its on my fire. game play and graphics are amazing! now I wish they would bring out ff1 and 2.
0553801503|5.0|A Feast For Crows doesn't disappoint. Its not as action packed as A Storm of Swords but it gives you crucial plot points to the story. It also develops several characters background stories.<br /><br />The only reason people complain is because they don't appreciate a good plot.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It was a fascinating story about a crucial time in the history of our country.  To have apresident like Lincoln, who raised himself from obscurity thru his own efforts, to be elected to office just before the Civil War  --- he saved the country.  To have him killed just after Lee surrendered was a terrible blow to the South!  I also recently read O'Reilly's LAST DAYS OF LINCOLN, which was another amazing book.  He quoted Doris Kearns in it.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|another rewatching for me...loved this movie the first time..and it still holds up well all of these years later...too bad about edward furlong..he showed great promise here...arnold still had &#34;it&#34; physically...and the new terminator still is one of movies great villians...
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I'm usually not a lover of Westerns...But I loved Lonesome Dove...Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were at their best.  Diane Lane also had a great part, and she was wonderful . The hard life they had to endure was incredible.  I think the pet pigs stole the show...The love they had for each other was wonderful.  Anjelica Huston  and Glenn Headley had a small part, but as always,  they are both  fine actors.
B003EPPEP4|5.0|excellent arrangements as well as a great voice , makes this CD a great listening experience.  Nikki is just a kid but has the style of the jazz greats. CCan't wait to see her in person.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I have been a Bowie fan since the early 70's and really enjoy this new album. Great songwriting, well arranged and a pleasure to listen to new work from him after all these years.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|well you could certainly tell that the director and producers like the original movie...the new judge dred resembles the first almost to a t in some cases...definetly better than the first movie..but not by leap years...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is really interesting. I've been enjoying it a lot.<br />I'm not a Stephen King fan, but 11/22/63 has really seized my attention.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is much improved over the previous version.  I don't watch TV so this is one of the main places I go to get my daily dose of the weather.  I have it on both my tablet and my phone.
B004QNN1UI|4.0|With this CD you do not have to go to the real concert. It brings Simply Red at home in your own living room.
0307719774|5.0|thats a notebook who likes keep tracking days with short questions &#60;3 . . . . . . . .
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Very convenient and easy to use. Keeps kindle safe and also makes it easier to get back to last page read.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of the couch. i do not recommend warching it late at night, like I did! Lol.... But great movie!
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|The product can be characterized as a protective envelope.  The product can be carried in a backpack, carboard file folder, or a briefcase. The grip is a nice soft rubber, possibly made of polysiloxane polymer.  The color is a purple (blue, brown, and purple are my favorite colors).  The zipper has two pull tabs with a rubber coating.  Actually, I use the case for storing photographs, since I do not own any Kindle product.
B000FA675C|5.0|I really love this book but I fully expect some to disagree. I know if my religion were put through this kind of thing I would be offended. With that said I like art and symbols and secret societies. I like a plot that keeps me guessing as to what is going to happen and who the real bad guy is. I like mystery. This book has a lot of those things.
B009R659L8|3.0|I had a difficult time wading through the copious number of characters, none of whom were particularly endearing, and this book moved along so slowly that it was excruciatingly boring in places.---just too long.  MHC is a great writer but this was certainly not up to her usual standards.  Just not great!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|What can I say? I'm a sucker for these movies. I do not know a lot of Thor's back story, so this movie acquainted me with him.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book was very useful and I used it to publish my first book on Kindle Solutions How to Port Forward. I chose the rating because it provided all of the information that was required to publish my book. It was not long and drawn out but precise and to the point. I would definitely recommend this book as a guide for anyone wanting to publish on through Kindle.
B001LM1456|3.0|This is not the best of the super hero genre of movies. I'm a little bit disappointed because it doesn't tell of how The Hulk became The Hulk along with the whole underlying story. It does tie in with The Avengers at the end but most of the movie doesn't really have the same feel about it as the rest of The Avengers movies does. All in all it was worth the watch but it didn't really leave me with that big &#34;WOW&#34; sort of feeling.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I ordered this mouse because of the price and positive reviews here on amazon.  It is a great mouse and just as good as mice that are twice the cost.<br /><br />Pros:  braided cover on the wire of the mouse, adjustable DPI, several buttons, customizable weights, Good software<br /><br />Cons:  You can change the color of the light on the logo at the back of the mouse but the wheel and DPI indicators stay blue.  Other than that I love this mouse.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I was surprised by this movie. I was drawn in to the plot, and enjoyed the ability to stream it with Prime for free.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|The concept of this book is a good one. The author seems talented.  But there was just something about this book I couldn't get into.  Maybe because I was listening to the audio book version.  The author's imagery is beautiful, but sometimes it just seemed to much.  I did like that she starts with a main character and really established the character under the government thinking and then to show how the character's thinking changes.  But overall I found it just too slow and to forced.
B00B2G4O2G|2.0|Just totally unbelievable.  Cult members coming out of woodwork.  Cops surrounding subject on secret operation and people walking up with pistols and shooting them.  Cult members shocking police time and time again by being violent.  I love Bacon but nothing could help this show.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book was a little hard to read at first, but after I got past that I couldn't put it down.
B002G1ZHNQ|5.0|This is the best book I have bought that helps you learn the guitar fretboard.  My advice is to also purchase the ebook version of this workbook.  After filling in all of the lessons in the workbook, you may want to repeat some of the lessons.  This is hard to do when your workbook is already filled in.  With the ebook, you can print copies of blank worksheets to use over and over again.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love making but don't usually have time for full game. This is awesome. Great idea developer keep up the grand work.
B009R659L8|3.0|Mary Higgins Clark has become known as the \\"Queen of Suspense\\" in the years since her first novel, Where Are the Children (1975) and for good reason.  Her suspense/mystery books are reminiscent of Agatha Christie with plot twists and turns, multiple red herrings, and a dramatic conclusion that the reader comes to understand only in the last pages of the book.  Her novels for the last decade or so have focused on the uncanny sleuthing skills of Alvirah Meehan and her husband Willy and did not have the same edge as her earlier works.  Daddy's Gone A Hunting, however, is more of a return to her earlier style and was a quick, easy and suspenseful read with just the right mix of suspense, loveable and hate-able characters, plot twists and humor.  My only complaint, if in fact I have one, is that there are so many characters that it becomes difficult to remember who's who.  Since I read the Kindle version, I must say the x-ray feature would have been of great benefit in this case, but unfortunately was not available for this book.<br /><br />The story begins with a deadly explosion in the furniture warehouse of the Connelly family of New York, known for their high quality reproductions of fine antique furniture.  Injured in the explosion is daughter Kate Connelly and dead is Gus Schmidt, a long-time employee who was bitter over having been fired five years earlier.  Kate had called Gus, asking him to meet her at the warehouse in the wee hours of the morning, and now Kate is in a coma and Gus is dead; suspicion naturally falls on these two who cannot tell what actually happened.  This is also the story of lawyer Mark Sloan from Chicago, his mother, and his sister Tracey who disappeared 28 years prior when she went to New York to pursue her dream of an acting career.  And it is the story of a man named Clyde, a hero, a decorated Vietnam Vet who came home emotionally damaged after the war and left his family for a life on the streets.  Their lives all convene in this tale ofgreed and subterfuge with just a little romance folded into the mix.<br /><br />The book is fun, fairly non-violent for a mystery and appropriate for any age group from teens to seniors.  While I have also enjoyed Ms. Clark's aforementioned series with Alvirah and Willy, this was a welcome switch back to her earlier style which led me to be a fan of her writing decades ago. Don't be put off by my 3-star rating ... those who follow my reviews know that I only give 4 or 5 star ratings to books I believe have significant social value, are destined to become classics, or are among the best books I've ever read.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Perfect for any devout Star Wars fan!!  Kind of strange that they added in Young Anakin, and left out Qui Gon Jin in the spirit scene.  Good movies nonetheless.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I like the concept but a bit cheesy at times and the acting is not very convincing and its predictable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun game that really perks up those boring moments throughout the day.<br /><br />Really makes long bus roses waits our a little down time before bed more bearable
B000A6EXNO|1.0|Couldn't screw it on my d700. Felt like it was stripping my nikon. It would never get tight enough, then just fall off easy
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|There are some glitches.  You can tap on a object and it won 't work but after tapping around or leave the area and come back tapping the same spot works.  The game needs a guide of some kind.  I just can't figure some of the game out.  Really nice graphics and the game in general is fun.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love this game! Great upgrade from the original app! Love it even more since it was free! Can't wait for #3!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Up to date is very easy<br /> To use. Any one can operate this system. Information is clear and laid out just right for me.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie is great for adults and children alike. The humor is clean and funny. I have watched this movie twice in the last few weeks and wouldn't mind watching it again. I also find my self quoting it quite often.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not disappointed at all....another great season of Downton Abbey!  Ready for Season Four to start up because i feel like i am missing out on something!
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|Love it and shaun of the dead, very funny movies. Paul is also hilarious. I strongly recommend any of these for a good laugh.
B00138EYG4|5.0|One of the best metal albums Ive ever listen to. A must for Classic Metal fans. 10/10 would buy again 8)
B0054W4JQK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I felt the character's frustration and was kept engrossed right until the very end.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Julianna Marguiles is powerful as the Good Wife! Archie Panjabi is amazing....so calm, cool, brilliant! I had heard from friends that this was a great show, but not being much of a TV watcher, I had put it off for years....so glad to have found it on Amazon Prime!!! I watched the whole first season in less than three evenings---needless to say I've been dragging my butt at work for the last couple of days!!! Well worth it!!
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|Clunky control interface, and crashes 1st gen Kindle Fire. Would not recommend. Good concept though. Oh well, maybe next time.
B009X01D9U|5.0|The thing that caught my eye when ordered this was that fact that when my Kindle is in it, it can be turned either way to watch...vertical or horizontal without a problem! I love that the Kindle can stand in the case too! It is very easy to put the Kindle in, yet the Kindle is very protected. The case is hard and has a strap to protect it even more! I love the color options as well. I ordered the orange one!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have never been into zombie shows, and decided to watch the first episode after being persuaded by my husband. I was hooked after the first 5 minutes!
B008476HBM|5.0|It is very intresting book about live and morals in England 2 hundred years ago. You will have close look into relationships between men and women in the 18-th century.
1423140605|3.0|Rick R is just coasting now. This book reminds me of HP#5 where it was lots of discription but the story didn't go anywhere. The last few pages hold all the info...but to make a whole book of filler????? Hope the next one isn't the same
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I avoided this movie because I'm not a fan of Spielberg, but finally succumbed to it because of my boyfriend and Daniel day Lewis. I would like those 2 1/2 hours of my life back now. Daniel day Lewis didn't disappear into lincoln, he was just caked under 20 lbs of makeup and wearing stupid stilts.
B009IJJB8G|3.0|If you want to get an updated sherlock holmes, see Sherlock, the BBC miniseries. Way better acting from all the characters,  ( though Lucy is just fine here), better scripts- the actors actually have something to work with, just better period. Next to Sherlock, Elementary is pale and limp.  In elementary's defense, it is hampered by the less than an hour format, after commercials are taken out.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Many times, when we have tried to watch our movie from the Amazon library, it will not play properly.  I wish I would have bought the disc instead.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Recently discovered TRAIN. Good mix of songs. VERY enjoyable music. Can listen to it over and over and over and over.
B00BESKTMG|2.0|I expected this to be an entertaining &#34;spoof&#34; of HK action movies.  The fight choreography was excellent, about the only redeeming feature - Corey Yuen delivered.  The acting was horrible, maybe with the exception of Russell Crowe.  Surprised he and or Lucy Liu agreed to be in this farce. The story line was....well not terribly credible. Quite disappointing.  Don't waste your time or $ on this one.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|One of my favorite artists and tv personality, this album is great.  I prefer country to county pop and Blake stays true to his Oklahoma roots. Being a native of SW Missouri, a transplant to Alabama, I really appreciate his connection.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I give this 5 star because every episode is well written. Courtroom  scenes are excellent and plots differ from week to week.  The cast has good chemistry. You will look forward to each new episode.  Many episodes are non predictable.  I recommend this series for drama lovers.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I have Wikipedia on my iphone, and wanted the same convenience on my Kindle. It is a great app to have.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I really enjoy this series and watched it with both my daughter and grandaughter.<br />We don't have cable or satelite at home so can't wait for the third season to come out on DVD so can see what it going to happen next.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Best film of the year if you're a sci-fi fan. The action, the blood and even the romance got me on the edge of my seat.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is incredible addicting! I cant put it down, its great for filling your time waiting till you forget what you were waiting to do!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This is a great movie, and I and my children and grandchildren really enjoyed it. I am a fan of Tolkien's &#34;Lord of the Rings,&#34; and it was a joy to see &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.&#34; The story is solid, the actors are excellent, and the scenery is awesome! Now I'm waiting anxiously for Part 2, which I understand is called &#34;The Desolation of Smaug&#34; and Part 3 which is called &#34;There and Back Again.&#34;
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I own both Season One and Season Two and can't wait for Season Three.  I really enjoy this series and my daughter, grandaughter and I all watch together.  Makes for good family time while we try to figure out what is going to happen next.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book was just amazing definitely recommended along with kill shot. He truly has crafted another masterpiece that will surely wow the audience
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this case! It's fun as well as functional. I like being able to adjust the position too. The only downside is it is a little heavy, so your arm does get tired of holding it up. But you can always just pop the Kindle out of the case to solve that issue
B0037471TE|5.0|intrigue and suspense, with more detail than movie. A believable yarn. Has romance but not enough to be boring.You will want to read the three books.
B000W21ER4|5.0|There isn't a bad track on the &#34;blue&#34; album and if you are any kind fan this is a must own.  It features the track &#34;Buddy Holly&#34; which is a catchy track that was released as sample media for Windows 95.  This track caught on and allowed the band to gain mainstream recognition.  While it isn't the best track on the album it has catchy beats and a great hook.<br /><br />Feel free to load the album into a playlist and set it on random/repeat.  No further intervention required.
1476719071|5.0|My first thoughts on finishing this book:  Wow. This book. I can't words...djanga;dvjnkajsdngkasjng    But I figured not a lot of people would appreciate that review, so I decided to give it a day or two before I tried to review it. I'm not promising it'll be any more coherent than that, but I'm gonna try. Just so you know my frame of mind when going into this book, I saw the cover and was intrigued, the synopsis sounded right up my alley, so I did what I always do, looked it up on goodreads. And wow! People feel really strongly about this book! So I read a few of the negative reviews and they scared me off. But every time I saw it I wanted to give it a shot again. And the rating is so high despite all the biting bad reviews. Finally I read like a page of the kindle sample and I was turned off by all the cussing. I generally don't read books with that much bad language, it irritates me. And then Walking Disaster came out. And basically I was just too intrigued to stay away any longer. I saw them sitting next to each other on the shelf the other day and bought them both right then. It was the blue butterfly that did me in. It's so pretty! I've had a blue butterfly tattoo since I was 16, I just couldn't resist. ;-)    I was very nervous opening Beautiful Disaster. I was afraid I was going to be totally offended and disgusted and have to find someone to give the books away to in a hurry because I couldn't stand for them to be in my house one more minute. As you can probably deduce from my rating, that did not happen. After maybe 2 pages I was totally engrossed. Say what you want about the storyline, maybe it's not your thing, I get that, but Jamie McGuire can write. Her characters explode off the pages in living color. Hours went by without me being even slightly aware of the time passing. I haven't been this absorbed by a book in a very long time. I love all the characters. Not because they're all perfect or good or kind or even smart, but because they all seem real.And yeah, they're all flawed, the whole book is pretty much based on that. No one ever denies it. But I really ended up caring for them, even if I sometimes wanted to smack them. :P    Books are so subjective, they sink or swim basically based on each readers own personal experience which bleeds into and colors the narrative. I thought about knocking a star or two off this rating. My five star ratings are usually for books that are not only well written good stories, but that teach me or move me in such a way that I want everyone and their grandmother to experience them. This one's different. Although I would love to share this book with everyone I know, and it did move me, I can see why it would only appeal to a certain audience. I do not usually read books with this much bad language, as I said, nor with this much sexual content. The reason this book is still getting a five star rating with all of that is because even though I don't like it, I can't argue with it. I fought the book and the book won. Because both of the elements I just mentioned may not be what I like to read about, but they're absolutely realistic in the context of this story. (And in the context of my own reality when I was 19.) They're not gratuitous, not added for dramatic effect or shock value and they're not given any special emphasis or lingered over, they're a natural part of the story. And having them absent would seem kind of off. Besides those two things, the only other element that got on my nerves was that Travis was obviously absent from kindergarten the day they taught \\"no hitting.\\" Even that only bothered me about three quarters of the way through when I wanted to pull him aside give him a hug and be like \\"It's gonna be okay, but dude you gotta stop hitting people.\\" But then things turned around and he did, so it was only a minor issue. I felt for him I really did. He was dealing with SO much stress and he was trying SO hard. I really didn't think he got enough credit for basicallyturning his entire life around in a very short amount of time. Whether your lifestyle is good/healthy or not, any major change like that would be difficult. Things would also have been easier on everyone if friends could stay out of each other's business, people didn't care what others thought so much, and they wouldn't try to deal with emotionally charged situations when they'd been drinking/wouldn't drink so much. But I've been there, because that's college life, because college kids don't know that/don't care.    I did not have some of the problems that other reviewers seemed to have with Travis. Although he had a temper, I never felt like he was a real threat to anyone, least of all Abby. He adored Abby. From the reviews I read it sounded like he was going to be a raging abusive maniac who locked her away in his room and her falling in love with him was just due to stockholm syndrome. I thought his temper, though maybe a little over the top, was fitting with the rest of his character. He had closed himself off to feeling anything besides anger and superficial pleasure for basically his entire life. But he's a passionate dude. And now all of a sudden his entire world is opening up, in reality and emotionally. And he doesn't know how to handle it. He even says he doesn't know how to handle it. And I'm sorry but I was cheering for him when he hit Chris Jenks. Dude needed to have some sense knocked into him. So I guess I don't see what people are upset about. You've never gotten mad and broken something? No guys ever got in fights or punched lockers/walls at your schools? It's not like his actions were ever condoned or that he didn't change his ways.    I didn't find Abby boring or wishy-washy at all, either. I totally related to her. Her heart had made the decision about Travis before she was ready to deal with everything. And she was afraid of how strong her feelings were and the future and him turing out just like her father. That makes perfect sense to me. Her actions were frustrating at times, but again, not unrealistic.    Beautiful Disaster resonated with me and took me totally off guard. There were a lot of details and scenes that paralleled things that I have seen or experienced in my own life. (Not the hitting parts-just to be clear! :P) Between that and the way the story was able to make me care so much, move me from laughter to tears, and everything in between, and the vivid characters that I will not soon forget, this book earned my five stars.

B00ANW33CM|2.0|don't particularly like it.  I got it just to have something different, but  I am not crazy about it.. just adds to my &#34;library&#34; of mahjong games.
B002VECM72|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies..Just wanted to have it on hand to watch at any time.  Great purchase!
B000W94FIW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.. reading it all over again. You should definitely get this book!

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I am such a Jack Reacher fan so once I pick up the book I always have to finish it . The only problem I have with this book is not being able to go to bed at night.  I Love the whole series.

B00BSBXA98|5.0|I'm a big big fan of Cirque shows having seen most of them. This was excellent even if it was a sort of compilation of various shows on the circuit. Well worth watching.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I love the this case as it is perfect for taking phone in shower (no real need, but).  Also, great for when phone is in back pocket and you use the toilet, God forbid it falls in (it's happened to many including me).  Downfall is that the touch screen is not as receptive and more pressure is needed from fingers.  All in all, I am happy with it!  Now debating on getting one for my iPad, so my 3 yr old doesn't break that!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|If you liked the play you will like the movie. It's also a musical but a lot more detailed than the play. Same great music, but not sung as well as the original play.
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|This is a nice mix of music - all varieties, and all suitable not just for a zombie movie, but for washing dishes, jogging, etc.  The Jamie Cummins track, &#34;Lead Me Home,&#34;  is excellent!
B00AW28HF6|5.0|Authors who write credible, interesting and insightful books on counter-espionage and terrorism are a rare find. This 'Black Ops' tale has a spontaneity and sense of realism that makes for a very interesting read. The world of spies and covert operators operations is a dark and often sinister one, where friendships are defined in terms of human assets and liabilities, and fixed relationships are elusive. Characters are not empathic or romanticized, just plain dangerous people in a very dangerous world. M.J. Gallagher captures this feeling with admirable deftness. You find yourself asking: \\"Did this really happen?\\" and \\"Who is this guy?\\". The answer to the latter is a talented, insightful author who knows his stuff and did his homework. I would not be a bit surprised if Gallagher becomes one of those authors whose name is synonymous with taught espionage stories and hard hitting plots. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good international spy story with plenty of intrigue and action. I'm looking forward to the next two books in the series.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning to the end. Loved it! Even re-read it several times.  I really felt the characters. Definitely recommend it.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|If you saw the lord of the ring series and liked it than this is for you. Great effects, good acting and well directed. Plenty of special effects.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was full of color and vivid images.  It stayed true to the book and the actors fit the characters.  Loved it.  Highly recommend to read the book first!
B00821OX98|5.0|It's like The Walking Dead but instead of zombies it's alien.  Oh and it may actually be BETTER than The Walking Dead.
1451695195|5.0|There has been so much speculation over the years about heaven, and the light at the end of the tunnel, that this gives the reader additional ideas to consider.,

B009DJB8I2|5.0|Everyone knows Portal! If you haven't heard or play the game, where were you the last decade?! For 15 bucks, this is an amazing deal! Plus you know, as well as everyone else, why you are here:<br /><br />THE AP-SAP!!!<br /><br />Yes, this 4-disc collection DOES come with a code for a GENUINE AP-SAP! This also comes with a Mann Co. Purchase Bag for a random item, which wasn't mention at all, so there's a bonus!<br /><br />It also comes with a Dota 2 invite key. (which I haven't used yet because I got 5 copies like everyone else lol)
B004LWZWGA|5.0|He was so excited that I got him this for Christmas, he couldn't wait to watch it. It arrived in plenty of time for me to wrap and put under our tree for our first Christmas.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I liked the story. The story line was most unusual. I thought I would not like the movie but the more I watched, the more I was drawn in.  I would recommend this movie.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Gave many hours of entertainment and kept me guessing the whole time.  I'm looking forward to the next series.  Let me know when I can buy Season 2
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I don't know. The show seems like it's in a holding pattern, despite some interesting developments - or should I say, developments that should be interesting but aren't. The conflict between the survivors and the crazy Governor and his enclave is handled dramatically in an episode-by-episode way but ultimately, this pot just simmers but never quite boils.<br />I don't want to spoil anything but it seems like characters do dumb, inexplicable things that ensure that the story either goes backwards or stays in neutral like a soap-opera ('join us next week...').<br />Also, a character from very, very early on appears again and - despite a somewhat dramatic episode - is undramatically forgotten and the story moves on. It seemed like it should've been handled better, since in some way this character framed the earliest stories.<br />The zombie, head-splatter scenes seem obligatory now, too. At least one or two per episode.<br />I may just wait the year+ for subsequent episodes to eventually land in Netflix instant rather than pay to watch them on-demand.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|You need power ups to experience anything more than 60 seconds of game play, and the amount of coins needed to power up makes it so you either have to play that 60 seconds hundreds of times, or buy coins. Not truly a free game as advertised.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|i really like the show. i do struggle with some of the graphic scenes. not for children in any way

B007BVOEPI|5.0|i really like the show. i do struggle with some of the graphic scenes. not for children in any way. i feel like they have to throw in a nude scene every show, even if if has nothing to do with the actual story. as much as some ike that, i do not
1451696191|5.0|The book is just amazing I couldn't stop reading it. Its really wonderful story that enter your heart and the way the book is written make you see the personality of charlie and how he think and how he see the word, I just love this book,<br /><br />and finely I received the book in perfect condition and nothing wrong with it and I totally love the cover of the book with Emma Watson :D
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Liked the movie. Harrison Ford is perfect as are the others in the cast.  I enjoyed the movie, hope you will too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I pick this up whever I feel like playing something mindless and it is fun too.  Love getting all the prizes and as you go you get more and more coins to play with.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I first read Life of Pi in middle school and loved the whimsy and above all the courage of Pi's story. After watching the movie recently, I decided to reread the book and was again taken aback by the beautiful prose, imagery and strength of the book. This is a great read anyone.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|More fantastical and contrived than preceding films.  The writing seemed stretched.....as if the screenplay writers were at a loss as to how to top the preceding films &#34;wow' factor and thus embarked on a screenplay that went from the normal Bond implausibilities to the absurd.<br /><br />As the movie drug on I wondered if I could get through it.  Incoherence of storyline was not made up for by special effects...since we have come to expect that from the Bond franchise.<br /><br />What's needed is some clever writing and plot twists.  Unfortunately this latest installment offered little of the clever and too much of the contrived.<br /><br />Rather than refresh...it was tiresome.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|It's okay but if you paid for it, you will regret it later. You cannot do things as the dev says it will and trying to convert it to normal text is a no.
0805092919|5.0|We have to read this book almost everyday. My 3 year old twins know it by heart now and read it to me.
B007REV4YI|5.0|More fun from everyone's favorite Spy.  It really doesn't matter who plays the lead, it's the action that counts.  This has a good lead and fulfills all my action expectations.  The end ............... well, I won't say anything about that, but it will have your attention and emotions!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly seemlessly picked up my Google Reader feeds. We'll see if it does the same once Google Reader is gone.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I thought this was going to be one of his better movies but was fooled. I hope one day he can play serious characters again that are not drunk for a changed.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|The first several levels are easy, but pretty soon they get challenging.  Great for puzzle lovers like me who use them to 'jump start' the brain in the morning.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great easy read.  Found it to be a great distraction after a day of work.  New, imaginative, and fun! The storytelling is also fantastic.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a little hard to read being written by a foreign author but I caught on to the dialogue and enjoyed the book.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages. My son who's only three loves this movie. And my husband and I also love it. It's like a romantic comedy robot movie.
B009GX6TMA|3.0|At first I loved this show but then it just kind of fell off for me. The jokes became sort of lame and repetitive. The progression of Jess and Nick's relationship is boring and poorly done in my opinion.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|Spoiler alert! Rock and Roll isn't saved, but it really didn't need to be. Sarcastic tongue-in-cheek title aside the album is devoid of much actual rock. Let's just rip that Band-Aid off right here and now before we get on with the review.<br /><br />Fall Out Boy have shown strange evolution over the years. From their first release to their most recent album (which felt like a grand farewell to the band as a whole) they have gone through phases of hip-hop leanings, almost metal-like sounds, and the ever-present pop mentality that made them famous. The band's mainstream success with `Songs From Under the Cork Tree' led to a struggle to find balance in the following album, but they found their center at last in `Folie a Deux'.<br /><br />When the first single, `My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark', was released not long ago it took some getting used to but suddenly there was a raging, viciously dark pop band on the scene who wasn't doing what the album title promised but were definitely showing an ability to bring change. The second single, `The Phoenix', led me to be so excited for this new style and energy the band was using that I finally got fully on board with the album. Then it came out.<br /><br />1. The Phoenix - 9/10: From the thundering and symphonic instrumentals to Stump's soaring voice, this is not as much of a band song as it is an example of what Patrick Stump's solo album should have been. But that doesn't stop it from being a fast, wild introduction to this new Fall Out Boy. \\"I'm gonna change you like a remix, then I'll raise you like the phoenix\\" is one of the dumbest lines I've heard from a band in a long while, but it doesn't stop other clever lines from rising or the song from being fun.<br /><br />2. My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark - 8.5/10: Continuing the dark pop energy from the first track we get an angry little song that shows off more of a band feel than the opening track. The most impressive part was something I didn't even latchonto until watching them live on Kimmel. The line \\"I'm on fire\\" is wailed and seems like an electronic distortion, but upon seeing them perform I learned that they have actually been able to tighten their group vocals as a band. It was quite impressive, but the best part continues to be Stump's singing. This becomes a pattern throughout the album.<br /><br />3. Alone Together - 6/10: `Jarring' would be the best way to describe this song. After the rough energy contained in the first two tracks this one bounces to the other end of the spectrum and derails the flow of the album almost entirely. This is nothing that I couldn't get from any other band on any pop station in the mainstream listening stations. It's disappointing and relies heavily on the vocals once more to latch onto anything impressive.<br /><br />4. Where Did the Party Go - 5/10: Another ambush of pure drivel, this one is even more baseline than the last. No effort was put into this one and it feels less impressive because it doesn't have the vocals to carry it as high, but it has more of a band feel than the first three tracks so that's something. Still, a disappointment to hear as it seems nothing can save this album from not being able to follow its first two tracks and what they brought to the table.<br /><br />5. Just One Yesterday - 8/10: A surprise! At last! As songs go it still isn't impressive, but it's entertaining in a way that the others weren't. It feels like a slower, less impressive track that you might have gotten on the middle album from `The Academy Is...'. Enjoy it; this is one of the better ones.<br /><br />6. The Mighty Fall - 7.5/10: Still not a great song, but with more going for it and energy that some of the `poppier' tracks haven't had up until this point. I would count it among one of the more fun tracks, despite the tacked on appearance of Big Sean. The rapped lines aren't necessarily a bad idea in rock anymore (indeed it's just something to expect now and then these days, accept it) but they aren't executed well. They feel out of place on the album as a whole, not necessarily the song despite the fact that the track was decent enough to stand on its own. It now seems that the track wasn't long enough and needed filler or some such nonsense, but it definitely doesn't feel like something that would fit on a Fall Out Boy album.<br /><br />7. Miss Missing You - 6/10: Meh. That is the best way to describe this album. It's a basic track that has a bit of nothing going for it.<br /><br />8. Death Valley - 9/10: At this point we've accepted that the dark feel we thought we'd get isn't going to happen, and we're able to embrace it. Enter Death Valley, one of the more fun tracks on the album. Bouncy, light, but with a tinge of brutality in the lyrics, this one is fun for a change in a way that hasn't been experienced since the beginning of the album.<br /><br />9. Young Volcanoes - 7/10: This one was another single, and the third track anyone following the lead-up to release would have heard. It was the first idea that we weren't going to get an album full of the style we had in the beginning, but it isn't a bad song. Acoustic guitars, light-hearted and fun vocals, and a rather fun idea of interaction between the lead and backing vocals make this exciting. If the other pop tracks had gone this way the album would have been much stronger for it.<br /><br />10. Rat a Tat - 2/10: This isn't about hating Courtney Love, though god knows I've got my demons in that regard. I'm not fond of Lil Wayne, but his appearance in Tiffany Blews last album was fine. This is just an abysmal, travesty of a song. Between the opening line, \\"It's Courtney b****\\", to the rants she uses in lieu of vocals, to Patrick's yelping vocals and the scattershot guitars this song is  just a cluster of a mess of a mistake. Have you ever watched a movie that was poorly written, shot, acted, and organized with bad music to boot? If you're answer is yes then you've heard this song already.<br /><br />11. Save Rock n' Roll - 8/10: Elton freaking John ladies and gentleman. This song isn't mind-blowing, and it's certainly not strong enough to end the album or make up for the track before it, but it's got Elton freaking John on it and his vocals are great. Stump is still showing off, but this is more of a band than we've heard all through the album. The keyboards, the light guitar work, and the vocals tie this together quite nicely.<br /><br />So there you have it, the album is disappointing but enjoyable in places. It won't grab your attention and it will be hailed by fans in love with the band simply because it's new music from them. The pop community will drown themselves in it. The rest of us will take the tracks we enjoy (whichever they may be) and move on, this won't be an album we'll play over and over. To those who love it I wish you well, but the band is capable of so much better and they know it.
0439023491|5.0|Finished Book 1 and I couldn't wait to read Books 2 and 3. Too bad the movie didn't come close to the book.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I saw this movie on Tv (missed it on Broadway:( ) But so glad I could get this on Amazon. It came quickly, and it was in very good condition. The price was very reasonable too
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've only played for 10 minutes but it's the good classic Mahjong game I've been looking for.  Just complex enough to while away some downtime.
034554398X|5.0|I'm just glad for the existence of this book since the tv show butchered the story so far. Take no substitute, stick to the books.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Can't wait for next season to finish. This series is one of the best I've ever followed. Great writers and cast.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Great music ~ as usual ~ by Bon Jovi.  A mix of upbeat and ballad tempos.  (great to clean the house too)  lol
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I really liked this movie very much. Love the songs. I have just ordered the two disc dvd version. I am looking forward to the blu ray version to come out.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Good Movie the wife enjoyed it more than Lincoln.  It was like Kill Bill crossed with Lincoln.  Would watch on a Saturday Night.
B001F0WXY0|3.0|Dune is a great book, and if I were reviewing the story it would be five stars.  The problem is the layout of the kindle version -- it definitely needed another editing pass.  There are sentences with spaces and punctuation missing, and poor layout of the pre-chapter quotes.  It's still fully readable, but much lower quality than I'd expect.
B0041CGP02|5.0|If you are a Bon Jovi fan this has it all.  All the hits are on this double album!  It arrived quickly and I loved the fact that I got a free download to the &#34;cloud&#34; with purchase.  I didn't know how much I would use that, but I have frequently found an opportunity to listen on my cell phone.
0792843584|4.0|Where to begin?<br /><br />It was a film that was so expensive to make, and such a catastrophic critical and box office disaster, that it literally ended the existence of a once-great film studio.  Its failure also all but ended the existence of a once-proud film genre, the Western.  The litany and avalanche of criticism, gossip, and talk of directorial excess on it virtually closed the shop down on tyro directors who could have their way with the studios and go to town on both budgets and schedules, at least for a time.<br /><br />It was Michael Cimino's HEAVEN'S GATE.  It was his attempt to make a Western of the scope of past screen epics like GONE WITH THE WIND, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and BEN HUR.  And it crashed badly, returning a miserable $1.3 million on a budget of close to $45 million when it opened (for one single weekend) in November 1980 (it was re-released in April 1981 in a vastly shortened version, and did no better).<br /><br />But just how bad of a film is it, in actuality?  Compared to other films of more recent times that have either cost much more and failed much worse at the box office, or films that have been hyped up beyond reason and in the end never really delivered, is this really the cataclysm a lot of people make it out to be even to this day?  In my humble opinion, having seen this film on five different occasions just to convince myself, the answer is \\"No.\\"<br /><br />It has to be conceded that this film, a very loose recreation of the Johnson County range war that raged in the 1890s in Wyoming between European immigrants and ruthless cattle barons, is excessive, particularly given its genre: oversized sets; Western towns that look dangerously like big cities; individual set pieces that seem to go on forever.  All of that I think any reasonable view of the film will reveal to be true.  If Steven Spielberg's biggest sin in having made the equally maligned World War II comedy \\"1941\\" around the same time as this film was in not realizing untilit was too late that slapstick comedy wasn't his forte, then Cimino's sin in making HEAVEN'S GATE the way he did was in not realizing that the Western wasn't really his thing.  His visions of making a David Lean/Cecil B. DeMille-type epic obscured the fact that such grandeur wasn't really what the Western genre was about, either historically or cinematically.  He didn't have the experience of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway in this arena.  He also unfortunately seemed to lack the ability to see the things that worked in more recent Western epics like director Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, both towering masterpieces from 1969, both of whose stories develop into epics; they're not full-born at the start.  In short, it's very possible that Cimino couldn't see the forest for the trees...at least not through all the smoke and the dust that gets spread around in the film.<br /><br />And yet, somehow, there's a lot to like for any viewer with the patience to sit through the more than three and a half hours of film.  The cast, which includes Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotten, and Isabelle Hupert, does very solid work, even if they were exposed to doing dozens and dozens of takes under Cimino's uber-perfectionistic direction.  The cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, who had won an Oscar for his work on Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND in 1977, is impressive enough, even if sometimes obscured by the aforementioned smoke and dust, especially in the final (and rather violent) battle sequence.  The period score by David Mansfield (who also has a cameo role) is also fairly impressive, sometimes echoing the score that Ennio Morricone composed for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; and in utilizing Johann Strauss' \\"The Blue Danube\\", both in Mansfield's solo guitar version (near the end) and Leonard Bernstein's 1965 New York Philharmonic recording (in the Harvard prologue of the film, set in 1870), Cimino may be tipping his cap to Stanley Kubrick's cagey use of the Strauss waltz in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  The end result may be extravagant to an obvious fault, but one can't fault Cimino for not trying hard enough, just for trying a bit too much.<br /><br />The film's recent re-release in Cimino's first version (lasting just over three and a half hours) in New York theatres, and on DVD, has led its most ardent defenders to claim HEAVEN'S GATE as the masterpiece that nobody recognized back in 1980-81.  I don't know that I'd quite call it a masterpiece, for the reasons I've stated.  But even with its numerous attendant flaws, HEAVEN'S GATE is also nowhere near the catastrophe its detractors have made it out to be for decades, not by a long shot.  It is a film that needs to be seen with an open mind, which a lot of people still seem exceptionally reluctant to do.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My kids love it...they had played it on the DS so I downloaded it a few days ago and they have been playing it non-stop.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I like it. Sometimes a movie goes on and on but this one slipped by without my glancing away from the screen.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The music is fabulous!  It was everything I expected from him!!!  I have it in my car and makes travel so enjoyable.
B003XU02QG|2.0|This movie seemed promising, it had a cool premise and involved seemingly good plot devices. but it went on and on, and had way too may subplots within the one. also the effects seemed like they were done in after effects, and not well done at that, seemed like a cop out for a big feature film. over all it seemed disorganized and not worth the time to watch. don't waste your time.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Pixar does such a fantastic job of animation...the details are amazing - and the story itself is very engaging. Plenty of humor and good soundtrack.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Didn't realize the old Kindle cable insulation cracks and flakes off over time - until it happened to me!  Bought this as a replacement.  No issues, looks like better material than the first one.  Whew!
B00CBXVGPC|5.0|Love the books, love the movies, and I love this show. Of course there is only a couple of episodes out but if things keep going as they are I'm very excited for a show of this caliber being on NBC.
B002XWXPC8|4.0|Good baseball movie funny and shows you how you can make a good team out of nothing. A a a
015601386X|5.0|This book will be a great addition as an auxillary text in the beginning German class that I teach for young teens.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I like the format of this game, and my kid seems to enjoy it as well.  We  particularly like the characters.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Love this book,  enjoyed the reading.  The way he write's you feel as though you were there.  I am in Book 3 now.
B000FJGWBC|2.0|Doesn't appear like a Blu-Ray picture, a bit fuzzy, grainy and lacks the vivid coloring. Case inserts look like an afterthought.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|great movie very funny, kept me laughing through most of the film. it was like watching a 2 hour long episode of family guy though no cartoons, which i love family guy! i recommend for any seth mcfarlane fan!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I enjoyed this one.  It was fun and interesting until I got through the game.  Once it was &#34;done,&#34; it is done.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|This series is interesting, reminiscent, and addicting. We watched all previous series in secession and now look forward to every new episode. I highly recommend it.
B006B9TLT0|5.0|Taylor Swift wrote all the lyrics and music, designed the sets, partnered on lighting and firework displays, pretty much did it all but probably you would never realize the genius (7 Grammys) as she started this tour when only 20 years old. Loves her fans.<br /><br />Plays electric and acoustic guitars, banjo and piano. More of a show than a concert. Crowd into it during the entire 2 hours. Lots of sets and songs you may have never expected to see and hear from Taylor Swift. Some nicely done cover songs included. The video is well edited and flows smoothly.<br /><br />The CD is well mastered and captures more backup voices and instruments in the mixes but keeping the crowd noise for effect.<br /><br />Very entertaining watching a girl enjoying being a girl. No concerns about talent here.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Is a good looking watch and I was pleasantly surprised with the sweeping second hand. Purchased it as an everyday work watch. Had just recently purchased a work watch but didn't realize how much I looked at the calendar until I didn't have it. I digress, only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is it isn't as large as I prefer but you couldn't beat the price for such a nice looking watch.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoy the Quell family of puzzle games.  I play them over and over again.  Some puzzles are really difficult, and some are easier, and they are not specifically in order of easy to hard.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Whether you're a new or an old a Clutch fan, this is a must-have album!  Most bands get stale after many albums, but clutch somehow keeps it fresh, time and time again. Not to mention, I just saw them live in Chicago, and they performed the whole album.  it was amazing!
B00008G9JM|4.0|Still the original soundtrack but cleaned up a bit. Not that you would really notice unless you had the old recording on vinyl or tape or CD to compare to.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|The kids like this one but a little difficult as you progress have to use two hands to complete in the future
B00846F1YW|2.0|The premise of this game is flimsy at best.  The &#34;reasons&#34; for the main character to go snooping through every room in the town is rediculous, the lack of attention to detail is horrendous, and if she had just read the letter she was given in the first scene, the entire &#34;plot&#34; (or lack thereof) would have been foiled.  And seriously, the villain was &#34;***&#34; in disguise? What is this, &#34;Scooby-Doo?&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great multiple story lines and an excellent cast that provides an accurate look into English aristocracy at that time in history.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Runs a little slow at first.  But once it gets going it's great!  Alicia is played by a great actress!
B000TDIFNC|5.0|The songs are all different from each other, it's very interesting, creative, diverse. Brian Eno at his best! I hope that my teenagers hear it in the car and learn that parents really can recognize musical genius!
B0035JLVWY|4.0|Basic lawyer picture. Very well acted and constructed. It had a few loose parts that should have been cut by the director. But the performances were first rate, and the movie left me satisfied when it was over.
B009YQJ322|4.0|It's a shame this didn't do as well in the theaters as it should have. The effects are well done (I would have loved to have seen the Slo-Mo stuff in 3D!)  Karl Urban does a bang up job as Dredd.<br /><br />Lena Headey is proving herself to be the go-to female villain after her turns as Cersai in Game of Thrones and Ma Ma in Dredd. She OWNS the vile and evil side of the tower.<br /><br />It's well done and I wish there could be a sequel. It was a reboot that needed to happen because Stallone's version is awful.
B001HN69AY|4.0|They of course did an interesting job of improvising without heath ledger to finish shooting the rest of the scenes.
B00009AOBI|5.0|One of Cher's finest acting roles so natural. Gutsy, loving a powerful movie showing that difference doesnt change who you are inside.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|I read many critically acclaimed reviews of this movie, but I was slightly disappointed. Consisting of a superb cast, there are fairly good performances by the actors and the dialog was sharp, but I was expecting more. I didn't really feel for the characters and that was a major strike for me. I wasn't invested in the film when all was said and done. It didn't draw me in as it should have done.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy and Mark Greaney have done it again.  Almost a little too realistic considering our nation's vulnerability to cyber-espionage and attack.  Even though it is fiction and a very entertaining read, American corporations and our military would do well to give careful thought to this type of scenario.  The characters, as always, have depth and the story held my attention.  I stayed up way too late reading this on more than one occasion.  These authors aren't just good at what they do... they define their genre of fiction.
B00402FGEE|5.0|Great show and great acting, from Robert Carlyle especially. Real shame it wasn't on for longer. Perhaps they will do a film to finish it.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I DISCOVERED THIS MOVIE BY ACCIDENT...AND IM SOOOOO JAZZED ABOUT IT!!!  HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT EVER SINCE AND AMAZON FINALLY ENDED MY SEARCH!!!  ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND WILL BE A PART OF MY LIBRARY FOR YEARS TO COME!!! :)
B009K86D86|4.0|There is so much we don't know about the food we buy and eat. This documentary is an engaging eye opener.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Inspirational & insightful. Makes you think. Most people can do  and accomplish a lot more than they think they can.
B000FA675C|3.0|really enjoyed most of the book.<br />Seemed to wrap up a little to fast at the end, or I would have given it 4 stars.<br />The ending just was too abrupt for me, the rest of the book was very good.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is an excellent movie which reflected the difficult time in our country's history.  It was directed well and the actors and actresses we terrific.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I am glad to see this on Amazon Prime.  Watched through Sony Blu-Ray connection. The streaming quality was very good.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|It arrived on time and was easy to use in the DVD player. The quality of the recording was beautiful. I
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The copy I ordered from Amazon was dark, lacked contrast, and wasn't worth the money, frankly. But, also distracting was the music scores, or sounds, were not related to the events taking place; in fact, almost opposite. They distracted from the storyline, true or not.<br /><br />In the opening segments, I forwarded them finally, because the roar of crowds only impresses for a certain, short lenght of time when a story must begin to move forward. In fairness, I'll watch this again, but did not find it exceptional.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am glad to see this on Amazon Prime.  I watched on my computer.  The streaming quality was very good.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game was really fun, then it started to act up once I was almost finished with it. For instance, it would lock up on me and I'd have to restart my Kindle.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|This is another replacement that went missingI don't know what in the world it would take to make up the word that I missing in the rest of this.  What can you have to stay about a movie that was taken to the house.  Many of the things that I order, are replacements of movies that just happen to disappear.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Again Luke has put out an excellent album! Now all will know why he is entertainer of the year if they give a listen!
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Following in Bogart's foot steps Jack Nicholson does a superb job in creating a classic gum shoe detective. This movie is a great piece film noir.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Glad to have a way to print from my Kindle Fire without going through my PC.  .Many thanks to HP.
030758836X|1.0|I was ready to give up at page 30 but decided to keep going because of all of the good reviews it was getting...surely it had to get better. It did and then it got cliche and predictable. I willed myself to finish it only to be completely let down and turned off by the ending. I felt like I was reading a Lifetime movie...fun to watch, but would never read one.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise was and is one of the best sci-fi series on television. I enjoy watching it on Amazon Prime.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Great dvd. Purchased for my husband. He loves it! Great mix of music. Great sound and video! :) !!! !!!
B007W7P5L8|4.0|This case fits my kindle fire very well.  It seems very secure and never feels like it will fall out or slip or anything like that.  It is a little awkward to turn it into a stand, but it does work if you want it to.  I ordered the purple one and the color is very nice, not too bright or annoying, kind of more of a deeper plum color. I am very happy with this case and feel that it does a good job of protecting my kindle.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|This album is great. It shows the evolution of the band. I can't wait for the next album. Buy it guys.....it's definitely worth it.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I purchased as a gift for my fifteen year old son. He has not seen the other fast movies and he loved it. I have seen the other fast movies and I cannot make it all the way through this one :(
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I don't know why I liked it so much- silly movie- but lots of fun and kids enjoyed it too.
B003B02OOG|3.0|Kind of a blah read...not up to Grisham's expectations....endings were anti climatic and leave you asking - why did I read all this just to get to this end!!!!
B000000OF6|5.0|I love it! I requested it as a gift from my husband. It is great! Love the song selection! :)
B000007492|2.0|This took so long to get that I had to check my account to see if I had actually ordered it or just thought about it.  Also, at least two of the songs freeze (  where the you get a loud stuttering drone) when I played it so I finally turned it off.  Very disappointing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i first got introduced to this on my brothers pad and i tried it and i love it. this app is so much fun. i like seeing how far i can get in one direction without getting eaten yet. i have been told by my brother rhere is a greatwhite in the game but i have not seen it yet :/ but fantastic game highly recommended
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Purchased for my fifteen year old son. He doesn't watch it very often ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
B0053TMP24|5.0|I started off with percy jackson, after finishing the last heroes of olympus book it was cool to find out that the story goes on, and really enjoyed how they intertwine. along the way, you learn about greek and roman history. i look forward to the release of the last book in the series after mark of athena, which i am still enjoying. after that i will read the other series the kane chronicles.. and i heard they also intertwine with this story. rick riordan, thank you for a great story.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I travel a lot for business and this book has been a great read on plane rides! Makes the time go by very quickly, so intrigued by the characters and story line of the Zombie Apocalypse. Any Walking Dead fan would LOVE!
0307352153|4.0|As an introvert, I really liked this book.  It explained why I have anxiety attacks before parties or social gatherings.  It sort of gave me permission to be alone and not feel anti-social.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is an Alfred Hitchcock movie starring Grace Kelly and James Stewart, from 1954. James Stewart plays an injured photographer who's stuck in his apartment in a cast for weeks, and he witnesses what he thinks may be a murder. His girlfriend is Grace Kelly and they discuss the ethics of watching his neighbors all the time. (Rear Window ethics). The entire movie takes place from Stewart's apartment and it's an absolutely wonderful movie!
B005OMOKN2|5.0|i would recommend.  very nice to have the extra battery and this one was far less expensive than in the stores!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A heart warming and uplifting story of Christmas. A great adventure story that awakens the child like wonder in all of us. The last line in the movie is sure to make you cry. Fun trivia time: try to pick up on all of the voices Tom Hanks does!
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|But it's still really good! One of my favorite shows. Really well done. The digital copy is good quality too. Much better than the SD. You must get the HD quality version.

B000YMQI6E|5.0|If you like psychological thrillers, this is great.  Hopkins thinks he cannot be nailed, even though he knows that Gosling knows he is guilty.  He taunts Gosling and in the end has forgotten one tiny little detail...
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Good story and acting.  Creepy so I set the alarm to the house when I watch it.  Makes me want to see the next episode to see what will happen!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love every book of his that I have read.  They all keep me engaged and interested til the very end. I can't seem to put them down and can't wait to start another one of Michael's  mysteries. I hope he keeps writing a long time!
B00447G2T8|5.0|If you like Helloween, than I am sure you will NOT be disappointed with this release. Good album. They provide exactly what I would have expected, in classic Helloween fashion.
B003QSJVV2|4.0|I love Nicholas Cage; all of his movies are great. Angelina Jolie is an excellent supporting actress as well as a lead.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  I'm not sure how I stumbled upon it, but I am sure glad I did!  Highly recommended.
0670026603|5.0|Louisa Clark, a young British woman, takes a job as a caregiver for a formerly active and athletic young man who has become a quadriplegic after a horrific accident. As she becomes more and more involved in his life, Louisa finds out about some plans Will has which greatly disturb her. The plot is involving and  the characters vividly portrayed; I found this novel compelling and unforgettable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the characters. I am completely invested in their lives and stories. The twists and turns and mysteries that still are left unsolved keep me coming back!!! I have watched each season twice!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another good book in the Harry Bosch series; kept me up a few nights as the book was difficult to put down.
B004G7UTXG|2.0|It never really came....big actors you would think their roles would have been better defined. Beautiful area for filming, special effects were weak, going over the falls...
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|A must-have to finish the trilogy. I was not quite ready for the ending. It was so sweet!<br />Thank you for finishing the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My girlfriend became rather amorous after reading this book so I thought I would check it out...........glad I did.  ;)
B00CDT5YZC|5.0|I have a TV pass for this, why hasn't episode 21 been automatically purchased yet?<br />Feeling very irritated, that is the entire complaint. Minimum word counts are asinine.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adelle pays tribute to mother, friends, and old loves at her life achievement venue, Royal Albert Hall.<br />From start to finish, a wonderful, and emotional roller-coaster for Adelle, fans, and you alike.<br />Have tissues handy! Right off the bat, Adelle's &#34;colorful&#34; language flows just like the words of her songs. Between songs, she rambles down memory lane, taking everyone with her. This is her moment, she has waited for all her life.<br />ENJOY IT my dear......you have EARNED IT!<br />You have arrived!
B007PKOKTK|5.0|I selected the wrong computer to download to and had no way of going back to select the correct one since the other unit crashed. I tried contacting amazon and this is the 3rd time we wasted a purchase for movie. No return of money either....Google Movie options seems to be better and easier to use and get your money back if they fail.
B000W967UQ|5.0|Love Terry Pratchett, his stories are always entertaining and full of fun and mischief if you haven't tried his books yet you are missing a good laugh. Great read!
B003Y5H5EW|1.0|Boring story and not novel strategy.<br />Not interesting.<br />Not funny.<br />You will lose your important time during watching this.<br />Please do not watch this DVD.
0470474874|4.0|I use this book regularly as a reminder, thought starter when I am trying something new functions and features.  Excell is always a learning experience.

B006L9B6TI|5.0|Amazing! The missing piece of the application of the Secret. The Magic showed me how to \\"feel\\" so I could harness the power of the Secret. You can NOT feel bad when you use the \\" Magic\\"!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Awful that they canceled this, it is so hard to trust networks anymore. They tend to cancel all my favorite shows, leaving you without resolution.
0061743526|5.0|This classic is a must read.  It is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago.  Reading a story from a child's perspective is so real and enlightening!<br /> I'm so glad I ordered the hard back.  It will be great to pass it on to my grandchildren.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 10 yr. old grandson got me started on this one.  Hardly play it until I know he is coming and I have to practice up because I know he will want to challenge me.  Great little game.  R. Hobbs
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Lots of fun, has a comic book feel, in fact I think it is based on comic book.Shia has an early career cameo in this.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The accuracy of the history is amazing.  Love the way the characters intertwine with each other and cross an ocean and nations.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Play it a lot but not as much as Legend.  Recommend it highly but not as much fun to me as legend.  It is better for most to start with Jewels...then J. Stars....then Jewels Legend.  All are great games.  Lots of fun for family challenge.  R. Hobbs
B0013ND36G|5.0|We love all the Terminator movies. Lots of fun, a little violent and a little action, seems as they contain they become more and more drama-ish.
B003Y5H59C|4.0|There are some disturbing elements to the well played personalities in this movie. I don't know what you think the movie is about, but I think its a way of finding your soul mate in that part of you that doesn't feel right, until you meet that special someone. The characters &#34;fix&#34; each other only to find out that they need each other as much as they love one another.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Enjoy Angry Bird better.  Just don't get it I guess.  Need to give it some time and I am sure I would feel different but don't play it much.  R. Hobbs
0618001905|4.0|Great book if you read biographies for fun. It highlights the horrors of the congo, rubber trade, and king Leopolds attempt to rise above his own ego.
B00C49H3WI|5.0|This show had me hooked straight off from JUST the trailer I caught before it was even released!!!  I caught the trailer while waiting for another movie to download and instead of skipping it after 5 seconds, which is what I usually do, I found myself excited for the launch of the series and even marked it on my calendar and I am so glad that I had.<br /><br />Without going into the details of the story-line to Orphan Black, (which might ruin the surprises to come) I just want to say that it is one of the most original story-lines being shown outside of the U.S. that is actually addicting to watch.  Though I have only watched the first three episodes, I find myself anxiously awaiting next week's program to see more of what is going to happen to Sarah/Beth. In the past, the only shows that have drawn me in, in this way, have been Mad Men and the Walking Dead so this gives you an idea of the type of shows I gravitate toward.<br /><br />If your unsure of whether or not to buy episodes to begin watching this show, I highly recommend you give it a go. I doubt you will be disappointed. I found myself hooked even after just the FIRST episode... which is strange for me since I am terribly particular with what I will religiously watch.<br /><br />With a great deal of fast action and a superb leading young actress, makes Orphan Black a remarkable series, even though the premise of the story is a bit on the wild-side.<br /><br />Please feel free to view my other TV and Movie reviews and thanks for reading this one!<br /><br />Cheers, Mike!
B000O3P18Y|3.0|Kind of seems like a bunch of random ideas David had sitting around. Nothing really good or bad. Does't remind me of Pink Floyd whatsoever. Seems David without Roger isn't anything all that special, and vice versa.
B0013FBS20|5.0|Can be slightly depressing. Has great action, great acting and a somewhat happy ending. However, I would advised you show only to kids over 13.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost is definitely one of the best series out there.  It gets a bit convoluted towards the end of the series and obscure, but all of its strengths as a series outweigh the weaknesses.  It will make you laugh, cry, and angry.  It will make you feel like the characters are long &#34;lost&#34; friends.  It's a must see and I love owning it.
B000026OW3|5.0|This is a fantastic value - an amazing collection of the Master, Artur Rubenstein, interpreting Chopin, playing as only he could.
B000W10AEI|5.0|Perfect series, great condition. Like many I adore this series, books and movies. Worth every penny, I can't wait until they release extended versions.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost is definitely one of the best series out there.  It gets a bit convoluted towards the end of the series and obscure, but all of its strengths as a series outweigh the weaknesses.  It will make you laugh, cry, and angry.  It will make you feel like the characters are long &#34;lost&#34; friends.  It's a must see and I love owning it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Nothing but positive things to say. Funny, dramatic, great animation...and it has Alan Tudyk, so you know you can't go wrong. Definitely the best of Disney's recent offerings by far.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|My hubby LOVES this movie, like a kid we have seen this about 600 times, in fact I am sick of seeing it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian really makes you work for it!  This is a great work out, but it gets a little boring after doing it over and over again.  I like a little variation in my workouts.  It would have been nice if there were a couple of workouts in the different levels to choose from.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is riveting!!  I usually take a lot longer to finish a book as I usually only read in bed to wind down for the night.  I recommend this book.
B00475BUVM|5.0|Who doesn't love a good story in 3-D? It's action, fairy tale, love story and drama all in one. CGI is obvious, but I can't think of a way to have giant bugs with CGI.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost is definitely one of the best series out there.  It gets a bit convoluted towards the end of the series and obscure, but all of its strengths as a series outweigh the weaknesses.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am not looking forward to finishing this series, I am enjoying it very much!  I would recommend this book.
B0093QEP58|3.0|The movie is great, the dvd is average quality. This may be my favorite action movie, ever. This money is worth the money.
0345529057|5.0|George R.R. Martin is brilliant.  I found it a little hard to get into at first, but once I did I was hooked!  As soon as I finished one book, I started up the next.  I started reading them in August 2012 and finished the set by February 2013.  Like I said, I couldn't put them down.  If you love the fantasy genre, you must read these books.
1885167776|5.0|Ok, that's a corny title, but I am much better focused and thus I will be much more productive then I have in the past. I have worked very hard in the past at my career, but at the end of the day, if you don't have results, does everything you did really matter? When you work hard, you may or may not have any positive results to show for it. When your working productively, most of your results will be positive. When you apply Gary Keller's approach to being productive, after each &#34;Domino&#34; you knock over, what you have accomplished makes everything else easier or unnecessary.<br /><br />This book focuses on using synergy, which is the interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce an effect different from or greater than the sum of their individual effects.As described in the book, The Domino Affect. Once you knock over the first domino, all the ones after will fall over EASIER (NOT EASY). You first have to know which Domino to knock over, then keep beating it until it falls. This is the most difficult step.<br /><br />For me, my physical health and my business income are the most important things that I believe will make a extraordinary difference in my life once I have knocked those Domino's down. Being in good physical condition will allow me to have the confidence in social settings so I am able to make long lasting personal and business relationships with people who is help me build my business. By making money in my business will not only allow me to live a lifestyle I have worked hard for, but also to have a sense of purpose and pride in my life that I currently lack. I will also be able to expand my marketing because I have more income coming in. My other focus areas are: my relationships (family, friends, significant other), my personal life, and my finances (it doesn't matter how much money you make if you don't know how to manage it).
B004856SQ8|5.0|Great action, humor, was super sad to hear they are refusing to make a sequel. It is sad to think they make sequels to crap but not good movies.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is definitely one of the best series out there.  It gets a bit convoluted towards the end of the series and obscure, but all of its strengths as a series outweigh the weaknesses.  It will make you laugh, cry, and angry.  It will make you feel like the characters are long &#34;lost&#34; friends.  It's a must see and I love owning it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I borrowed the first season from my brother and thought I would give it a try as I enjoyed watching other like tv series with mediavel themes such as: Tudors, Borgia, and Elizabeth, and The Other Boleyn Girl. I was instantly hooked and had to have season 2, so when it came out for pre-order, I ordered it right away. The story  and acting is very well done and I like the mythical creatures, which makes it unpredictable what will happen next.
B007V65R54|5.0|Great story of how people so quickly mistake meaningless facts for meaningful facts, and how to find facts rather quickly.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|If your a fan of the MIB franchise you'll love the third installment.<br />I like the way they gave further explaination of characters from parts 1-2 in this third one. And they did a great job of introducing new characters. I'm not going to spoil what happens in the movie. But I will say it is well paced, action packed, and it wraps up the frachise very well.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Was expecting a book written by a military person. Instead i read a book written by a great author. Gave me a view of how war can affect strong people and shake marriages. A very intense read. Sorry he won't be around to write any more.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This has to be one of Clint Eastwood's best movies. It has a good plot and flow to it. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book took me a year but I read it and I am sad that's it is over
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I live in South Carolina and have children in TX.  and. P.A.  This weather app allows me to keep track of several locations quickly.  Love the ease of use.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My husband started watching this on Showtime, thinking I would not be interested as it focused on a U.S. Prisoner of War returning home when everyone thought he was dead.  He finally told me about it and I watched the first show.  I was hooked.  The stories keep you guessing as to 'who is telling the truth', 'what are they planning to do', and 'what will happen next!'  You have to watch close and maybe an episode later you realize - &#34;oh, now I get it!&#34;  I could not wait for each new episode to air.  Some I watched more than once and you always see things you missed the first time.  You watch and think this could happen in today's world.  I enjoyed the mystery and intrigue of each episode.  I am looking forward to Homeland:  The Complete Second Season to become available.  Fast shipping and no disappointments here.
1608862801|5.0|My 8-year-old son is a big Adventure Time fan (and I enjoy the show too...it makes me laugh out loud). I love its quirkiness. I didn't know until we spotted this book at the school book fair that it comes in a comic book form, too. He was overjoyed when I got it for him - he loves comics/graphic novels. He's enjoyed this book. I'll think about getting him more in the series.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Like being back on the court! Great graphics, sound and ball control. But beware, addictive, especially if you are a competitive player!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Even though Fade into You didn't make the cut because of copyright issues, they provide you with a credit to purchase the song anyway....so this makes the album complete and perfect!
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Forgetting the endless ear candy that is played to death in Classic Rock radio, these albums are where to score a renewed appreciation of what a truly gifted and unique band the Eagles have been -- right from the start.  Kudos to mssrs Meisner, Leadon, and Souther - often the men behind the curtains
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Good graphics, good layout, good color scheme, easy to navigate.  I've given it 4 stars previously, but the app loads slower and slower over time.  Other weather apps I use don't have the same problem with loading as The Weather Channel.  When it does work, it works pretty good.  The videos seem to stream with no problems at all.  The main problem is that it takes quite a long time, relatively speaking, for the app to load.
0553293397|2.0|Endless bla bla bla. It doesn't seem to go anywhere. Talking about the same stuff over and over again. A robot can't do it, but who did, repeat endlessly...
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I just bought a Kindle Fire HD and was looking for things to keep my great grandson occupied.  I love to hear his giggles when he is playing with Tom!  Also I bought the &#34;full&#34; version for .99 so Tom does some other things as well.  Wish he did more though!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A must see! But you must watch from the beginning.  I can not wait for the rest of the seasons to come out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a fun game.  Helps keep my reflexes going. Also, the graphics and<br />sound accompaniment are high quality.  My students are much better than<br />I, but I am trying to stay up with the kids - just to know what they are talking<br />about.  Bottom line, it is fun - I understand why my students like this so much.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've seen this many times in 2D, which was good, but now that I've seen it in 3D, I know why it is considered the standard for the art.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|The Movie \\"Contact\\" was a great movie and was by far one of the best I have seen so far.  The main actress (Jodie Foster) plays her part very well and the rest of the actors and actresses played there parts well also.  The movie keeps your attention for the whole duration of the film and comes with a suprising ending.
B009QD0MYQ|3.0|not to much to really go off of for this CD since I just heard them on Youtube and bought the CD. The band is ok but really just one song was all that I wanted.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|The family really enjoyed this Hobbit movie (may not be for really young children). It does not follow the path of the series. The movie begins from an earlier period and takes you to how the ring was discovered by Bilbo Baggins. Some very enjoyable special effects are included and the sound track does really well on a surround sound system. Parts of the movie reminded me of Snow White and even Star Wars..........see how the characters make you think of past movies.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I really enjoyed the first couple, but after watching all of them I'm left feeling a little disappointed in how it's all turned out.  I'm not going to get into the realism of an actual Zombie Attack would be, but I will say the way the characters react to a lot of situations seems really unrealistic and at times down right stupid.  I was happy when Ricks wife died a while back, but haven't gotten too excited about anything since then.
B009G78EE2|5.0|heard Thrift Shop online and decided that I would buy the CD. Love it to say the least. There are few CDs that I have bought that I could listen to the entire CD without skipping a song but this is one of them.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I love this movie!  It is very clever and I am so happy that they included some of my favorite games from back in the day! I would recommend this movie to all game lovers!
B000FA675C|4.0|If you read a book before it becomes huge (which I was fortunate enough to do with this book), you can really judge a book on its merits without having to pay attention to what the rest of the world thinks. However, once it becomes popular, the reviews become over the top, which I think happens far too often. Yes, it is a good book. Did I like it more than his other work Angels and Demons? Not really. Do I think it led far too many readers to have unreasonable expectations about his following novel? Yes. Now that the hype has gone away, if you haven't read the book, give it a try. You may or may not like it. However, at least now you'll get the chance to judge it for yourself instead of having all your friends urging you to fall in love with it.
0061438294|4.0|As far as entry level books that have quality information, this is probably at the top of the list.  The writing is good, it is complemented with pictures that demonstrate the expressions, situational examples are given.  For a light read, it is pretty detailed and informative.  One must learn the basics before becoming an expert, and while I was hoping I'd be a little bit more of an expert after reading this, the book delivers what it says it will.  This is a fine buy.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Bought one for me and one for a friend.  Love it!  It helps that I had seen the movie and loved it, so I love the soundtrack!  Arrived quickly and in good condition.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Complicated! why not give a tutorial like most games like this? Too many steps. Could be more fun if I didn't get so frustrated!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Excellent value thru Amazon compared to ITunes et al .This version has all of the songs in correct order. Love it!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a great game. Well worth the .99 cents I paid for it. Willing to recommend it to anyone
B0087EACJK|4.0|This is a fun app to use between other things.  I don't find it that it holds my attention for long periods, but that's also because it is increasely difficult as it progresses.  The nice features are being able to return to previous sections to retake that level, improve your score or learn more.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|A solid sequel to a good movie, that is not always a given.  We look forward to the next in the series.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Love it - quality excellent - great in the theater, great on DVD.  Books better, but that's usually the case :-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is easy on the eyes.  It's fun to use and I like the added tip feature.  Great buy.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you are an avid ebay user, I recommend this App!! Makes searching for items so much easier!! Took me a little<br />to learn how to navigate but, once I did, I love it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think it a good game with cool dragon.  you guy should make more game like this I think people would like the games I wish you could make more
B005CFWHCC|5.0|I have this style of Crocs in every color they offer. There are great to wear with dress pants for work or with every day causal wear. Love them!
1439190275|5.0|This is a great book.  I tried the Adkins diet years ago and it was so restrictive that I didn't last long.<br />Now this book lays everything out clearly.  Much easier to follow, more options.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Two thumbs up. Affleck has done himself a lot of credit as a director and actor. Had us on the edge of our seats from start to finish. Did not care to see it for awhile but then we decided to go ahead and take a chance. It is not at all what I thought the plot was all about. A must see!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I would recommend this product to all my friends and relatives.  I will continue to purchase merchandise from your company.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great suspense. Time we got a decent and honest narrative about the people that made it happen instead of the political BS that came out of DC.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a very good sharpener for those of us that don't want to spend the time it takes to use a real sharpening rock. This sharpener does a pretty good job at sharpening my knifes when I'm in a hurry or in a situation in which I don't have space for a large sharpening rock. However, I would highly recommend getting a sharpening rock if you want your knifes to be extremely sharp as this product just can't compare to the edge created by a real sharpening rock.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Not the kind of movie I would go see again. Heard a lot about it and the movie trailers made us want to see it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This package arrived earlier than expected, is easy to put together, and provides my grandchild with enjoyment. I recommend it for anyone who wants a crib mobile.
0788859544|5.0|My granddaughter loves it.  She will watch it over and over again.  Then when I ask what she wants to watch when chooses &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; again.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My kids, 18 to 7 enjoyed the movie.  {Spoiler alert}  Its about rats and food.  The french rats are fun to watch.
1416550550|3.0|This book needed to be edited, a little to long.  It's a great beach book for light reading, characters not that interesting.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Judd Apatow is a genius with comedies but he really has no idea how to pace a drama, as evidenced by &#34;Funny People&#34; and now &#34;This Is 40&#34;. Only the likeability and vulnerability of Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann saves this movie from being an incoherent mess, but fortunately they are, at times, able to overcome the lack of plot or direction in the film. Its worth a watch for a couples' night in but set your expectation low.
B003B02O0A|5.0|First of all I am a Grisham fan altho I was disappointed with Calico Joe.  I read this novel years ago and read it again this winter.  I had forgotten how intense & emotional this read is.  I had also forgotten what the South was like--a  memory I really didn't need to revisit; but this novel gives one such a comprehensive view of the 1960's and how much we as a nation have over come.  Best historical, legal novel ever.
B00913DPW2|1.0|They took a very common game concept and executed poorly on it.<br /><br />It was hard to install, took two tries.<br />The game starts off like any of the other \\"hidden objects in the context of a story\\" games do, but it quickly becomes unplayable. Here are some issues I had:<br />- hidden doors that don't open on the first touch. Touch the area, nothing happens. Find out later through the walkthrough I was supposed to touch the light emanating from the doorway and not the door way itself. Riiiiight.<br />- can't tell when you're done finding clues in a room. That's simply evil, which brings me to the next one:<br />- allows you too far into newer areas, even though you don't have the right items to go anywhere. Almost like they decided... Let's make it harder by making people think they're getting somewhere... Even though they should have really picked up the red gem 17 rooms ago. I know this happens in other games... But in addition to a good hint system the pieces are always logically related. Not some bizarre \\"a red gem goes in this hole but you will never know this hole is missing something, or that you should be looking for a gem, much less a red one\\"<br />- the puzzles are just dumb and repetitive. Like the three sliding picture puzzles you have to put together at one spot. Wth? Who thought this was a good idea?<br />- really poor hint system. Their version of hints is to tell you to go the official walkthrough. I think they realized how unnecessarily complicated and dumb the game is and created the walkthrough... Which also happens to be poorly executed.<br /><br />The game is not enjoyable at all. Save yourself the frustration. Try similar games from big fish and others - they're a lot more playable and fun.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|LOVED it...the right touch amongst actors...Danny DeVito is just a hoot (as usual)!!!!  Great plot lines and a great look at &#34;law in the south&#34;....
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Movie applied to real life. Very moving.  Denzel Washington was amazing. Great portrail of what alcohol can do to family members.  People in treatment should be required to watch this movie!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The movie was phenominal in theatres, and tho I don' have the screen to match it at home, the experience was nearly there with the blu-ray. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I cry everytime, even if it's only a little.
0938045768|5.0|Wow this workout is MUCH tougher than I expected.  For years I just lifted weights.  I got strong, big and in the process I also put on more fat than I realized.  I tried P90X, got shredded, looked great and got my athlete self back.  However, I lost nearly all my strength and I got tired of doing hundreds of push ups, pull ups, etc.  I found this book and CC2 also and they tie together both the strength and the endurance aspects of weightlifting and P90X.  There isn't the cardio in CC & CC2 though, but the work outs are so short that you can add in whatever cardio you want.  This isn't just another book of body weight exercises where you randomly chose what you want to do.  The exercises are done in an order and way to get you to progress to even harder exercises while you strengthen both your muscles and tendons/ligaments.  I can do tons of push ups and pull ups, but not in this program.  On all exercises you go down and up slow and you pause at the top and bottom.  I can't do anywhere near the reps in this style that I can do when I use some momentum and speed.  An example of the progression for push ups is to start with leaning against a wall and doing a number of sets for a number of reps at the slow and pause pace.  When you can complete that program you move to the next one.  Eventually you get to where you are doing one arm push ups with your arm close to your body and feet together.  I thought I could jump right into the middle of this program, but after today (I just started), I have to start near the bottom like the author reccomended in the first place.  Book 1 covers the 6 core exercises.  Book 2 covers stuff like calves, neck, diet, flexibility/mobility, etc.  If you think book one has new stuff, you will be in for a bigger shock with book 2.  Some of the stuff he goes over completely goes against mainstream bodybuilding/fitness training.  And I am loving it!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Basically brought the experience home for repeatable uses for one low price! And it came with UltraViolet?! Yeah buddy, you know it!
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I have watched season one and two and they are both excellent. Great acting and characters. Currently watching season three.
0385738765|4.0|Okay. I'm still confused. This book does not answer questions you may have had at the end of the Maze Runner. I hope they are answered in book #3. This book is still pretty action packed. Once you start you just HAVE to know what happens next. On to book #3.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|While the plot unfolds slowly, the story draws you into the characters and circumstances.  We finished Season 1 and promptly started Season 2.
0385738781|4.0|Okay. I saw that some people were upset with the ending of this book (based on other reviews). I read this book expecting to be disappointed with a horrible ending, but I wanted to finish up the series I started.<br /><br />I have to say, I was NOT upset with the ending. It worked AOK for me.<br /><br />If you liked the other Maze Runner books, you will like this one too.
B008GJVH7M|4.0|I didn't know whether to laugh, grimace, or cry... so I did all three.  Has to be the most peculiar &#34;mob&#34; movie ever made.  Very enjoyable all in all.  I loaded it up without researching and when the ending credits revealed the Coen Brothers, I thought, &#34;Well, that explains it.&#34;  I'm not sure why I didn't know that going in except it was a late night after a long day.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I REALLY liked this book a lot. It makes you just want to keep reading to find out what will happen next. I quickly read through the entire series!
B009LMTDL0|2.0|I was disappointed in this book.<br />She seems out of touch with women in general.<br />I would like to hear what she has to write about when<br />she is older and her children grown.
1250007208|4.0|This review was originally posted on my blog She Has A Knack For It<br /><br />I read it in one day. There was still one mild issue with the story that bothered me. Cinder's mother and sisters are referred to as \\"step-mother\\" and \\"step-sisters,\\" when in reality they are her adoptive mother and sisters as her father adopted her after her birth parents were killed in a hover accident. I'm guessing the author did that to try to more closely resemble Cinderella, but I don't think it was necessary. I feel she could have just stated they were her adoptive family and called it good. I think the readers would have been more than happy to go along with it.<br /><br />Now on to the interesting world that Marissa Meyer created. As far as fairy tale retellings go, I found this one to be interesting. Most of the retellings I've read seem to take place in modern or present time. A few have taken place in the future, like [[ASIN:0763663468 A Long, Long Sleep]], but Cinder not only takes place in the future, but a dirty, gritty world after a few wars. I like that there are humans, androids, cyborgs, lunars, etc...I do find it a little hard to believe that in the future we would treat cyborgs as second class citizens. It seems like most of them had an accident and had a body part replaced, like a leg or an organ, etc...I would believe that we would actually herald that a success in medicine an advancement, from what we can currently do for our soldiers and other accident victims today. But alas, I went with it while reading the story.<br /><br />I like description of the vendors in the market. It almost reminded me of Aladdin of all things. The lunar people are scary and mysterious. The plague is obviously scary as they still haven't located a cure. Those who catch it are sure to die a painful death and it's so easily spread.<br /><br />Overall, a very appealing set up to a series.
0425263908|2.0|This is exactly like 50 shades of gray! Everything in it is the same, just different names. I was excited to read another set &#34;like&#34; 50 but I'm majorly disappointed at how much they are the same. I won't be reading the other two in this set.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Loved this movie! Grew up reading the books. The Barsoom World opens up the imagination. I heard from the media it is hard for some to understand the whole concept of how he ends up on Mars but it seems clear as day to me. Hopefully they make a sequel for this!!
0345803485|1.0|I was interested in this book because I have dabbled in the BDSM lifestyle, so I was curious as to how it would be portrayed in a \\"romance\\" type novel, a bestseller at that.<br /><br />Granted, I have only dabbled in the lifestyle, but I cannot imagine any true Dominant acting the way this man does.  It was so unrealistic.<br />But that is just one of the many unrealistic things regarding this book.<br /><br />\\"Inner goddess\\"?  Who thinks like that?  Those voices are usually a sign of schizophrenia, so, girlfriend, see a shrink!!!<br />I can't imagine any girl going through 4 years of college and being as naïve as we are supposed to believe our heroine is.  Hell, the Amish aren't that naïve!!!<br /><br />I love myself a good mommy porn book.  I've read all the Nora Roberts books, Kathleen Woodiwiss, LaVyrle Spencer, and the like.  I've been reading them for 35 years.  This is the absolute worse book I've ever read.  It isn't even good enough to be called a Harlequin!!!<br /><br />Bad writing, poor or no plot, unresearched, poorly constructed characters, the list goes on and on about why you shouldn't bother reading (and especially buying) this book.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of that is allowing this book to continue to be so popular is the fact that the BDSM lifestyle is so `forbidden' that people are intrigued enough to think this is good literature.<br /><br />I want my $9.00 and 3 days back.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Movie was very funny and enjoyable. I think of ur 40 or 40 something you would really like this movie.  I liked it so much I watched it twice
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|awesome to play for all ages and lets you pick 2 modes. and I love it so much you should play it or buy it.ITS FREE!!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|historically accurate, dramatically superb. Daniel Day-Lewis a gives a tour de force performance and deserved the &#34;Best Actor&#34; award. Tommy Lee Jones also deserves high praise for his performance as well.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Generally, what makes a dramatic tv series really good in my eyes, those such as the BBC mysteries, &#34;George Gently,&#34; &#34;MI-5&#34;, and &#34;Cracker&#34;; or French series, such as &#34;Spiral&#34;; as well as Scandinavian shows, for example, &#34;The Eagle,&#34; &#34;Wallander&#34;, and &#34;The Protectors&#34;, is that the very best of them constantly confront the moral dilemma between absolute truth, how difficult it is to live an honest life with one's mate, and a hard adherence to the law, often measured by just plain expedience.  I don't think GW is as complex as some of the above, but there is an ongoing test of values and honesty, love lived and lost, naked, raw ambition, and intricate personal relationships.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Fun game. Helps to past the time. Takes too long to get good cards though. Another than that worth downloading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game for my kid he LOVES this game so much and I love it to !!!
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|A good story in terms of the suspense factor, however many people remember very well the way the actual event went down. I and many others think it strayed a little too far from the truth. That being said, it was a good movie for the entertainment  element.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I haven't played it. I read romance books all the. Plus I have other games to play. I'll try to get to it one of these days. Sorry.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I WELL NOT SAY IT WAS A GOOD OR BAD MOVIE YOU NEVER LET ME SEE IT AND STILL I HAD TO PAY FOR IT SO NO I HATE THE FACT I STILL HAVE TO DO THIS RATEING THING JUST SO I CAN STILL BY STUFF POOR MOVE ON MY PART
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just did a review on this game and it said to resubmit and I did. It still won't submit it.
0525958002|5.0|WELL IF THIS WELL MAKE YOU HAPPY I GOT IT FOR MY WIFE FOR HER BIRTHDAY SO THANK YOU AND GOOD BYE
B00846F1YW|4.0|I like seek and find word books and pictures. I usually  beat the game. I really like this kind of games.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|i really enjoy their games but this game isn't letting me install for some reason ... i even checked my gigabytes :'(
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game is my favorite game. I play it all the time on my kindle. I started playing it years ago on the computer, well not the same mahjong, one like it. Thanks for having it.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've been working out for over twenty years. I have researched hundreds of books, magazines, and various publications trying to find the most efficient and effective diet and exercise program for getting bigger and staying lean.  His philosophy and principles are easy to follow and parallel the conclusions I've made over my life.  It's not mind blowing or ground breaking but very effective.  I believe that heavy weights, compound exercises, and a clean diet are the answer.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I just did a review on this game. I'm thinking this one is my free game before I bought  it. It's my favorite game.
B0049U4INC|2.0|Once in a while I'll read a book by a deep thinker, futurist or whatever.  And occasionally, I see right away how/why this person is in the position they're in.  I've read a couple of Seth Godin's books and come away thinking this guy really has a lot unique and clear insights; things that would not be obvious to the average person.  So, while I believe there is more to life than marketing (even if you include marketing yourself) I can see why people buy Godin's books and hear him speak.  Kawasaki is another matter.  Enchantment, it turns out, is the realization that people will be loyal to, and pay a premium for products that not only work but are fun to use.  And, if you're the purveyor of this product or service, it pays to be likable, interested in others and so on.  If this strikes you as obvious, that's fine.  What scares me is the thought that there are people who don't already know this.<br /><br />Obvious as this stuff is, he doesn't always take his own advice.  He rightly suggests not to hit people over the head with big words but he's not content with being a promoter or pitch man.  He has to be an evangelist.  Is he on a mission from god?  If you're sufficiently enchanted you might think so.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I down loaded this and it will not play on my kindle. I love puzzles. When I had my big house, I would put regular puzzles together and glue them on cardboard and hung them up on the wall.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|As with so many other artists remaking the same Christmas songs over and over with their own version, this CD is the same, but I love Rod Stewart and the sound of his voice so I'm happy to listen to him singing these songs!!
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Since many have commented, I will only say that the emerging relationship between the bored handicapped lead and his contemporary helper was a thrill for someone who likes action, with a job deep in human suffering, and no interest in it in pleasure viewing.<br /><br />But this is not about suffering but a deeply positive story in the context of real limits.<br /><br />I only rented due to 5 stars, and so glad I did.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Almost couldn't put it down, love these kind of stories.  Wish amazon had the other book by this author.  Maybe they'll get it
B00466HM28|5.0|I bought this device on a whim because of the incredibly low price and my son was able to convert his laptop into a simple but powerful recording studio. great product.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|I thought &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; would give me some of his songs that I really enjoy.  What I like is the definite beat in the songs of his that I like.  This album must be from early in his career.  I'll have to try another album that is more recent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a well written post-apocalyptic series of stories. The premise is fascinating and somewhat scary. The characters are well developed to the point that the reader can feel she or he has met them. The unfolding of the story and the gradual revelations are plausible, they hold the reader's interest.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|If you enjoyed Homicide Life on the Streets, The Wire, and others of that genre you will love this. I am so glad I have an Amazon Prime membership which includes access to this show!  Michael Chiklis' portrayal as Vic Mackey is awesome! I watched the first two seasons when the series originally aired on TV and somehow I stopped watching; I suppose life just got in the way.  I'm really glad to have found this show again.  Amazon rocks!
B0029LCJJS|3.0|I like to believe I am an expert on the subject of Henry VIII, his wives, and his children. This show was kind of slow and didn't really grab my attention like I thought it would.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|For me, this was my introduction to the zombie genre, and I had not much of an idea of what to expect. Beforehand I found this zombie craze a bit &#34;silly&#34; perhaps, but somehow I decided to give it a try. After a few pages I was hooked. I found it fantastic, and chillingly realistic. It did not experience this as &#34;classical horror&#34; at all by the way. The zombie war has passed, and you are talking with the survivors. Recalling their memories (which obviously are chilling), you are reading the story from the comfort of knowing that all these people apparently made it, since they are being interviewed after the war. It absorbs you into this alternate reality, and when I looked up from the book after a few hours reading I found it hard to somehow not believe this had actually happened.
B004E547D8|4.0|Fun script and lots of fun.  Aging ex CIA operatives past their prime, but still a menace to the powers-that-be.  The John Malkovich character is a hoot--lost a lot of brain cells decades ago when the CIA was using him as a guinea pig for drug testing.  Enjoy the film, but don't look too hard for logic.  Good luck trying to determine how many bullets are used during the course of the movie!
B000ZN8036|5.0|I first saw this movie years ago and have been searching stores for it ever since. The story (based on real events) it amazing, heartbreaking, and inspiring to me. It makes me want to go on my own journey westward, though I don't intend to do things exactly the way he did (no spoilers here). I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|The series enters the 21st century with the the Bruce Willis character still stuck in the last (probably John McLain still has his 8-track collection).  Many of the stunts he pulls off would leave us mere mortals in the hospital for days, but he gets up, dusts himself off, and continues to battle the bad guys.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I bought it for my 6 yr. old daughter and she just loves it.  One of the best birthday presents EVER!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome story line (though getting a little dark), and zombies too. What more do you want? They may need to bring in a few more characters as the main characters are dying off.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Well done!  Wonderful message.  There were a few references that made it a little uncomfortable for watching with my 13 year old.  Parents may want to view it before sharing with children.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michaael Connelly writes an exvellent book.The Black Box again delivers  Hatty bosch's search for the 20 year agok serail killer. He writes so well. Many other authors in his genre do not have  as excllent a command of the  Engish language.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love the Hunger Games.Suzanne Collins is brilliant the book is so detailed,it is my favorite book.I can't wait to read it again and again
1451695195|3.0|Dr. Alexander repeatedly insists that his experience happened while in coma.  As repeatedly mentioned, it's his occupation as a neurosurgeon that sets his claims apart from the common peasants and bolsters his credibility. Make no mistake, there's no proof beyond his own assurance that his wonderful, beyond words transformative experience actually occurred while his brain was checked out.<br /><br />After marveling at the unbelievable complexities of the brain, he completely dismisses the notion that this all may have transpired during the re-awakening of his brain activity... because he was certain, and that he was anchored in Earth time during that period (what?!).  This is particularly curious because he tells of a realm with no linear time.  But yet still seems to travel aboard a butterfly wing, among other things that are decidedly time-centric journeys.<br /><br />Obviously he knows darned well that the brain is capable of producing timeless odysseys, as he was once a skeptic of such accounts, and is clearly aware of the similar spiritual claims from DMT users, for example. But he promptly reassures us that his neocortex was not functioning and therefore dismisses any brain chemistry explanation like that.  That, however, is the proof he fails to deliver: that his hyper-real experience was not simply created by the amazing brain while returning to consciousness.<br /><br />But to be fair, how could he? I'm sure he didn't name the book.  It's a good story, and just in time for Easter. Kudos on the NYT Best Seller! Maybe he did meet a blonde angel and ride a butterfly wing.  The universe is certainly more unusual than we'll ever know.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the movie so much I decided to get the soundtrack. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I immediately popped it into my cd player in my car. It's now one of my fave cds!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Most adults would probably review this badly but coming from a kid it's super funny<br />ROTFL lol lol lol lol
B009GYSRO2|4.0|Yes, I love this package. The LP pressing is gorgeous. Perhaps the package and price were a little exorbitant.  The hi-res download was nice, but an included CD and some in-depth notes would have rounded things out nicely.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I don't like the fact of having to wait so many minutes before getting more lives.  Actually thought of deleting the app b/c of this.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|You must have time and patience to get thru the maze.  Kept the grandsons busy most of Christmas day.  Perhaps we should have started with the Junior maze and worked our way up.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This CD is great! Most of the songs are written by Phillip Phillips himself. Those are the ones I like even more than what's out right now. But I guess if they are the ones promoting him, he needs to do their songs first. I can hardly wait until his own songs hit the top 20 on VH1. I'm sure they will! He's just that talented!
0812982622|5.0|WIth each page, each chapter, I felt I was now privy to forbidden secrets.  Not only about the country, or the leadership, but the very hearts and souls of the leading characters.  True or not, who knows.  It felt true and heartbreaking.  Not surprising it won the Pulitzer.
B0079XNWQA|4.0|He sings about what he stands for. Be kind to one another and don't abuse what we've been given on this glorious Earth. His word play is so delicious and to steal a line from Randy Jackson, &#34;He can sing the phone book.&#34;
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a worthy album.  The musicianship and the mix of instruments are unique.  Be sure to get the disc with the bonus tracks.  &#34;The Boxer&#34; has taken one of my favorite songs for decades and given it a whole new significance.  Douglas's Dobro takes it to a new level.
0385349947|5.0|I thought this book was really inspiring.  I related to the author and I think she did an excellent job of starting a real discussion about some important issues.  It was really interesting to hear her story.  I really connected with what she was saying, and because she talked about the times when she didn't necessarily make the most feminist choice, it made her more human and relatable.  That is, we can succeed, even if we don't get it right every single time.  I really appreciated the book.  I've recommended it to several people already.  Everyone seems to be talking about it around my office.
0525951652|5.0|This is my husband's favorite author and he cannot wait for the follow up to this book, and also any new books this author writes.  He has loaned his copy out to so many people who are amazed at the writer's skill.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I know there are a lot of die hard Bon Jovi fans that think the band has gone soft with their last few albums but I think they are staying true to themselves and their fans.  What About Now shows versatility and has some great ballads as well as optimistic anthems.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Jeremy Renner is great for this role and he did this movie justice. There is plenty of action to keep you interested throughout the entire movie and the plot was well portrayed. All the characters in this movie were well suited for their roles. I can hardly wait for more. If we're not having Matt Damon then Jeremy is the man to take over.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I had to get into the idea it was a interesting history lesson.  Day performance was great, I expected Sally Fields part to be more.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It's a good movie, just not great. The fact that it is a true story really makes this good. It was well portrayed by all the chosen actors and Ben Affleck does a great job in this movie. Ben is a fine actor and I have always followed his career.
B000FA675C|5.0|Hard to put down once you start.  I think almost anybody would enjoy this book. And I got it free. Life's good.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie was so well made. The only thing I have trouble with is, if there is not allot of action in a movie I have a tendency to fall asleep. This movie was just too long for me so yes, I caught a few z's. I have to give it four stars for the actors and their portrayal of the characters they played. Very well done and extremely well made. Cinematography was also A-1.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I liked the story and there are humorous parts. The poor guy just can't seem to get a break. But he keeps trying.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Don't waste your time on this movie unless you have seen it before look at the trailer it is absolutely awful and pointless. Peace!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I was very impressed that several of the stars who I don't think of as singers but did sign very well.
0802473156|5.0|It's an easy read and even my BF liked reading it. We figured out our languages and started communicating better to each other and I realized the ways he was telling me he loved me that weren't as obvious as words.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|totally cute and worth buying. Disney is doing great with this one. I love this movie. It is a really good movie.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|this book was my book clubs choice for the month of april-it was a good story<br />and since i recently started to be a children's advocate gave me a little insight into &#34;the system&#34; which we had discussed when i took the training course-i would especially recommend it for those who work with children caught up in the legal system
B005LAIHZY|5.0|totally cute and worth buying. Disney is doing great with this one. I love this movie. It is a really good movie.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|This is my favorite out of the series.  I felt that you really understood all the characters and their choices by the end. Great read.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This movies is so different it is amazing. You never know which way it is going to take you, it is great.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|you dont even have to be a fan of the franchise, it's awesome you have to watch all three now
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is such a great movie! We watched it in the theater twice and it was epic! I'm so glad to own it and be able to watch it at home all the time!
B003NTSBTC|5.0|This mind-bending masterpiece will keep you on the edge from start to finish.  Boasting an amazingly deep and talented cast, a brilliant plot, captivating dialogue, and stunning visuals of \\"Shutter Island\\", this film will leave you speechless.
B00000IBRI|5.0|ive never seen a movie by dario argento before now.ive read about has movies in fangoira and horrorhond mags.but when i saw phenomena i was blow a way this has to be one the best horror movies ive seen in a long time.a little back ground info on the movie.it was put out in 1984 on vhs as creepers 28 mins was cut from the movie.then anchor bay put it on dvd in 1999  uncut and uncensord for the first time.staring donald [halloween] pleasnce,a very young jennifer connelly.i am now a fan of dario argento.so if you like good horror movies this is must buy.until next time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Believe all the hype.  Hopeless is both beautiful and endearing.  I enjoyed the ride and it left me in a better place then when I started it.  The dialogue was witty and real.  Sky and Holder's story is what nightmares and dreams are made of.  Thank you Mrs. Hoover for the bringing them to life.
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is one of the better funny movies or mix cause it's sad funny serious. I would for sure recommend it.
B009KHCT94|5.0|Ok this movie was meant to be cheesy but damn its funny. Someone dropped some money into this movie and what did they get? An awesome movie! It gets better every time you think about it. I would never watch it again.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|On one of the songs you can clearly hear a misc. noise (mic. squeal) That is very noticeable. Otherwise great cd.

1582701709|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book!  Great read!  Inspirational and the Law of Attraction has CHANGED MY LIFE! I highly recommend you read this book!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Great Granddaughter loves these and has a huge collection of the Monster dolls lined up on her dresser.  The movies came fast and I appreciate the good service..
B00B935SUY|5.0|Absolutely amazing documentary that brings Sound City the recognition it deserves.  The history and stories involved with that place is captured in this documentary and makes you want to go out and buy every single song ever recorded there.  Makes me wish I grew up during that time!
B008LP8QE8|4.0|good book, could have been better if it had worked on iphone too.  It takes some time to download. but it is amazing that you dont need to carry 5 pound book in your bag all the time. You can just carry your tablet and read it any where and also highlight it with 4 different colors.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I loved this book.  I have been struggling with weight for a long time, and to date, only low carb diets produced results, but I always plateau then eventually give up. I already understood insulin resistance but this drove it home along with more much needed information. I changed my eating when I was done reading the book with renewed commitment and more knowledge and have blown past my usual plateau. I feel I now have the right knowledge to make it to my goal. If you have tried loosing weight and it just won't go, this book may be your answer too.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|Great book easy to understand and worked really well, I now can understand the proper way to use my kettlebells.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|this music take my heart. used to fan from befor bon jovi. especialy this albuｍ has simple merody ,<br />aridhinality,and powerful,tender for me. just 2nd track little like TAKE THAT(blitens pop idol)s merody i think.<br />but this one give enagy and encalegge to me everyday. ARIGATO BON JOVI!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband plays this every evening for hours.  He is so very pleased with its quickness and fun for all of us.
B004XZR63M|2.0|It's an old message wrapped up in a clever but false premise of his two fathers. Was looking for more of a business book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I work out each morning while watching this, I enjoy each and every episode! Please put season 3 on prime
0743486285|5.0|This book is sad & scarry. Why people think they have to do this to their bodies is beyond me. I guess they get bored & have all this money.
B002GHHHME|5.0|I enjoy Arnold's movies and needed this for my collection.  This was just another replacement for an old, used VHS tape.
0345803485|5.0|It's pretty racy. Not for everybody. I've read all 3 . The first one is the best. All the sex gets a little old after a while.
B002GOAH1A|5.0|I wore out my VHS tape of this movie. I know critics hated this flick, but I enjoy it.  Will Smith and Kevin Klein are great.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|But I was kinda disappointed that there weren't more extras. But It was still pretty great. I probably watched it 4 or 5 times within a week when I got it.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|Easy read inspiring stories. Cuban gives plenty of life examples that make it relatable to anyone. Funny comments. Recommended to college students and aspiring entrepreneurs.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I don't own Blu-ray but It's good to have incase I need it, and the digital one pauses every few seconds (most likely because my internet connection was slow when downloading it?) that's the only disappointing thing.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story of love and heart ache is told with a simple and musical beauty. It is not at all what I expected, bout the most pleasant of surprises.
B006X415GK|5.0|It's my second Monster High doll, and I just love the style of it. The stand wouldn't fit together all that well (the tall part and flat part) which was kind of annoying, but with some tinkering I dealt with it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I saw this at the theatre three times, and wanted this DVD when it came out. It is an amazing movie!!! Thank you for such prompt delivery! I have been enjoying it again.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Harold and Maude is a classic.  Ruth Gordon is beyond beautiful to watch.  The story like no other.  The soundtrack superb.  Nothing more to say.
0857680986|5.0|I've heard it said one should own nothing that is neither beautiful nor useful. This book is both. It's well-constructed and full of Loomis's excellent and instructive drawings. If drawing the human body, male and/or female is your goal, this is a great book from which to get started. Bust out your drawing tools and get to work.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Now that was fun, hard, challenging, but not impossible!  It looks so simple with not much going on, but this game just keeps amazing.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I owe so much to this movie.  It introduced me to the swingin' jazzy music I listen to today, and has forever imprinted its fantastic artistry in my mind.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I am younger in age and this book seems to be full of hope and mystery.  By far one of the top five favorite books I've read and I cannot wait to get the next.  My sister finished all of the series and hopes to read the one about Beatrice next.  She has told me the parents have a secret and I'm dying to know.
B003M6FGTE|3.0|The performances are quite good, but the characters are not believable and the story line is banal.  It is better than watching reruns that you have already seen several times.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found it fascinating to experience a remarkable trip like he had. I believe what he wrote and the sister he didn't know he had seems to prove it was real. I have recommended it to some friends. Ina McCulloch-Allen
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love Fun. This is a great album. Every song flows nicely into the next song. Why am I the One and Stars are two great songs, as well as We are young and Some Nights. I love all the songs.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I don't like musicals at all.  But I absolutely love The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  You can interact with this DVD.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son & husband have this game on their Kindles. They are constantly talking about what they have created and discussing strategies. They love it.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Easy to work with. Layout is nice, like the view. It is a nice app foe Android. Would recommend for download.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was by far the best book I have read in a long time. I'm going to c the movie tomorrow and I can't wait. I love all his books and will b starting another one probably tomorrow night.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It's long but it's good.  $30 for 3 hours of entertainment is a good investment to me.  If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings Movies you will enjoy this one too.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It's not a BAD book, but it is one of the worst Clancy books that I've read.  Maybe time to throw in the towel.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|My husband heard the Celtic Woman on television and really like the music.  He likes the CD, and plays it all the time.
B002361MLA|5.0|I enjoyed ready this and particularly liked the element of questions being asked and answered relevent to the content of the book.<br /><br />This helps pull elements of our unconcious being into reality in terms of what's going on in our heads!<br /><br />Recommended!
B00499NHLC|3.0|it is fast moving, have to concentrate on whats going on or you get lost....interesting story though.  not sure how believable though
B0063IH60K|4.0|This particular game is fun, relaxing and basically easy to use.  It is slightly inconvenient with the choice butttons situated the way they are, but all in all a good version.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Fast paced, exciting, loved the ending. Just plain excellent.  Recommend to any audience who likes lawyer drams with a twist.
0385523912|5.0|What a read!  It certainly helped me to understand the government and the poor people that live under the North Korean regime.  It should be essential reading for everyone.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I was somewhat bored with the bad choices made by the 100-Year Old Man. It was funny, the characters were quite different, but I found that there were repeated scenarios (cookie cutter prose) throughout. Hmm? Did repeating history make the book funny? The 100-Old Man recycled his life-experience with a care-free attitude . . . . . What Else Could Go Wrong . .  Since I've Made It This Far?  Do or Die.
B001JI72AI|5.0|This is a great movie!  A fairly accurate retelling of a very important moment in United States space history.  A must see.
B004SIP7NU|5.0|Great movie - glad I have it in my collection of DVD.  When kids come over, I put this movie in and it keeps them glued to the TV.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is my second favorite book. Don't be suspicious of the quality of it just because it is Erin Morgenstern's first book (I usually wonder how authors' first books are going to turn out). It is beautifully written, the vocabulary/wording used always flows and fits with the time period. When I was reading The Night Circus, I was enthralled in the story, and I really wish I could actually be a part of it! Morgenstern brings her characters and story to life in a very real way. I absolutely can't wait for her next book!<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book for high schoolers and up. I'm 21. It's kind of a romantic fantasy, but parts of it seem very down to earth, also.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Loved the movie so I had to have the soundtrack.  Great car songs when you are taking a long ride.  One problem, don't want to get out of the car!!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book is so interesting. It gives remarkable insight into life through the eyes of a young girl as she matures over the years. As she explores life, you are carried through her growth, both mental and physical, from a girl to a young women. The reader will be amazed at the responsibilities that are placed upon her shoulders and how she manages to deal with adversity. Women, reading this book, will be able to see themselves as they grew and matured bringing both sadness and smiles. I highly recommend this book.
B000083E79|5.0|Great gift for Christmas.  Who doesn't like Cher.  All of her songs that  everyone loves .  Will buy more of Cher.  She is priceless.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is a great light read, an escape after a stressful day.  Storyline is a bit predicable, of course with a happy ending, but it did make me smile.  Some interesting insights into relationships and facing ones fears.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Glad I waited for this more complete soundtrack!  We love it!  Would have liked a solid case instead of the flimsy cardboard one it came in...but we're rating the soundtrack and not the packaging.  =)
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Not just a few good songs but a complete album. I love the raw sound, feels like real rock. I haven't heard an album like this in a while.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Great book! Easy to read with great ideas for improving your success. Highly recommend for anyone trying to develop life habits.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie makes you keep thinking for days after watching it. Beautiful photography. Lovely scenes. Being all my life in America and only knowing this life, I enjoyed seeing how a young child would be if seeking his truth in India. Funny family scenes, humor managed in even such a terrible situation.
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|Great songs waited long time for this one to come out. Poco been making quality music for years. Definite buy for lovers of classic country rock and roll
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My seven year old loves it. Easy enough for him and the pets are super cute. I even play it sometimes when he isn't looking ;)
B0060MYM7O|5.0|First is does not follow the books in some impotent parts so that may upset some purists. As a work of art it holds together well. The Game of Thrones presents a &#34;what it is like&#34; view of a Medieval culture. The second season seems to be more comfortable with itself and flows more smoothly between sections.
B004XZR63M|5.0|It expanded my perspectives on not only wealth but life in general. I will definitely apply all the knowledge I've gained from this book into my life
B009NYF2ES|2.0|When I saw the pictures of the product I saw a photo of Liza on the disk and I got a plain black one with just CABARET written on it (maybe it's because I ordered it from Mexico, third world, we don't know any better, you know?)<br /><br />Why in hell did they use a crummy design of a great photo for the cover? It doesn't even look like Liza and we all know the photo from where it was taken !<br /><br />(Again) Why in hell did they use a different lettering for the title when the original typo is SOOOOOOOO original, now it looks like the name of just any other musical!<br /><br />The sound, particularly during the songs hasn't been fixed since the bad output of the DVD. In the Money Song one can not hear Liza and half the instruments are muffled<br /><br />It's got a couple more extras than the DVD but it's a pain in the neck to play them all, after each tidbit they return you to the menu<br /><br />The info written in the booklet doesn't offer anything new to a bonafide fan<br /><br />Color saturation of the movie is OK and there are good pictures in the booklet, but that is all I can say positive about this packaging of the 40th anniversary of the film that ranks No. 5 in the American Film Institute's list of best musicals!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just discovered this show and watched all 3 seasons in 2 weeks, It's fabulous, can't wait for the next season!!
B000062TU1|5.0|I have purchased the entire collection of Harry Potter.  All actors and actresses are top notch.  My only upset, when Dumbledore was later replaced by a new actor.  I am loyal.  This change upset me.  I do not know why the change in actor was necessary and I did accept the new actor who was exceptional in every form of his work, however, I personally feel directors should maintain consistency amoung the character stream so prevent viewer memory as this one.  This is my only complaint.  The change in actor of Dumbledore, even though both actors were exceptional.  I simply appreciate consistency when in today's time, there is so little of it.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|One of those shows where you can understand it at two levels: wow, this is a cool crime show AND wow, this intellectually and stylistically amazing! Not for the queasy...surprised some of the scenes made it onto standard (i.e., not cable) TV.
B00005JMAH|5.0|All Harry Potter DVD's are wonderfully made and speak to the whimzy side in us all!  I have purchased the entire collection.  All actors and actresses are top notch in this collection,
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|I thought this would be a comedy, but it was sad, depressing, and the story was awful.  Very disjointed and little content.  I wouldn't recommend this movie.  I love Paul Rudd, but this was just bad.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Bought this for my grands after my husband and I watched it on Netflix .i highly recommend this film. It is not only entertaining but teaches goo godly principals and shows how a man  of principal should live.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I am very impressed with my new Seiko SSC017. The order was processed,shipped and received promptly. I bought this watch to replace the one that was lost when I was robbed at a local grocery store. My original watch was a Pulsar Diver quartz. my wife gave it to me for Christmas 32 years ago. With the exception of changing the battery 4 times, it kept accurate time and still had the original seal in it. I really thought that I would be buried with that watch. In replacing that watch I looked no further than another Seiko product. I'm hooked for life and Amazon is the best place to get it.

B0029F21BA|5.0|Clint Eastwood, who directed this film, proves he is one of our best directors, and the cast representing families in a working class Connecticut town is excellent. There are many twists and turns and local color, which help us get to know the actors and the town well enough to care about the resolution of the case. Highly recommended.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I'm not a fan of musicals but I've always loved a cappella, and the singing in this movie was great. The acting was decent and Rebel Wilson was hilarious as usual.
B004WMKSH2|2.0|Our whole family loves Harry Potter. My 8-year-old has read the books half a dozen times, and regularly quotes them. But unlike any other Amazon movie we have watched, when there wasn't time to finish it before bedtime, there was no muttering or complaint. The next days passed without any request to finish it.<br /><br />The effects are well done, which is why it gets 2 stars.<br /><br />The movie doesn't tell a story, but instead recounts some scenes from the book, without a clear sense of what they mean, and many of the scenes shown are not in the book at all. Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent after Ron leaves them??? Ron wanting to kill Dolohov in the coffee shop, once is immobilized?<br /><br />Like me, anyone who has read the books with pleasure, and watched all the preceding movies, is probably going to watch this one, but I don't recommend it.

1452101248|5.0|I'm not a vegetarian, but I always feel I could use some more fun, yummy & interesting vegetarian recipes. This book is great. Seriously, every single recipe is fabulous. Instructions are easy to follow and Ottolenghi has some great commentary on many of the dishes, also providing wonderful ideas of other dishes to pare with them.<br />Many dishes are simple, yet with complex flavor outcomes, and rather hearty.<br />I couldn't be happy with this book. Easily the cookbook I have the most pages dog-eared in.
B0040I09RM|4.0|It took a few episodes to get into the show but the last 4 made the season.  I recommend it.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Quell is okay but it is not the best game in the app store.<br />I would rather play something like tempel run or where's. my Perry.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|DL'd this game on my last phone and the Ads' were always there but not overwhelming. Redownloaded when I got a new phone and after every single board there is a freaking Ad and then when you close the Ad it sends you to an Ad page before you can start the next board. Personally love the game and I understand it's free, but I already uninstalled it because of the Ads.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The technical parts of this movie were good.  The historical accuracy remains in doubt.  This was just another Hollywood attempt to depict the humanity of Lincoln's presidency. How do we know for sure, that Lincoln manipulated those two soldiers into repeating his speech which gave them the courage to proceed into battle.  Perhaps, Hollywood could use a footnote flash to show where they get this so called non-fiction.
B00005T30L|5.0|In a world where everything changes and nothing ever stays the same, Enid, the main character of Ghost World, struggles to maintain a sense of identity while still remaining an individual.  Enid and her friend Rebecca have just graduated high school and they are expected to be a certain way and to do certain things.  While Rebecca falls seamlessly into the complacent category of conformity, Enid is constantly plagued with the individualism that has kept her from the mainstream her entire life.  However, her rebellion will lead her to choices that, perhaps for her, were not the best to be made and will lead her down a path of abandonment, a feeling that most teenagers and young adults face around this crucial time of change.<br /><br />Enid befriends a middle-aged man named Seymour who seems just as lonely as she.  Enid finds him interesting and begins to hang around him which leads to a multitude of humorous exchanges.  But when Seymour also moves on with his life, the determined Enid who wishes to remain unchanged, is forced yet again to pursue other routes of individuality, driving her down the unknown road of the future.<br /><br />Based off of the graphic novel, Ghost World focuses on the teenager and young adult during the tumultuous time where mandatory education falters and critical life choices arise.  Everything, from people to ideas, become hazy and indeterminate, like the ether of ghosts.  People, places, and things drift out of existence and into the dim past as everyone moves forward.  Those, like Enid, who seem to revolt against the very idea of moving forward are stuck in a limbo situation where confusion and loneliness dwell.  Despite this grim outlook, we tend to love Enid and her eccentric nature and hope that she can find some stability in her life.<br /><br />Despite the described message, the movie is lighthearted, witty, and fun.  It does not try to take itself too seriously for fear of drifting too far into the drama category and abandoning the essential comic relief.  It also should be mentioned that the movie isn't your typical kind of film.  Characters enter and disappear, even though it feels like they should have a larger role (e.g. Josh), because the movie focuses on Enid's life and the idea that permanence is not an option.  Knowing this, the movie is well made and a great addition to anyone's collection.e essential comic relief.  It also should be mentioned that the movie isn't your typical kind of film.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Maybe I went into this movie with my expectations to high. After all the hype I was expecting more. The acting was good, not as good as I had heard, but good none the less. The story was good although at times it was a little fuzzy with the facts. I also think a movie titled &#34;Lincoln&#34; should have been more about Lincoln. I think a more appropriate title would have been &#34;The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States&#34; as that is what it is actually about.

B00BKBCF38|4.0|I don't think these guys are actually any more Satanic than Halloween is.  Overall, this album is just loads of fun with lots of over-the-top \\"evil\\".  The music is very well done, with very little filler.  This album did not grab me as immediately as Opus did, but after listening to it a couple of times, I think that it's just as good, and in some ways, better because the quality is more consistent and the music is more varied.

Come on, you know you want too... it's only a buck!

Andreia was a self-centered pain, she new she didn't deserv Zombie time and shot herself.  The show is good.  It gets serious, but back off into Zombies Fun Time so it is not too serious or boring.  The Zombies came, they saw, they ate everbody.  These days the lving kill more than the Zombies.

B009S33I68|5.0|As I stay above....much of the book are stories of individual grunts as they faced a determined enemy in force for the fist time.  However what I liked was that the author (a life time military man) tied the grunts reality on the ground with the continued policy error's of our top military command and politic leaders.  Their error's clearly put our guys in greater harms way then necessary.  America's inability to accept that we were at war, hold their leader accountable and commit according is of course part of the tragedy of Vietnam.<br />Regarding Iraq & Afghanistan...there were some lessons learned however I wonder if it is all that different in how politic's of the situation and our Military/Industrial complex again did what was good for them and not for the &#34;boys&#34; on the ground.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am giving the Author 4 stars, cause the Author is very creative with twists, as with her other books, but this story is too disturbing for my taste.  I like mysteries and twists, but these characters are too much for me.  If I had to grade the character's substance I would grade 2 stars.

And I had some sleepless nights which was crazy to me at the time.... How could a book mess with my head to such an extent?!  Such a mix of characters, emotions, coincidences, and tragedy.  But at the end of the day, this was a page-turner.  May not be the best book for moms though.  Might be too scary.

B006RXQ3GO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies- even though it's your standard early 90s movie, I just think Julia Roberts shines in this role. While it may romanticize prostitution, the classic early-90s clothes and music are entertaining and who doesn't love a fictionalized love story that would never actually work in real life?

B0055EDCGU|4.0|This album is my first taste of Trivium. This band is on the same label, Roadrunner Records, as some bands I listen to such as Dream Theater and DragonForce and I discovered Trivium by chance of picking a random band off of the label's list of artists. I chose a great band and a great album to hear! I've since purchased other albums by Trivium, but it's come time to review this album. Matt and Corey are just brutal on the guitars! They are shredding so much on this album and easily stand up to other great guitar duos like Maiden and Megadeth. From what I can hear, the bass is fantastic as well and the drums are superb!<br />Before I get into reviewing this album, I want to address something other reviewers have said about this band: Their music is good, their albums are good, but they sound 10 times better live. Why? Because they have more energy, intensity and better vocals when they perform live. Just putting that out there. If you like the record, check them out live, they are AMAZING!<br /><br />The Music:<br />1. Capsizing the Sea- This is just synth/drum/guitar intro to In Waves. A good intro too, very driving.<br /><br />2. In Waves- This song starts off with Matt screaming his head off and an intense driving thrash type riff. Then it quickly turns into a melodic rocker and shows off that Matt can indeed sing too. One thing to note about this song is it may sound repetitive, but it is BRILLIANT! I've never heard another song like this! It isn't structured like most songs at all. Instead of verses and choruses, it's more like Part A, Part B, Part A Part B Part C, etc. Then it gets to an absolutely amazing guitar solo section. Great stuff going on all throughout the song :D I'm impressed! The vocals, drums, and guitars are what stand out, but mainly the drums for me since I play drums! This song is definitely fresh and original. Never heard anything like it at all!<br /><br />3. Inception of the End- This one starts off with an intense drive and then pounds youlike there's no tomorrow! Lots of great drum work going on here, great guitar stuff, and I like the vocals of this one a lot as well. I also really love the triplet feel of it. Matt's voice also is a unique voice among the other bands I listen to. He has a much lower, resonant voice than most of the bands I listen to. And this band also adds a progressive edge to the song too. I'm a progressive metal fan and this song has some progression in the middle instrumental passage. Very technically complex and cool song. I'm definitely a fan of this one.<br /><br />4. Dusk Dismantled- This one doesn't rank too high on my list. Musically it's great and technical, but I'm not too keen on it. When they play this one live, it sounds GREAT!!! Really, live, this song is amazing, but on here, I kinda find it not that cool. But that's just me I guess.<br /><br />5. Watch the World Burn- I really like this one. The drums have a really cool vibe going on and the guitars are heavy as ever! And I can kinda hear the bass lines and this song is full of guitar melody and complex bass lines! On top of all that, the vocals are just excellent and I like listening to this one! The song just has a good driving force and great things going on! The chorus is also loads of fun to sing along to! The only other bands I've heard that has this much guitar melody are In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Iron Maiden. This band really knows how to craft melodies like the best of them. Great showcasing of skill here!<br /><br />6. Black- This song is more of a thrashy song and starts off in your face. Matt's voice booms over the driving storm of guitars and drums. This one is definitely one to start a mosh pit to. The technical skills of this band are absolutely incredible. This band can definitely stand up to Dream Theater in terms of being technical and making great, awesome sounding  songs!<br /><br />7. A Skyline's Severance- This song starts off really cool and epicly, but sadly it turns into a disappointment like Dusk Dismantled. I just don't like it that much. It would probably sound amazing live, but again, this band seems to not sound as good on record as they do live.<br /><br />8. Built to Fall- So what if this is a more radio-oriented single? This one still has the intensity of the other songs and this one has a killer guitar part! I find this song along with the title track to be one of the album's better songs! The lyrics are very well done and I can hear the emotion in Matt's voice on this one! He sings this one with such passion and the band seems to be into this one as well. In Waves and Inception of the End had emotion and then all the songs between those two and this one were more technical with some emotion, but they were still good. This one is better than those technical tracks though because it's still technical, but you can hear the emotion in not only Matt's voice, but Corey's lead parts have much emotion to them as well. Great song. I love this one very much!<br /><br />9. Caustic Are the Ties That Bind- This is THE BEST SONG on the entire album! Hands down BEST song! This one is so many things at once!!! It's emotional, it's technical, it's progressive, it's straightforward, it's heavy, it's soft, it's angry, it's hopeful, and so much more! It just starts off with a powerful driving guitar part and such a melody and it sucks you in and really makes you want to headbang and at the same time it just fills you with this epic emotion! Then after 2 verses/choruses, it just softens up and turns into a soft, melodic Dream Theater type song. However, this is much better than Dream Theater! There is so much emotion in the lyrics, there is a drive in the music, there is such harmony in the band, everything has it's place and the solos on here, while technical just have so much energy, emotion, and gusto. This song is the one people will be talking about years from now. This is a metal anthem that everyone will know! Needless to say, I love this song! The middle passage gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. It's soft, melodic, and emotional, yet it retains a driving beat and flame that keeps it metal. So many bands (metal and non metal) try to make a song with emotion and only a few succeed. This one does more than succeed, it has raised the bar! If you choose one song to hear off this album, make it this one!<br /><br />10. Forsake Not the Dream- This one doesn't match the previous one, however, it's still a really good song! It too has emotion going through all of the band and all the instruments as well as the vocals have an emotional harmony that makes it more fun to listen too as well as give it more focus and strength. The melodies in this song and the vocals both have an intensity that few other bands can match. On this song, Corey has proven that he is the best modern lead guitarist in metal! This guy is shredding throughout the song and he also puts on a great solo later on in the song! I'm impressed by this song's energy and strength. At first, I wasn't even interested in this song because it wasn't nearly as good as the previous track, but after a while, I realized that it is almost as good as the previous track, but In Waves and Built to Fall are slightly better than it as well. However, these four songs are hands down the best of this album!<br /><br />11. Chaos Reigns- I have to say that the opening riff and the beat are good, but this one is probably the worst song on the album. It's just uninteresting to listen to sadly. Not a good song in my opinion.<br /><br />12. All of These Yesterdays- This is the closest thing on the album to a ballad. It's a nice soft slow song to end the album on a nice note. This one does show a very powerful shot of the band. They sound somber, yet strong playing this. This one may not rock like the others on this album, but it does have a great set of lyrics, amazing music, and great vocals! Awesome song!<br /><br />13. Leaving This World Behind- A boring outro to thealbum. Not much.<br /><br />Overall this album is worth buying! It's very well written and it's full of great metal anthems that will be around for a long time! Rock on! \m/ \m/

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Wreck-It-Ralph is entertaining from start to finish.  My 15 year old dragged us to the movie and then we couldn't wait to purchase it!
B00003A9QI|5.0|I have been looking for the music the state of Michigan plays in the back ground of its advertising for a long time. I finally heard the music on a classical radio station and started looking for the cd. I found it on Amazon. Completely satisfied with the service from Amazon.Great relaxing music!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Well was having fun with the game till now won't let me pass the first level on the desert world I die without even touching game
1400069807|5.0|Well written, kept my attention and validated the facts quickly without excess verbage.  I would certainly entertain reading other books written by Michael Moss.
B00190N4E4|5.0|This movie was a great tale of a great man. Ben Kingsley did a wonderful job displaying the warmth, kindness of this great man!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Why 4 stars?<br />1. Some episodes are very scary<br />2. The overall season is like a soap-opera with ghosts<br />3. Some episodes you walk away feeling dirty for watching, but you're still wanting to know what will happen next<br />4. Some of the characters themselves may get a bit on your nerves after a while, but the acting is great.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love DeMille and this one was good but not as good as the one that took place just before 9/11 and also &#34;starred&#34; John Corey and his wife.  The latter was one of my all time favorite reads.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Fun movie and just what you expect in terms of how the plot develops, but on the other hand it is very cute and has some good lines so not brilliant but very good.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|The ending was way too ambiguous.  In fact I was wondering if I'd missed some pages.  Not up to his usual standards.
B00AFEY354|5.0|i have no idea why this did not win anything this was the best movie of the year. emma is gorg as always and what more can you ask for??
B008XG1X18|3.0|Don't really use it much, takes to much time.  Maybe after I retire I'll use it more.<br />Did allow me to see my friends interests.
B001B51B9M|5.0|It's a classic, and for good reason.  Great characters, great character actors, catchy songs... what's not to like?  You'll find yourself singing along and enjoying it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Anxious to get into book two.  Really enjoyed all the detail and really getting to know all the characters.  Had alittle trouble keeping them all straight but just made it more interesting.
B007V4530A|4.0|An easy quick read packed full of practical advice.  Don't get hung up on the title, the principals outlined can be applied to any public speaking or for that matter even private conversations.  The author uses examples from TED talks to illustrate his points.  I purchased the kindle version.  It would have been nice if the examples used were linked to the actual TED talks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app to give me an idea of how much time is left on my kindle brilliant highly recommended

B00BD2DRHW|1.0|(w/ apologies to Monsters v Aliens)<br /><br />Why in the world does this app need full internet access?!  You people can be dumb enough to install it if you want to. But the only reason I know of for an app to have full internet access is to steal your personal info or to push ads onto your phone.<br /><br />If you continue to buy these apps, the devs will continue to abuse users.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My son love this. The last time I checked, the Who was a band, but different strokes. The only problem is that the cap is not tight enough and slips off.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|a quick read and thought provoking we used this for the beginning of a discussion club dinner evening - good conversation starter.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Does not offer me what I'm looking for in a weather site. Needs greater view of current weather and forecast.
B008602KQI|5.0|Had read the books and enjoyed them so much wished to see how the movie was.  The movie followed the book pretty much and was exciting as well.
B002MGOWH2|5.0|This movie shows the incredible inhumanity that human beings have visited on other human beings for reasons that defy logic. It shows how arbitrary decisions and circumstances can decide life or death. The acting was superior and the scenes made you feel like you were in the Polish Ghettos. Whether it was Germany or Rwanda, the incredible inhumanity that people visit on others based on ethnic or religious differences is stunning and chilling.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting with a great plot. What more do you need. There are always new twists and nothing seems outlandish enough to take you out of the show.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Good length, good puzzles, great for the price.  I would recommend to my friends to play.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Purchased this set for my 12 year old granddaughter as I knew her parents had no interest.  Read all three books, as did my husband, in an effort to facilitate conversations with an adolescent. Great effort to recreate the story when transferred to film media. It was by far her favorite Christmas present and she has watched in in both formats to the point of &#34;wearing it out.&#34;  She can watch it using the blu ray player, and when on her own, she uses her computer and the digital copy - great idea!!!!!  Though she (like most young people) can see it many times over, the rest of us don't need to, so the digital copy spares us the &#34;multi-view&#34; nightmare.  Would not purchase blu ray items if it was not a special film as they are expensive, but to please a young person to such a great degree, made it worth every penny.
B0044JTISS|5.0|I can see why everyone says this is Simon and Garfunkel's best work yet. It really is. There is not a bad song on the album. Highly recommend it. Best song on there is  &#34;El Condor Pasa&#34;. Its too bad they didn't make anymore albums after this. Would have loved to see the direction the would have gone in musically.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|As a civil war historian, I was curious to see how this film was going to play out. I think this country has turned the Romantic Notion of Lincoln into myth, and has not seriously engaged all his political maneuverings, idiosyncrasies, and suppression of constitutional rights. He did some great things, do not get me wrong, but he also had a dark side that most people don't want to talk about. Combined with that, modern American culture (Hollywood in particular) loves to denigrate and stereotype the South as redneck racists and whatnot. So, I was curious to see how fair and balanced historically this film would be. There have been many numerous historical critiques of this film. There are well documented reviews out there that some of this film is sheer fiction. I won't go into that. I understand the need for creative license for the sake of telling the story.<br /><br />Factual inaccuracies aside, I found the film interesting. The portrayal of Lincoln as a human being, particularly his family life with a wife who had all sorts of behavior and mental problems is worth watching. We often want to view Lincoln as this knight in shining armor or something, and he was a man like any other man. I don't think they got his accent right. He would have had a very crude, Kentucky backwoods accent that was often described as &#34;nasally&#34; and high pitched. Day Lewis portrays him as a much more regal, deep voice, which I found odd, but that's just casting. I did appreciate the way Day Lewis tried to portray Lincoln as a storyteller that would constantly tell these yarns and off color anecdotes that often drove people crazy about him. That is accurate. I was somewhat unhappy that the casting could not find a Southerner (what few there were actually in the film) with an actual Southern accent. This is typical of Hollywood. But this film is more about the North, so that is just a side irritation.<br /><br />Again, it is worth watching, though I think it ran a bit long (almost 2.5 hours). It got bogged down a bit in a few places and could have used a bit more editing. I felt there were some scenes that could have been cut that were not really in keeping with the actual plot.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well, if you are looking for free stuff, there isn't. But this is AWESOME! Can't wait for the update; maybe there are going to be spawn eggs, and that would be cool. However, I do have a hatred for slow updates, but overall, MINECRAFT IS AWESOME!
B00BESCJII|5.0|Okay I fully admit if I wasn't married I would of passed on this just because I'm 40 and the title has \\"Wallflower\\" in it. Yeah, no car chases in THAT movie. But, my wife was insistent so I maned-up and sat down to watch this movie while I recorded a baseball game.<br /><br />To my surprise, I loved this movie. It reminded me of some of the movies I watched in the 1980's like \\"Breakfast Club\\" or \\"Sixteen Candles\\" where you cared about the characters. You really do feel for the main character as he struggles to fit in starting High School. He's had to overcome adversity and starting High School and it's pressures to make friends and be relevant really added to his angst and you smiled, laughed and rooted for him as he made friends and was there for those around him as they were for him.<br /><br />Thank God I didn't get misty-eyed afterwards or I'd have to check the date on my man card. But between you and me, I loved this film and recommend it.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|A good movie for young kids and teens. Great acts and effects. It was a little slow to watch to the end.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry is an okay character but he's no Lucas Davenport (John Sanford Prey series).  Harry is not as interesting or as exciting a main character as some of the other &#34;leading men&#34; in novels by John Sandford and Lee Childs.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint does it better than anyone in finding good plots and matching actors to the characters they play. Enjoyed it to the end

B005USZML4|4.0|It was humurous and interesting, I don't normally read books about kids, but this book has all the grace and interest of a Grisham book.  Really enjoyed this book and read two others in the series.  Easy read!
B007C3TVNA|4.0|DON'T, whatever you do, read any summaries of this movie's plot. Beware of spoilers: I feel sorry for whoever reads any outline before seeing this film.<br /><br />It's made to be seen free of such summaries, as a whodunit where you're clueless and stay that way for its first half hour, possibly longer, while trying to piece together what's going on. Half the joy's in this gradualism, with the clues nicely laid out via a well-chosen collection of odd, sometimes near-incoherent scenes. Despite that mental fog, the direction also manages to get across quite clearly that it will dissipate, as well as that this is no surreal plot but a set of bizarre circumstances warranting the befuddlement, since it fits the plot perfectly.<br /><br />Much about this film is also cringe-worthy, yet it's never a tawdry emotional grab. A horror movie as much as a psychological thriller, it raises issues about nature vs nurture, and whether something beyond parental incapacity makes us tick. No simple answer emerges, so the unfolding is the nub.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton's acting is top-rate, her androgyny perfectly fitting this particular part: in several scenes it compounds the requisite discomfort. She was reportedly nervous about playing a mother without being one. Yet even her way of holding the infant alone speaks volumes, contributing to the visceral impact. Everyone else in the cast is also at least good, albeit never on her level.<br /><br />Ezra Miller, as Kevin, is clearly dealt the weakest hand: scant dialogue and just growling try to pass for character. Surely better could have been scripted for this part, and the director might have considered something subtle, for balance. John C. Reilly, as Swinton's go-with-the-flow husband, is the movie's second weakness. His laconic character verges on absence, and one teeters between considering such obtuseness possible, however implausible, and outright disbelief.<br /><br />Together with Swinton, most aspects of the direction and photography/art direction call for special mention, with the techniques to unravel the plot being especially intriguing. One of those rare films that may send you back to the source novel (by Lionel Shriver) to fill in the lost detail and for another look at the artefact in its original form. It got a Palme d'Or nomination for best film at Cannes, and Tilda Swinton was up for a best actress Golden Globe award. Both were well deserved.<br /><br />Despite the mentioned flaws, well recommended.tography/art direction call for special mention, with the techniques to unravel the plot being especially intriguing.

B00B2QG3K2|1.0|I have been a HUGE Paramore fan for years now. Rarely is there a Paramore song that I don't like or can't at least listen to. When I heard about this album I was so freaking excited because they haven't put out any new music in years. I thought about all the amazing new songs I could add to my collection. When I started listening to this album, I found myself skipping song after song, waiting to get to one that would be a hit for me...but that moment NEVER came. I can think of so many amazing songs from their past they've done like \\"I Caught Myself\\" and \\"My Heart\\", none of which on this album even come close to touching. There are no really good songs on here in my opinion. I didn't find one single song I actually enjoyed trying to sit through entirely. They have changed their sound/music style. I know that artists want to progress and grow but this feels like regression for them. They were already at the height of their game in the past, so I expected this album to be phenomenal but it was totally disappointing. I am really bummed out about this. Oh well, guess I'll back to listening to the OLD Paramore.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Like the CD a lot, many songs have a strong connection with my life once upon a time.  Great show and good music -
B009IUH1N2|2.0|As can be expected with this type of game, there is very little variety. Graphics were unimpressive. I turned off the sound. It got annoying.
B008K8U13K|5.0|Awesome game and it is worthy of being part 4.  Buy it now!  Its fun and takes you back to the classic 2D.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game is fun. The graphics are pretty. The music is quite good.<br />One problem I encountered was in controls. You are required to multitap. Either my phone doesn't handle that well, or the app doesn't interface properly with my phone. It gets very frustrating having to tap repeatedly just to move to the next level.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked the past that gets uncovered and they get married and have kids.if there was hope for Christian than there are hope for others.a good read.
B00BF11STU|4.0|It was a good watch. It's a bit too long , it'd have better with more details or shorter length.
0099570297|2.0|It took a long time to get to me it took almost a month. Maybe be a little more conscience of how long it takes to get to the buyer
B00C0NFMKI|3.0|While Paramore has always been a punk-pop band, their previous albums definitely landed on the punk side of things, which is what I loved about them. Sadly, this album is more pop than rock. I feel like guitars might as well be absent throughout this album. It almost feels like a Haley Williams solo album. Not terrible, but not memorable either.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yet another amazing book in the series. It keeps you flipping the pages until there are no more. The detail is amazing and the characters are well thought out.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game kept my interest over several hours.  I found it challenging yet not so difficult as to make it frustrating.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I am a big fan of batman and this is definitely a great movie. It is action-packed and full of entertainment.

B002R5QPRI|5.0|Whitney Houston's singing was mesmerizing.  I never tire of hearing the great sound track.  The screenplay was good, suspenseful, well-acted, and believable.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Big fan of all the Tolkien books and movies!  What else is necessary?? The only downer is that we have to wait for the rest of the series!!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It's a great story about an interesting situation. Like all books that are great, I wish it were longer and I had made my friends read it so I could talk about it with them!
B00AEBB932|5.0|One great movie and one of the best westerns of all time, especially when you consider that it was made on location (check out the scenery)  60 years ago. This is Alan Ladd's signature movie, the fight scene at the end is one of the best ever and when Brandon DeWilde yells out---- Shane, Shane, Come back Shane you have one of the iconic movie scenes and dialog ever
B00000JLWW|5.0|I was only seven years old when the movie came out and I am glad that I can finally own it.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you enjoyed The 4-Hour Work Week or The 4-Hour Body, you will like this one as well. If not, I still think you will like it. Provides simple followable advice that anyone can use. Even if your not that into cooking, the methods it covers can be applied to nearly anything and Ferriss provides many examples.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|These will serve as a great reminder of our past on our wedding cake! I loved playing with legos growing up!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I was looking for a watch that I could wear at work when I stumbled upon this 21 Jewel automatic watch. Simple interface and low profile. Canvas strap will go eventually but luckily they make replacements. Comfortable and plenty of watch for the price.!
0062014102|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting and thought provoking.  Even if not every detail is correct (see other reviews), it doesn't change the fact that many outstanding scientists share much of Mr Talbot's perspective.  So sad that he died so young.  Would have enjoyed reading more from him.

0061124265|5.0|Loved this book.  Mr. Coelho has wowed me once again with his work. This book intrigues you to take a closer look at what society claims is insanity. Leaving you with the conclusion that we are all, in our own respect, mad.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I don't even know where to start. When I first heard Fiona it was on Pandora with her hit criminal. I then came across Extraordinary Machine for cheap here on amazon so I picked it up. I was pleasantly surprised and liked it. My main musical consumption is Metal(all kinds/eras) and Hip-Hop (underground), so it's really exciting when I come across an artist I enjoy that doesn't fit somewhere in those genres. Then I heard When the Pawn... and I figured Pawn had to be Fiona's best work, I couldn't imagine it being surpassed. Then along came The Idler wheel... and blew me away. Every song is necessary and 5 stars for me. I absolutely loved the &#34;stripped down&#34; and &#34;bare bones&#34; approach Fionna took with this one and now it ranks as one of my all time favorite albums, you know up there with LPG's &#34;Earthworm&#34;, Metallica's &#34;...And justice for all&#34;, Project 86's &#34;Rival Factions&#34; and Deftones' &#34;Adrenaline&#34;, Sentinel Beast's &#34;Depths of Death&#34;, Iron Maidens' &#34;Power Slave&#34; ect...
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It is simply the story of how Psycho was made.  No plot twist and you don't get involved with the characters
0345803485|5.0|I bought &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; simply because everyone was talking about it. Once I got into the  book, I realized why. Wow, erotic and captivating. Christian Grey is the perfect guy, the guy we all wish (maybe) we could be -- handsome, rich, talented in business, and a complete whacko when it comes to his sex life. But in the next two books (it's a trilogy) everything fits neatly into place and hero and heroine marry, have kids, and become (sort of) your typical suburban couple. However, the erotic ride that gets them there is worth time and money invested in the series.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Typical action adventure.  Car chases and fights.  Little plot development or twist.  But a good escape movie and will do what all other movies of this type do for you.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie held my attention even though there was a lot of dialogue.  All of the characters were interesting and each contributed the good quality of the story.  The overall emotional experience for me was an intense anticipation and an intense sadness at times.  Whenever a movie can provoke that kind of emotion in my movie watching experience, the movie actually becomes memorable!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Highly entertaing movie.Fast paced.The extended cut better filled out the plot.The lead character is riveting to watch.All and all I highly recommend it.
0393312836|5.0|i have seen the movie so many times i had to read the book.  took me a couple of chapters to get through the slang of the book then i t was cake.  loved it and recommend it to anyone.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Although I don't think I missed any of the series when it aired on TV I still wanted to see them all again. Love Harvey & Mike & I hope the series runs for many more seasons.
0385720920|5.0|an amazing read from cover to cover finding his own way and just doing what humans do.  simply amazing is the only words to really describe this awesome story.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Fantastic series - we just can't get enough.  Can we wait until January, 2014?  It's sheer torture! Now we must to go England to see the real castle.

B001AQQR2S|5.0|The kids love this movie and it's parent friendly too. Clean, funny. Matilda is such a cute little thing. Awesome!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is awesome, probably my favorite show ever. I love movies, games or shows where there's this constant rivalry and backstabbing and at the same the rivals have to treat each other with respect and they can't go at each other's throats....at least no yet. There's so many revenge story lines and conspiracies. The acting is great too. I don't don't want to give away any spoilers so I'll stop here.
B009K86D86|5.0|This is a very good review of the changes in our food supply in the last 50 years or so..  not all of them are good, and I think very sad the way the animals are raised, fed, transported to slaughter... etc...  We could do a lot to make it more humane if making big money was not the entire aim..  I think the video is probably a bit biased, but pretty fair in its treatment of all the issues...  Learning more about how food is grown and animals are treated has sure helped me to eat a lot less meat.. so probably better for the planet that way.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Both glad and sad to finish the last book. It took a little longer for me to get into this last book but took off after that. Very good with some unexpected turns.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There is not really a lot more to say about Downton Abbey that has not been said..  When my friend and her husband were over here we watched a few from season one-- and I was pretty sure my friend would like it, but I was not sure of her husband.. I thought he would probably just put up with it... but by the end of the second show he was hooked too..  Lots to like in Downton Abbey, and of course I am disappointed that some of the characters have left..  it was all perfectly cast.
0307730697|5.0|Not many military books talk about faith in God, however this book did & I'm truly thankful it did. Most people will not discuss their failures in life because they aren't proud of them, but we all struggle with something.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Typical Clancy..to long and to many sub plots...Great if your are a techie...labored to finish it.  Lost track of all the characters.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Wasn't as good as the first, but entertaining. James Brolin was dead on with his<br />part of a young Tommy Lee Jones. Will smith was great.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great mix of music. Classic, modern, contemporary.. I love the piano. I was not sure about the cello. But once I heard them together it was great. I had never even heard of them. Saw them on PBS. Ordered CD. Happy I did !
0307346617|3.0|\\"World War Z\\" is Max Brook's take on how the world would react to a zombie outbreak.  From the first time the \\"zombie virus\\" was discovered in China, to the eventual proliferation of swarms of zombies across the globe,we are presented with interesting accounts of how different countries and individual within those countries deal with the crisis.<br /><br />Like many readers before me have mentioned, the book consists of different vignettes cobbled together around a central theme.  Each chapter is narrated by a different individual as he or she tells of his or her experience during the zombie war.  This unique structure gives the book a very episodic feel, as the readers are left with the task of piecing together pieces of the puzzle to get a feel for the bigger picture. Luckily, the author does include little details that tie each chapter together so that after a couple of chapters, a picture of what the world is like during the zombie apocalypse does begin to emerge, even though there are still gaps that will remain unanswered throughout the rest of the book.<br /><br />As for the vignettes themselves, those are basically hit and miss. A lot of the times I would be left wanting more after spending time with a narrator with an interesting story to tell, while at other times the urge to skip ahead would get the better of me, especially when I know that skipping one person's story will have no impact on my enjoyment of the other stories. The book is divided into 5 different sections, with each section dealing with a different stage of the crisis.  \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Blame\\" deals with how the different governments and the people react as they gradually realize what is happening, \\"The Great Panic\\" details people's attempts to survive the zombie wars, and \\"Turning the Tide\\" and \\"Home Front\\" talks about the strategies the different countries used to win the zombie war and the subsequent reconstruction.  The first two sections were a little hard to get into, and I would often become frustrated with the different narrators jumping in and out of the story.  But after a couple of chapters, as the bigger picture begin to emerge, I started to enjoy the book a lot more.  \\"The Great Panic\\" and \\"Turning the Tide\\" are definitely the most interesting sections of the book, as we get to witness the mass hysteria that resulted from the zombie outbreak and how the US and other governments finally figure out what makes the zombies vulnerable and how they can be \\"killed\\".  By the time we get to \\"Home Front\\", the world is pretty much on its way to recovery although the zombies have not been 100% eradicated.  During the last 2 sections, I found the descriptions of the impact the zombie wars have on our society's socioeconomic structure to be the most interesting.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very imaginative work by a very imaginative author.  It's clear from each page the amount of research and effort Mr. Brooks has put into postulating how different cultures would react to the same crisis differently, and the book can be seen both as a fiction and a social commentary on what's wrong of our societies today.  I thought that the book's structure and the lack of a central hero did compromise the dramatic potential of the book; and that the author left a lot of gaps in the history of the zombie war and a lot of the goings on in other countries unexplained.  But still, this is an interesting take on a very common premise and a good way to kill off a couple of hours.
1936719010|5.0|A friend of mine let me know about this book, and I'm glad he did.  It's an easy and quick read that makes you think.  It's setup as guide to help you work through your project (music, new business, writer).  I found that the book made me want to get off my butt and do something.  Very few books have had that kind of impact on me, but there is something special about this one.  If you get a chance check out The New Man podcast where Steven Pressfield is interviewed.  Enjoy!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|A season of change with the companions.  Nice mix.<br />And introduction of River Song, need I say more.<br />Well done!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I failed to 'get into the story' as it seemed only a vehicle for Speilberg to display his cinematography skills.  The lighting, shadows, colorations all were state of the art and certainly of a defined style but they kept bumping me out of the story.  This was 'all about the movie' grandstanding and far less about good storytelling.  It simply lacked credibility and any depth for me.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|But my kids lost interest.  My wife and I liked it better than the kids did.  Worth a rental though.
0143122916|5.0|I read this book in a few days...picked it up to read any spare moment I had. I am still thinking about this book. I loved how the author paralled North Korea current polices and practices with Shin's story.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I LIKE THE MOVIE, I HAVE SEEN ALL THE OTHER HOBBIT MOVIES AND READ THE BOOKS, THEY ARE VERY GOOD
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This story is beautifully written. I've read it, listened it the audiobook and eventually watched the DVD version. Of all three the audiobook was without a doubt the most moving. Narrated by the author, his voice brings the story to life in a way that no other reader, including my own eyes, could do. It is one of the best audiobook experiences I've ever had, and consequently one of the best books I've ever read.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|SORRY, I THOUGHT I HAD LEFT FEED BACK ON THIS ALREADY. MOVIE WAS IS GOOD CONDITION AND THE KIDS LOVE IT
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I watched Justin Timberweek on Jimmy Fallon when he promoted this CD and loved his performances so much I bought the CD.  It's good stuff!  I'm surprised.  I was never a JT fan until now - but the dude is talented.  Some of these are 'baby making' cuts and his faster tunes are very 'dancy'.  Overall, it's a great CD, I feel like I got my money's worth.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE. TOOK MY GRAND KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE AT THE THEATRE. THIS IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never watched this show while it was on - a friend told me it was good and I finally decided to check it out - I am HOOKED.  I've been binge-watching the seasons, I'm on season 3 now and it just gets better and better.  Fantastic show!
B003PIUC02|5.0|Started watching this series on satellite and couldn't stop. Had to have all of the episodes...from beginning to end. Will watch over and over....Loin cloths and swinging dicks
1609611543|5.0|The recipes in this book are truly delicious and excellent. The only caution is watch your portion control when you are eating these.  Otherwise, the background information is excellent and informative.  It definitely is a must read for anyone who wants to conquer fat and also live and eat in a healthy fashion.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book...  very intriguing.  I have a better understanding of why and how people behave the way they do.  I did soul searching with the book...  surprising as it is to say.
B00BJ7G1VK|3.0|Didn't research book before I ordered it - watched her on television and guess I expected more-only looked thru it once.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green does it again with this book. I just loved it. Loved the characters, loved the story, loved everything.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Thought it was just okay.  Wonder if I would understand what was going on if I hadn't read the books.
B001VFTYWI|3.0|Not as good as her others. I'm not sure why she is rushing the endings to put a bow on it?
B00AO3K01C|5.0|I'd never heard of the author, but chose the book based upon some other reviews. I loved it. It's beautifully written and kept my attention throughout.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one movie fun to watch no matter your age! We watched with our kids, my parents, the kids' uncle....3 generations enjoyed it!
B006FPFTMS|4.0|I needed to be able to do underlining on literature download from sources other than Amazon.  This allows me to do that.<br />Thanks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is ADDICTIVE!<br />My nephew told me about Temple Run 1 last year then I started playin 2, then my sister, her daughter, her son, her husband, my mom, my sister-in law...............next thing you know we're having a Temple Run 2 marathon competition that turned into several weeks of texting each other our score!!!<br />LOL<br />Sooo much fun!! The high score now is 5 million something!!!<br />crazyness!!! but fun!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Being an insomniac, my past few months have been exhausting. 3, maybe 4 hours off sleep every day (or night?). On my cloud, you will find 20 some sleep noise apps. None downloaded because none worked! So, I tried this one, after getting a positive review from a friend, and absolutely LOVE it. My personal combination is a cat purring and slow waves, but when my cat cuddles with me, I like thunderstorm, slow waves, and campfire. Although cuddling with my cat usually gets me an extra hour or so (he doesn't cuddle often), this app has gotten me 4 extra hours on some good night. Usually 2-3 extra hours. I absolutely adore it, and recommend to everyone!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Couldn't be better for a free app!  It has replaced my bedside noise machine and is much more portable for travel.  I love the timer function.  The number of choices for different sounds and combinations is excellent.. makes it easy to customize something that works for you!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Having this available for digital viewing is wonderful, so clear, both picture and sound. Can't wait for Season 4 to obtain also.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I recommend this movie for family, friends or events. It has a great message that many of us could utilize to be better people.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. Made me laugh all the way through, but still kept close to the reality of true life. Best comedy I've seen come out in a long time.
B005LAIII0|5.0|An absolute amazing movie experience. A perfect balance of writing, visuals and deep emotional story. Get it now and change your life for the positive.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Every song is just great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Recommend very highly makes you want to get up and dance and sign along can't get enough of it!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is excellent-- the best of what TV/film has to offer, in my opinion.  Characterizations are complex and subtle, the plot twists and turns in delightful ways, and the historical insights are thoughtful and fascinating. Totally engrossing - I love it. Bravo!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The episode I purchased was well written and executed. Great story line. Would recommend to anyone that is a fan of the Supernatural series.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I enjoyed it so much, I bought 2 copies of the DVD . I knew my sister would have to have it too. I also bought the CD for myself. Every time I watch the DVD I see something new. This story Is one that needed to be told and who else but the very talented DAVE GROHL!! He is amazing.....I cannot wait to see what else he has up his sleeve for us in the future. There is so much mediocre music out there....WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE DAVE.. I was totally blown away by Corey Taylor, He has such an amazing voice. The CD has been playing non stop since I got it.  THANK YOU DAVE!!!!!<br />And, for all those very misguided morons, who gave it anything but 5 stars and less than steller reviews. You just came off sounding JEALOUS........PLEASE GIVE US MORE DAVE!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|the book is very good i love the hunger games tank you i liked so much i i i i
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This series is so well done.  A must see for TV viewers.  I needed to pass time during treatment and I zipped through 4 seasons.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have purchased the previous seasons of this Masterpiece Classic, and Season 3 was as enjoyable as the previous ones.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wonderful yet addicting site!! So much fun!! Very useful for organizing recipes and planning upcoming events! Humor section is hilarious!
B008458O3S|5.0|Very good game.  Lots of puzzles, my kids love it, and I love it - great for killing time on flights.
B000WN60NG|5.0|Steve Vai makes the movie much  more enjoyable. Learning how Robert Johnson and the blues music got its start .
0811874192|5.0|We saw this book at a friend's home, and had to have it, both for a gift to our son and daughter-in-law and for ourselves, to bring some cheer into the house at a moment's notice.  Just terrific engineering to make this happen.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry<br />Washington and Samuel L. Jackson star in Quentin<br />Tarantino's 2012 action western. A bounty hunter<br />helps a slave rescue his wife from a corrupt<br />plantation owner. Jamie and Christoph are great<br />together and it's nice to see Leo play a villain.<br />This 2-disc set has nice picture and sound plus<br />some neat featurettes. This is a good film that<br />pays tribute to many classic westerns only adding<br />blood and profanity which is usual for Tarantino,<br />but ok. I recommend this.
0938045768|5.0|To sum it up, cancel the gym membership. I'm sorry I didn't find this years ago. In the short space of time I've been using this I've seen incredible results!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|a great to spend time at the end of a rough day.  or a game you can play with the kids.  I am talking about the big kid in all of us.  lol
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Overall a really awesome mic. Sound is clear and loud. Cord is nice and long with on/off switch. LOVE THIS MIC!
1609611543|5.0|I like the book a lot. I feel I learned a lot about what is going on with our wheat these days.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Wasn't what I was expecting but it was very informational and I liked it very much.  Thought there would be more surfing footage though.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I watched this movie as a child with my mother and loved it 30 years ago.  This time I watched it with my son<br />and loved it as much if not more.  This is a great story.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I was looking for a backpack that would fit under the airline seat. This one is narrow and fits even under the smallest space under the isle seat on Boeing with that steel box under the seat. The other backpacks do not have structure that would keep it together - this one has.  The harness is also very well built.  I recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie then read the book , I know I did it backwards but glad I did. I can't wait to see what the next to movies bring :)
B0018QQQK8|5.0|A great book about bad relationships and overcoming them to find amazing love. The book is MUCH better than the movie!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|How could it just end like that!!!! Rick you should be ashamed and the worst part is I have to wait a lifetime to find out what happens!!!!! Nooooooooo!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is quite informative about the horrible effects wheat has on ones body. The wheat we have in the USA is not the wheat that is sung about with the words &#34;....amber waves of grain&#34;. Since reading this book I have gotten off wheat and am seeing a good shift in my overall health.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Analytical in style.  Profound material.  Coming from a neurosurgeon validates and debates both sides of this topic well.  Well-written and quick read.
B00745BJ9A|5.0|I got this for my mom. We both like the song, \\"You Raise Me Up\\", and even though she can listen to it and watch the video on YouTube, she thought she would like to have the CD. It is very good, and Josh Groban is a rare talent. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of this artist.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie! It's exciting and adventurous. I cannot wait until the they make a sequel. This a movie I will add to my DVD collection.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|This movie is pretty hilarious. I love it when Flynn is stealth-walking at the office. Also there is a pretty epic scream awaiting you.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Excellent movie.  Peter Jackson has done it again!  I was enthralled and it was great seeing characters that I knew so well from the trilogy.
0062082353|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for my husbad.  He is not a reader at all but what he got read he really enjoyed reading.  He told me it was very interested.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Great album. Great artwork. Good production. Can't really say anything bad about this album. Great cover of ABBA for the deluxe version. Enjoy!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|My daughter made me buy this CD for the song, The Voice (awesome song) You can find it on youtube. The video I like is titled, wolf song. The thumbnail is a picture of black and white wolves and it was posted by, 0ladykyuubi0. It's an awesome video with a slideshow of wolf pictures. All the songs are nice, it also has Scarborough Fair which is one of my favorites. I would recommend this cd to everyone. :)
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Spell binding fare for fantasy and medieval fans. Complex yet rewards the diligent reader. Characters are realistic and easy to empathize with. Can't wait for more.
B00AO3K01C|3.0|Just sort of ended with a lot of loose ends. May try to reread and &#34;get it&#34;.  Not sure if I will take the time.

B0000DZTIW|5.0|I loved the movie , and also the music....If you loved the music in the movie you will love this soundtrack...I  Recommend this..
0770435726|3.0|Was surprised it was rated so high by others.  I guess if you're into this kind of thing.  Sounded too make believe and found little depth in the characters.  Lost interest half way through but managed to press on till the end.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|First off, I am very satisfied with this case.<br /><br />I had another case that made the phone feel thin, because that's why I purchased the iPhone 5. The downside to that case was that it provided no protection.<br /><br />This case keeps the phone feeling very thin, has a great feel, and provides great protection from drops or slips.<br /><br />Again, I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend this case to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I was intrigued with first book but second one was boring! I feel the sexual content was all the book had moving it forward and it got old....
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My sister said they kids play with it all the time in the car on long road trips.  They said it was great!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great read, couldn't put it down, I needed to find out if Jacob was guilty or not!! Surprise ending left me with my jaw to the floor! A book that stayed with me for days. Highly recommend
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Not as funny as was hoping! Laughed couple of times but not overly amused. Language was bit much for me
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Reviting and captivating, in the end there is a great lesson to learn. Care is There... It is a great movie...
B00002N9ER|4.0|These work, and that's all you need to say. Are they fancy? No they aren't but, we're not in a beauty contest. They hold the light firmly and work well. Now if the flashlight fairy (5 year old grandson) would stop running off with my light and put it back where it belongs, I would be happy! I'll mount these higher next time! Mounting screws are in the package. A nice plus.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I was having trouble charging my kindle and this new charger proved to be the solution and has continued to be.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A major page turner.  Contemporary, likable characters, realistic plot., and easy to read.  Baldacci is a very good suspence writer about present day happenings.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|the strength it takes, the work out they had to do, I have a galdius myself that I excise with. they are quite heavy. I also liked the cast. could with out all the sex. but I love it any. I love ancient times. honor and no fear of dying mean a lot to me.
0307594777|5.0|Trilogies are quite popular right now, but most seem amateurishly written.<br /><br />The Stieg Larsson books are a great read from the beginning of book #1 to the ending of book #3.

B007REV4T8|5.0|The movie was excellant, no surprise there. Added plus: you can buy this for less than the price of 2 movie tickets. Watch it over and over....
0061478784|5.0|Having seen the Ghibli Studios adaptation of this book, I became very interested in what the story would be like...that's why I bought it.  As much as I love the movie, I love the book!! Yes, it is different - don't be expecting the movie when you open to the first chapter!  STILL, this book is FANTASTIC!! I love the world that Diana Wynne Jones has created, and the development of all of the characters is fantastic!  It's definitely a MUST READ!
B008220C38|1.0|The movie was a huge disappointment.  I expected a movie updated from the original versions and it was just not filmed in the same manner.  I actually threw it away.

B004EPYZT4|3.0|Apparently, this film took place during the dark ages......or.......everything bloody had to take place on a dark day.  I don't know how else to explain why the filmmakers took every opportunity to stage the bulk of the swordplay in dark ill-lit interiors or during the gloom of day.  They were also inordinately fond of nighttime scenes.  The battle to end all battles took place in a dark cave barely lit by torches.  I ache for the days when movies were made in such a way that everything could be seen.  Otherwise, what's the point?  What's the point in staging elaborate sword fights if they're next to impossible to see?  Especially in this case, when the film is little more than a series of fight sequences strung together.  What little plot there was involved multiple quests for a pure blood woman, parts of a magic mask, and, of course, vengeance.  Lots of locales are visited, each thoughtfully provided with an onscreen place name.  Both good and bad, this movies rushes along at a fast pace hardly allowing for anything to register.  Very little of it is memorable.  Everything is so carefully orchestrated that the results seem mechanical and by the numbers.  This is supposed to be a sword and sorcery film, where's the magic?  There's plenty of swordplay but little in the way of the supernatural.  What little there is conjured up belongs to the dubious charms of Marique (Rose McGowan) the witch daughter of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang).  Rose McGowan gives what amounts to the laziest performance by channeling Freddy Krueger right down to the knives/fingers.  If this isn't an act of plagiarism, I don't know what is.  Every nuance of her \\"witch\\" is a clich&eacute;.  Unfortunately, she is not the lone straggler as far as performances go.  Jason Momoa as Conan takes the honors as the worst of the lot by snarling on cue while glaring mightily.  That's the extent of his range.  If scowling were a fine art, he'd still fall short of the mark.  He has only one facial expression barely visible under his mop of hair.<br />For all the savagery depicted, this film is curiously detached, passionless, with characters as cold as the sets they pose on.  I forgot what I saw the moment the film was over.  Hardly a glowing endorsement.sible under his mop of hair.<br />For all the savagery depicted, this film is curiously detached, passionless, with characters as cold as the sets they pose on.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG once started reading this book  I couldn't put it down even tho I needed too my eyes would burn! This book was the far best book I've have read!!! It felt so realistic goodness!!! I recommend a most read!
1476712042|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. It took me 2 days to read it. I was so sad when it ended b/c I didn't want it to. Not your typical love story and that was very refreshing. Would definitely recommend this for others to read.
B00783NWB6|5.0|GOOD MOVIE EVEN BETTER IN 3D, THE SOUND IS FANTASTIC, THE 1080P IS SO VIVID AND THE 3D REALLY DOES STAND OUT AND GIVE IT REALLY GOOD DEPTH, CANT GO WRONG ON THE PRICE, MUCH MORE AT OTHER PLACES I WOULD BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN, THEY ARE ALWAYS SO HELPFUL AND VERY NICE TO DEAL WITH.
B000FA675C|3.0|The ending left me flat. The writing was excellent. The plot compelling, but I felt like I should have spent my time in another endeavor when I read the last chapter. I guess the sequel might address that--I would hope.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Amazing movie now even better, the picture is amazing on blu-ray i never thought watching these on VHS and then DVD that the picture could be this much better on blu-ray. Not to mention the sound. Dont hesitate to buy if your thinking about it you wont regret it!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I didn't actually install the app, so this review says nothing in regards to the game itself.  When it was ready to be installed, it wanted me allow it access to things that I thought were unnecessary for a game such as this to have access to.  For example, my location, accessing a cloud server and one other that I don't recall at this time.  I love to play Angry Birds, but refuse to install an app that wants access to so much information that is totally unrelated to the app itself.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Installation was a snap, not really much to say! This processor has given me no issues, and is performing very well.
B005PK57NU|5.0|One of the best series on TV. Like the fact that I could go back and watch missed episodes or just enjoy them again.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fresh perspective on asset management and growing their personal wealth.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|The movie plot was a fairly good one but it didn't fully develop the main character. The ending came full circle but left you thinking.
B008RJFRTK|3.0|I had hoped it would be something that would actually let me plot trips, instead of just a digital version of a paper map.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Robert DeNiro is outstanding and the cinematography is something to be seen. Also brings into question what is a missionary?
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I watched my boyfriend play this and had to have it. I have android ICS 4.0 and it will not work! I get to the world map and CRASH every time! Worse yet he was playing it on Android 2.2! The only reason it got 1 star is because of the crashes. I fell in love with it and now I get to look at the icon and wait for the update....
B000FA675C|5.0|I read Dan's two books many years ago, but  wanted to read them on my Kindle and not be weighed down in the process. I was greatly rewarded!!! He writes in a manner that I greatly appreciate!  The mystery was ever present, &#34;deliciously&#34; explained and surprisingly brought to an unsual conclusion. I felt drawn into the story and &#34;drained&#34; at its conclusion.I have no idea how accurate his descriptions were, but that made no difference to my enjoyment of his work. I highly recommnd this to other prospective readers.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I had never read this book but knew there was a movie of it so I was intrigued.  In the beginning I sometimes had difficulty keep the characters straight since there were so many quickly introduced and some with similar names.  However once the book got going it was funny and interesting.  The end was completely satisfying with a few surprises!  Though very long, it was a very enjoyable book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read the trilogy four times already and i am yearning to read them again. What makes these books the best in my opinion is the fact that James created characters that are so real you fall in love with them. I am left feeling bereft at the end of the story, feeling as if my family had left me. For me she could have continued the story and I so u long be bored.<br />James feel free to tell us Elliott's story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first this looked boring and easy.  Then I got past the easy levels and into the challenging ones.  Now I can't put it down.  The more challenging the more fun. I'm loving it.
B008MM9630|2.0|This game asks you to buy gems to do quests. If you like spending tons of money, then this is the game for you. You can play the game without having any help. I like the game okay, even though I can't finish any quests because I don't have the money. I'm also having a hard time mixing potions since I have no idea what plant or tree drops what.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'VE been playing this some time and I really enjoy it. It works great on Kindle Fire.  Only problem was with my puzzle packs disappearing, and having to clear the cache and download.  GOOD news ..I found a solution for that.  Before closing the app,open a new puzzle, put one piece one the board then close.  It will be there when you come back.  I have bought several puzzle packs, but there are lots of really nice free ones.  I love the way you can save an unfinished puzzle for later.  Many of the puzzle packs are only $.99, and the large ones are only $1.99.  They range in difficulty from the very easy and quick to the almost impossible.  I enjoy the challenge of the next to largest # of pieces, though sometimes I go for the big ones.<br /><br />To update my review:  Right after I wrote this, I opened the game, and oops!  it was gone.  The trick has been working, so go ahead and try it.  But to the developers, please fix this.  I'd be a lot more likely to buy the ad-free version should this little glitch be fixed.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It's a good book. I would recommend it if you have a good amount of time to sit down and read.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very good, nerve racking,couldn't put it down and wanted more when it was the last chapter. Highly recommend excellent read.
B007JMW46U|4.0|It's a good book. I would recommend it if you have a good amount of time to sit down and read.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack for Rock lovers...from a movie made for rock lovers.<br />So if you are a rock lover....go for it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|It's a decent book. If you have a lot of time to sit down and read I would recommend it.
B00A83075M|4.0|Wreck-It Ralph is a fun movie for kids of all ages.  Adults will enjoy the humor as well.  I rented it first and the kids watched it over and over, so I decided it was worth the investment.  Add this to your family video library; you won't be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting! Wish you guys made games like this! I recommend this game to anyone. Got this game on my cell and kindle fire.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love this movie and still haven't forgiven Disney for totally blowing the marketing. Beautful stirring, romantic, fresh!!! Buy it, and if you get a chance, see it on a BIG screen.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I love anything by Andrea.  He stepped out of his former style a bit with some jazzier, more modern numbers with this CD.
B00A3AU9KI|5.0|They make a great product, and this is no exception. Flawless, great design! This article is handy and simple - all one piece.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I bought this for their hit song.  Rest of the CD was just okay.  Hopefully, they won't become a &#34;one hit wonder.&#34;
1451695195|4.0|Proof of Heaven will give you more questions than answers.  In the end, it is a matter of faith for you to decide for yourself.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I felt as if the camera were following my family and friends around. Judd Apatow really hit a home run with this portrayal of life for 40 somethings. From the soundtrack right down to the relationships between Husband/Wife/Mother/daughters/parents.  Laugh out loud funny and a real treat!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found \\"The Misremembered Man\\" to be a little confusing and hard to follow during the first few chapters. Then, it took off! It's full of strong characters and I don't think the author could of described them in more detail. So, break out the tissues and settle in for a wonderful read...
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|If you love puzzles you'll love this game! I love the little noises it makes when you place a correct piece. You can play for hours!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|In this game you can fly a bunch of different planes, drive boats, cars, and tanks. There are also a bunch of weapons and different missions.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|this app is fun at first but then gets boring. it is not very fun I kinds sucks. but its okay for a long road trip or something.
6305907145|5.0|I love this movie! I really like Jane Austin and I think that the main actress is beautiful in it.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|We really like using this case.  Our 8 yo and 4 year old both use easily.  Seems to provide good protection and I love the standing ability.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|I liked the movie until the ending, where evil wins and you are left knowing very little about that evil.  Because of the ending, i can't recommend this movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. The writing was great and well plotted. The story was intriguing from start to finish. And one of my favorite endings in a long time.
1939416019|1.0|Boring and the characters are not developed well. Avoid this series if your a serious fantasy reader. Not really even in exiting for Kids.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|GOOD CALCULATOR!<br /><br />It works very well.  I am not sure about the larger scale of its operation at this time.
B002APU580|5.0|Really true to Jane Austin.  The actors are all first rate.  The cinematography is excellent.<br />Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, Rosamund Pike, Jena Malone<br />Judi Dench do fine jobs.  Donald Sutherland is particulary on target with Dad Bennet.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I love this album it speaks to me. I would also recommend listening to Lana Del Ray! Get this now
B004U8VX2M|5.0|The actors, sets and costumes are real great.  The story lines are less &#34;soapy&#34; than DA.  The class issues are much clearer and well drawn.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Excelent prequil to one of the greatest science fiction seris ever. Good script, Well cast. Truely caputes the nature of the original intent for futre stories with this crew of the New starship N1701.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|The strength of this book was that it highlighted some of the (often overlooked) characteristic strengths of introverts as leaders, such as their capacity for careful listening, considered and thoughtful decision-making, and conscientious attention to detail.  However, in her zeal to establish the leadership credentials of shy people, I think she may have gone a bit overboard in dismissing the talents of everyone else.  Are extroverts really that thoughtless?  Are all their decisions really that ill-considered? (And do we all fall neatly into one category or the other?)  I found this book thought-provoking, if a bit biased.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|good for any young couple to see real love in action in an real non-modern setting. True romance never goes out of style.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|worked great as I expected.  used them before without problem<br />or mishap.  would definitely purchase again.<br />and again and again.
1117994112|5.0|Excellent movie in all aspects. Be prepared for all music with about 12 spoken words. You will like this style if you liked &#34;hairspray's&#34; all music approach.
B0091REZMW|5.0|do not be in a hurry to play. take a break. just like living. more to do as time goes on. just wait. this is good while waiting in line or waiting for an appt. the music is also calming. I play this at night on my kindle fire. use head phones if you are in a public area if you wish. not bad for free. make sure you set the parental controls so no accidental purchases occur.  great game. could use a zoom in feature.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|great product<br />enjoy<br />love them<br />great deal<br />fast.<br />amazing<br />wonderful<br />excellent product<br />perfect<br />works great for all appliances in my home
B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie tells a wonderful tale for all family members.  I highly recommend it. Put it in the top 10 for children.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|I have to say that I have been a fan for years, but I have to say the last two albums have not been the Blake that I love.  However, I will say that I have enjoyed being able to hear something new from Blake.  Keep them coming, cause no matter what I will always buy your music.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Excellent acting.  Christian Bales, as always, plays the part the best.  Highly recommend it for adults.  Buy it as soon as you can.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie was entertaining even though the entire thing felt like a cash in on The Expendables success. The best scene was the opening scene. The rest felt cheap and patched together. Some of the acting (well, a lot of the acting) seemed wooden and forced. Nowhere near as good as the first.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|For the cost of the book, it might be worth buying. It was not, however worth the time spent reading. Some of the science and problem solving were described well. There was very little description of the setting. It was more about survival in an extreme environment and could have been set anywhere. The main character was unbelievable because of his juvenile nature. Astronauts are highly intelligent and screened for their psychological ability to handle long duration missions. It is obvious the main character would not be suitable for such mission. Some of the science is wrong and not well researched. Some of it is correct and well described.<br /><br />Another frustrating facet is that Amazon did not make it clear that this is not a \\"professionally\\" published book. It was clear after I purchased it because of the typos, weak story, and poor writing.<br /><br />In sum, if you like problem solving and survival stories then you may like this book. I did not enjoy it.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I have yet to receive this CD, but I know what I'm getting.  I watched the movie because I have fallen in love with the very beautiful piece &#34; Gabriel's Oboe.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|You get into the heart of the man. Still can't believe this happened over weather Blacks were humans. Must see.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I always like kristen bell and thought she was great in this show. It was a very entertaining show with action and romance.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|i love this album, the lyrics ar very unique (i think they would of been better without all the bad words) but the songs are good and catchy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the story was well thought out and intriguing. I enjoyed that it was easy to read and kept you drawn in throughout the story. The underlying message compels you to read the other books. Well done!
B0011Z33ES|5.0|i love to hear Josh sing in spanish and &#34;si volvieras a mi&#34;  does not disappoint, and &#34;broken vow&#34; is like the perfect break up song, so sad :( Love it though!!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This is my first experince with a Bryan Peterson book. Clear explanations coupled with generous examples make this book a Must- Read for Photography Enthusiasts. I have been using my first DSLR for just over a year and have found by reading Understanding Exposure that I am on the right path. The book's content has greatly helped me to fine-tune my skills, technical and creative. The chapters are short and concise and void of complex technical explanations. To quote the lyrics of a popular song: &#34;I can see clearly now.&#34; If you are starting out in photography with a first-time DSLR, this is the book you need to make you feel confident that you have made the right decision. It sets you up for success and helps you to minimize the stress associated with learning all that &#34;technical stuff&#34; that makes for creative photo-taking. Looking forward to reading Bryan's other books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great season for the walking dead<br />I really love the show can't stop watching it<br />It is scary to watch but there is some good twists and turns this season
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I never bought a Hendrix album in my whole life.  This is my first - and I think it's great.  Pure Hendrix.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a really unique look at a post-apocolypse and zombie story. There are situations that arise that I haven't seen covered in the genre before.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Outstanding, workable directions that are easy to follow. Marred only by a tendancy to over-simplification which, considering the tech-befogged alternative, is not all bad.  This guide is a model that should be emulated.
B000002KDO|5.0|Yes, This would be the greatest Black Sabbath Album in there Catalog, Instant Classics on this one Sweat Leaf, Children of the grace, The band is at there best here.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|this movie was a very hold your attention movie.  was sorry it was over when done.  Will watch it many times
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie is great in 3d! The effects were well balanced. Not just a bunch of stuff shooting at you. Story line was interesting a good mix of action and naration,
B0000047EC|5.0|Love listening to this--a very mellow and relaxing CD!  It is my favorite mediation CD.  I would highly recommend this for anyone-young or old.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This documentry was a real eye opener.I have bought extra copies to give to freinds. I think that  everone should get this to see for them selves, What is really going on.
B00000IQW5|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever.<br />Touching, funny, dramatic with a touch of romance. Great cast and acting. A lesson is learned in watching this movie. I could watch it a few times and not get tired of it...
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|I have never seen this movie and I enjoyed ever second of it.  It is a must watch and a recommend to friends.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Fun. is an awesome band and the sound quality of the CD was great. Will purchase more from Amazon music!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is Great...can't wait for next season. We watched every week on Mon due to not having AMC..way cool
0425252868|5.0|Well written, lived up to the story I was expecting. In war there are heroes on both sides to have the story told from both sides make for a great read.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I really liked the book and visually this movie was wonderful, but I don't feel the story was fully realized.  The movie was actually kind of boring.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Just as captivating and thrilling as game of thrones watch both! The governor man they really get you to really loathe this guy by the end of the season.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I still really enjoy this movie after many viewings.  If you aren't a Tim Allen fan stay away.  He plays his standard characture, but this movie is fun.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Very good book, Suanne Collins is an excellent writer. Keeps the suspense throughout the entire series. The series also evolves around the love story that blossoms between Peeta and Katniss.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|great item for the price. Way better prices than the stores. I especially liked the way they came in the so quickly. Shared it with my mom & sis. the only problem was the plastic covering that covers the pictture & movie name was not there so it looks just like a blank cd or dvd container.
B00884GR0W|5.0|My son is a big Minecraft player but is always looking for other games and this fit and is entertaining.
1426209584|5.0|After reading the various reviews on this book I'll admit I was a little hesitant in ordering it. I had already purchased the National Geographic DVD and found it fascinating. All that being said I've found this book both informative and beautiful. To those that didn't see each Bird of Paradise in the DVD, they're here.<br />I just finished an online course from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which included a module on these birds.  This book was a great enhancement to the courses written and video materials.<br />The book is well laid out and extremely readable for both the seasoned &#34;birder&#34; and novice.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|The game is great. engaging and visually amazing. I have really enjoyed it, but now I'm at kind of a rough spot. Even on the easiest difficulty i have a hard time killing anythin. also, when i have a quest to complete, it says 'tracking quest' but i dont see any indication on the map, mini map, or anywhere of the direction i need to go. i spend a lot of time wandering, and getting killed to find the objective. Really irritating. The 'tracking' feature is supposed to work, as i saw it on youtube, but does not work for me. Any solutions to help me out? Overall its a fun game, a lot like skyrim, but mobile!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|The only negative is most people don't live in the dark without turning lights on.  If you are looing for something at night, wouldn't you turn the lights on?
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie was so good!!! It was informative and it was nail biting even though you know the outcome. Loved it!!!
1400032717|4.0|This book was a really good read but it's not really so much about the dog. A great story and insight into the mind of a young man with Autism.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It's no wonder why this movie was nominated for and won so many awards. An absolutely stunning production by Cameron Mackintosh (spelling?) and WELL worth the three hours to watch it. If you're a fan of musicals or this production, you will not be disappointed.
B002SM2QDC|4.0|It has more high tech stuff than the 2nd GI Joe.  I watched it after the recommendation from my friend that the 1st one is more &#34;GI Joe&#34; than the GI Joe - Retaliation.
B005JABSB6|5.0|finally i have enough 3D glasses for the entire family... they work perfectly with my Sharp Aqous 70&#34; 3D TV
B009FZFONO|5.0|The best show ever if you love zombies. Season 3 is kind of slow and drags on but concludes very nicely.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book. Reaffirms the importance of reaching out and sending kindness and love into our world. Thank you for reminding me if my job!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Classic movie that I'm glad to have added to my collection.  My daughter is an early fan of musicals and this is a good addition
0345444051|3.0|It was a book club choice and i don't normally read science fiction.<br />It was well written, I just didn't like the subject matter.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Authors new to publishing on KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) are given two important pieces of advice if they want to make their book stand out from the crowd: have an attractive cover and an attention-getting title. Of course, if you’re Stephen King you don’t need either of these things to get people to click on your book to find out what it’s about. However, look at the title here – 11/22/63. Either you recognise immediately the date as the day President John F Kennedy was assassinated, or you wonder what the title could possibly mean. In both cases you’ll be hooked. And you won’t be disappointed. And don’t worry, this is not another conspiracy theory story. It’s about time travel. Stop, don’t go! Don’t say, I’m not interested in science fiction; I’m not either, but Stephen King’s special story telling skills made me believe this could happen (or perhaps wish it could happen). I guarantee the ending will make you feel good.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been addicted to this game for a couple of months and don't believe any 12-step program can help.  In fact, I had to purchase a second Kindle in order to avoid withdrawals while one Kindle is charging.  I may never leave my couch now!
B000E97Y6K|3.0|This movie is okay and honestly I cannot find it anywhere in my house, I don't even remember buying this but I remember liking it so yea.
B003VANOFY|3.0|When these headphones are charged and on, they're fantastic for meetings, listening to music or just about any untethered headphone use you can think of. Even without proper mac support (I don't have to install Logitech junkware on my mac? Sounds good to me!) the volume knob, mute button and microphone action work great. The range is excellent in my apartment, I can go practically anywhere without dropping signal.<br /><br />They suffer from a few frustrating flaws though. First of all, the battery life is awful. I use these for maybe an hour every day and my headphones don't stay charged for a whole week. Less than five hours charge? Pretty bad. Second, the power button is near impossible to use. It's recessed and hard to reach unless you're poking at it with long nails. These should be easy to pick up, put on and turn on without even looking at them. Instead I stare at the power LED to see if I've turned them on yet, then I have to do the hold-down song and dance to turn them off. Wouldn't a slider switch just like the surround sound button be more appropriate?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these are the best wireless headphones you can buy at this price point. But be prepared to love and hate them.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This is a must have addition to your collection of Bowie favorites. It has been a long spell without a new Bowie CD but this one proves he still has what it takes to produce great music.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It grabs you and nver lets go, leaving you with the only option to get the second one. The story is good, gripping, the characters are also well designed. But if something has really strike me deeply is the utter precisión of the author's use of the language when describing emotion.<br /><br />He is a master of conveying the feelings of his characters and you will find yourself quoting this book in your mind. Your beliefs and ideas where always there, but the autor manages it to precisely grasp them into words.<br /><br />Truly a gem if only by how it is written. You will be surprised. 5 out of 5
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This app works well if you are able to open the document using it. I have had to email it to myself as an attachment and then open it on my kindle in order to use it. A somewhat tedious way of getting things done.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|Except for the zazzy special effects, I can see why this was the lowest-grossing Hollywood film of 2012 (followed by Transformers: Dark of the Moon). You see, you got a total slacker who doesn't know how to grow up, living with his Marine brother, and now has to join the Marine, yet it seems like he's been in it for some time as it is (and with no indication of any length of time passing by for him to get promoted, and it's impossible for it to have happened so quickly), and during the Marine's own battle game on the sea, some transmission sent out to a distant planet back in '06 has a few spaceships coming to Earth. They use their superior technology to create a lifelike board game, destroying everything that threatens violence at it (and then some on land).<br />There really seemed to be nothing for me in this film worth enjoying beyond the special effects (as I said before), its script, for the most part, was cookie-cutter and unrealistic. Some of the characters seem to come up with some random bit of helpful info just out of nowhere without prelude. Not to mention the aliens their selves, look entirely laughable (like parts of the script, too laughable for me to enjoy thoroughly), and I guess they had budget cuts on their own currency if their own technology can't come up with better sound effects when they detect some threat.<br />Then are certain soldiers that don't act like the real deal- like they don't have a mind to think with in the most common sensical ways. And a death scene presented just did not have the emotional substance for me to shed a tear, it simply felt like they tried too hard to yank the tears out, and failed.<br />Really, Hasbro, did you learn nothing from Michal Bay's abysmal interpretation of Transformers? The special effects may be cool, but they don't replace substantial story and characterization (especially when a character breaks in to a convenience store, keeps looking into the camera, and does not seem to care he keeps breaking law after law), and not all scientists talk like the cardboard thin scientist who apparently represents those who think people with artificial replacements are \\"cyborgs\\" (that did bother me, and I have no replacements, I thought it unscientific and not humorous). Remember that for the next toy/board game/overall game you decide to popularize into a mainstream movie, because this is getting old.after law), and not all scientists talk like the cardboard thin scientist who apparently represents those who think people with artificial replacements are \\"cyborgs\\" (that did bother me, and I have no replacements, I thought it unscientific and not humorous).

B0083EY9EI|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful record.  Every song is a great song.  I have always loved good music no matter the genre.  This UK artist has hit it out of the park.  Buy this, you will not be dissappointed.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I've watched this film about a dozen times with my sons and they are 5 and 7. It’s better than it’s given credit for. It has enough action and story to keep them entertained and the right amount of humor for any adult to enjoy. If you are like me and get tired of the Pixar/Disney fair and their heavy use of emotional tropes, then this is a good change of pace.<br /><br />The story takes a modern-cum-clash-of-the-titans-approach (the classic loin cloth version) but your young hero is a kid who has ADHD and Dyslexia, part of the effects being a Demi-god. Several other characters have physical disabilities that hide their true “abilities”. Also Percy’s female companion is the best warrior of the bunch. It’s nice to see a movie for once use characters like these and put them into positive roles like the hero and the rest of gang.
B000GCFBQU|2.0|Most readers have experienced many, if not all, of the small town and church dynamics -- even if they have not lived in small towns.  A lot to be said, but it plods along too slowly.
0765325950|3.0|After so many years it is a relief to have the series finished. I feel there was too much concentration on the war and violence. The actions of the main characters should have been fleshed out much more before killing them off.
B00A89ITZG|4.0|Im a runner and i only readed the part of running and it helped mi a lot.im training hiit and there is not a lat of books about it.if there was a 10 km shedule for runing i could give it a 5 star.
B000FA675C|5.0|Since the book has been extensively reviewed, I will not review it here. But it spoke to me on the power of organized religion, and how it has monopolized the very personal nature of one's individual faith.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season was better than the last.  Lots more action and demented scenes revolving around the governor.  Can't wait till next season!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Most of these reviews are good. I have seen the film before purchasing it and can say this, if you can watch this film without shedding a tear you are a heartless human being. Regardless of the liberties taken by Hollywood in the retelling of this true story, it still conveys the message of the story and does so in grand fashion. I am a grown man and considered pretty \\"hard\\" by most people and this film almost had me sobbing like a baby.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|it wasn't the best movie i watched at all, the movie was too slow, no action, and it was very tense
B001H1UQRI|5.0|The rich story full of twists and turns matched perfectly by Edward Norton's narration makes this film into a artistic masterpiece. This is a must see for any movie fan.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|my friends were telling me about Dr. Who and I was like...it cant be THAT good but I decided to try it anyways. I watched it and its and amazing show!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Thought it would be better since it got best picture at the oscars but I guess I set my expectations too high.
B008VBYN80|4.0|But I was only playing for 10 minutes when it asked for a review. I like it so far. I'll update later if I decide I hate it or love it.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I thought it had a good story line. It was extremely long though and had a terrible ending. But overall great movie.
B004JQN364|5.0|These pieces are very durable and so detailed. They are very authentic looking and any kid who is into mythology loves these. This piece is great in any mythology collection and brings its own mythology into play.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It wasn't bad. Kind of predictable and cliche but it is James Bond so the stunts were awesome. Had a good story line
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This is the band's best album since 2002's Alive Or Just Breathing.... the other CDs since then just failed to strike a chord with me. Welcome back, Jesse!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I'm juts not a big fan of this guy. he just doesn't mark me as the suave type. sorry Daniel
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was a good story a little drawn out in spots. I found it to be a bit boring during the training.
1582701709|5.0|This book is a treasure trove of positive ness and it gives you a roadmap to pulling yourself up by your own vibe to the universe. My wife found herself the convertible car she wanted, utilizing these tenants. My thing is asking for lots of checks and I am so thankful they keep coming! Be happy, keep your pathways open to the universe and with love you too can have what you want from this life!
0525425764|5.0|U have done it, yet again , Mr. Grisham!! Have every book u have publish & enjoy them all!! Thank u!!
B002FE5XVK|5.0|The heads, young forever! While Byrne has white hair now, and Chris N Tina have aged a bit, they will always be immortalized in this fine fine concert film. Byrnes creative hand is so very evident throughout the film. I enjoyed seeing Steve Scales an aquaintance from the New Haven Ct area, he and his array of percussion was exquisite. When I saw him at Toads Place in the early eighties and he told me he was playing with the heads, I should have taken more notice! I have always enjoyed the Stop Making Sense CD, but the extra material shown in the film helps to flesh out this great bands creative juices and more than just the hits. One more thing Byrne has soooo much energy it at times is a workout video with all his physical actions, enjoy on Blu Ray!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Reminds me of &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34;, one of my favorite movies ever.  The tension continues to build throughout the book.
B003Y01JL2|5.0|Great deal. This album has always been one of my favorite, and now I can add it to my vinyl collection
B0034DGPEU|5.0|this was a new slant on slavery.  i thought it was well done and i would like to know what happened after this.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. It is nice to be able to add it to my vinyl collection...
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|suspenseful and intriguing, this show definitely gives understanding to the world of Vikings and keeps you wanting more!!<br /><br />We will continue watching this thriller!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was really hard to get through the first couple of chapters but after you get into it, the ending was great!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent movie. I would highly recommend it. Daniel Day Lewis does an excellent portrayal of Lincoln. Sally Fields and Tommy Lee Jones so an excellent job also.
0553328255|5.0|If you have a friend who is a fan of Sherlock Holmes, just give this book as a gift! Really enjoys reading it!
B001EBWIUO|3.0|This 1948 movie depicts two broke Americans (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt) in 1920s Mexico, joining with old-timer Walter Huston to prospect for gold. At the time, prospectors were at real risk of being killed by bandits, who in turn were at considerable risk of being killed by patrolling army units.<br /><br />A mine is dug, and about $105,000 in gold extracted. Bogart, however, begins to lose his sanity and trust in the others, fearing that his partners will kill him and take his share. A fourth American appears, wanting to join the mining, the men decide to kill him, but just as they confront him, bandits appear. The fourth man is killed and Federales chase away the bandits.<br /><br />Bogart's paranoia continues, resulting in him killing Holt while Huston is away being honored by a local tribe for saving a young boy. Bandits then encounter Bogart, kill him, dump his gold (believing it to be sand), and try to sell the donkeys. Locals recognize the bandits for what they are - they're executed.<br /><br />So everyone ends up with nothing.
B0018OFN2W|5.0|very pleased 2 fast and 2 furious is my alltime favorites movies to watch any day of the week anytime!
0062231375|4.0|A fascinating book.  I thought it was unnecessarily blatantly crude, but after a few hundred pages, even that blended into the landscape.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a bit of deja vu...I know I've played this somewhere before.  Game is well put-together and fun to play.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a family member and they love the movie.  Not sold in any local stores so MUST have for online ordering.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I know I will be in the minority but I did not enjoy this book and will never read a Gillian Flynn book again. She is without doubt a talented author because the book draws you in but for me the more I read the more twisted  and  sick it became. It is not a fun read and when I finished the book I wished that  I had never read it. Again I know the majority of  readers probably loved its dark style but it was not for me!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|What else can I say? It works well but I wish it had a better way to sort the info and a way to turn off the warnings.  But for free I can’t really complain.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|As a follow up to Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead takes Andrew Wiggin to where he might have dreamt for himself at the Battle School as a youth. Perhaps a bit preachy at times, but a heartfelt, loving tale of the Xenocide trying to repair what he did in the Bugger War. It provides a fresh look at how humans deal with the &#34;other&#34; in our lives, and how we could do better if we got to know our &#34;enemy.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I've gone a whole day playing that game<br />and this game will always be my fave  if your a temple run fan then this is the game for you
B007BVOEPI|3.0|The Blueray disk work great. But disk2 of the DVD set will not read. Was my able to watch on the DVD player.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Keeps you going all day love it smile smile smile smile smile smile smile smile smile smile smile smile smile
B007KUFDBY|1.0|The only thing this movie had going for it was the Animation.<br /><br />this movie is so dull I can barley remember it. the main charactor is nothing but a pretty face.<br />what falters from the book is that the focus is more of a bro mance rather than a adventure story. It tries to be The Jungle Book rather than Alice in Wonderland. Both excelent. but this is....... so dull.<br /><br />Not only is the main nothing but a pretty face, I got so bored with this movie I ended up playing with an egg (yes an egg, I'm weird OK)
B008N1LL42|4.0|Because it was panned by reviewers and the fact I'm not a big sci fi fan, I had minimal hopes when I rented it. But, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch did a good job, especially in the chicken burrito scene. That had me cracking up. My favorite actor/actress in the movie though was Rihanna. She was pretty bad ass. I hope she continues to act.<br /><br />The movie kept me entertained and I would recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks keeps you on edge through the whole book.  Makes you want to keep reading and the unexpected happens.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I’d give the first half four stars, and the second half two stars, for an average of 3 stars, honestly about 2.5.  Overall this story was decent but increasingly hard to swallow on several levels, including difficulty with suspension of reader disbelief, as well as frustratingly repetitive examples of the extreme evil or naivete of the characters—by the end I wanted to scream at the author: “We Get It Already, He’s EVIL”.  This book wore me out.  But despite this, I have to add that the audiobook narrators were both absolutely terrific.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app so much its great for waking up in the morning to do your hair for school in time to catch the buss
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I really enjoy Eric Clapton, he's one of my favorites, and Steve Winwood is a star too. I thought I would try this as I like watching the music DVDs. This is excellent, love these two together. Great seller, arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I recommend this album for great entertainment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It has a fabulous story line, great acting and beautiful scenery. Definitely worth watching. Its fascinating to watch the interaction between the servants and the lordship.  There is much to learn about leadership in this show.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I enjoyed this soundtrack tremendously. Some of the tracks sounded very Batman/Inception-esque such as Waking Up. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I like the use of electronica and wish they had included more of it.<br /><br />Overall I would say this is the perfect music to study to. It really takes you on a journey. I would also recommend Illusions by Bergersen if you like this type of music.<br /><br />4.5/5
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a very good book and enjoyable reading. I did not think it was as good as book one but definitely worth reading.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|The charger is okey, when I plug it in it is alittle hard because its too tight. The cord is very very short. Impossible to talk on the phone while charging.
B008MM9630|5.0|Having a lot of fun playing this game. I just wish I could get it to connect to FB on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A really enjoyable movie with a talented, and older, British cast.  Anything with Judi Dench in it is great.<br /><br />The DVD arrived quickly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its way better than any of them scams of minecraft its the pe is the best buy pe not the scamed vershions
B00B6QXN56|4.0|Joe Bonamassa is an artist who I feel is  really starting to push it with his number of live releases; I am starting to feel abused as a fan. To his credit, however, they have all remained different enough in style, song selection, and guest stars to warrant buying them if you are a fan. I am! This set displays a whole other facet of Joe's boundless guitar talent. The background musicians add to the arrangements with an eclectic variety of instruments. The song selection is impeccable; my highlights are the renditions of &#34;Dust Bowl&#34; and &#34;Jockey Full of Bourbon&#34;. I like these better than the original studio recordings.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is the best game i have ever had. I definately recommend it. The only problems i have with it is 1) the freezes and 2) the characters cost too much.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Fabulous series.  For readers of the Terri Goodkind- &#34;Sword of Truth&#34; series it does not follow the books exactly but does not do it any harm.  I loved the books and love the DVD seasons even more but for different reasons. Great escape series and wonderful eye candy for all.  It is a shame there were only two seasons of this &#34;good triumphs over evil&#34; journey. Bring it back!
B009GEYX5E|2.0|Quality of film was bad even for this type of camera. All my pictures came out dark even with a flash.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|This is the expanded with outtakes of the la sessions i like this i wish that jim stayed around to play them on stage.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Its a nice puzzle game. I like to play it when I have time. to kill. Its so consuming time flies by!
B00008OE4W|3.0|Wanted it for my collection,  interesting to see how we spied on people during this time period. It has a great cast.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but I want an update so you can get flint and steal on creative mode. they already give you Tnt in creative so why not give flint and steal.
B0072OFM28|5.0|If youu havnt watched this show you are missing out. Lots of action a good story you can really get into. Worth getting if you are an action or history fan. Great fight scenes.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I love the new music. I shows how they all have grown up vocally. Cant wait for the concert. Hopefully they will sign some off them.
1476733953|5.0|I was hooked from the first paragraph and couldn't put it down. I found I am still thinking about it several days after I finished. I certainly liked and recommend this book.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Entertaining but not challenging.  Could have a few more scenes since it doesn't take long to complete the ones available.
B000FA675C|5.0|Amazing story telling. Backed by solid research which engages you.<br />Kindle edition is good, no page missing or jumbled words/paragraphs.
B009G41CG2|4.0|This is a real great Mahjong.  It's a bit challenging but it is possible to complete it.  But it would be nice if it would allow 1 shuffle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter is addicted to this game, and I admit, it is fun and time can get away from you when you start playing.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love the way my Verso cover fits my Kindle. Makes it easier to handle. And it's so stylish! The only thing I don't like is when I'm watching videos. I wish there was a way to prop it up so I didn't have to hold it or make a stand out of whatever's nearby. But for reading? I love the way this cover feels in my hands!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It's pretty changeling and funny. Graphics are really good and characters entertaining. This app is so much more than others that do the same in strategy.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am having fun playing this game. It's my relax and unwind game before bed many nights. I don't know why finding the objects is so much fun or soothing, but for whatever reason it is. Great graphics too.
B004UID2LC|2.0|The antivirus free for android through your amazon app does not like this app, so I deleted it off my android.
0060527986|5.0|The book was everything I was hoping for and more!  A great book for anyone on their &#34;spiritual Quest&#34;.  I would recommend it highly to people looking to their &#34;higher self&#34;.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Amazing story... very well done... intense suspense. I recommend! This title was going to expire from free stream, and I was lucky to get it before that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. Wish there was a replay to watch the training and competitions though. Takes a while to replenish energy.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck does a fanTAStic job with this movie.  Everything, from the casting, wardrobe, and acting, down to the set and location, was SPOT ON!  I had not heard this story, or read about it before-hand, so I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Superb job!
1476733953|5.0|Hugh Howey is a seriously good story teller, with a seriously good story to tell. Literally couldn't put it down.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Move over Bond Girls, this movie is all about &#34;M&#34; !  She runs the show, and she runs it well.  Dame Judy Dench is just amazing in this role.  I love her tough-as-nails attitude, her relationship with James, and the banter between them.  The Skyfall location for the movie ending was quite appropriate and beautiful.  5 Stars!
