B009FZHYKU|5.0|I consistently find Walking Dead to be the most entertaining and compelling show on television. Season 3 continues with the formula of the previous seasons (drama interrupted violently by zombie attacks at the WORST possible times) - and I find it still works. I hope the writers begin to take new kinds of risks with the story as I can imagine the impending threat of killing off beloved characters eventually growing stale as a dramatic lever.<br /><br />The only audience I cannot heartily recommend this series to is one that has absolutely NO appetite for some graphic imagery. I have known some to be turned off by the depiction of zombified children which is understandable.
B009E3EY38|4.0|This is a very good collection of Led Zeppelin tunes on two CDs with a Blu-Ray and DVD as well.  I was slightly disappointed as I thought the DVD would have the live concert footage from the O2 in 2007 (its only the Bluray that has it).  The DVD is the practice session prior to the concert, done in B&W with photographers and other stage personnel in the audience.  The sound isn't quite as good as I would have liked, but still very good.  Almost a 5 star rating...

B0084AXZK0|5.0|I had heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray, I knew what it was about, but I never imagined it was going to be such a good book. At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has.  The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray´s portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far.
B009X01D9U|4.0|This is a great case.  The case allows you to rotate the kindle 180 degrees.  You can view it in landscape, rotate 90 degrees to portrait, and 90 degrees again to &#34;upside-down&#34; landscape.  You cannot view the device in &#34;upside-down&#34; portrait, nor can you turn the device in 360 degree circles.  Once you've rotated to &#34;upside-down&#34; landscape, you have to spin it back the way it came to get back to the un-rotated position.  I think the &#34;stiffness&#34; required to rotate the device is just right.  Any stiffer and it would be hard to rotate, but looser would cause the device to flop around in the case.  The cutouts for the Fire speakers allow sound to play the way it is supposed to.<br /><br />One concern I have is whether the torque used to rotate the kindle in place will cause the leather to tear over time.  This remains to be seen, so is not a negative at this point.<br /><br />The reason I gave this device less than five stars is because it doesn't have the perfect viewing angle for me.  The three notches for positioning the tablet seem to be somewhere around 60, 70, and 80 degrees from the table or lap that the case is resting on.  I would have preferred a design that allowed the device to &#34;lay down&#34; closer to a 45 or 30 degree angle.  I have seen this design on certain iPad cases but none yet for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B0017P520U|4.0|I enjoyed seeing this version of Beowulf. If there is any fault with it, it was with the story (of which I'm not overly fond), not the illustrations or the voice-overs.

B003LZPDF8|5.0|I put it off and off and I shouldn't have. This movie was well worth seeing and it is one of those movies that stay with you long after the credits have rolled. It might even haunt you.  I know the scenes of rampant poverty in India stayed with me.  And yet the story, for as glum as it sometimes has to get, has an up-lifting ending with a little Bollywood dance number thrown in, to boot  Excellent movie and a must-see.

0761169253|5.0|I used this book as help in a seminar I taught on building a color reference file and I found it to be very helpful in teaching people how to &#34;steal&#34; artwork and make it their own.  (Don't panic over the word &#34;steal&#34;, at no point in time did it encourange anyone to COPY someone's artwork.)  There were lots of little ideas to use as inspriation and lots of humorous antidotes and drawings. A quick read, it is worth a repeat visit on a regular basis. I just wish Mr. Kleon had included his chapter on &#34;Quilting vs. Weaving&#34; since both interest me but I guess some editing had to be done. Maybe he'll put it in his next book for me.
0553274503|5.0|I don't think this story could have been told in any format other than the journal format used by this book.  I have seen the film adaptation with Cliff Robertson and Claire Bloom, but it doesn't do the book justice because it is not in the journal entry format.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say other than I think that every child should read this once between the ages of 10-16 and then as an adult read it between the ages of 24-30 to get what they couldn't understand the first time.<br /><br />This book makes you feel sorry for 'Charly' and then turns around and makes you feel angry with him and then sad, but not quite as sympathetic at the ending.  I can't really describe much else without spoilers, so I will end this review by saying that everyone who has never read this book should pick it up and take a day or two to read it.  You will not regret it.

B008GZVHZI|1.0|I am so upset right now! this DVD does not play on my regular DVD player. The cover of the DVD is printed in Italy, the DVD comes and was shipped from Italy. I wanted the English version, as of now, i do not know if the DVD's audio is in English or Italian because it doesn't work AT ALL. Maybe if i was leaving in Italy would work but for some unknown reason this is a bad purchase, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this DVD at all! i was looking forward to get it on the mail for such a long time, i was excited to put this movie on for my toddler boy, since i know Pinocchio sends a positive message to children, and that's why i feel so frustrated that this seller is knowingly putting this out for sale. Amazon needs to make arrangements with sellers like this one! too bad, i know i wont get my $ back and neither my son could watch his movie! DECEPTION !!!

B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther<br />John Corey Book Six<br />By Nelson DeMille<br /><br />Agent John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield have just been posted overseas in Yemen. Their mission is to track down the Panther, a high ranking Al Qaeda operative. But once they arrive in Yemen they realize the reason they were sent to Yemen was not to track down the Panther but something much more sinister.<br /><br />This book doesn't actually pick up until the end and when you read a book that is six hundred and twenty-five pages long you expect more than just build up for what takes place in the last one hundred pages. Most of the book is dialect and meeting new characters, with only four or five actual action scenes. John Corey is always making sarcastic comments, whether in his head or to the people around him, this does start out as funny making the novel a little more light-hearted but it soon becomes tedious since he seems to be complaining about every little thing that takes place. However the intrigue is certainly there but it is so drawn out that I couldn't sit and focus on this book at one time, I kept putting it down and reading a different book. It took me four days to make it through this book, and considering I read a book a day that is saying something. I can't judge whether this is just one of those books that was a \\"miss\\" for the series since this is the first Nelson DeMille book that I have ever read, but the writing and storyline leads me to believe that the others may have been better than this one. I must admit though the ending is superb even if you have to wade through some uninteresting content to get there.<br />I was sent a free copy of this book for an honest review.

B00973DDN2|4.0|The new Killers album has an air of nostalgic melancholy about it.  What really struck me are the abundant references to Nevada and the desert, which reminded me strongly of the sense of place Springsteen managed to inject into his early albums.  A lot of the songs are looking back at the past and wistfully remembering those times.  Not as buoyant as Day & Age, The Killers take a more subdued tone here, the music perfectly complementing the lyrical bent of each song.  It's a simple and beautiful album.<br /><br />I found myself thinking of Las Vegas, where I was born and haven't been back to since my family left in the mid-80s.  Battle Born brought to mind riding in my dad's Ford LTD on Charleston Avenue or on a desert road on Nellis AFB.  Living in a tiny apartment in North Las Vegas, waiting for housing to open up on the base.  Walking to school each day once we did get on the base.  Watching the desert sun kissing the blonde-brown hair of the first girl I fell in love with.  The lights of the Strip and the sound of fighter jets cruising overhead.  These songs whispered all that and more to me.
B000002KCF|5.0|If one is working within the parameters of the jazz/funk sub genre,it helps (but is not required) to be a musically educated conceptualist. And that doesn't necessarily mean a degree either,though that does help. Sometimes practical experience helps with these matters. Having recorded his debut in 1973,Michael Franks was such a person with a wonderful way with words and a fine wit in his songwriting. Not to mention a quiet,relaxed yet sly vocal technique. On his second try on the Reprise label this time he turned to producer Tommy LiPuma (Herbie Hancock,Al Jarreau) and the Crusaders Wilton Felder,Larry Carlton and Joe Sample to help out with the music. The results,in terms of the artist are historic.<br /><br />  Basically this album does for Michael Franks what 'We Got By' did for Al Jarreau;it presented Franks' individual talents very much outfront with musical concepts that zeroed right in on jazzy melodies and funky grooves. \\"Nightmoves\\",\\"St.Elmo's Fire\\" and the closer \\"Mr.Blue\\" are perfect examples of Frank's signature style on the slower end of things. With it's playful innuendo the swinging \\"Eggplant\\" and \\"Popsicle Toes\\" are both standouts to me,and particularly from the jazzy end of things. Of course being Crusaders are on this album \\"Monkey See-Monkey Do\\" throws down with some cool,clean,chunky style funk. \\"Sometimes I Just Forget To Smile\\" has a bluesy Larry Carlton-style (of course) rocking soul/jazz type groove .<br /><br />  The easier going melodies of \\"I Don't Know Why I'm So Happy I'm Said\\" and the jazzy \\"Jive\\" round out the extra meat of this album musically. Basically Michael Franks' approach is somewhat the flip side of what Steely Dan were doing at that time;his music comes in on the lower key end of the jazz/funk spectrum,he takes a singer/songwriter approach to his music and his eccentricities are playfully implicit rather than being darkly cryptic. It would seem like such a good world to me to have bands such as the Crusaders,with people like Wilton Felder and Joe Sample,playing on records both with Donald Fagan and Michael Franks almost in tandem with each other. This represents the height of the funk era to me in terms of different jazz and soulful grooves coming together through the filter of funk and loosening up both the grooves,words and messages.Wilton Felder and Joe Sample,playing on records both with Donald Fagan and Michael Franks almost in tandem with each other.

1455502758|3.0|Christopher Hitchens had planned a longer book, expanding on the themes of \\"living dyingly\\" and cancer etiquette, but died before he could finish the work.  Several of the pieces in 'Mortality' originally appeared in Vanity Fair magazine, and until the book came out, could be read on the magazine's website.  Shortly before publication of 'Mortality', the articles were taken down, although many of the articles Hitch wrote for the magazine over the years can still be found on the website.  I give this three stars because of the searing, beautifully written articles, but as others have said, there really wasn't enough material for a book.  When you factor in the forward written by Hitch's Vanity Fair editor Graydon Cater, and the afterword written by his widow Carol Blue, you have an even thinner Hitchens \\"book\\". The scattering of random Hitch notes at the end seems to have been added in another attempt to flesh out what is essentially a few essays published in one place.  Save your money and wait until the price comes down.  It definitely is a must have for Hitch's readers, but not at the absurd price.

However, this movie is layered with the typical Disney shallow characters and stupid antics that is in all their other movies of the past 20 or so years. I wish Disney would stop making movies that 'sell' and start telling good stories with some depth again. Thank goodness I only paid $1.99 for the 48-hour rental.

0316069434|5.0|This newest book by Michael Connelly in the Detective Harry Bosch series opens in 1992, when LA was in the throes of the civil unrest resulting in over 50 murders that followed the Rodney King police beating trial.  Harry is called to the scene of a murder in the heart of South -Central LA, 45 miles from the suburban courtroom where the all-white jury had acquitted four LAPD officers accused of excessively beating a black motorist.  The victim was a white woman, a 32-year-old blond photojournalist from Denmark.  He was able to work the crime scene for less than an hour before being called out to other murders in the ongoing insanity.<br /><br />Twenty years later, Harry is now working in the cold case squad.  Now that \\"the 20th anniversary of the riots was approaching, the media savvy Chief of Police sent a directive to the lieutenant in charge of the Open-Unsolved Unit ordering a fresh look at all unsolved murders that occurred during the unrest in 1992 . . .  The chief wanted to be able to say that all unsold ed murders from the riots were still under active investigation.\\"  His old case has been pulled from the archives is now his to pick up again, and solve if he can.<br /><br />The case was dubbed \\"the Snow White murder,\\" unwittingly putting a racial spin on an horrific act of brutality.  Now, years later, the thought that of all the racial tension and countless acts of arson, looting, and murder that had taken place, the one cold case that might actually be solved from those days would be that of a young white woman, does not go over well.  To Harry, it is simply a matter of justice, to a victim over whose body he whispered an apology twenty years before, despite the fact that his relentless pursuit of that justice puts his career in jeopardy.<br /><br />The \\"black box\\" of the title has more than one meaning here, but its primary meaning is a reference to the one crucial piece of evidence, analogous to the one thing looked for after a plane mishap, \\"the one thing that makes it all make sense.\\"  Slowly but surely, and despite the intervening decades, new leads start to emerge, and Bosch becomes reinvigorated, as does the reader.  The book is not a page-turner in the usual sense, i.e.,  with suspense-driven tension and breath held, but `simply' a terrific story, wonderfully well-told, that grips the reader and keeps him/her anxious to find out what will happen next as the story unfolds.  And just when the reader thinks all the pieces of the puzzle are there, the author has one more surprise in store.  This is a police procedural in the best sense of the term, and of the genre, and it is highly recommended.

Glad I bought the 5 story edition because had I stopped after the first book I would have been disappointed. The story just kept getting better and by the time I was on number 3 I could not put it down. If you read this on a Kindle, as I did, make sure you read past the Q and A section at the end of book 5 to find a lone chapter that I thought important to the story. I've suggested this book to friends and coworkers and hope to read more on these characters in the future.

0385535147|4.0|Forty-something Malcolm Bannister, a lawyer, is in a Federal, low-security correctional facility because he naively was maneuvered into laundering money by a notorious scam artist. He hates being in prison, but now he has a way out. He claims to know who assassinated a Virginia Federal judge Raymond Fawcett. But his information comes at a price: discharge from prison, a new identity, and the hefty reward once the individual he names is indicted. The pressure on the FBI is unrelenting; they have no choice but to accept his offer.<br /><br />And so begins this page-turning book which follows Malcolm, now Max, in his journey after prison executing an elaborate plan of revenge and enrichment that merely got started the day he fingered an alleged murderer. It is amazing that Malcolm could have that much foresight to construct a plan that would play out over several months involving several individuals and locations. It does strain plausibility, but not that much. The big questions are \\"has he crossed the line of illegality\\" and \\"can he stay one step ahead of various law enforcement agencies with their immense power and reach?\\" A return to prison would be devastating.

The only thing we have in common is we both endorse dropping the dairy.<br /><br />There are nearly 100 of highly scientific thorough 1-star scores for this book which I suggest you read if you don't take my word for it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Without a doubt, the best movie of 2012! It has plenty of action, great one liners, ad awesome heroes. People of all ages should enjoy this film!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|The blu-ray version is missing the duet with Mr. Caine  and Bell. The technical improvements are not worth the chopped version of the movie. What is the sense of taking out valuable content and then adding in better technology ?
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|No, despite what I'm about to say, I don't think Robert Plant is perfect.  I just think he's about as close as one can ever be.<br />The fact that he has been singing, writing, playing for somewhere in the neighbourhood of half a century and can and does still seek out new ways to express and share his gifts is uniquely remarkable in itself.<br />In working with Alison Krauss - a combination few if any but T. Bone Burnett could have conceived - he won 5 Grammy Awards at the age of 60.  Every catagory in which they were nominated including Album of the Year.<br />Band of Joy is another pivot giving a different perspective.  Whether he can hit high notes or not is, to me irrelevant.  As with Krauss, he can take Zeppelin tunes and give them new life and a beauty that was, perhaps before unseen.  His voice is every bit as remarkable, beautiful and emotively expressive as ever it was.  A whisper of a lyric with a bit of blues and soul embellishment is every bit the equal of the gut-wrenching screams from his Zeppelin days.<br />He is also a fantastic interview.  Humour, self-deprecation, insight, intelligent, always seeking, honesty without tedious detail.  The rather impish twinkle that has always been in his eyes reflects, I think, a love of life and exploration.  Learning, openness, fearlessness and the burning urge to squeeze every drop out of life.  What more could one ask.  Working with other great artists ?  He's got that too.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie for all ages.  Everyone in our family enjoyed watching it together. We can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B00367XA1K|5.0|One of the best films ever in my opinion.  The depth, breadth and perspective of a love story amidst one of the most interesting and exciting periods in history.  The costumes, scenery, dialogue are impeccable.  An excellent cast.  Many &#34;tidbits&#34; that give a story believability, life and often humour - as the &#34;don't smoke comrades&#34; bit where they keep on smoking is a good example.<br />The character's determination and development struggle with the crumbling of dreams is  most poignian.  The realities of war and just how wrong good intentions can go should be a lesson for all.  The beauty in the internationality of joining a variety of movements into the revolution and the American fear of anything that threatens the &#34;profits&#34; (best line in the film) of the elite juxtaposed holds far too many truths to this day.<br />A beautiful, passionate, poetic, epic view of &#34;Ten Days that Shook the World&#34; so-to-speak is magnificent.  BTW - IMHO, 2nd best bits of dialogue - the conversation between Louise Bryant and Eugene O'Neil wherein she calls him a &#34;wounding son-of-a-bitch.&#34;
0937381888|5.0|This is the most comprehensive and comprehensible brewing book I've encountered. It covers set up, equipment, extract, and all grain brewing. It even has some sections that go more deeply into different topics (these are near the back and you don't need to read them to brew). It contains excellent recipes and helpful charts and pictures. I refer to this every time I brew. I recommend this book to anyone who asks me about homebrewing and I could not speak more highly of it.
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|you have to get 9/16&#34; 1 1/2&#34; washers to balance small lightweight camcorders , but once you get it balance it works great
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; by Gillian Flynn and I LOVED it.  This one of hers is not quite as good; it's okay.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I LOVE this series! No sex, NO swearing! A wonderful way to revisit your younger days with a new spin on fairy tales!
B0085776BG|4.0|This is a fun movie which covers a lot more than just a bunch of black fliers in WWII.  These guys had what it takes; and a lot more. A solid, well acted story with believable fighting scenes about some very brave fliers who fought he enemy as well as overcoming prejudice in their own military.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|My kids love this and I like the message that this gives.  Great characters and friendships.  Fun for adults and kids to watch.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I am so happy that I bought this wonderful game!  Scenes are clear. and consise.  Storyline is very good and creepy!  Game keeps you on task with searching out the items.  I just can't see how anyone wouldn't like this long game!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie makes me happy every time I see it.  Definitely a classic to me.  Puts me in the mood for Christmas.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Its ok. Not as good as virtual city in my opinion. But that's just my opinion...seems I prefer levels to ongoing activity.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is an awesome video. I saw results after only 2 weeks.  Makes muscles a lot more toned in a short period of time.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie is easily 5 stars. It is so good, there really is no need to go into any explanations whatsoever!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the graphics are very colorful, and the music is great. i love that i can play this game by myself or with friends. and it is so nice to have no violence in a game. any age group can enjoy this game.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|The book came in 2 days and is in excellent condition.  It looks like I just brought it home from a brick store but now I have to wait for the first one in the series before I can read this one.  The cover has some dimples in it but I've seen that in stores so it is excellent.  Thanks
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting premise I still thinking about it weeks after finishing it. I had never read a Stephen King before highly recommend it!
B003H9MSPG|3.0|While I have been a fan of nerf guns ever since the longshot, this one is a bit of a dissapointment.<br /><br />This gun's functionality is great. The clip system allows for fast reloads.<br />But the gun is very average.  It is supposed to be a sniper rifle in every way but the ranges are just as good if not lower than many nerf guns.  It has a reverse plunger system.  This means that the insides of this are very similar to that of other non- sniper nerf guns (recon, alpha trooper, raider).  This makes for a very average gun.<br /><br />If you want this as your first nerf gun, it will work and function properly but be warned this IS NO SNIPER. It shoots no farther than any other nerf gun.<br /><br />In the end this gun will work fine if you buy it, but it would be smarter to invest in a different nerf gun.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|this is a wonderful movie with a great message  of accepting people and appreciating them for who they are. it is rated PG, so it is not as racy as it sounds! my husband and i rented it, but then decided to buy a copy so that we could watch it again. i highly recommend this movie.and also, it is based on a true story about a shoe factory in england. check it out!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I would like the books of the Bible put back at the beginning. it is easier for older people or in other words seniors.  Thank you
B0088EDMMS|4.0|fun movie! bette midler's music makes this enjoyable movie even better. fun for adults and children alike. i would recommend this movie for the whole family.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is a great band.  I would call it modern folk music, Dirty Paws and LittleTalk are my favorites but the other songs are great also.
B008458O3S|5.0|fun gameplay, challenging levels, definitely a great game to lose track of time while playing.  i enjoyed this game more than games such as angry birds
B000SEI230|5.0|!!!I highly recommend this book. I dont even read alot and this book was easy, fun and sweet. Definitely worth reading!
B007K3JCAE|1.0|Don't waste your money on this version.  The digital copy cannot be downloaded through iTunes.  It is ultraviolet/flixster - in other words, useless/worthless.
B008I43DYU|3.0|This is a decent, basic calculator.  I am surprised, however, that such a basic application wouldn't come pre-loaded.  Again, nothing spectacular, but it is functional.
0451418441|5.0|World Without End picks up where Pillars Of The Earth stops. One should read the first book before attempting to get into the second. It's all about life in old England, and not just life, but intriguing life.<br /><br />If you are a fan of history, especially of European history, then this book is for you. Ken Follett, the master storyteller, brings it all to life in a fascinatingly colorful way.<br /><br />He lets you into the intimate lives of kings, queens, peasants, warriors, and the church with its tyrannical officials who delight into condemning people for witchcraft.<br /><br />This story has it all:love and hate, war and peace, beauty and ugliness, holiness and sinfulness, joy and sorrow, everything. It is a true epic loosely based on real events, and a book which is very hard to put down.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|As a first CD, I did not expect it to be what I got.  Congrats to Phillip for using an awesome band, sound manager, and 15 songs.  Most 1st cds are short and have songs which sound hurried, rushed - but this one is crisp.  I think he sounds way better than he did on Idol and his voice will only get better with age.  Where has he been hiding.  I DIG IT.  Keep more coming.  Looking forward to seeing him in concert.  Note that my favorite artists are Eric Clapton, Robert Plant, Bob Dylan, Sting, and Jim Morrison.  I have seen them all in concert on several occasions (sans Jim) and think that this kid is among the greats.  Hope to see him rise to the top.
B007MS5B6Q|2.0|I love this show, but I don't want that discusting head in my living room.  Can't you buy the season 2 special edition without the gross zombie head?????
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett knows how to write a good story and I love the way he weaves the history into the story line.  A rollicking good read!
B006VGGAC4|3.0|I enjoyed reading about his childhood, time in the army, bodybuilding and movies. He didn't reveal much though. Not much mention of his love child or steroid usage. Wasn't a tell all book but I still enjoyed it. Arnold is a very determined person.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app! It lets you read books on your tablet or phone anytime! If you're a bookworm like me, you will love this app!
0743457900|4.0|Le Carre writes really well, but sometimes his books can be tiresomely long, not too long to stop reading, but off-putting. Frankly, after reading it, I much prefer the BBC television series made in the 70's, I think.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Zooey never fails to deliver something adorable, and she along with M. Ward definitely deliver adorable Christmas spirit with this album. From old favorites to originals, they liven up the songs on this album with a charm only they could convey.
B00785P2QC|5.0|cool .....,..,... and a good pass time ....play this game every day and night my kid love this game play ti all the time and fun to wach
B007Y1S2HQ|2.0|This eagerly-awaited CD was a bit of a disappointment. Rumer is an amazingly talented artist.  But her latest offering lacks the sparkle and freshness of her earlier CD &#34;Seasons of My soul&#34;.<br />On &#34;Seasons&#34; her mellow alto voice was eerie in it's similarity to Karen Carpenter's voice, but she still had her own unique style.<br />On &#34;Boys Don't Cry&#34; she leans heavily on the Carpenter sound, even with the familiar background harmony &#34;Ahhhhhs&#34;. Even her hairstyle on the cover is Karen.  We can hear Karen Carpenter sound-alikes in any Karaoke bar. Rumer is capable of much better.
0525953728|5.0|I got this book because of the controversy I heard on the news. I found nothing surprising in it, AKA submitting national secrets, and throughly enjoyed the book.
B009X01C64|5.0|I have been using various Marware cases over the years.  This by far is the BEST they have ever produced.  It is solid and well thought out.  You can tell they spent a lot of time thinking about this device.  I had my doubts when I saw the rotation function.  I did not expect to find such a well planned item.  Your Fire rests securely in the solid plastic base.  It is formed to match the fire.  In fact if you have seen the official amazon cover the actual plastic holder looks a lot like it except of course this one rotates.<br /><br />The rotation is very easy to do.  At the bottom of the holder ,in both portrait and landscape modes is a small plastic tab that secures the cover to the base.<br /><br />I tried all kinds of different locations and applications and frankly could not find one instance where I could not use this case.<br /><br />If you will be using your Fire at work this will pay for itself.  You will keep your Fire safe while adding usability.<br /><br />They really are to be congratulated on form meeting function.  It often seems like cases such as this are rushed through product development at the expense of quality.  Someone at Marware got this puppy right on.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I love to listen to Barbara Streishand as she is one of my favorite female singers. Once again she comes through!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|a really fast paced action adventure. I could not put it down. i recommend this book to all adventure fans
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Best Angry Birds so far! I would recommend it to anybody, get it now... it is free, so what is there to lose?
B008M721MS|5.0|This is a fab tablet!The color and the picture is best to none! my grandson will love this. I am planing for me also!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing! I very rarely want to immediately reread it when I'm finished with a book, but as soon as I finished I wanted to reread it! It's a wonderful story, and because it's told through written letters, you feel like you're talking to a friend. It was incredible!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm Gunna bite you then stretch you. Mmmm I love being a zombie havin a tv show finally puts us in the spot light
B005KELQEU|1.0|The description states that this item is for use with a Kindle; however, when it arrived, I attempted to put my Kindle reader (not a Kindle Fire) in there and the case is way too small.  The description is misleading and incorrect.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|Still like this movie, originally saw it in Big Bear CA, good fun action movie of it's time. Great cast and a good action thriller, reccomend.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I looked forward to reading this book as soon as it came out. Ms Morton did not disappoint. I have read all of her books and have become an avid Kate Morton fan, recommending her to all friends in book club.
B008OUSFVO|5.0|I love every song on the CD and I just love her voice.  Simply Beautiful!!  It is very refreshing to hear someone that can truly sing in that age of &#34;studio magic&#34; , booty shaking, and little to no talent.
B000FCJZUO|5.0|I loved the story of Rosie Dunne and her best friend Alex Stewart. I found that I could not put my kindle down, (my media of choice) at the click of every page I anticipated Rosie finally telling Alex how she felt or Alex finally admitting to the silence. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up from the very satisfied reader.
B005LAJ17M|3.0|I gave this a three star (instead of one) as it has a quite interesting storyline, and superb acting from the two main characters. We'd never watched an episode on TV, but had seen a number of ads for it on other channels. Also, we loved &#34;24&#34; and being from the same producers we were happy to order this It was listed as &#34;No Rating&#34; so gave content no thought. HOWEVER in the opening minutes of the first episode you're suddenly in the bedroom with a couple engaged in the most graphic sex scene I believe I've ever seen on a screen. (If I watched cheap porno films I probably would have.) My wife and I did not enjoy the groaning, sweating, humping duo, and wondered what you'd do if children were present. While &#34;24&#34; could be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 10, &#34;Homeland&#34; is quite different. The language is from the gutter, and the (what turned out to be an adultrous) couple's gyrations were far from the only incident. I checked the back of the BlueRay package again, and found in the tiniest of print at the bottom that the content included graphic sex and (foul) language. It's a shame that they took a great story and dragged it through the mud. The result is garbage.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It picks up right where The Maze Runner left off. It has a lot more action. It's a little darker and has more twists.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The ending of the book came too soon.  I didn't feel like I had adequate closure.  The book itself was extremely well written and I had a hard time putting it down but I wanted more after reading the last few lines.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app does not work on the kindle fire hd 8.9&quot; - as many have stated it just shows a few posts and then just spins that little circle at the bottom and never loads more. i have a few android devices and this is the only one i have this problem with. i assume they'll fix it soon, as this device has only been out for a week or so? For now, one star. I cant even use it.
0374214913|4.0|This book, which deftly combines books and technology in the search for meaning, is a truly charming novel.  Robin Sloan has managed to write a novel that examines our relationship with technology and how we use it while still keeping an almost cozy atmosphere in the novel.  The characters are quirky and likable, the quest interesting, and the ending just the right amount of sappy.  For book clubs:  This is a quick read that is generally upbeat, yet still allows for great discussion of theme.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is my first time playing solitaire online and this app is fun and easy. its also challenging and competive.
B0034C9CFK|5.0|Alan Jackson is greeat period. I would give anything to be able to go to his concert.  Wow he is great
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazing!  When things come together all is possible.  Gotta love intelligence community.  They are true heroes to my way of thinking.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I've read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. This another classic from Ken Follett. If you're a historical fiction fan, this book will take you through the early 1900's through the end of the WWI in a way that helps you understand the events like no history book ever would. Very fascinating read.
034580404X|5.0|Good for open minded people, sensitive people, bold people.  Very good.  Very well written, more people should ready. Very soft.
B00005U122|5.0|This is by far the best concert DVD i have ever purchased. Especially \\"It's a Miracle\\", \\"Perfect Sence\\" and \\"Dogs\\", absolutely brilliant. I would highly recommend buying this DVD. I hope a blu ray comes out soon.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is an outstanding C.D.  Ray Lamontagne is an outstanding artist.  I enjoy the melodic voice this man possess on each and every song.  It makes a bad day at work seem not quite so bad as I listen on my way home.
B0097BO21G|5.0|This CD might be 15 years old or so, but it's still one of my favorites.  A nice blend of duets and a great selection of songs.  I love upbeat Christmas music!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod Stuart's new styles along with a few of his old ones have become favorites of mine.  This album is no disappointment.  Well done.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This was a well crafted horror story, which showcased the amazing talents of Jessica Lange. The story is gripping and suspenseful, and, as a bonus, Dylan McDermott bares his hunky buns. I would give this 14 stars out of a possible 10.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator.  I will be using this a lot on my Kindle.  Well worth adding this to any Kindle you may have.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|YOU HAVE TO READ THIS ONE. I WASN'T GONING TO READ ALL OF THEAM BUT I COUDN'T PUT IT DOWN.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like Solitaire, you will love this game on your Kindle.  This game is easy to use and fun to play.

B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I have to say I can listen to her music over and over and I was surprised to see that she wrote most of the music. Can't wait but will have to for the next CD.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Game is really fun... similar to farmville and other facebook games. only downfall is you shouldn't have to purchase acorns&hellip; there should be easier ways to earn them faster and in larger quantities, or things shouldn't cost as much.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|Test device: HTC EVO LTE 4G, stock ICS<br /><br />With Google Maps with navigation built right into my phone, and most everyone's phone these days, who needs an extra navigation app?  Well, maybe you!<br /><br />Waze tries to make getting from Point A to Point B into a social event.  It does this by not only adding in groups for you to join, but also by allowing the posting of messages/alerts for other Waze users in the area.  \\"Look out, cop ahead!\\"  Nifty, for sure, but perhaps a little questionable depending on your local laws about messaging while driving.  The gas price features are nice, as is the rerouting based on changing traffic conditions.  The UI itself is very easy to use, quite intuitive.  Of course, it has to function as a navigation device too, which I feel it does very well at, with accurate directions when compared to Google Maps and my glovebox loving Garmin.  Seriously, it's a very full functioned app.<br /><br />Waze does have some nagging items though, which, for me, keep it from being a 5 star app.  It has some odd ideas on what it means to \\"Turn right/left\\" and \\"Stay to the right/left.\\" Usually, it means turn, not stay.  Depending on where you live, there might not be many other Waze users, which negates a lot of the community based functions, like traffic reporting.  The rerouting function is a bit slow on the uptake, and the notification that there is an alternate route isn't too obvious unless you have your phone in your face or recognize the tone.<br /><br />On the whole, it's a pretty good app, and I'll be keeping it.<br /><br />*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse. Please note the date of this review, as it may contain info that is no longer accurate.*
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones was great in this movie.  The setting was detailed, the overall plot was a little cliche, but there were many surprises and unique ideas. A couple parts were a little corny, but the rest of the movie made up for them. Another actor that nailed his performance was the Confederate General. I bought it. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, it's definitely worth the price and I'll probably watch it a few more times down the road.
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|I love this movie!  I saw it first in the movie theater and had to keep going back as I missed some clues.  I love this movie because it definitely makes you think.  I won't share too much as I don't want to give away any info from the movie.  Guy Pearce does a great job with his character and taking you along for the ride.
B001AITH50|5.0|Arthur and myself both enjoyed the movie very much.  The screenplay is great, the players were wonderful, the costumes and makeup top shelf.  I'd read the book many years ago, and the movie did not leave me feeling less entertained than the book.<br />I would have given it 4 1/2 stars, but Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Christian Slater and Antonio Bandaros pushed that last half of star right out of me :)
B0087HT36U|5.0|very challenging game with a plethora of levels. the controls are easy to understand. graphics are awesome. this is a must have for anyone. just need the new levels to be released.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I believe this was the best book in the trilogy. Actually turns out to be a very good love story
B000002OZY|5.0|One of the most important Rock'n roll album of whole history!<br />The album concept is realy amazing. I recommend definitively.
B007857FOO|1.0|This is NOT what you will get when your order comes in. It is just a regular 2 disc special edition. Not the white box made to like like Bella's dress. Not collectors edition at all.
B000002OX7|5.0|Expetacular! An album to listen all the time. A rock'n roll classic, with singles to be remembered over the music history.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've spent the last two months on a leave of absence and have read some awesome books. I love romance and comedy and anything concerning marriage, dating, that type of thing. To date, my favorite book which I highly recommend is [[ASIN:1470000342 Note to Self]] by Valentine deFrancis. It had me laughing, crying, and then taken aback by the ending. It's such a great read if you're over forty, divorced and dating. I can go down a long line of great books, such as Marriage Bargain, but I want to mention Reflected in You. I really loved this book. I read a few of Sylvia's books but this turned out to be my favorite of hers. I'm giving it 5 stars and totally recommend it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoying it on Kindle Fire H D. Graphics good, reliable, no forced closes. Touch sensitivity is good, having fun with it
B000JJS8TM|4.0|Featuring music compiled and remixed as a mashup for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name, This album contains very creative versions of Beatles song, re-engineered by George Martin and his son Giles.  Much more than merely remastered or remixed, it is a collage of many songs interlaced with one another.  The end result is a fresh take on the classic Beatles spirit.  This album is a treasure for the dedicated Beatles fan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Quick and easy with minimum of movement.  Very efficient tapping with quick reaction.  Enjoyable way to pass the time. Recommed to all solitaire enthusiasts.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|They will have to combine all three books and completely change the dialogue to make one hour long movie, because nothing happens. And the writing is terrible.
0596522347|5.0|Taglines usually grab me more than titles. As creative as slide:ology is as a title, it was the tagline, \\"The art and science of creating great presentations\\" that grabbed me to read this book. It also helped I had come across Nancy Duarte's blog and discovered that the art of great presentations begins with great story telling.<br /><br />Nancy lays out her approach early in the book, \\"Every presenter has the potential to be great; every presentation is high stakes; and every audience deserves the absolute best.\\"<br /><br />In pursuing that best, I read slide:ology and was not disappointed. Nancy emphasizes the importance of connecting with the audience, not merely communicating the presenter's agenda. The goal is to create ideas, not merely great slides. There's connection. There's process. And for me, there's a lot to learn.<br /><br />I appreciated how Nancy walked me through steps in the presentation from conception to design to arrangement to engagement with the audience. One of my favorite parts was 5 principles to present your data in the clearest possible way:<br /><br />1. Tell the truth.<br /><br />2. Get to the point.<br /><br />3. Pick the right tool for the job.<br /><br />4. Highlight what's important.<br /><br />5. Keep it simple. (I liked this one best of all!)<br /><br />If you are a novice like me when it comes to putting together presentations and you want to get better, this book is a great resource to read and to refer to on a regular basis.<br /><br />I appreciated Nancy not forcing her philosophy of slide:ology but showing how great communicators like techno-evangelist Guy Kawasaki uses slides to pastors like John Ortberg. She even shared times the best use of slides is not to use them at all.<br /><br />Content is not only key, but connection with the audience is king. Pictures are best used that tie into the message, and she showed how to make pictures best tie into the message.<br /><br />I give Slide:ology 5 out of 5 stars. It is a reference I will refer to often and is a great tool for further growth in one's presentation skills. The book delivered what it promised -- the art and science of creating great presentations!nce I will refer to often and is a great tool for further growth in one's presentation skills.

B008IGP8RI|4.0|My hat's off to ANYONE who could talk Ralph Stanley into singing \\"White Light/White Heat\\"... or maybe they just told him the song is about moonshine.<br /><br />I wonder if he has even heard of the Velvet Underground or Lou Reed?<br /><br />In any case, what a phenomenal soundtrack this is.  Wow.  Nick Cave, Emmy Lou, Ralph Stanley??? Holy Crap.<br /><br />Just fit the movie perfectly.  I heard this watching the movie.  Have NOT heard it without a movie to go along!  :)
145162607X|5.0|I was amazed at how fast my order was shipped. I am very pleased. My order arrived in very good condition.  I absolutely love it.  Phillippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors.  I have all of the other books in The Cousins War series.  I needed this book to complete my set. Gregory has penned another best seller.
B009LUCPWQ|4.0|Great album and worthy follow up to the string of 70's and 80's albums, I really liked GP's solo stuff as well, but the fuller sound of the Rumour really adds to the overall mix. We're all growing older but hearing GP still pissed off makes me feel so much younger.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I own a few of the Sherlock Holmes books, but it is so convenient (and cheap!) to have them all in one place. Thanks!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game, you can actually play it without having to do all the crap like &quot;ask a friend for more wood &quot; etc
B00992CF6W|5.0|I pick this game because it is fun. I have minecraft on my computer. so I click on minecraft on my kindle and it did come up. so my last thing I had to do is put minecraft and I saw it so I was happy.
1599290642|5.0|Still the best measure of the genre. What I always really enjoy about Spectrum is the representation of not only what is really happening in the field but also the representation of the best in the field and the best in illustration. Tastes will always vary but excellence can still be measured by the best in Spectrum.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|There are many different layouts of the game to play, What makes it interesting is that play is rated by time it takes to solve each laqyout.
145210655X|5.0|For all I love Star Wars, I sometimes get a little tired of the serious tone the spinoff books and comics take.  Surely if there's room for drama, suspense, romance, and even horror in the Star Wars universe, then there should be room for some humor as well.  Sadly, all too often the writers of the Expanded Universe books and comics take their jobs all too seriously.<br /><br />\\"Darth Vader and Son\\" makes no effort to take itself seriously, and while it may be entirely outside the \\"official\\" Star Wars canon, it's an adorable and funny read for any Star Wars fan, especially if they happen to be parents as well.<br /><br />The premise of the book is quite simple -- what if Darth Vader, one of the most recognizable and infamous movie villains of all time, had to raise his young son?  It doesn't tell a complete story, but rather is a series of one-shot comics that show snippets of the Vader/Skywalker family's life.  Vader and Luke go to the zoo, get ready for school, tour the Death Star, go trick-or-treating and grocery shopping, and otherwise experience the father/son dynamic they never really had a chance at having in the movies.<br /><br />Jeffrey Brown's art style, while not as epic as that of the Star Wars comics, fits the subject matter quite well, and he has a knack for including small details for hardcore fans to catch and giggle over.  Some of the scenarios are funny simply because they involve Vader in typical parenting scenarios, while others draw on dialogue, characters, and scenes from the movies and depict them in new and amusing ways.  And of course, Luke manages to still be Luke despite being four years old and tagging along in Vader's bootprints.<br /><br />After reading this for myself (it's a very quick read, about ten minutes, though always good to go back for another browse-through) I gave to my mom, a non-Star-Wars fan.  Her reaction was that it was \\"warped, but cute.\\"  Make of that what you will...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't actually have this game but I have played it. it could be better by adding chests. and I don't think you can grow wheat.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Got caught up in this series from the first show. Not usually into Horror stories, but this one takes the cake. Love the back and forth time frames to let you in on why there are so many unhappy spirits living in this home.<br />Already caught up in Season 2 on FX. That was a little slow in the beginning, but the pace and interest will quicken.<br />Using same Actors, half the challenge is to figure out who was who in season 1.

B005FITIK0|4.0|Did see this in the Theater first. Was hoping to catch something I might have missed. But to see Charlize in such a unhappy character in her life and love (lack of) was very convincing. A movie to watch to make you feel better about your OWN troubles.

B008XMXFS6|4.0|There's no need for lengthy arguments here.  If you like The Darkness, this is more of The Darkness, which is more than many fans expected for several years and a welcome surprise for the same.  If you don't like The Darkness, this record's not going to change your mind.<br />But if you haven't given them a listen before and you like artists in the vein of Queen or AC/DC, then this is definitely worth your time.<br /><br />For my money, this is better than &#34;One Way Ticket to Hell...and Back&#34; (their 2nd album), but not quite as epic as &#34;Permission to Land&#34; (their 1st album).

B009SIE6AA|4.0|I generally prefer original recordings of older Christmas favorites, but James Taylor's recordings are unobtrusive and not overly produced, which makes them much more pleasant to listen to than similar &#34;Christmas albums&#34; by other pop artists.  These tracks are also faithful renditions (e.g. original lyrics to &#34;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&#34;) that do justice to the original songs and may even offer a fresh, stripped-down take on some of them.<br /><br />Definitely a must-have for James Taylor fans or anyone looking for a solid collection of classic Christmas songs.

B009GESJH2|3.0|I was really excited to have ordered this CD. As usual though, Bobby Ritchie talks it up to be closer to his &#34;old school&#34; style. IMO there is only one song that even comes close to the old school Kid Rock and that is &#34;Cucci Galore&#34;. Love that song!<br /><br />I also like &#34;Lets Ride&#34; written as a tribute for our Troops, it's a great song and will give our troops something to get pumped up too before carrying out a mission. Other than those 2 songs, I don't have much use for the country/twang sound.<br /><br />Oh and Detroit Michigan....well it's way to simplistic. I'm from Detroit and don't find the song to be a good fit. I like that it honors some of the great musicians that have come out of this town, but if he was gonna take the original song and change it up, I think he could have done a better job of that. I actually like the original song more than this one.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I got interested in the book after I saw Ms Rowling's TV interview with Charlie Rose. She came across as a sharp observer of people's lives in their day-to-day situations (despite of her billionaire status and fabulous success with Harry Potter).<br /><br />She is a remarkable human being in how she handles her success and responds to her critics.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This is an easy, rather witty book without any real substance.  It was fine for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  It reminds me a lot of Forrest Gump-- and I wasn't all that keen on Forrest Gump. The book is completely ridiculous and you really have to be willing to suspend all disbelief but some of the characters are likeable.  I was glad I was able to borrow it from the kindle library as I wouldn't have wanted to pay full price.  In short, it was an okay romp.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|a sequel worth watching. who would have thought Robert Downey Jr. would be a good detective, but he's at it again, as a quirky Sherlock who knows his stuff.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|As a life long Star Wars fan, I'm very excited about this game.  Its lots of fun, but some of the levels are very difficult to figure out.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is definitely a masterpiece. I have read this book probably 9 times now. No kidding! I first picked the book up in 2001 when I was in high school. I can honestly say that this was the first book I actually \\"read\\" straight through without hardly putting down. The character development is very well done. Specifically with Sabriel coming into her own as The Abhorsen. Mogget, the cat, is a very funny comic relief, where as, Touchstone the sworn sword for her, is the strong silent type. All three characters blend together to make a wonderful fantasy novel. It's full of action adventure, suspense, comedy little romance. Everything a good novel should be. I would suggest to anyone who is a fantasy fan, read this book and the entire series.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Since I was used to using Adobe to read PDFs on the computer, I started with that.  However on the Kindle, ezPDF reader turns out to be much more practical.  There are a number of helpful features on this app that are not included with Adobe, but even with just the basics, this app is much easier to use.<br /><br />I wish only that there was some way to organize all of my hundreds of PDF books and docs into folders or categories.

B0000DCGT5|2.0|Riding a runaway train downhill, this mess of a third outing suffers from a seemingly rushed production and lazy setup that found half of the original cast missing (why bother?) and helplessly regurgitated jokes that didn't work that well the first time and certainly don't work that well the third.  The problem is that nothing feels fresh or new and everything is laced with this overwhelming feeling of desperation.  This is coming from someone who still enjoys the original `American Pie', despite it losing its effect upon subsequent viewings (it is one of those films that is never as funny the second time around, which is odd).  The cast is bored with this, even Seann William Scott (who I firmly believe should have been considered for a Supporting Actor nomination back in 1999) and the plot points just never exceed past the moderately low bar set by the second film (which was better than this but leagues below the original).  All the obvious wedding humor is used, and a slew of gags feel like lazy rip offs of jokes used in the first and second installments.  I was surprised, but then again I guess I shouldn't have been.

B0082Z447U|4.0|&#34;the woman in white&#34; is one of my comfort books--something i like to re-read every few years, especially when i'm feeling low. i love the fact that i can have it at my fingertips (i downloaded the ebook edition).<br />it's a great novel. i first read it in school and it still thrills after so many re-readings.
B009346RSS|5.0|I got this because I wanted audio out of the PS3 to an old receiver. This is stereo only, and the PS3 will only do 16/44 on the optical out. It's ready to do 192/24 though. I tried it on my CD player at 192 with the Wall and again on the PS3 with the same speakers - almost the same. So as far as gaming and watching movies from Netflix and Hulu in bed - Perfect. It's super tiny. I used double sided tape and a 6&#34; toslink cable to attach it to the top of the PS3.
B005LAIGLO|3.0|I have not seen this movie as of yet and am waiting for it to arrive. Mark is a great actor and I can't wait.

B004XWMXW4|2.0|Purchased this because we usually find cello music to be relaxing.  They play fast and probably more recent music which is not slow and relaxing like we wanted.

B000YHG72E|5.0|A great movie for everyone! Its a must every season to watch Elf at least a dozen times each season!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I really do love this album. I am not much of a Twilight fan. I honestly do hate the books, but after a few years (and especially now that the craze is dying down) I watched the films once again and found that I do enjoy them. I actually saw part 2 in theaters, and I never thought that would happen. The soundtracks compiled for each movie have been absolutely amazing. I love the mix of indie/alternative music they use. This album is no exception. If you're looking for super fun, happy go lucky music, then you should have learned by now that that is generally not the type of music used in the films (although I do believe the most \\"upbeat\\" music is found on \\"Eclipse\\" which is my favorite). The soundtrack is indicative of the constant impending doom that is being felt within the story. Not to say the songs aren't fun, but the music that is used for the happy sappy scenes was composed by Carter Burwell.<br /><br />The only song I like, not love, is the song by Greenday. I think that was a strange choice. The Ellie Goulding song, while it may seem like an odd pick (I can't remember where it fits in the film), is actually a nice addition and goes well with the compilation. I LOVE \\"Fire in the Water\\" by Feist. I just really like Feist, so I may be biased. This really is a wonderful mix of music and musicians, and infinitely better than the soundtrack for \\"Breaking Dawn Part 1\\". I think they really dropped the ball on that soundtrack (I'll only be downloading certain songs instead of purchasing the whole album) but they more than made up for it with the final album.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|One of the better versions of Angry Birds. It is fun to play and has some awesome levels. More challenging
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Highly enjoyed watching this movie. Non-stop action. very well scripted. Iron Man stole this one. I would highly recommend this movie to all Marvel Comic book followers.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|I have followed Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton all my life.  They are fantastic actors.  Rachel McAdams has been a favorite actor of mine since The Notebook. You can feel her emotion when you watch her. Patrick Wilson meshes well with Rachel McAdams although she pairs well with anyone.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The continuations of a wonderful love story and adventure.  Our friends just go from one adventure to another.  Sorry it was over when I came to the end of the book.
B0042UEU8M|4.0|I love this movie b/c it's heartfelt w/ beautiful scenery. The lead actress in it is fantastic even though she is not well known. Zac Efron is an amazing actor and I am sure will become even better as he ages. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|People just love to hate this movie. My advice: If you're interested in this movie, watch it for yourself and make your own opinion. Support art and pick it up, redbox, stream it, do you what you gotta do.<br /><br />It's definitely a flawed movie, but far from bad. Well... I guess it depends on what you think are bad movies. If you can't stand movies with cheesy typical characters saying cliche shit, then that will probably break the movie for you. I'm not gonna lie, the biggest thing I was disappointed in was the acting. The actors are forgettable and I'm glad they killed off most of the cast and left the only ones worth watching. Fassbender and the main chick did a pretty good job. The rest of the cast, not so much. But as an artist, I really loved the artistic style and direction. The creativity with set pieces, make up, and the scifi aspects were pretty cool. The thing I liked about the technology is that it was subtle and I think you have to watch the movie more than once to appreciate all the creativity that went into everything on screen. The thing that turns me off about most scifi movies, or at least all the cheap movies on the Scifi channel, is that some series/movies go way too far in the future and becomes Trekkie level scifi that only appeal to the scifi nerds. But this movie has tech that, if we were ever to live this long to explore other planets, seems possible in the future and is not so farfetched.<br /><br />I was really hyped for this film before it came out in theaters because the trailer made it look like the next amazing scifi epic that everyone can enjoy and not just nerds. Needless to say, if any of you were hyped on what they showed in trailers and their ad bits, you were probably disappointed with the final result, and I was a little too. Even the ideas and theological aspects raise a lot of questions, but that's what I ultimately loved about the movie and also what I think people hate on. This movie honestly tries to throw in a lot of ideas about if there really a god, were we created, was Jesus planted on earth and we killed him so now we're paying for it, but I like that there's all these questions. I don't think people understood this movie (which is probably why on the dvd it says in big bold letters \\"ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED\\") and that's unfortunate. Other people will say it makes no sense. I think it makes perfect sense, if you're a smart logical person. The thing I like about Prometheus and its theological ideas is that it made me do a little research after I was done with the movie and form my opinion of what I think happened and that's ultimately what any writer/director wants, for you to be engaged in the movie and think about it after it's done.<br /><br />If you're interested in this movie, JUST WATCH IT. It's not a bad movie, it's just not perfect. If you like scifi and art, please support it.
B00866JL96|4.0|This is a very sensitive and heartfelt movie. It references the war which should be sensitive to all Americans. And it's a great love story.
B00975L81Y|4.0|You can not expect from Dani to scream just like he did in 90's, nor you can wait the band to create such dark and gothic sounds like old times. Time passes, that's the reality. Yet I have found some melodies in the album that gets me and make me murmur even not listening.<br />It is written everywhere that the main concept of the album is &#34;Horror&#34;. I am not a true horror fan. The Manticore & Other Horrors had evoken so little about horror in me. May be I am wrong. May be I know so little about horror. But I am a Cradle of Filth Fan and in past I had always thought three or four times before I made a bad criticism for them.<br />At last what I think for the &#34;Manticore & Other Horrors&#34; is; you will like it if you are a Cradle Of Flth lover. The style of music is basically their own. You can not claim, this is black metal or death metal etc… It is their own mixture. It has black, gothic and symphonic aspects, as the old times. There are few really hard ones in too. If you will listen to Cradle of Filth for the first time… I am not sure about that… If you first listen the early albums, and you like it; then you will never get used to this one. So this will be a hard question for me.  Anyway I will not tell you to buy or buy not. I liked it and hope you enjoy too.

0312330537|2.0|First of all I agree with other reviewers that this novel is a structural failure, to say the least.  I was surprised to see in his ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS that he actually had an editor.<br /><br />I'd just like to give readers a heads-up here.  In my book club many speculated that Shantaram is autobiographical.  That's exactly what Roberts and his publisher wish us to believe, I think.  I'm afraid I didn't buy it.  Oh, the convictions for armed robbery and escape from prison have to be true--they are matters of record.  And Roberts obviously knows Bombay.  Actually I quite enjoyed the early part of the book, in spite of the \\"purple prose\\" many other readers noticed (I learned early that if I skimmed over these self-indulgent pasages I wouldn't miss a thing).  But much of the story, including torture in prison and the preposterous range of skill sets and accomplishments of his fictional character Lindsay as well as himself (printed on the back cover) had the needle on my bs meter swinging so far over to the right it stuck there and hasn't moved since.  After visiting his web site shantaram.com, where he embarrasses himself with his glamorous self portrait and pretensions, I really think he may have a certain personality disorder and believes he really was, and did, all those things.  Which is neither here nor there, I suppose.  Except he ain't no artist.<br /><br />Enjoy the book for the colorful atmosphere and especially the endearing Mr. Prabaker.  And leave it at that.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Not a bad book, but you can tell its just not the same overall as a Crichton novel.  It basically is a less PG version of Honey I Shrunk the Kids...but with scientists.

1476712042|5.0|I have been a romance novel reader since my teens.  Lately, I have found myself getting nostalgic for those great books of the eighties and nineties when you got sucked into a book and you thought about it for days afterward.  None of my favorite authors have been able to deliver a great story lately.<br />My sister lent me her copy of this book.  Finally!!  This was what I have been searching for.  Great characters, good development and chemistry, and above all, a great story.  Took me only a couple days to read, probably would have finished sooner if it hadn't been for the holidays and having young kids.<br />Soooo excited to hear they are going to make a movie and that there is a new book coming out!

B00181YT9S|1.0|I have had these speakers for about 1 year or so and barely used them. They have been on my shelf for months not plugged in. I just tried to get them set up again with my home studio rig and noticed the non-powered speaker is now dead. I tried different cables and all of the usual troubleshooting procedures.<br /><br />They never sounded worth a crap to begin with but I figured I could use them for listening back to scratch demos in my studio. Now they aren't even good for that. I would suggest spending more to get something more reliable and better sounding. Behringer stuff looks good but the quality is pretty sub-par from my experience. I have had some of their rack effects and they didn't do anything useful so I sold them. These speakers will now be trashed.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Somehow, Amazon's update, which came out several months after it was released on other platforms (such as Google Play) managed to delete my progress for the 2nd time this year.  This is inexcusable.  All my other Angry Birds games were purchased from Google Play and not once have their updates resulted in the deletion of all my progress.  I will be deleting the Amazon App store from my phone.
1455527475|2.0|The book could be reassumed in a few lines: moral standards were slowly but steadily abandoned, and once it was all better at Goldman & Sachs.<br /><br />There are many books describing the disappointment in institutions. Journalists regret that profound and valuable information is no longer the main objective of their work, but rather the number of subscriptions or advertisers. There are complaints about big NGOs that their main focus is less and less the delivered help but the own institutional growth, their market share on the Help-Market. The difference between the moral standards and the practical life has been described repeatedly from some members of the church. Schoolteachers can't teach to the best of their abilities because of administration and overregulation. Political parties having been fresh and idealistic, are soon mainly worried about the consolidation of their power, scientists can tell similar stories and so can athletes, doctors. For art there are cartels and strategic price-policies, and even for institutions without any altruistic identity a lack of morality is condemned - some companies waste the qualifications and motivation of their workers, they sacrifice all for short-term profits and sales-figures, and ignore ecological parameters or child-labor. There are many insightful and smart descriptions written by disappointed people indeed.<br /><br />Once, in the good old times, it was all better at Goldman & Sachs - though even then G&S didn't present itself as an idealistic company. The book describes the authors entry, his career and the exit from G&S, but his criticism is difficult to find any application. When he joined G&S, the world was still all right, he was proud to have made it through the selection process, it still was passionate love. But steadily the romance faded, the times of fair profits based on good advices for clients were gone, and there was greed, insatiability (the book's title in German), ruthless behavior, and the important people of G&S were those who didn't have any problem with damaging a client for their own profit. The people at G&S were just caring for their own bonus, their profits - who would ever have thought that ? My answer: eventually everybody - it never pretended to be a welfare corporation. And furthermore, after the heavy storms in the financial market, who knows if G&S would still exist without having made those profits.<br /><br />The events on the financial market should stimulate improvements, lead to more efficient control, more responsibility in bad times - these are very difficult technical questions. But if somebody buys derivatives at G&S - without understanding what he is just buying and without knowing into which risks he is just engaging - he shouldn't be seen as completely innocent. In those markets, many people have played poker with other people's money.<br /><br />And what to do with G.Smith's criticism ? More intervention, regulation by the state ? More competition ? And if it's not enough to just wait for some self-healing powers of capitalism via competition because there is just no competition anymore at those levels  - what should be done ? The book is not giving  any indication as to practical advice coming from the moral condemnation. Even if a moral condemnation is legitimate and well done - the question about practical morality would have been much more difficult and much more interesting.
B000024JPW|5.0|I will be brief and defer to SFL comments of a few years ago. It has taken me a long time to embrace Beethoven's great mass. I tried Bernstein's highly praised Vienna performance TWICE - once on Galleria [[ASIN:B000050GK3 Beethoven: Missa Solemnis]] and once with the original 2-CD set [[ASIN:B00000E2WM Missa Solemnis]]. Why twice? Well, I never found the sound on the original 2-CD especially pleasing. It was bright and glaring, lacking, at least to my failing ears, warmth. So I tried the budget Galleria realease noting that it had been remastered. Yes, the sound was much improved, but I just couldn't warm to Bernstein's approach to the music, but more to the point, I could not get past the quartet of soloists. I found their singing prefunctory and lacking any measure of spiritually. Next I tried Zinman's Tonhalle release [[ASIN:B000B8QFC8 Beethoven: Missa Solemnis]]. I found that I totally agreed with the reviews I had read previously: wonderfully executed, nicely sung, a solid group of soloists BUT totally lacking in spirituality. Alas. So, after much searching, I decided to try Karajan's remastered 1966 recording. I never even considered Klemperer's [[ASIN:B00005AVMH Beethoven: Missa Solemnis in D major,Op.123]] for a minute: I find his readings of Bach's and Beethoven's choral masterpieces nothing short of ponderous (something like Bernstein in Vienna: if it's slow, it's got to be profound!). My verdict of Karjan's performance: Nice. Really nice. The music truly ascends the heavens! And what a dream quartet of singers! The Vienna Choir and Michel Schwalbe's wonderful violin playing in the Benedictus. And, of course, the Berlin symphony just a few years after Karajan put down his famous, and still immensely popular, 1963 traversal of the Master's Symphonic Canon, an instrument to behold. I found my Missa Solemnis for years to come. Highly Recommended.
B0091JQH76|5.0|If you love Poulenc as I do you have no choice but to grab this set. It contains virtually all his music -- actually I can't find anything he wrote that isn't here -- on 20 CDs at about $2.50 per disc. And these are absolutely classic performances mostly by French artists. They have all been issued separately before so you may already have some of them, but at this price a little duplication is no problem.<br /><br />Consider some of the contents (I don't have space to list everything on 20 CDs!): All of Poulenc's piano music played by Gabriel Tacchino and Jacques F&eacute;vrier. All of his chamber music played by the likes of Pierre Fournier, Jacques F&eacute;vrier, Oscar Ghiglia, Emanuel Pahud, Laurence Pottier, Michel Debost, Maurice Bourgue et al. Piano Concerto with Gabriel Tacchino, orchestra conducted by Georges Prêtre. Concerto for Two Pianos with Poulenc himself along with Jacques F&eacute;vrier. Orchestral works conducted by George Prêtre or Michel Plasson. All the choral music including the Mass in G sung by the Winchester Cathedral Choir, other music by The Sixteen. The magnificent Gloria with Rosanna Carteri, with choral and orchestral forces conducted by Prêtre. The Stabat Mater with R&eacute;gine Crespin.<br /><br />The classic recording of Dialogues of the Carmelites with Denise Duval, R&eacute;gine Crespin, Rita Gorr, et al, conducted by Pierre Dervaux. Les Mamelles de Tir&eacute;sias with Denise Duval, conducted by Andr&eacute; Cluyten. L'Histoire de Babar le petit &Eacute;l&eacute;phant, narrated by Peter Ustinov. Le voix humaine with Denise Duval. Figure humaine with The Sixteen, Harry Christophers conducting. All the m&eacute;lodies and chansons with artists like François le Roux, Jos&eacute; van Dam, Rita Streich, G&eacute;rard Souzay, Elly Ameling, Nicolai Gedda, Mady Mespl&eacute;, Pierre Bernac, Michel S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, Gabriel Bacquier, William Parker, Jessye Norman, among others. Can't get starrier than that!<br /><br />This set is, of course, self-recommending, but in case you haven't figured it out, I am completely in love with it.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonof course, self-recommending, but in case you haven't figured it out, I am completely in love with it.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B005LAII0I|2.0|This movie was not what i expected...kind of corny. Do not want to see again. But see it for youself, who knows u may like it.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|I liked his program. You could certainly get very strong with this book alone. I agree with most of it.<br /><br />I disagree about how the author goes on and on about the futility of weight training. This is unfounded. Lifting weights is a viable way to develop practical, usable strength. I know, &#34;duh!&#34; Right? Well a goodly portion of the book is taken up with the stance that that isn't the case. I know, it sounds weird but it is true.<br /><br />Second, and related to the first is that bodyweight training  leaves something lacking. Namely-TRAPS! Look, when you see a guy that can deadlift 500lbs and you see those traps, you know he is strong. You just can't train that kinda limit strength with bodyweight.<br /><br />That said- its a damn good book. If he had excluded all the bashing of other, clearly effective, methods I would have given it 5 stars!<br /><br />He lays out very logical progressions on just 6 exercises(which is all you need). A person could follow this for years and continue to gain strength. It is far and away better than what your wannabe, Ken-doll, personal trainer would do. It would get results beyond most peoples current program. If you threw in some heavy deadlifts, and possibly a little Olympic lifting, It'd be totally complete!<br /><br />I have purchased and read several bodyweight only books and this one is the best. By far. I now use it along with my weight training and I feel it is helping my strength. I feel its a little easier on my system and has improved my recovery, my strengths and my physique. My whole core, especially from the one arm pushups, has gotten very muscular in that Greek statue kinda way! Love it, and so does the GF, lol.<br /><br />The last thing I would mention. I feel like using more frequent, less intense sessions (Grease the Grove) would work much better.  I do them quite light almost daily(before my weight training) the one day a week go medium heavy. I have been making sick gains for a couple months now.Love it!

B0094BB4TW|2.0|newsfeed only brings up a few items and wont load new items when trying to refresh . needs to be updated badly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've played this before on my old iMac.  I would get caught up in the Vegas style action.  Enjoyed it so much that I asked the casino if they had a slot machine with Solitare.  Go figure Vegas would not have Vegas style gaming.  This seems to be the exact game with added interactive internet features.  I have'nt tried online feature yet.  I mean, what's the point?  It's Solitare.  I think they should move the 'Redo' buton to the bottom middle of the screen as I keep touching it with my idle finger.  Fortunate it does not deduct cash from your score but it does mess up your statistics.  Just a tick as your the only one looking at it.  There are a few bugs with the auto snap as it sometimes won't let you place a card.  It's as if the tablet is hinting you should rethink your move.  I'm using the free version so ads pop up between shuffels.  They get tricky to make you hont down the location of the close button.  Well it works as a few ads did catch my eye.  But who can pull away from the game!  Have fun!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show takes the zombie apocalypse genre to new heights. The focus on the human drama, rather then simply the zombies and gore, adds a realistic layer to the story that is unmatched in any other zombie movie. And there's lots of zombie killin too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am 1/3 the way through the book and it has not disappointed. It is as good as all the others I have read so far. I can make a further judgement when I finish it which won't take much longer. I can hardly put it down.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very exciting movie. My 6 y/o son enjoyed it too. Excellent mix of humor, adventure, and a great story line.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love her books! Can't wait to for the next one :)<br />For those who haven't read one of her novels yet... You should! Especially if you like a good murder mystery with a dash of romance ( its romance NOT SMUT- don't get me wrong every now and then a little smut is good :) lol)

B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is the best CD since Revenge although I think Sonic Boom is good. Monster is as advertised a Monster of a CD not a bad track but the best on the CD is the Eric Singer sung &#34;All For The Love Of Rock N Roll&#34;.

0765350386|5.0|This is one of those books that keeps you up until 4am reading - several nights in a row!  I thought the use of metals and the world building in general was brilliantly done.  One of my new favorite books!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Honestly, this book got way too much publicity and hype.  Read the first and could care less if I read the others.  A bit creepy, but then, not the type of sex I would EVER be in to.  Not that well written.
B009AMAM9S|3.0|This is one film most people will love or won't watch the whole thing. The stories concern reincarnation of the soul (?) although it goes far beyond that. The same half dozen or so people in one life are connected in similar ways in different lives. And a person who gets a scar or mark in the future, will have that mark show up in the past as a birthmark. Clearly this film goes way beyond any simplistic idea of reincarnation and makes it into a cult doctrine.<br /><br />There are 6 separate tales, although the film seems to concentrate on the two future stories. \\"Souls\\" are connected by generally having the same people play different parts, or by connecting them through aforesaid mark. The beginning of the film was confusing as it presents the ending of the various lives.<br /><br />The lives of these people are not simple. They are filled with trauma, killing, and intrigue. Scenes are connected by showing people doing similar things in different life times such as passing through a door, i.e. the so called \\"smart\\" and \\"clever\\" aspect of the movie.<br /><br />Rather than asks questions about truth and free will, the movie gives you David Mitchell's answers, which you may or may not agree with. For those who believe in some universal bond that links lives past and present to the seemingly inane point that things that will happen in the future will effect the past, you should enjoy this film for a full 5 stars. For me the film was too artsy, telling stories in a disjointed fashion that lacked depth and meaning to my life.<br /><br />I would wait for the DVD to see this film as there are things that are easily missed and will need multiple viewings to grasp.<br /><br />If they really wanted to make their case, they should have named Tom Hanks \\"Wilson\\" as an island dweller.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.
B0091LS07E|5.0|The moment I heard \\"When It's All Over\\" and \\"Listen To Your Heart\\", I about foamed at the mouth. I am well aware that Alicia is five albums in, the fifth being \\"Girl On Fire\\", but I've never given her much of my attention (and I have her other four albums!). This new Alicia is exciting, and intimate.<br /><br />\\"Girl On Fire\\" wasn't a good choice for a single but it helped to layout the overall theme of the album. I squealed when I found out that John Legend helped produce \\"When It's All Over\\" and \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" - it's got his signature written all over it.<br /><br />I like this Alicia, I really do. I must agree with a reviewer about her voice... it's a bit strained but I think it strips the album a bit, making the album a lot more intimate. Over-production would have been a KILLER.
0823016714|5.0|I have one of these for myself and bought this one for my friend's daughter who's into anime. You get the expressions from a 240 degree span of the face, not just front and sides. There are different ages of model to assist with wrinkles as well as the planes of many shapes of faces. And I like the sections on hats.<br />It arrived in a timely manner for a very quick vendor.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Never thought I would read this series but all my children had...from the twenty year old to the twelve year old and they had all really enjoyed them.  I honestly didnt realized there were 3 books to read and when I found out, I hesitated to begin.  But I am glad I did.  I throughly enjoyed the premise of the story and the way the story unfolded and even made the recommendation to my book club to read.
0547884591|5.0|I bought this book for the Meta-Learning, but the entire book is awesome! Buy all of the 4-Hour books! Now!<br /><br />That said, I've been reading some of the 1-star reviews and I can't believe some of the stuff being written. I think they just don't get it. It's about living a better, fuller, more enjoyable life on your own terms.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I love this movie and have since I was younger. I am nearing 30 now and my fiance and I still enjoyed watching Beetlejuice again as adults.  It's quirky and fun and worth a watch.  I'd say fun for the family 8 and older.  (My 7 year old niece was kinda freaked out at some of the ghosts/monsters when her Dad let her watch this)
B003PHJLR8|1.0|When reviewing the product details and user reviews prior to purchasing this I didn't see anything about how it only plays on European players. Doesn't play on US blu-ray players.
B0053FANS6|4.0|We really enjoyed this series of movies. Good story. Good action. Creepy mummies and Egyptian lore.... We own them all.

B0098VYKSA|4.0|I had one of my female friends over and we made my boyfriend watch this with us while we were all hanging out at the house - the action scenes kept him engaged and Charlize Theron is a great villain.  We all enjoyed it!
B007NWPB4S|5.0|Fun silly song to drive or dance to....my young relatives love to sing along to it...guilty pleasure...I would buy it again
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like this game and glad it's on the Fire. Looks WAY better on here then it does on a tiny smartphone :) My husband even plays it and he generally has nothing to do with the Fire, lol. Definitely worth playing if you have it on your phone.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I did not watch this movie but my husband who is a fan of the comic character really liked it...he said it was a shame Disney did not promote it more as it was a good story
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game has to be my favorite for the Fire and from TeamLava. The graphics are great! Yeah it might take awhile to make your island bigger but it's a lot of fun watching the dragons grow and making new hybrid dragons. My favorite thing has to be anxiously waiting to see what kind of dragon will be bred next :) Definitely worth playing if you like the mystical and fantasy stuff.

Plus, David Grisman gives his mandolin support for Friend Of The<br />  Devil, and what make this landmark masterpiece especially ironic is the way that it<br />  had provided the music world with two Top Ten hits: Sugar Magnolia and the even<br />  bandâ€™s travelogue signature hit Truckinâ€™.

B0018AO8TA|5.0|This Is The Ultimate Expanded Edition Of The Landmark Debut Album!       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------             With The Grateful Dead remaining at the top of their form and well in demand on         the live circuit, they successfully entered the 1980’s with this superb album that was         met with absolute success when it was released 1980, and just as the band already         making it’s full-fledged return to their original rock and roll origins they were ready to         take on the decade their way.  Go To Heaven gives us is a dazzling cornucopia that         successfully combines equal timing with excellent performing done with just results,         and with roughly some Deadheads and fans who have come of age listening to their         music becoming yuppies at the beginning of the 1980’s, they have kept on admiring         the band.  Beginning with the rock and roll classic Alabama Getaway, the slick track         set concludes with other first-rate tuneful numbers like Althea, Feel Like A Stranger,         Saint Of Circumstance, the Bob Weir-penned Lost Sailor and Don’t Ease Me In (the         latter was first performed by in 1965 when they were known as The Warlocks). And,         what you get on the expanded edition are outtakes of What You’ll Raise and Jack A         Roe that ends with an encore version of Althea, which gives it the expanded edge it         deserves.  Time had somewhat mellowed the general distain for the band, they still         manage to top the rock charts and sell out concerts at the time (1980 would also be         the year the Grateful Dead celebrated it’s 15th anniversary) where they remained as         fresh and highly in demand as ever (even when rock was dominated by New Wave-        sponsored synth-pop, heavy metal and heartland rock, which describes the success         of Go To Heaven as one of the main factors of The Dead’ssuccess where it rank as         one of there greatest and beloved albums.  Once again, here is yet another timeless         masterpiece that will ring as bright as ever for the ages.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is for fans of the video game series, through and through. If you enjoy the games (especially Halo 4!), you'll love reading this. You get a lot of insight into how many of the character's stories begin and the background of the war against the Covenant. There are lots of 'aha!' moments that link into elements of the story shown in the games.<br /><br />That said, I think someone picking this up off a shelf with no prior knowledge of the Halo universe would enjoy it as well. The book is well-written and doesn't baby the reader - it explains most of its military acronyms through story progression rather than by pausing the narrative every five minutes for explanations.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a military sci-fi book that does the game series justice.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I have been on the search for the perfect stylus since I bought my iPad.  The Cosmonaut had some really good reviews, so I shelled out the $25.  It is a pretty thick stylus...about the size of a dry erase marker.  While I thought it was a little awkward to use at first, I quickly got used to it and ended up really liking it.  Although I do have to have to say that if you are writing for extended periods of time that it can make your hand tired due to the size.  I was surprised that a stylus with such a broad tip wrote so well and was pretty exact.<br /><br />Now, the bad.  This has been my go to stylus for many months.  However, even though it doesn't seem to show any visible signs of wear, it does seem to be losing it's effectiveness.

B00138KK62|4.0|I got every single Keys album. I think she's one of the best voices of the 2000's. She's also a lot deeper than most artists, which I like.<br /><br />That being said, if you are not a die hard Keys fan and love her for her straight up talent as a vocalist and pianist, you will probably hate this album. Most of her albums are about the same subjects, and a lot of critics find that boring. I still think it's better than trap music made by MySpace gangster fakers... but hey, to each their own. I like heartfelt soulful music, and thus, I love R&B.
0618154248|4.0|Who doesnt love the curious monkey George. Great little set at a great price, would recommend it to anyone  .
B009JBZH54|4.0|This set would be absolutely perfect if not for the fact that the movies don't come in three individual cases. Personally, I find this to be a drawback because you have to bring the entire box set along if you want to take just one of the three movies to someone else's house. And there's always the security factor. Discs are much safer when they have their own individual packaging. Overall, great set and a fantastic deal at $30, though. Definitely worth taking advantage of this deal. If the price drives back up to around $50, I wouldn't buy it.

B009NQKPUW|1.0|The trailer for Prometheus was nothing short of AMAZING, and although I tried to keep my expectations low due to a recent spate of beautifully executed trailers that had been followed by disappointing movies, I found myself looking forward to the movie with eager anticipation. Prometheus proved however, not to be an exception to the disturbing trend, and was in the end the biggest let-down of all! I suppose this was mostly due to the fact that the Director is one of my favorites, and the original Alien, one of the most enduring classics of both science fiction and horror genres.<br /><br />I'll just give you a brief overview (only brief relative to how long it could be if I were to really get into all the details) of what were to my eye, serious flaws:<br /><br />Many the characters behaved in ways that were impossible to explain. They were set up to be highly intelligent, but then proceeded to make unbelievably stupid decisions that resulted in their deaths - some of which, like Charlize Theron's, wound up being unintentionally funny.<br /><br />The alien technology seemed inconsistent, difficult to believe and in some cases uninteresting. There were rough-hewn stone hieroglyphics that operated crude-looking stone doors and projected recordings, squishy gel buttons and musical instruments that were used to fly the ship, high-tech holograms that seemed way beyond the technology present in the surrounding rooms, and unfathomable tomb/lab/temple chambers that seemed to have no function at all. The derelict alien horseshoe ship in the original movie was so intriguing - it looked biological, but was clearly also technological. When I heard Promethius was being made, I thought &#34;Oh cool, now we'll finally get to see how this bio technology behaves when it's functioning!&#34; It turns out that all the ribs and wind-pipes are just inert, interior decoration. Apparently this is just the aesthetic favored by the Engineers for their version of Star Wars corridor paneling.It isn't alive after all, so doors for example, aren't organic orifices, they just slide open like all the doors in every other sci fi movie - such a disappointing extrapolation!<br /><br />Much of the plot was convoluted and hard to understand. The Engineers needed to clear Earth of all it's disappointing inhabitants, and apparently the most efficient method they could think of was to bio-engineer a menagerie of nasty creatures over which they had no control, and send them here in a small fleet of ships. What if some of the Earthlings found a way to protect themselves from the alien invaders? Even if we are all wiped out, how would they then get rid of the new inhabitants that even in a controlled lab environment they can't seem to subdue? Is the Earth just going to be a total write-off as opposed to a reboot? Then there's the hidden &#34;invitation&#34; the Engineers left in all the ancient inscriptions - was this intended to alert them that we had become technological by our deciphering it and showing up on their doorstep? It seemed they had been watching us, and their attack had been well underway eons before this event, so what was the &#34;invitation&#34; really about?<br /><br />The surprises and twists felt a bit arbitrary to me. Why keep it a secret from the crew that Mr. Weyland was on board? In the context of the story, what does this buy the corporation? In the context of the audience experience, what does this buy the filmmakers? Why would the android infect one of the characters with alien spores when he has no idea whether or not the resulting creature could end up threatening the life of his creator/father/boss? Wasn't his mission to prevent Mr. Weyland from dying? What were they trying to achieve by bringing that Engineer head back to life? Were they trying to make it feel pain? A head can't talk without lungs, so they didn't stand to learn anything from it. Was it the black stuff on its surface that made it explode? The other engineers that died atthe same time, seemed to have intact heads.<br /><br />Then there were the counter-intuitive alien life cycles. A &#34;snake&#34; forces its way down a crew-member's throat, but then the big surprise result is: nothing! It was apparently just hanging out in the corpse waiting to jump out later and scare the other crew members. Another life form can turn you into a moody, slimy person with a fever and bad skin if you swallow some black liquid, or gestate in your womb and emerge as a giant face-hugger if transmitted second hand during intercourse. Still another turns you into a strong, homicidal, jumping zombie if you get sprayed with its acid blood. The linear life cycle of the original alien was so much more interesting, intuitive, shocking, frightening and innovative.<br /><br />Even some of the designs lacked that trademark Scott elegance. The weird pin-head alien at the end, in spite of the verisimilitude lent it by current technology, was far less beautiful, disturbing and memorable than the guy-in-a-suit alien in the original movie. The retro bubble helmets reminded me of an era of science fiction that was far more goofy than cool. The silly looking zombie guy who got the &#34;snake&#34; blood sprayed in his face was neither scary nor interesting, it just looked like a generic, gory Halloween costume. The old-age makeup on Mr. Weyland, although I've heard people speculate that it was a tribute to the makeup in 2001 A Space Odyssey, was way too hokey for a movie released in 2012.<br /><br />Much of the movie was stunningly beautiful to look at though, and for this reason I can't in good conscience recommend not seeing it. Additionally, I can almost guarantee it won't ever bore anyone, and the cast is for the most part, top-notch and compelling to watch. I should also say that if there is a sequel, and it certainly set us up for one, I will definitely go see it, although I probably won't be waiting for hours to be the first in line!
B0095R64AO|3.0|It has some good and funny points but wasnt anything special. Was only worth a couple dollar rental, wouldnt buy it.
0345529057|3.0|The first 3 books were just marvelous.  I really enjoyed reading them and couldn't put them down - but it all went downhill from there.  By book 4, the author is killing off everyone that I liked in the first 3 books - or blinding them or getting rid of them - or they simply were no longer written about - they just disappeared.  Book 4 is rambling and verbose and seems pointless at times.  I had a great difficulty even finishing it.  When I finally trudged to the end of book 4, it says ... \\"to be continued in book 5\\" .... or 6 ... or whatever and that'll come out when the author is good and ready I suppose.  Well, I'm so over it.  If book 5 is anything like book 4, it'll be just bloody awful.  I'm giving the set to the library in my donation box and I'm not buying the 5th or 6th or 7th wordy and rambling book or anything else written by this author.  What a great start and a big disappointment.  I understand sequel, but, crap - this is a boxed set and it ought to be complete.  I feel cheated.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors. He is a great writer and storyteller. I have read every book of his and thoroughly enjoy all his books and series. I would say the Camel Club series has been my favorite overall. He is a great author and all his books are definitely worth reading!!!
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|1.7.7 worked fine on kindle fire, but 1.7.8 is broken.  Same as others, it kicks out to the video list every 20-30 seconds making it unusable.  If you have 1.7.7, do not upgrade.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry Bosch is a long time favorite of mine, I anticipate each entry in Connelly's long running series.  The Black Box was a disappointment.<br /><br />The book begins with a preview of a cold case - a photojournalist murdered twenty years before during the Rodney King riots.  The city was in chaos and murders were hastily investigated, most not cleared.  But Harry is haunted by the 'Snow White' case.<br /><br />Back to the present and the gun that killed the Danish journalist is tied to another crime.  The twenty year old murder case gets assigned to Harry and his partner, and Harry wants closure.  As is often the case, Harry is at odds with the supervisor of the unit.  Add Harry's attempt to close a 'riot' case that involves a white victim when the mayor wants to appear sensitive to the black community on the twentiety anniversary of the King verdict.<br /><br />The case takes a turn in a direction that is unexpected and Harry follows the case.  This plays out against the backdrop of a formal complaint from his supervisor.<br /><br />The Black Box isn't a bad book - it just isn't a great book, which we have come to expect from Connelly.  The writing is average and the story seems plodding.  The only real bright spot is the developing relationship with his daughter, sixteen year old Maddie.<br /><br />A must for fans of the series, but not a stand alone page turner.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|The data sorting function is cumbersome as is the copying of formula populated cells.<br />I have just used it a couple days, but have found this a little aggravating.
B0082SU98U|5.0|This is a must read Classic that can be actually life altering should the attitude of its heroine be adopted personally by the reader!  LOVE THIS BOOK!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I purchased this to replace a tape version.<br />It works as a DVD should and satisfies my need and expectation.

B00AA7O22U|1.0|Even if you like mindless action films, you will find this a waste of time and money. Poorly written, bad acting.
0547884591|5.0|I've read Tim's other books (Four Hour Work Week and Four Hour Body) and this is a great addition to the collection of knowledge.<br /><br />To me, Tim's style of writing slightly sarcastic, funny, and \\"smart\\".<br /><br />The Four Hour series is about healthy living, working smart, making the most of your time, learning from the best, while also being entertained and having a good time reading.<br /><br />If you have tried and liked the other books, I believe this is a must have for you.  If you haven't tried, I'd say give it a shot.<br /><br />Thank you Tim for this book!!<br /><br />- Brian Ma

I was told it was located above my setting Icon but there isn't anything there. I'm not sure if this is an issue with kindle or not but someone plz help .. antanise02@gmail.com
140130916X|4.0|I do love the movie PS I Love You, but let me tell you something, THE BOOK IS NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE!!! we all know that people say the book is better, or a little different here and there, but let me tell you something, it's completely different! The book was okay the movie was GREAT. Perhaps if I read the book first I'd say the book was GREAT and the movie was okay.
0545425115|1.0|this was supposed to be a Christmas present for my son however in the middle of the book the pages are sliced in half and glued to the center of the book. This book is not suitable to read and i have contacted the company for replacement right after i received it and got no response i would be careful about buying books from here.
B00632HWOG|5.0|this works good on my tablet. i have used others but i always come to yahoo, it' a good search engine as well.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|its ok, i do have some problems with this app loading, sometime it take to long and other times it's fast.
B00633W614|5.0|I ordered this 2nd book immediatley after finishing Only Time Will Tell. I can't wiat until the 3rd one comes out in May. I am so happy to find Jefffrey Archer. I usually read mystery and crime novels. I have been looking for something different to read and when I read various reviews I decided to try these novels. I am so very happy I did. I have been so entertained by Mr. Archer's writing. I would recommend his books to anyone that loves to read.
B00005JMYI|5.0|They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time. Lol! Movie arrived quick & in awesome condition! Had great laughs watching this! Will Ferrell is one of the best!
B0045XICB2|5.0|Recieved DVD in a timely manner in great shape and completely enjoyed watching it. I won't go into any detail because I might give something away and I don't like when that happens to me.<br /><br />I will say that I was wonderfully surprised, after not watching any of these movies before and watching them all now; that the stories were told in a very entertaining way without super sexualizing, gory kill detail, or foul language. YEA!  The PG13 is a match, in my opinion.
B00005RHGL|5.0|One of my all time favorites! Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer are great together in the movie. My purchase arrived quick, it was somewhat damaged in the left hand bottom corner of the box but I think that happened during the shipping because the envelope was damaged the same way. I didn't care, the two-disc inside were in perfect condition!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It sure is fun, but harder then the others. My granddaughter likes<br /> it to and she wins more then I do.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Ordered this for my boyfriend who is an Iron Man fan. Movie came in awesome condition and zero scratches. Very happy with my purchase. =]
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It may not quite reach the height of the Dark Knight but the Avengers is definitely one of the most fun movies I have ever laid my eyes on.
B006A819AG|5.0|You can't get the full picture by listening to just an individual track.  This is an album that needs to be listened to all the way through without interuption to get the full effect.  Special shout out to Black Thought for his subtle brilliance here.  In my opinion, it is his best lyrical writing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The best he's written.  I thought I figuredit out, and then a new twist, I was wrong.  I'm recommending it to my friends who like good murder and mayhem
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app is nothing but trouble. Even following their steps to set up for internet use, the app will not find my computer. I have tried the Google log in and IP method with no luck. It works fine over the same wifi network but as soon as I want to use it away from the house and leave the computer at home, it is worthless. Compared to Logmein which works perfectly and is also FREE, who would want to buy Splashtop? Suckers, that is who.
B009KHCT94|4.0|I expected this to be just a politically incorrect comic sci-fi ride through alternative history-- which it is-- but was pleasantly surprised by the filmakers' astute reading of post WW2 global politics and the way they poked fun at it. Some really smart AND funny humor throughout here if you're paying attention. In the best tradition of Blazing Saddles, nobody comes out unscathed, and none of that gets in the way of the entertainment. Deserves a spot next to Dr. Strangelove and Blazing Saddles in you DVD cabinet.
B0018QQQKS|4.0|A great read for any closet economist or wall st disciple.  Ferguson takes you back all the way the East India Company and describes how the first company brokered shares, sold them and valued them.  He also described well how money was first created and the inception of exchange rates.  He also does a great job going through the history of bonds and how wars were the harbinger of national debt.  He takes the history all the way up to the Savings and Loan crisis of the 80's and to the fall of Long Term Capital in CT, explaining really well how leveraged finance works.  Mostly, he talks about the history of economic bubbles and how many there have been.  The end gets a bit philosophical about why banks are \\"too big to fail\\" but doesn't offer much of a solution, if there is one.  The bottom line is, when banks fail everyone looses.  This of course is a paradox since it supports risky investment behavior, but history tells us that has always been the case.  His book walks through the history of bubbles and bailouts and shows over and over again the end result is taxpayer support or national bankruptcy in the case of Russia or Chile.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a delightful story. If you enjoy a good yarn with a Celtic lilt mixed with  heart-rending Dickensian flashbacks this one's for you. I couldn't put this book down.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I live in South Florida. I sweat a ton, even in the winter months. The sweat from my arms, and drops from my face, sometimes make the watch change modes. If I run at night and I try to illuminate the watch by touching the bazel with my sweaty hands makes the watch change modes, and I have a problem getting the watch back to the timing mode. Otherwise, I like the watch.
B00ADII8YE|5.0|Talked with a couple of readers faithful to the graphic novels, and even they had a hard time bringing up negatives about the show. It may not be exactly what was written, but it has proven a worthy stand alone version of the books.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|It's the VHS version and then some. Better picture, better sound and the extras are cool. What's not to like? Niiiice!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Rated 4 stars because it is a great read and a great end of the trilogy.  Also liked the epilogue, because it tied the loose ends, no pun intended.  Definitely think the prior two should be read first.  All in all, I think Book Three is the best.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Growing up in the 80's I used to love watching this cartoon!! Now I love the game! Its really cute and I can enjoy it with my daughter!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's books are very entertaining.  I can't see Tom Cruise being cast as Jack reacher.  He is a veryu short person, while Reacher is over 6 ft.
B009EANE3M|5.0|Great! The script does not disappoint. Totally recommend this album if you liked the first two script albums. Great collaborations.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I really liked the story and watched with my daughter who also loved it.  Definitely worth the rental. Lots of action and humor.
B000HEVALC|5.0|There are over 40 cuts on this disc.  You will hear these guys just talking among themselves and even hear people in the background - even a child playing.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I read other reviews of this story so I knew it would be a challenge; but after getting thru 2/3 of the book (had to switch to audio book to get passed the language ordeal) I still got no feel for the point. I was then even more disgusted by the gratuitous suicides of two of the more interesting characters! Needless to say this will not be on my recommended list.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Holy Bible app is easy to navigate through and has a sections dedicated for notes that I can toggle through with ease as I read and meditate on God's Holy Word.

B0024SQW2Q|5.0|Love all movies of this line. Its a special movie about vampires, not just regular shitty one.<br />Enjoyed watching it...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|You'll never watch &#34; the movie&#34; the same way . I wish they would remake it more to the book .
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Did not like this app,tryed a couple of times to set the clock to eastern time.  When I downloaded this app it was set for western time,which is fine if I live in the west.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app. is wonderful! My daughter uses it all the time for her homework. And I love that it's free!! Thanks for making a great product!
0739317741|4.0|This is the kind of book that can change the way you think.  I may have to get the hard copy book, this is so good.  As a six sigma black belt who has spent time with Design for Six Sigma, this book resonated heavily.  In the end, are you measuring the right things?  Many people do not.  You don't use the metrics you have for metrics, you use the metrics you need.<br /><br />The audio book version is abridged, which I am never crazy about.  How do I know what I'm missing out on?  Also, some of the transitions between sections in the book aren't handled well.  Due to editing the author-narrator will jump from one set of characters and setting to another so fast, on multiple times I thought my iPhone got set to \\"shuffle.\\"  That's a new occurrence to me after reading dozens of audio books.  This is the only reason why I gave this book a 4-star rating.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book or series is a way to pass time at best if you don't have any laundry to do. While it does grab your attention with Anastasias's little inner goddess popping up and your wondering what is going to happen it quickly becomes clear that Fifty is in serious need of more counseling and perhaps some kind of light therapy techniques to help with his contol, jealousy, and manipulation issues which are just a few amoung the many. But apparently if you are rich and good looking you can do whatever you want and we are supposed to love you(roll eyes and vomit a little here) and what's up with the continuing references to Fifties long fingers I am sorry but that creeps me out and makes me think of ET trying to touch something everytime they mention it...sorry that's not sexy. The sex scenes are mildly arousing at best and give you a glimpse into what the BDSM scene is and gives you terms to google if you want more information actually I think reading the google and urban dictionary terms are more steamy than the sex scenes that seem to be over in a matter of 2 minutes if that. For a skilled lover fifty has the stamina of a pre pubesent rooster. Which would explain why he had to find an inexpierenced girl like Ana. Writting style is that of a Jr. High school student so it is easy reading. Personally I found more pleasure in reading those Fabio covered romance novels my mother used to read. My advice try to borrow these books or find someone to go in on the cost or resale them to an unsuspecting person at a yard sale to get most of your money back. This should be one series where the movie will be better than the book but it it will probably climax quickly and leave you with an unsatisfied look on your face also.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Lana Del Ray has a great voice, but I'm not a fan of the lyrics. I learned of her through the Blue Velvet commercial she did for H&M.
1401323952|5.0|A beautifully presented book covering the needs of a normal family .The ingredients are easily obtainable and not overly expensive ,there are numerous extra handy hints and the recipes are easy to follow .
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Not your average brutal drug dealer movie.  Oh, they're brutal alright, but they have realistic failures and business problem. Everybody is trying to look smarter than they are. They trip themselves up.
B004G600A4|5.0|My 3 year old has watched this movie a countless number of times... and I don't mind, because I enjoy watching too. Great movie :)
B009FXIICK|4.0|While the music and graphics are cute,  in the default mode, the game gets too challenging very quickly.  I would have enjoyed it more if default mode's time pressure wasn't so oppressive.  While I enjoy a more casual game pace that can be enjoyed over a longer period of time, this game got very intense within 5 levels, and that only took about 10 minutes to reach.  There is a separate mode \\"catch 100\\" that seems to be more appropriate for someone looking for a  more casual gaming experience.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I like this cd very much. I had the album but I play it so often that bying the cd wasn't difficult. Its a nice cd with beautiful songs and it is never boring.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|As a kid I read Tom Sawyer about ten times, and also loved Booth Tarkington's Penrod books.  Like Twain, Steven Spielberg understands a specific kind of half-earthy, half-magical kids' world that many of us never quite abandon, nor want to.  The Goonies is one of the top films ever in that genre.  I would compare it to Stand By Me and, more recently, Moonrise Kingdom.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Difficult to take pictures.  Sometimes it does not work correctly.  Pictures are not of good quality they are very grainy looking.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the newsfeed only show the first 10 or so stories. And when i choose to &quot;like&quot; something, the like won't stick. a pretty useless app.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I thought this movie might be fun because of all the well known actors.<br />Is wasn't.  Just stupid.  Find another movie and don't waste your time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book!  I can't wait to read the 3rd installment when it comes out this spring. I fell in love with all of the characters!! Definitely worth reading!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This movie keeps getting better and better. it really is more enjoyable with each viewing. This film should be a must for the younger generation.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|It was good! perfect for our long plane trip home for the holidays. She had seen everything current, so going back to a old movie was fun for her.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|I haven't seen Mulan since I was little but it is still one of my favorites. I may buy it instead of renting it next time!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Magic Mike has very boring plot.  The dancing by the men was great. I guess I really didn't hate it. That's why I gave it 2 stars
0312330537|5.0|One of the best books I have read, I have recommended to my friends, who have recommended it to there friends
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|Sounds like really generic music, although Rihanna has never been one that has made soulful or thought provoking music this album feels cheap and generic.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I would rate this app a 3.5 if I could, but can't. The story was fine but it didn't take long to complete. after that it is just empty space from there on. I did by the app for a dollar, the thing that made it worth it.

B008XG1X18|5.0|The Pinterest app was definately everything I was looking for! It is much easier to use on my kindle than just going on the Internet! I am a believer! (:
B003B02O14|3.0|A typical Grisham novel, a great read, well developed story ,great story telling. The end however made me feel cheated. Unless there is a sequel I will continue to feel this way.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love getting to learn a bit more about &#34;A&#34;. The twists in the plot are amazing and those you used suspect and cleared or re-brought up at suspects. But it keeps me interested by leaking out just enough information about &#34;A&#34; without giving it all away.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I look forward to this show weekly.  It has so many levels to it.  Love, intrigue, mystery, women, men, children, politics, finances, and etc.  It appeals to all age groups discounting little children.  I hope it is on for many years with the same cast.<br />  .
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I like learning the back stories of each character and how they interact with each other. Belle and Rumpilstiltskin are my favorite pair.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Kate and Castle are wonderful together.  Mom and Castle's daughter are so entertaining.  I love watching what they will do next.  The loyalty of these characters for each other makes me want to what happens next.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|I watched this streaming without downloading it to my Kindle Fire. The was some choppiness at the beginning and the picture wasn't quite clear until it finished buffering the whole movie. After that the picture quality was good.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I had preordered this item and was getting concerned after reading the mostly negative reviews.  However, I found this to be not only an excellent concert but excellent production quality. They were all in great harmony and even Brian seemed to be enjoying himself.<br /><br /> I,too, was unable to attend any of the concerts.  The closest one was still too far for me to travel to with my schedule so I was thrilled to get to see this DVD.  My only complaint is that it does not include the tribute to Dennis and Carl.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Recently began using Amazon Instant Play and Im impressed. Quality was good on my Sony Smart BluRay. Have since watched many more films.
B004XISI4A|5.0|A fantastic read. Better than the TV show by a mile (I read this before watching and still do live the TV show). Full of twists and turns that keep you excited to see what will happen next. Don't get too attached to some of the characters or you may regret it. Buy this now.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It makes the Internet so much easier. There are a few bugs from time to time. But that is to be expected.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Better than the first book in my opinion. Although I have read that it was all written as a giant book then split up, so maybe I just liked the events of the story more than those of the first book. Great fantasy read. If you liked the first one you will love this.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I have been using Opera on all of my devices for over a year. I use it because they cache the sites first to make them smaller and eats up less data. Not important if you have unlimited data, but for me this is perfect.

B004KA9UXO|5.0|This is a very interesting and enlightening read. I have read many fantasy and scifi books in my time and rate this as one if the best. It is actually a blend of the two genres in my opinion. You do need to focus when reading as some of the words are just made up, but make sense in context so don't need unnatural narrative exposition.<br /><br />It is really a chosen one(s) story, but done very well. It has lots of intrigue and you are genuinely unsure who will live or die.<br /><br />A book for the ages.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|It's IRON MAN....whats not to like.  R. Downey Jr.  was born to play Tony Stark.  Great entertainment and worth owning!
B003HV0TN2|4.0|Though I find the main character arrogant (with cause to be, mostly) I really like this book and will be getting the next one for sure. It is a fairly typical fantasy story, but has enough originality and interesting things going on to keep it out of the mediocre mire. At times I found the writer allowed the facade of the story to be broken when I felt like I could 'see' the overly contrived clever actions of the protagonist being cobbled together. Hmm, I hope that made sense.<br /><br />Anyway, a great read. Buy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book had the action, good guys and enough bad guys to keep the plot moving.  There were twists  and turns and some flashbacks to prior happenings that added character depth.  It left me wanting to keeping reading,but the door is open as 2 &#34;new&#34; characters are now out there helping or so we hope fight against global terrorism.

B009DCOU9S|3.0|I actually enjoyed the game when the talking ended and I could actually play. Fun little interactive problems to solve. Not too hard as to be frustrating but not so easy as to be boring.  I usually enjoy a story laden adventure but for some reason these &quot; Magicians&quot; like to chat. I know you can click it faster but then you miss the gist. When 3 is pleanty why use 10..... nuff said?  Also it might just be a glitch for me but even when it says my progress is saved and I can restart the game from that chapter, I inevitably have to start all the way from the start!!! Has Nevosoft never heard of auto save? Just a suggestion.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved the format and subject matter.  The writer made me care about these characters, and I found it very interesting to read about the experiences of people on the Isle of Guernsey during and right after World War !!.  I loved the addition of humor and yet it was a very sad story in many ways.  The human spirit shone throughout the book. My mother lived under German occupation throughout the War in Paris.  She was just a young girl, but she shared many stories with my sister and I, many of them scary, but others quite funny.  My dad was one of the American GIs who helped liberate France and end the war.  They met in Paris in 1946.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|A lot of people have been complaining about these Adventure/Point and click/ Hidden object type games lately because they say free ....until or if  you read the entire description***** or play a bit of the game. Then bam! fork over the dough bub (&lt;--- Bub? what was I thinking, that I'm 104?) Actually I think it's. nice to see if you like a game before paying full price. That being said.....in a long and drawn out way....sorry.....THIS GAME SHOULD BE LIKE$2.99 TOPS. It's. fun and interesting to a point but five bucks? Nah. ...btw auto correct bites . Cool Game but not $$$$$ cool.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an amazing series.  It is extremely well-written, and the acting by the main characters is exceptional.  Damian Lewis' character is surprisingly sympathetic.  We are left to wonder, of course, whether he really is a traitor or not.
B007SGM084|3.0|While the reading is *stimulating*  I think the three books could be combined in a small version of 1.  The issue with Grey is rehammered again and again... it's used as an excuse to another sex scene.  I think if the author attempted to give insight to a lifestyle and mindset and the author failed miserably.  Could have done so much more with the whole psychology.  A poor attempt if your looking for depth.  If you're looking for bedroom reading... personally even there... just doesn't capture it right.<br /><br />The other issue I have with this book is the characters are really one dimensional...she's a twit who says no but means yes yes yes... she really needs a safeword and we need one from her childishness!  As for the bdsm part...the author should have done more than take a cursory look at the lifestyle.... she explains away his inclination and the whole bdsm lifestyle to his mom... when there is a whole deal more involved than she dares to explore.  She stereotypes a whole lifestyle into one insane control freak implying that stalking is part of that world.  Really!  Shame Shame Double Shame!
0425263916|5.0|I was waiting for this book since I preordered it. When it was delayed I was disappointed. However once I had it, I couldn't put the book down. The story was written to draw you in and invest in the characters. I can picture this book on the screen. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series. I can only imagine what happens next. While I will always love the Fifty Shades series, I am finding that the subject matter and how it is treated in the Crossfire series is more engaging to the more mature aspects of my literary interests. I am like so many others who want to see people succeed even after so much adversity. I can't wait to preorder the next book.

B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I love the option of being able to read Emma online and take notes on my Kindle Fire.  The story is a classic Comedy of Manners novel about courtship and marriage for the wealthy Victorians.  The only drawback to the online version is the Chapters are numbered differently - the print version just consecutively numbers all of the chapters but the online version starts Part II with new numbers.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I picked up Life of Pi expecting a very different story than the one I received. Through it, I experienced many true trials, starvation of a soul, a burning desire for life and a more intimate knowledge of the spiraling ways of the natural world. Every page was written eloquently, the imagery is rich and vivid. I was enraptured through the entire story.<br />I highly recommend this book, give it a chance and prepare to be astonished.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was a great way to kill time. Although I wouldn't say it was better than fifty shades of grey, I would say its a close second. But I do recommend thus book.

B000AA4JMU|3.0|This one came out a few years ago.  Great scenery on location in London, wonderful costumes and sets.  Parts are well acted - maybe a little too realistic and rough for children to see.  I had to cringe at some of the treatment of the children and Nancy, the female lead.  I won't give away the ending, but just be forewarned it is not Hollywood pretty.  Parents should preview this before showing it to kids under 14
B002HC67U6|4.0|This was an old favorite that I recently shared with my 16 year old daughters.  It was appropriate for them, given some vulgar language and one particularly intense scene.<br />My kids were not excited at the prospect of seeing this movie, but were sucked in by the compelling characters, the very strong performance by Pacino in particular, and the aspects of the plot involving the teenage prep schoolers' moral dilemna and how the different students reacted to the dilemna.<br />This film still holds up after all these years; great movie!
0345803485|5.0|In good condition, time delivery was before stated at the check out. On regards to the story, i like it but not loved it..typical macho rich man who gets to be with a virgin girl, although the love story surprised me by Mr. Grey...purchasing book 2..
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have long been a John Grisham fan and will continue to read everything he writes, but in comparison with his earlier novels The Firm and The Rainmaker and the Runaway Jury, I did not think this was an outstanding addition to his collection.  Getting back to the lawyer based character was very good since Grisham is truly in his element, however the beginning was only about being in prison and without an additional character, seemed very slow in the development.  As the book progressed I saw flashes of the real Grisham with the cat and mouse strategy he does so well.<br />I gave it an OK because of the slowness of the first 50 pages and the slow development of the main character.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Entertaining movie for gals, but compelling story for all about the world of male strippers with a standout performance by Matthew McConaughey
B000HZHBIM|5.0|I'm a Trekie.  So, I have a definite bias, but let's just say when this film came out, I was in Heaven.<br /><br />This particular story was actually a re-working of an old episode, so it was fun to see how 10 years of advances allowed them to re-tell it in a more realistic and engaging way.<br /><br />I must say, it's not the best of the Star Trek films, but it was a great way to re-start the franchise.  The pace of the film is a lot slower than other Star Trek films and shows, mainly because they wanted to draw attention to some of the rich details of the new ship and the visuals that could never have been captured in the original series.<br /><br />While the special effects may seem a bit crude by today's standards, they were quite groundbreaking to Star Trek fans when this film came out and many of them still hold up today.<br /><br />The reason Star Trek was successful was because it was never about eye popping special effects or images, it was about the relationships between the crew.  That special blend of tech and how the personalities of the crew connect makes Star Trek so special.<br /><br />Live Long and Prosper.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this was a psychological thriller which it was. It was a good read that I did not want to put down. I don't know who is doing the movie, but it should be the Cohen Brothers for that unexpected twist at the end.

1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander gives the medical profession and the rest of us skeptics something to really ponder and possibly, reconsider. Somewhere around the mid 1980s I &#34;lost&#34;, for lack of a better word, my sense of trust and hope in the world. I'd seen it's underbelly and knew first hand it's dark side; where people and events could be quite cruel and fall far short of what I'd defined as 'human' up until then. It was a deep and profound loss of of something I'd long accepted as simply: the truth. That there were beings and forces of goodness far greater than ourselves here in the Universe and it was shortsighted and egomaniacle to think otherwise. In recent years, I have had reason to again revisit this subject, only to find myself again questioning the same issue in the same way. If there were truly a goodness beyond human measure, why did I see no evidence of it as those I loved suffered and caved all around me? In hearing about and then reading Dr. Alexander's book, I see myself in him and all his scientific knowledge and skeptism. That is why his experience resonates so deeply within me and has awakened memories of feelings and &#34;knowledge&#34; I had from a very young age, until life and it's pain wore me down and whittled that knowledge--that belief--away. I owe him a debt of gratitude for having the courage to write this book. I suspect many others' will too, even if in secret.

B002N7P23I|2.0|When I saw the movie in Spanish I was terrified.  Granted I was alone, it was a really fun movie to watch in the dark at night.  But the English overdub makes the whole thing feel like a joke. It sounds ridiculous and the voice acting makes the movie seem like a comedy rather than the scary movie it was meant to be in Spanish.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|As a fan of Mumford & Sons this album was a great follow up to their first album, but was much more religious than their first album.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I read the book description and a few reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am glad to say it was a fantastic book. At first it was a little hard to get into and understand, but its just a different style than what I am used to reading. After a few chapters I wanted to lay on the couch reading the day away until I reached the end of the book. I absolutely loved the characters!! Silhara is so mysterious, even up until the end. It always made me want to read on because he is just so unpredictable. I liked Martise because she wasn't what I expected after reading the reviews and book description. She is easy to relate to, despite the fact that she is a slave and an aspiring mage, she is like an average woman not some exotic, beautiful person who has everything magically work out in her favor. I really loved the ending as well!! I highly recommend this book :D

0525953728|4.0|If you want to know what happened on the 2011 U.S. military raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, \\"No Easy Day\\" is the book to read. It's not that this is a perfect book - it's good, not great - it's just that it's all we've got.<br /><br />The military has offered only a handful of official details about the mission and even some of those have been shown to be doubtful. So until anyone else who was on the raid steps forward to tell his story, this is the only publicly available eyewitness account.<br /><br />\\"No Easy Day\\" was written by former Navy Seal Matt Bissonnette, using the pseudonym Mark Owen, who says he was a part of the team that assaulted the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan on May 1, 2011.<br /><br />It's quite a story. The mission, according to Bissonnette, did not go nearly as smoothly as the government admitted. The helicopter carrying Bissonnette and other soldiers almost suffered a disastrous crash. It actually DID crash, but miraculously hit ground in a way that no one was hurt.<br /><br />A team that was supposed to land from a helicopter on the roof of Bin Laden's home aborted that route, forcing the soldiers into a time-consuming entrance through a series of barricaded doors. One group of soldiers blasted through one of the compound's gates only to find a brick wall behind it.  One soldier told to blow up the disabled helicopter mistakenly set up explosives to blow up Bin Laden's house instead (he was stopped in time).<br /><br />While the soldiers tried to collect computers and documents that could have information on Al Qaeda, they left a lot behind because they ran out of time. On their way out, Bissonnette said, the helicopter he was on came perilously close to running out of fuel.<br /><br />For all the danger, only one person at the compound fought back, according to Bissonnette. Shortly after landing, Bissonnette and two other soldiers were trying to get Bin Laden courier Ahmed al-Kuwaiti out of a guesthouse in the compound. Al-Kuwaiti firedan AK-47 blindly out the window, narrowly missing one of the Seals. The Americans fired blindly back in, killing him, and somehow managing not to hit his wife and kids.<br /><br />Next, as they entered the main building, Bissonnette describes the soldiers seeing a man's head sticking out of one room.<br /><br />\\"The point man snapped off a shot. The round struck the occupant, later confirmed to be Abrar al-Kuwaiti, and he disappeared into the room. Slowly moving down the hall, the team stopped at the door. Abrar al-Kuwaiti was wounded and struggling on the floor. Just as they opened fire again, his wife Bushra jumped in the way to shield him. The second burst of rounds killed both of them.\\"<br /><br />This paragraph - describing U.S. soldiers killing a wounded man \\"struggling on the floor\\" - disturbed me probably more than anything else in the book. There's no indication the man was armed. And accidentally killing his wife is just tragic.<br /><br />Moving to the second floor of the compound, the Americans killed Bin Laden's son Khalid when he poked his head out into a stairway landing and was shot in the face.<br /><br />As they reached the third floor, Bissonnette describes himself as being second in line, behind the point man.<br /><br />\\"We were less than five steps from getting to the top when I heard suppressed shots.<br />\\"BOP. BOP.<br />\\"The point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of the hallway about ten feet in front of him.\\"<br /><br />That was Bin Laden, who apparently was hit in the head, and fell back into his bedroom. Bissonnette and another soldier found him.<br /><br />\\"Blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull. In his death throes, he was still twitching and convulsing. Another assaulter and I trained our lasers on his chest and fired several rounds.\\" The soldiers found that he was not carrying a weapon.<br /><br />It's jarring how different this account is from the original White House story, which said the Bin Laden was armed and \\"resisted.\\" The White House later but backed off from the claim he was armed, but still insisted that he had resisted capture.<br /><br />The Bin Laden mission is not the only event described in the book, though you can hardly be blamed for skipping to that section.  The first half of the book is filled with Bissonnette's swaggering tales of other Seal missions he took part in, primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan. These can be interesting, though they're largely told in a cold military tone where people are \\"targets,\\" helicopters are \\"birds,\\" and dead enemies are \\"re-engaged\\" to make sure they're dead.<br /><br />It's fair to wonder whether Bissonnette's version of events in the Bin Laden raid is true. Did he exaggerate his role in the raid, or perhaps hide mistakes he may have made? Still, the reaction of Pentagon officials to the book speaks volumes - they've accused him of divulging military secrets and are hunting for a way to punish him.  Clearly, he hit close enough to the truth to strike a nerve.

B0090O07RS|1.0|Oh My!  I just watched this.  Words cannot reproduce the feeling of let down I have over this show.  While the audio is excellent, and the picture pefect, the performance is a joke.  They are obviously on a powerful illegal substance and not taking the show all that seriously.  I can appreciate that this was 1968 after all, and it was a rock band, but I expected something I would enjoy.  I didn't enjoy this.  Anyways, I watched the music videos and tv performances as well, and while interesting, the sound was presented in 48k and 16 bits.  Not much more than cd quality.  I bought this mainly because it was 96k 24 bits, and it was the doors.  While fantastically produced, the subject matter falls a bit short for my taste.  Sorry guys...  Flame away!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I got this on my kindle fire and went up several levels before I learned I did not have the quest book. I messaged team lava and was told it was not available for my game.

B000008HZB|4.0|Jeff Lynne can do anything he wants and I'll buy it. The four stars is based on my personal have-to-keep-replaying ratio. Which is 4:11. That's 4 cream of the crop if I'm totally into it on a Tuesday night past bedtime, trading music for sleep which I hate myself in the morning for. But from the point of view of the creative fingerprint of an incomparable individual, aka f**ing genius, it would be 5 stars.<br /><br />I'll elaborate on my two very favorites. 1. Now You're Gone, please Jeff. How did you even think to pull in the Indian trilling or whatever it's called and how on earth did you plunk that little saloon piano run in there, and KNOW those things would enhance the mood? 2. I'm blown away by Blown Away. It's not the first time you've evoked the euphoria of love. (Does anybody else around here know the relatively obscure I Need Her Love from I don't know which album back whenever? Not as simply constructed as it first sounds, btw. Anyone who can make \\"The boats that sail, the planes that fly, she is with me,\\" make sense can do whatever the heck he wants.)<br /><br />Back to Armchair, it's more stripped-down musically than the original ELO sound and showcases his voice more clearly. I'm really glad to hear that. He has breathed some oxygen into his vocal tones over the years. Case in point, Blown Away. Yet the interplay of sounds is still nicely layered.<br /><br />Not that he has the richest voice I've ever heard, wait BELIEVE ME this is a compliment! I mean some vocalists could live and die on any one note, Stevie, Etta, Aretha, Amy (r.i.p.). I love it when an excellent artist who is not those guys but light years beyond us poor cogs in the wheel doing who knows what all day and listening to our i-pods on the commute, when somebody like Jeff Lynne gets to a point of just off-the-cuff excellence and puts out an album like this. It's a notable happening.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great job Rovio, made another amazing game, I love almost everything about it. Except the fact that I have to pay for the return of the Jedi levels. but other than that, gameplays great, nice graphics,creative ideas, and everything you would expect out of rovio. the other thing I don't like, is the lack of levels, but I can live with that since the game is addicting as it is.  So long story short, keep up the good work rovio, but add more levels
B001CDLATE|5.0|I got this movie because I read that it was beautifully shot.  That is true.  The imagery is amazing.  If you need to show off a tv, or projector this is a great DVD.  No dialogue or plot, just great visuals from around the world

Crosstober was what everyone was calling the anticipated release of this book but once it came out it was more like shocktober. It was a great read. Loved the ending. Young need to read twice because you question characters thru out the whole book then at the end things are presumed and have you rethinking what you have read. But love it better the second time better.

B000683VI4|5.0|When I first saw this movie, it didn't seem true to life, until I personally experienced a similar story, although no Alzheimer's was involved.<br /><br />Two members of my congregation had been married for many years. They were special friends to all of us. Her health began failing, as did his. They ended up in rooms next door to one another in the hospital. He went first, and we could see her slipping away. She joined him two days later, and they were buried with a single simple ceremony.<br /><br />So I now take this heartwarming story a bit more seriously.

As with all music, this is totally subjective, but I feel that they've changed direction, and not in the way that I perceive as 'the right way'.

The Doctor calls(what I assume is Heaven)\\"The Gateway or the Core\\" in which a being tells him \\"THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO WRONG.\\"  It is chilling to think that all who reads this book would take that to heart.  I don't believe that is a world anyone would want to live in. If God was trying to tell Dr. Alexander anything, I believe it would be \\"pay more attention to your earth worm's eye view.\\"

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Cinematics are fantastic. Actors are fantastic. Great story, dialog, etc. I've really enjoyed this show so far, and I'm a terrible critic.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is one of the best combo packs I have boughten. The special features and the blu-ray 3D disc is worth it.
0756405890|5.0|An amazing book; easily one of my favorites. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. The story is riveting and Kvothe's retelling of his tale entrances you as you get farther in the book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am constantly wanting to reach into my I-POD an wring the neck of the reader. She is so &#34;like gag me with a spoooon&#34;.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book really did bring history back to life. The perspective from families in various countries really added depth to the story.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn allows Rapp to be quite vulnerable in this thriller. It provides the reader to see another side of Rapp that you have not seen in some of the previous thrillers.  Rapp has an opportunity to question and conduct self-analysis on his own behavior.  Flynn does this in such a way that engages the reader and at the same time does not allow Rapp to become too maudlin.<br /><br />The pace of the book was excellent and I enjoyed seeing other members of the team, including his boss Kennedy play such an integral role in the outcome.  Flynn did an excellent job!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Would not recommend it for anyone easily offended. It was addictive but raunchy. Don't think I will read the rest in the series
B002Q85A1I|5.0|I have always loved this ballet, and have seen it performed many times.  This cd resonates with its beautiful orchestration and creates mental images of those ballet performances.  It is a perfect addition to the office music for the holidays.
B0018BB20W|4.0|There has been enough written about this album, so I won't bother, it's just a classic.  For those who don't know it, it has some classic Moody songs inter-spaced with some long orchestra sections.  If orchestra type music isn't to your liking you may want to see if the more &#34;rock&#34; songs are available on a collection.
B00914JWSW|5.0|That voice! (says it all) Lovely songs - a Randy Newman (I think it's gonna rain today), a Gatlin!! that Babs does beautifully (Lose a lover, win a friend), Willow Weep for Me, lots more. All fab.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|I like the ease of digital purchases. I have only viewed it on PC, but can't wait to try it on ipad and kindle fire.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This continues to draw you in, just to see if some of the questions are answered , can be a little steamy , but hey we're all mature, aren't we?
B003O86FMW|5.0|daughter loves these books and looks forward to more of them to read.<br />She is anxious for the movie to come out.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I bought this movie hoping that it'd be a close sequel to &#34;The Band of Brothers&#34; movie from HBO - boy was I disappointed.  Sure it's a good war movie, but comparing it to B-O-B is like comparing a pee-wee football team to the NFL.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I read the reviews on Amazon after reading the book, and I recommend you do the same.<br /><br />I'll divide this review into three parts:<br /><br />(1) My Recommendation<br />(2) The Story (with some plot spoilers)<br />(3) Mood spoilers (the author's message and arrogance)<br /><br />(1) My Recommendation<br />I read this story at face value, and I imagine many readers will be coming in around this time at the same place I was: you had never heard of this book or author, you saw the trailers for the movie and became interested enough to read the book. For those that meet this criteria, you will not be disappointed and *I highly recommend you stop reading this review, and all reviews, and simply read the book* - then come back.<br /><br />The author's writing style is matter-of-fact, yet with imagery that will paint a vivid picture in your mind with efficacy and depth unlike most other writer's, and many of his musings on life were so profound, I put the book down more than once to contemplate before moving on.<br /><br />Read, enjoy, then think.<br /><br />(2) The Story<br />This book really has two distinct sections, before and after the sinking ship. They are very different, and each interesting in its own way.<br /><br />The first part of the book is about Piscine - soon to become Pi - growing up in India. It's fairly interesting, but frankly starts to become somewhat tiresome, but don't worry, the adventure begins before you get too bored. The savior of this part of the book are the profound thoughts I mention above, which are littered throughout this section and the book. I wish I had thought to highlight some of them so I could quote them here.<br /><br />Then begins the catastrophic event that begins the adventure, Pi's suffering, and the meat of the book. It's truly an incredible story, with fascinating details about the workings of the animal world and zoology, enduring in a survival situation, and how the human spirit deals with tremendously difficult situations. It's rarely pretty and heroic, and I like the realistic way it is dealt with in this story.<br /><br />The interactions between the animals, and Pi with the animals and sea life, are rich with detail and truly immerse. Once you power through the first section, you will not put this book down. I think I finished it in 3-4 days despite an extremely hectic life right now.<br /><br />There really isn't much more to say about the story because, taken at face value, it's just that - an awe-inspiring story that will delight and captivate your mind. It's when you delve deeper that some of the magic is lost...<br /><br />(3) Mood Spoilers - the Message and the Author<br />Having not been introduced to the author's ego previously, my eyes were opened as I read the last few pages of the book and then hopped on to Amazon to read other's thoughts. There are many in-depth write ups here, so I'll just summarize what I find to be the most important to understand:<br /><br />- the ending of this incredible story is somewhat disappointing. Pi laments about the Tiger's 'unceremonious' goodbye when they part ways; I felt almost as unsatisfied and without closure when, after enduring Pi's amazing journey and suffering for so many pages, I feel almost abandoned unceremoniously on the Mexican beach myself.<br />- in the final interview, Pi's attitude and personality seem to change to the author's, who apparently is somewhat smug and self-satisfying. Frankly, I don't know how such a person wrote so well from thee vantage point of a wide-eyed, innocent youth for the entire book<br />- I do want to say here that it is not so terrible as to spoil the book; I still highly recommend you read and enjoy it<br />- The author's essential message seems to be - and this is explicitly stated in the book - choose a path in life. Believe in God, or be an atheist. To be agnostic is illogical and a waste of life (essentially).<br />- The final interview with Pi then seems to take a further stance that one should choose belief in God, or actually *man's stories about God*, because they are a more artistic and satisfying view than stark, uncaring, meaningless reality<br /><br />It basically smacks of the smug arrogance of deeply devout adherent to organized religion that many of us have met throughout our lives; you know, the ones who ooze of self-righteousness and would almost pity the lack of higher meaning in your life if they weren't so self-absorbed to even care.<br /><br />It doesn't ruin the book, it just sort of cheapens the wonderful journey you just finished enjoying. But it's not enough to spoil the adventure, at least not for me.
0525953728|5.0|this book is so easy to read and packed with excitement, it took me just 10 hrs to read it.  The best part of the book (for a visual learner like me) was the maps, aerial photos in the middle of the book to help me visualize what was going on.<br />it's quite obvious that the media has their own rendition of what took place on this day, and is quite different than what actually happened.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book was very interesting.  It was very descriptive and &#34;wordy&#34;, but kept you wondering what could possibly happen next.  It reminded me so much of Forrest Gump. I could not imagine a 100 Year old man being as active as Allan was.  It was very hard to find a stopping place and I wanted to keep reading all Night.  It was a book filled with Humor and Mystery and I enjoyed  it very much.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I did skip over some of the &#34;History&#34; as that part was a little boring and unreal.
0062082353|5.0|nothing better than a real life hero telling his story.  if you have any respect for the military you'll enjoy this book, if you are unsure if you support the military, read this book to see what types of sacrifices some make so that we can all walk the streets safe and sound.
B008VBYN80|4.0|kindle version is difficult to add friend's. for quests ... needs better options ... faster timers for coins ... seems. like a good game so far
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read, very engrossing.  Couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed past Grisham novels.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love the Supernatural Series.  I have them all except seasons 3 and 4. I hope Santa has his eyes on this review.  Sam and Dean ROCK!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Who doesn't like the program.  It is so well done that you feel you know the family members, up stairs and down.  My friends and I can hardly wait for the 3rd season to start.  We even like the re-runs.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I already have this game and can say that it is a great choice for FAOTD. I have been playing this for a couple of months. This is different from the typical Bejeweled clone in that the graphics are more like a DS game instead of glossy HD.  This game plays well on phones and tablets. This takes up less space than the Bejeweled app as well.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is so much better then one that comes on kindle.  You can input words to find and gives you options.  A great tool:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's just like playing with a deck of cards--good graphics and sound effects.<br />Nice game for downtimes and for relaxation
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Good book. Very much enjoyed the various writing styles. I anticipate the movie will not be as good. I would recommend this book to a variety of different genre readers.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game is awesome.  once you get started. you don't want to stop.  adventure at every turn of the game. Varsity. of small games to archive new goals as you play. I strongly recommend this game if you want adventure and excitement.  Most enjoyable!
0395389496|5.0|This book is an amazing book to read to children, or anyone for that matter. It brings back childhood memories that can make any person smile no matter what their age is. Many of us have grown up with the presentation of Santa clause bringing us presents on Christmas Eve. This book allows children to understand that while Santa Clause isn't \\"real\\" the spirit of Christmas is what we need to believe in.  Children need to understand that Christmas spirit is what they need to keep all throughout the year not just during Christmas and this book does a good job showing that. When the boy gets to choose the first Christmas present he doesn't pick a toy he pick a token that will help him remember the Christmas spirit forever. People need to understand its not about what you get it's what you give.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is the most amazing movie I've seen in years. Absolutely phenomenal acting. True love portrayed wonderfully between Sam and Suzy. My Review 5 STARS!
B009SMW9IW|5.0|Beautiful writing and singing on this collection of Christmas music. I like the maturity of this understanding of Christmas. It reminded me of Mary Chapin Carpenter's Christmas album. Outstanding track is Joy
0451228375|5.0|Wonder parts of history tied into a tale of interesting eras.  This volume is full of life, history and excitement!
B008M721MS|2.0|I bought the kindle because of skype. I tried several times to skype with my grandson. Then went to skype Faq Forum.  Guess there are hundreds of people with the same issues. call does not go thru, hangs up, no pic or no sound. Pleaze fix this app.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie to watch with your older kids..the storyline is quite disturbing at the same but it is thrilling and rewarding to see those who deserve to win actually win and those who deserved to be punished actual get it!
B00009MGR6|4.0|Blow Up Your Video may not be on the same legendary status as say Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, If You Want Blood You've Got It, Highway To Hell, and the band's most successful LP Back In Black, but it's certainly not a bad album at all. It even has one of my all-time favorite songs by the band:That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll. The album was recorded at Studio Miraval in France, which is also where Pink Floyd recorded parts of their classic album \\"The Wall\\". This album would be the last time Brian Johnson had any part in songwriting up until 2008's Black Ice. The band still rocks out and delivers great rock music on this album like they always do. Other highlights include Kissin' Dynamite, Two's Up, and the final track:This Means War.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Nice plot for a Mother/Daughter resolution play.  It would have been better if there had been at least one or two admirable male characters.  Perhaps if the father figure hadn't been so dumbed down.  As it is, this movie doesn't have a single significant adult male character which isn't the cartoon representations of some form of stupid, evil, or awkward.  Only the mother and daughter come close to being normal in both their cartoon physical form and character representation.  Maybe this is a good movie for a single Mom to share with her daughter?
B0086HJW76|4.0|I've seen Joe since his pre-recording days when I lived in Cleveland (6 times) and have never been disappointed in his music. He has a great sense of humor, seems humble and kicks ass on the guitar.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My 10 month old baby loved it! The figures are enough large and very cute. Definitely I would recommend this product.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Nice product that is convienant and protective.  Dosen't seem to stay folded well.  I don't understand how it is supposed to stay folded.
B004UAKAE2|5.0|This period-piece sucks you in! It is a great drama showcasing class relations in late 19th-to-early 20th-century England. The acting and lines are wonderful!<br /><br />You can't help but root for the underdog(underclass) yet feel yourself a part of the upperclass. This is a pure meld of fact, fantasy, and fiction at its finest.<br /><br />If you enjoy other BBC period-pieces, you will fully enjoy this.<br /><br />Watch this BEFORE you watch the present-day series.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the characters more than the 50 Shades. I love more empowered, screwed up women as characters, not women who are door mats! I also wish I had a Gideon at home for myself.
B000OJFV3S|5.0|I ADORE this series. I watched the first episode on a whim and it had me hooked. I finished the rest as soon as I could.<br /><br />Wonderful acting by all involved. The dramatics, acting, period clothing, and setting were wonderful and engulfs the viewer.<br /><br />While the kings appear to be the focus, the queens are actually center-stage and telling/influencing the story.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I would have read 10 more of these books. They were so good. I am looking forward to the third book from Gideon's point of view.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I loved the book so much, I even bought the CDs.  I also enjoyed Blink and Outliers as well.  The Tipping Point connects the dots on how small things can add up to big changes.  Gladwell equates cleaning the subway system to cleaning up crime in New York.  At the time I read this book, the concept was mind boggling.  I can't wait to read his other books.  He kept me interested throughout the book, and he's held my attention for other books as well.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Ive enjoyed this movie as a kid so much that now at 48yrs old I still love it so much that I bought the dvd.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|I have tried to watch this movie several times, and invariably I end up falling asleep on it.  The series of books are so dynamic and prolific.  I especially loved the Celestine Prophecy.  Maybe that dynamism can't be translated onto film?  I find the movie boring and hard to get into.  It's a pity because the book is fabulous and chock-full of useful information even though it's mostly fiction.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Great selection of tracks on here, worth the price alone for the awesome two new tracks.  After 50 years this band still proves they can outperform and out gun any of todays crap bands.  Hails to the Stones \m/
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was very interesting, historically based it gave a compelling account into slavery and the lives of those who endured a time in American history we should not be proud of.
B00006AW2S|5.0|One of the Stones many classic albums that is just as much relevent, inspirational, and just plain awesome today as it was back then.  From start to finish it's a very enjoyable album, when you listen to the Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, The Who etc the Stones always stand out.  Very happy with purchase.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is a great souding cd.  Depeche Mode has yet to disappoint.  Love this CD & the lyrics are great.  A lot of haunting meoldy tracks.  Reminds me a little of Violator.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This is just another book of the same old stuff that drives me to distraction.  There has to be a way of explaining the technique to format a book for Kindle without upgrading the strength of a person's xanax.  If there is, I haven't found it.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love this CD, actually all of her CDs!  She is brilliant.  I grew up with her starting in my college years, and I have matured and grown as she's grown in her musical talents.  I have enjoyed everything that Alicia Keys has sung.  I would definitely recommend this CD, it is her best yet!
B007HACDLK|4.0|For anyone who is a Vince Flynn fan this will be the usual fun read. The story of our hero and his boss lady is still a great one. One almost wishes that the protagonist was real and that all self-serving, twisted, America haters both in and out of government could be dealt with so summarily and satisfyingly.
0156027321|5.0|I LOVED IT!  Not the typical book I'm attracted to (I love mysteries) but this book caught me and wouldn't let me go.  Pi is a character I will never forget.  Take the plunge and the adventure of your life!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great app. works as easy as a piece of apple pie.<br />keep the good apps coming.<br />God Bless the USA
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I'd long been wanting to see this film but just never got the chance until recently I decided to buy the DVD. While I haven't yet seen the special features I found the picture and sound quality in the feature film was excellent.<br /><br />The movie itself was just okay. When I saw that it was written by Aaron Sorkin (The American President, A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War) I thought I'd be in for a real treat. Unfortunately, the film just wasn't as good as I hoped. I do think most of the actors did a good job but the story suffered from too much &#34;poetic license&#34; and the embellishments detracted from the facts of how Facebook really came to be, the relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and others, etc.<br /><br />There were also points where it really dragged, and the film told in a series of flashbacks wasn't the best method of execution. But it was well-paced and held my interest. I had hoped to hear a little bit more about the technical side (technical professional that I am) but I imagine a documentary would be the better setting for that. So although the film wasn't what I'd hoped, on its own merits it was a good.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very interesting game will get addicted to it. And it is a very good smart buy to relax with.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|I just love the groove of this album.  It was recommended by a friend.  She definitely gets extra truffles in her xmas gift.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is very clever and a nice break from all of the ho hum ( boring) authors doing the same old love story over again. I was looking for a change from the mundane and I got it . I was left wanting to find out more about what happens with these characters, which is good because that really means she gave enough to get me invested in the people in the novel. It is a pleasant change of scenery from the ordinary. Bravo!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Obviously first time writer.  Poor flow.  The only thing going for it is that it is popular porn.  There is better porn out there.  And sometimes the lady even gets to tie up the man
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This is a great little game particularly for a free version . I have loved playing it it down time to relieve stress .
B00632KSXI|5.0|All of us, including my 3 autistic boys, love singing along.  Very singable.  Wonderful beat.  Awesome.  Just never seems repetitive.
B0027BVMSY|2.0|I sat there thinking for most of the movie &#34;what is going on&#34;. The action scenes in the movie were great though.
B0050IY61G|5.0|A very down to earth, encouraging book.  Full of humor and good sense  I recommend any of Attwood's books heartily.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|No issues so far with my Kindle Fire HD - it looks great, functions properly and I haven't had any crashes, etc.
B002QBS9KE|2.0|I was very disappointed that this didn't fit my Plantronics blue tooth  I don't know what to do now  It sucks to have to buy a whole new one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to Pinterest as it is and now that the app is available for viewing on my Kindle Fire HD - I couldn't be happier! The mobile option of this site is great!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Waiting a week in between each episode is very hard. It has so many plot twists and turns...I love it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I never really followed the comics or knew the story line behind the Avengers, but I loved this movie. It was very entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun game for everyone in the family from 6 to 50 years old.  It changes enough to be interesting.
B007UXTG8M|1.0|I should've researched what this movie was about before I watched it. The theme was not appealing to me. I would not recommend this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|lotsa fun with reasonable challenges without being discouraging.<br />need friends though and seems difficult to get people to join...any suggestions?
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I love this movie! The Fantastic Mr. Fox is very witty. One of Wes Anderson's best. If you enjoy witty humor you will love this movie!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Because it's a great movie. Not only is it action packed but humorous also, to top it off, Robert Downey jr is in it.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This a great movie! A classic in my opinion. Leonard and Kate were amazing in this movie. I feel like this is one of those movies everyone should own.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very fun game! deffinatly getting the second! very good story, and im sure the next one will have just as good of a story.
6305622914|5.0|My wife and her sisters love this movie and I get a real kick out of watching them watch the movie.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book held my attention every step of the way through a well woven story set during London blitz of WWII.  Character development was excellent and I felt like I truly got to know each one of them.  There were twists and turns throughout that kept me guessing - it was wonderful!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The entire album is amazing. I could listen to it all day. The talent the band has is heard in every song.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Kept my 2.5 year old grandson well occupied. He loves the toy story trilogy. I would recommend it for all ages.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading this several months ago and just didn't get past the first few pages.  Picked it up again during a lull and am glad I did.  Read 1-5 and now Im hooked.  I'm imagining it as a movie and picking actors for various characters.  Just purchased volumes 6 and 7 and am happy I can continue the story. No end of series blues for a few days now!
B000FCK42M|5.0|Terrifice fast moving keeps you involved until the end--could not put it down---Certainly gained  an insight to the Mexican drug situation
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I enjoyed the general movie experience, however, the movie as a whole lacked a somewhat dreamy quality it could have achieved.  This locale was vibrant with color, great actors and interesting plot.  I just felt it needed more depth, for i truly liked the idea it tried to express to viewers.  Agreed, there were some very serious and sombre moments, but others could have built the film quality higher.
B003TJ4YUQ|4.0|Everything my husband thought it would be he loves it. Once again this is not for me but that doesnt matter.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|Thoughtfully made and kept me interested throughout.  Had forgotten this was an actual account of true events.  Loved the TV footage at the end.
B002NOYX54|4.0|Songs from around the world was one of the best Xmas presents i could have bought my husband as he is hard to buy for and he loved it.
B004XWLN20|5.0|If you know anyone to give this to as a gift, the packaging is beautiful!  And, of course, the show is entertaining.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is an amazing story and even my 26 year old son loved this one. Have purchased him a copy as well. Very moving and you would be hard pressed ot to like it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The HD graphics are top notch and the voice acting is very good. I've heard of the series and decided to at least try this game and I'm loving the comparisons of it from games like Sim City and such. I recommend this adorable game for all ages or whoever really likes the series.
B009D5VNLS|2.0|Outline of the story was too pointed out for tweens or teenagers, predictable and hardly any funny elements in it. When you sit down to watch a cartoon, you expect to enjoy yourself. This was too boring.
159413586X|1.0|This product is mislabeled. It is in extra large print. If you prefer normal (or smaller) print I would not advice purchasing.
1451695195|5.0|In the past, many doctors tended to ignore any patient who tried to tell of a near death experience.  Now you hear from the doctor why it is a real heavenly experience, and cannot be faked.  Great inspiring book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is great. It lets me know how much battery life I have for reading, gaming, video, etc. And it's free!
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|This covered every aspect and every question I had as a new writer. It was a good read, just as entertaining as one of his novels.
B004RE29WW|3.0|My 3rd favorite of the original trilogy . Still good if you like the franchise, and has more punch than the recent additions.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You wont regret it! The best show ever! Suspense, love, and gore! Its going to keep you on the edge of your seat! BEst season so far.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Great movie to watch with the family. Might be to scary for the youngsters but overall a good flick. A+
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Good movie  spin off on old tale. Great images and well paced story. Never really a dull moment. Acting is OK. The dwarfs steal the show  just like the old Disney animated classic.
1426209584|5.0|A beautifully present book...<br />It's nice to knoe that there is still a place like national Geographic, that will help fund these extraordinary adventures.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a good read. An  entertaining tale of plotting and twisting story line. One of Grisham's better efforts. It seems like a cross between the  old movie The Sting and Shawshank Redemption.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|I enjoy zombie movies.  I won't say I adore, love, or can't get enough of them, but I really enjoy them.  However, I do get tired of the same old thing over and over.  \\"Exit Humanity\\" was not that.  It wasn't the same thing over and over.  It took a bit.  I had to wait for it, however, when the credits rolled, I felt I had watched something worthwhile and ... about zombies.  The thing was, it wasn't so much about zombies as it was about the search for hope.  One man's nightmare and desire to die transformed back into hope and even love.  If you are wanting a movie full of blood and guts with ripping action and heads flying, there are a lot of those out there - pick one.  Heck, pick 10.  But, if you don't mind a movie that takes its time and unwinds, showing you something that you can like and enjoy and even feel a bit good about, then \\"Exit Humanity\\" may just be what you are looking for.  Blood? Yes.  Some gore? Yes.  Zombies?  Yep.  But more than that, it's a pretty decent film.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I learned so much about Yemen that I  know i do not want to go there. DeMille's book is entertaining and his lead character, Corey, is very funny. However, this book is way too long by about 150 pages. It drags on and is almost predictable from about 100 pages in to it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This was the first app I bought a couple years ago.  I still play it.  It is a classic game.  A must for Dr.s waiting rooms.  Kids love it too.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|This album, Merry Christmas, Baby,  has a nice collection of Christmas Songs.  A good addition to my Christmas Holiday playlist.
B00701L5XS|3.0|I purchased this app as I have used their website and found it to be a great source of knot tying instruction and information. At the time of purchase, from Amazon, I needed to splice rode to chain and that was not in the app, a great disappointment.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Sherlock Holmes:  A Game of Shadows:  Really enjoyed this movie.  Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job as Sherlock Holmes.
B009T9P7OC|2.0|After purchase, I continued to suffer through ads, which I thought was the main point of paying for the 'plus' version instead of going with the free version. It does have some useful features, but the constant ads are a deal-breaker for me. I even got an 'important message flag (not in the ad area) that took me to what appeared to be a phishing site trying to get private information by saying that I 'have won a fantastic prize' (yeah, right). It also does not allow you to specify which folders you want it to look in for audio files, so it included a bunch of sound effects files, which were not really music but could not be removed from my 'music collection.'<br /><br />In short, the player itself is nice enough, with a nice equalizer, and if constant ads don't bother you, I suggest the free version. I can't see any advantage to the paid version, as there are players with similar features, at a similar price with no annoying ads, and which allow you to limit your music search to certain folders if you wish.
B003K16P50|4.0|I bought this book reluctantly as a book club recomendation and I was pleasantly surprised.  Although I found it to be a bit slow starting, it soon captured my interest as I discovered the author's subtle message about the absurdity of politics and cultural chauvinism.  I think it  will engender much discussion.
B0085KGHI6|4.0|Pressed wrong button. Tried to change review earlier. Do not know why that did not work. Evidently cannot delete review. Tried.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is so not a pice of shit like anything else that tootley failed it is awsome I love it. it is just like minecraft
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This is a very detailed history of Lincoln and his interaction with others. There were pssages I skipped over because I was not interested in that much detail on a secondary character's social life. The political detail and the military detail provided me insight into how excellent a leader Lincoln was. An important book to read even though you might find yourself skimming at times.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie, is wonderful!  it has humor and suspense and some scares.....lots of Pirate treasure too!  it is suitable for the whole family.  My sons loved it when they were younger, and still do!!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|My husbands hero!!! had to get this copy so he can watch it anytime and anywhere.  He is a happy husband.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I loved Sherlock Holmes (books and TV show) as a kid.  When I saw this for 99 cents I jumped on it.  A timeless,classic book, this purchase was a no brainer. [[ASIN:B00A71EROW Afterlife - An Introduction to Dante's Inferno]]
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a really fun game! Its hard to level up though,  with tasks/missions,  but still a really fun game! Not that it teaches responsiblity, it might,  I have no clue if it does. But like the title,  BEST fantasy game EVER!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This product is great for really opening up your Kindle Fire and KFHD, Once downloaded and a little googling you can open up your Kindle to use Flash and other desktop like features.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My husband and I love the Supernatural Series!!!  Season seven is no exception!  Delivery time was awesome.  It arrived undamaged and we were able to enjoy the latest installment of the Winchester brothers!!!!  I highly recommend this series to anyone and everyone!!!!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Warrior is the greatest sports film of the century.<br />There is nothing new here - the story is typical, even cliched. One can predict the ending before it happens, and the usual heroes arc from defeat to victor is present.<br /><br />But everything is doubled! The acting, with the incomparable Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, the brutal fighting (as an MMA student myself, I can tell you this is some of the most realistic fighting I've seen in a film), the story, the emotion, and the characters.<br /><br />A true triumph from director Gavin O'Connor (Pumping Iron, Miracle - another great sports film), but the real stars are the actors - especially Tom Hardy.<br /><br />Strongest Reccomendation! Watch this film immediately, and read my other reviews!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I loved this. It is a DVD I use to get back into exercising if I take a few weeks off. I notice a difference in the first weeks. I don't do it in 30 days - I use the DVD 3 times a week and alternate it with yoga or running. There isn't much stretching for warm up or for a cool down, so even though its a 20 minute work out and a 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down, I generally take about 40 with the stretching.<br /><br />Great if you are just getting back into exercising or looking to begin. The two girls you can watch are great inspiration to try harder and you can see your improvement.<br /><br />I am a 23 year old female, in relatively good shape but a beginner in exercising.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD (plus a CD) of a concert at Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago (Buddy Guy's club). The DVD begins with a couple blues songs--&#34;Sweet Little Angel&#34; and &#34;Flip Flop and Fly.&#34; Nice playing, but I was wondering--&#34;Where is Muddy Waters.&#34; Then, Muddy heads to the stage and we see him perform with his band. Wonderful blues playing, with &#34;You Don't Have to Go&#34; and &#34;Country Boy.&#34; The club provides a claustrophobic feel--small room where people sit almost on top of one another. People are lined up at the entrance, and are admitted as others leave.<br /><br />The show really gets rolling during &#34;Baby Please Don't Go,&#34; as we see four Stones enter--Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, and Ian Stewart. When Waters sees them, he invites them to stage. In a way, this is eminently appropriate, since the Rolling Stones took their name from one of Waters' songs and since the Rolling Stones had extolled the virtues of Muddy Waters as an influence on their work (and sometimes had his songs in their play list). One of the touching aspects of this DVD is what appears to be genuine affection and warmth between the old blues warrior and his musical progeny, an unlikely band of Englishmen.<br /><br />We see  Richards and Wood playing with Waters' band on a number of songs; Waters invites Stewart to play the piano. Jagger and Waters play off of one another on the vocals. Making the video more enjoyable--more guests, including legends like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells who join in the music. The small stage features players leaving to make room for new players. The improvisational quality of the concert is most pleasurable.<br /><br />And the songs? It's hard to beat &#34;Mannish Boy,&#34; &#34;Hoochie Coochie Man,&#34;  &#34;Got My Mojo Working,&#34; &#34;Champagne and Reefer,&#34; and so on. One feature that I especially enjoyed was the various guitar players playing off of one another--Wood, Richards, Lefty Dizz, Guy, and Waters himself at some points, among others.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD is pretty good, given that it was captured in 1981.<br /><br />All in all, a terrific and energetic concert. It was telling to see the obvious influence that blues legends like Muddy Waters had on the Rolling Stones. And how naturally they played the blues. An hour and a half worth of music that seemed to last only moments as the performance unfolded. . . .among others.  The quality of the DVD is pretty good, given that it was captured in 1981.

B00005JPSM|5.0|Typical romatic comedy (it is wholesome!), but one I will watch over and over. I used to always watch it on TV and then saw it on sale and decided to buy it. The acting is cute, the plot is standard, but there is something about the actors and all of their chemistry that tie it all together.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a great rebound from the tamer season 2.  Season 3 offers some interesting characters, not all are welcome. Can't wait to watch every episode.
B007FTZDN8|1.0|can't believe they restrict it to US billing addresses only! same thing happens with many free apps..<br />I hope they change their policies soon.
0345803493|5.0|I think these books are amazing but when mine came in the mail it had some pages that were just printed weird like there was a page half typed out and then the rest of the page was on another slip of paper attached to the book. It was really weird.
B004UID2LC|1.0|i was downloading this app and my antivirus phone detected an malawere and act like one DO NOT DOWNLOAD (Also slows down your tablet)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My coworkers are playing it too! Nice to have angry birds back in my life!!!  Fun for hours, keep the kids quiet!
B008M87GJK|1.0|I was disappointed to find that the app was only videos . It would be prefferrable to have a news summary with embeded videos ...similar to the bbcnews website
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire was a book that I really did not expect it to play out the way that it did. And I could not put the book down. I was thinking , how can they do that to the characters, and why would they? I can't wait for the movie to come out to see how they play it all out in the movie.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|I really enjoyed this app playing with my cousins. Sadly I downloaded it to my kindle fire and paid 1.99 and it keeps asking for me to update it! Ugh and now it wont work. I am angry.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games book, I was not sure I wanted to read. The movie clips did not really interest me to even go see the movie let alone read the book. I really did not espect the way the book played everything out. I finished reading the first book then rented the movie and waited to see how the movie would play it out. I'm glad I read the book and currently am reading the 3rd book. I find that the books are hard to put down.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I had no idea the Zooey sang, my daughter has since given my the complete rundown!<br />Beautiful singing, will listen to this a lot, I am sure.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What an incredible story of courage, perseverance, faith, duty and honor. Will challenge you to be a better man. Adam's story grabs you by the belt buckle and refuses to let go.
0345529057|5.0|Great books from a great author. I read these bboks on break at work and they definetly make the time go by would definetly recommend these to fellow fantasy lovers.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Runs great. The designs are good though I hope there are some more interesting designs in upcoming levels. Hours of fun.
1596680296|5.0|If you want to learn to knit socks, this is your book. In fact, you can learn to knit with this book. After years of knitting socks, this is still my go-to book for heels and toes. Worth every penny.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I got this to kill time and I find myself playing this more and more I would recommend this game to anyone that has some knowledge of shooting games.
0547884591|5.0|This tremendous book is a delight to read. I laugh out loud every few pages. It invites us to become more involved in life, and then provides practical guidance for that journey. Tim Ferriss seems to have uncovered a more meaningful value system, wherein, quality of life is not measured by material things or ease, but by the degree to which you actualize yourself and maximize every experience. This book suggests that learning, itself, is the key to a rich existance.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My wife and I are big angry birds fans. So when I heard about this game I had to try it and not only is this game fun but its a unique game that sets itself apart from other games, I recommend this to anyone that enjoys puzzle solving and looking for a good time while traveling.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. More interesting by the day. There's nothing i do not like about this show. I wosh it was cheaper to buy the episodes more like 99¢… not $2.11 after taxes.
B005HSL626|5.0|My wife and choose this for our daughter we all instantly fell in love with this game. It was easy to pick up and play my daughter is enjoying this game and I would recommend this to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased the book for my Kindle because so many people were talking about it.  It's not my thing. Wish I hadn't purchased it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is better than bedside alarm clock and looks better too I don't even know why I got the first
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great Christmas movie for the whole family.  We took our grandson to see this in the movies when he was3.
B009QW7HMC|2.0|I have to admit when I first started watching this show I was prepared to dislike it intensely. I'm not a huge zombie fan to begin with, too much grossness what with falling body parts and their predeliction to snacking on the living plus the screaming just doesn't usually make for the kind of entertainment I enjoy. But the Walking Dead Season 1 charmed me enough with it's believable, intriguing characters and end of the world as we know it depiction to get into watching it. And I found myself enjoying it immensely even though I had to hold a pillow in my lap to block out the more squeem-inducing moments. (If you've seen the show you know what I'm talking about)<br /><br />Season 2 was equally great, more so since now we knew the characters enough to care about their fates and/or even be annoyed by some while growing to love others. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT HERE - But then when Shane died at the end of Season 2 I thought, \\"Uh-oh, am I going to even like Season 3?\\" Granted while Shane wasn't the greatest humanitarian he was THE main source of the internal conflict amongst the group. It made watching the series so worth it for me since I was by turns fascinated, frightened and even sometimes sympathetic of his hoped for role as savior and hero being upstaged repeatedly by his best friend, Rick. It's enough to drive a man mad and sure enough that's what happened to Shane and then Rick, every the shining hero put an end to Shane's life. And sadly the best source of internal conflict on the show too. This left me wondering what Season 3 would bring. I heard about Michonne and that seemed like a good thing. A kickbutt woman with a katana? How cool will that be, right?<br /><br />And then Season 3 arrived and with it my feelings of growing...boredom. Sadly Michonne's character is taking forever to develop and sorry, but having the actress run around looking angry all the time while not saying much does not endear her to me. I know Michonne's a strong, silent warrior type, but I don't know why since she's just not been given the time and attention her character needs to take it's place in the overall story. The Governor is also boring since again we know he's a bad guy who seems charming on the surface, but not really why outside of the usual cliched \\"former nobody finds himself in power and aims to keep it that way no matter who he has to mow down along the way\\" villian. And the survivors themselves haven't really gained much in the way of new developments either. All of this leads to a not very compelling story to watch and maybe it's just me, but I find myself having to use the pillow in my lap alot more this season. Even in places where I don't think we should have to like did we really have to see Hershel's foot getting cut off? That coupled with the fact that things just keep getting worse and worse and worse and there's no real reason to care or goal to be had makes me feel that this story is simply another one of the walking dead, shuffling along with a blank stare on its collective face. And I'm so jaded by this point I just dance out of the zombie's way a little bit then don't even bother with the head shot since it really just isn't anything I'm interested in dealing with now. For me anyways, this show is dead.
B007KPY9O6|5.0|It's a Tolkien Reader,what more can one say. LOTR was the main course,this Tolkien collection is a fine brandy after a more than agreeable meal. Oh,yes,great service from this seller.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great album - love Thrift Shop, Same Love, White Walls, A Wake, and Neon Cathedrals especially.  Ryan's beats are amazing, as usual.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time and it had me rolling on the floor with laughter.  This is a must see Christmas movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Friends recommended book one. I enjoyed the story so much and heard other people talking<br />  about it I couldn't stop and wanted more.I feel part of this and love the characters.Thank you .Going for more....
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this was a great movie to watch with the family.  I will definetly watch this with my family again on movie night.
B005R32L66|4.0|I use this app to stay in touch with distant family members.<br />It usually works really well, although video chat is sometimes a bit rough.<br />IM is flawless, and easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool game for kids, I just wish everything didn't cost money during game play. Its like you can only do so much because they want you to purchase more coins.  Where are the straight up games that don't require extra money.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I have been listening to the deftones, like most any other fan, from the beginning. I still remember how big white pony was when released. Huge signs in record stores.... anyhow I loved white pony and everything else sense then has been a bummer. I liked maybe 1 or 2 songs but never enough to buy an album.(not including teamsleep, I loved it) So from fans not unlike you pioneers I heard good things n bought it in Black Friday fray. I love it, so many of my favorite bands had to change or fade away, but my faith is restored. I give 5 stars to all but two songs... not bad out of ten.
B001R6AW18|5.0|it's old school and the very first king kong to movies faye raye love her screams the original movie that sceared me
076115728X|5.0|This is a great book.  I bought for my daughter when she was... 4 or 5 and I have just passed it along to my 3 year old son. He was fascinated. My daughter loved it and still does. Tactile, interactive, and teaches kids it's okay to make mistakes and turn accidents into art. Every kid should have this book!
B004FEJ3VY|2.0|Very difficult to transform and it broke very easily. My son loved it but was frustrated because he couldn't transform without getting help from my husband and I, and we even had issues changing it back and forth. Probably more of a toy to &#34;look&#34; at and not play with.
B00881PPTO|1.0|This app might be good, might be bad, I will never know. I downloaded it and when it came to the permissions page I read send emails from users account without their permission.....what??? No thanks.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love Stephen King - and  this being one of his first ventures left me in awe.  A really short story that delivers!  It has his touch!
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This is the first Fiona Apple album I have listened to from start to beginning. I was very impressed and now own two other albums. This album is a wonderful concoction of light and dark moods. Her voice is amazing and the music is well arranged. Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|You've heard it before: &#34;I couldn't put this down&#34;.  -  Loved it all the way through.  Characters so well-drawn, story so fascinating, plot just great.  My introduction to Stephen King's writing was in reading &#34;The Shining&#34;.  I've been hooked ever since.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This set is exactly what I was looking for. I am reading the series (some books for the first time, some for the second) and I wanted the movies so that I could watch them after I finish the books. I don't use all the extras movies offer such as behind the scenes views or commentaries, etc. I didn't need all the bells and whistles, I just wanted to watch the movies. This was perfect! It's a simple set that has only what I need. If you're looking for some great collector's edition, this is not for you. However, if you're like me and just want the basic movie, this set is ideal and definitely worth the price!
B0015DYIH2|2.0|Realizing that the main concept of this story is all over the place today, of course most younger folks would find this read \\"great\\".<br />Being a writer, inquisitive, and imbued with imagination - always open to and excited by the new and different, I found the writing trite - and not even placed in my category of 'fantasy'.  I had hoped it would make a good read during airplane travel, but it fell very short.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What a waste of good reading time! Even my husband, who wanted it purchased to see what all the fuss was about didn't finish.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone 15 or older.  I think it would appeal to the females. Funny and sad.  Great characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book until I found it had a epilogue. Did not like the way the end was split up and written. Hopefully more to come.<br />.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OK yes the book is filled with sex, but it's not just about that. The story line is heartwarming and you find yourself wanting this fifty shades f'd up guy for yourself!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I downloaded the app thinking it looked really nice, however the location cant be adjusted and the widget doesn't work. The try before you buy feature in the app center is useless. It looks really nice but it doesn't work. Don't waste the $0.99 on it,...too many bugs.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mr. Albom just has a way of weaving un-attached souls together in a way that holds your interest until the end. Another great creation in an ongoing sucessful writing career.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I love this series. Its one of the best t.v shows i have seen in a long time. I love it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Writer keeps you interested throughout the build up and through the actual mission and after. Great detail. Add this one to your list.
1608871452|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book ... Just looking at the front cover I knew I was going to love this book.  Excellent quality, excellent pictures, awesome little extras ... Extremely happy with my purchase.  Love Supernatural ... Love the Winchester brothers :)
B008K8VDPU|5.0|For young and old alike--works fine with lots of options!!  Will see how battery life is affected after a few times playing
B001AOKA3W|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I have watched it three times. It is different, which is partly why I enjoyed it so much. However, a lot of people do not enjoy this movie because of the shaky camera. Some people say it made them feel sick. I liked how it was like that because it made it feel real. So it really comes down to whether or not you want to sit through a movie where it is like just some random person making a home video.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed this book.<br />It was my first Baldacci read.<br />It was recommended to me by a friend.<br />I will mostly likely read more of his work.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 or 4 times already and would love to watch it again. The first time I watched it I was completely shocked. Everytime that I watch it again I notice new details that I didn't notice the time before. I highly recommend this movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This app is th best I wish I could give it 1,000,000 stars!! thanks team lava for the best app ever!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The flow of the book is very good. Simple enough not to confuse but complex enough to keep people interested and reading. A good read.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The shooting scenes are pure comedy. Jean-Claude Van Damme is great in his Nazi style bad guy role. Jet Li makes a very brief appearance. It was always a pleasure  to see  Dolph Lundgren  and Jet Li pick on each other as in Expendables I. Chuck Norris, finally off his exercise machine, was a surprise. OK, the story is they rescue village slaves, a ton of forgotten weapons grade plutonium from evil doers who plan to sell it, and get revenge for the brutal murder of a buddy. It is pure macho entertainment.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|So simple to review an excellent album. The words can not describe to much the joy to listen the music on this album. Just insert the CD in your player, turn the volume to a proper level and enjoy...
0439023521|5.0|I love to read this kind of book.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering how it would end.
B00978V35C|5.0|Another excellent album form Robert Cray. Powerful blues with wonderful melodic line and guitar solos. I strongly recommend to listen this album.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Kindle Fire came with a camera and no way to operate it without purchasing this option.  Cheap!<br />Camera works good for Skype I guess, or taking a picture of me, but i wish it had another camera on the other side so I could take a picture of something when I have the Kindle with me and don't have a camera.  I guess I could lay on the ground or on a picnic table to take pictures.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Cannot wait for the next episode.  I have scary movies and shows but this show was very well shot and directed.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Gives me what I want to know about the local weather.  I haven't spent much time with it, but, couldn't find a way to check the weather in other states.  There is quite a learning curve for the Kindle, it's not like a computer so there is probably a way I haven't discovered yet.
0767817664|4.0|Old movie that I thought would be fun for Halloween week! We all had fun watching this movie.<br />Good movie
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Loved the story.  recommeded by a friend.  easy to read with a good story line.  would recommend it to all.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love her voice and the music.  Different than your typical Christmas album and so much better than the popular music on the radio.
B00122QCHU|5.0|You can't go wrong with a bob james cd,  he is the first soft jazz I was introduced to and is one of my favs
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is a great basic app with a really large number display, which could be useful for people who prefer large print. The ads aren't annoying either. :)
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Jason Mraz and saw him in concert this summer (2012). He is an amazing entertainer and his lyrics are so inspiring. This album is perfect addition. &#34;Living in the Moment&#34; is my new favorite.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|It's not perfect...but I would rather have this than not. It is a good installment into the mythology of the Alien story.<br />People complain and complain. Who knew there were so many movie writers and producers out there with opinions.<br /><br />It is a good movie, fun and cool to see.<br /><br />So people complain and keep mentioning Alien franchise and miss the whole point. This is my opinion, I enjoyed it and thought it was pretty good. I want to see another one to see what happens next.
B008J05EL8|1.0|i have pirched this app and it wont poen even thow ihave downloded the app .it guzt sends me back to the pave were ihad pirched it and dose nothing so i wasted 5 dollers on an app that dose not even open !
B001NLKT60|4.0|So glad I picked up this trilogy. My Cardiologist recommended this read to me. The first book caught my eye and it was no stopping from there on.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson has moved up my reading writers list for sure. So much suspense along with twist and turns that one has to continue reading.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I waited a long time to watch this movie, and even bought the Alien Quadrilogy to prepare.  The plot and character development are laughable.  This movie is so bad, it's almost like parody of Alien.
B005KELW26|5.0|What can I say.....this Folio is perfect for my Kindle. Light weight and fits the Kindle just right. Oh and thanks for making it in purple...
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book is ok, but the scattered interview format with just snippets of insight into the zombie war is not very satisfying.  Also, you need to believe that 'rule of law' wouldn't completely dissolve in a world full of zombies (which goes against every other piece of zombie fiction, I believe).
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you enjoy a good laugh, you will completely enjoy this series, we have all the seasons on DVD so that we can return to our favorites.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great CD! Has several top rated songs of Adele from the radio. Would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Adele.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love all his books. They have a lovely story to it and even though you know they fall in love, it always is so interestering.
1401937519|5.0|This book has completely changed my perspective on life. Before reading it, I considered myself to be a joyful and spiritual person, but now I feel like a limitless, free and magnificent being. I truly believe in Anita's message that everything we desire is already ours - we don't need to strive to obtain it, because it's already part of our experience. The best thing we can \\"do\\" is be present and authentic as we enjoy the unfolding of life.<br /><br />After reading this, you might not feel as compelled to continue searching for the elusive answers to all of life's questions, or choose to engage in spiritual practices out of a sense of obligation. It's a liberating, inspiring and profoundly wise read.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|They are even better than the show. Read them before watching the show then reread them. Once you read them you can ruin the whole show for your friends.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I love this author.  I have enjoyed several books from her.  I was pleased not to have the ending figured out before the book was finished.  Wonderful story.
0345803493|5.0|good book. read the series. very pleased. wish there were more. read in 1 day, thats how interesting this book really is
B006LSZECO|4.0|You'll be asking yourself that very question as you read Gone Girl. The novel gets your attention from the start, but I did find that after the first part of the novel the story did slow done a bit. It picked up halfway though. The story is told from the husbands point of view and the wifes point of view. His is present time and her storyline goes back to when they met and how the relationship grew. I did like this book, there are several twist and turns, but like a lot of people here, I did not care for the ending it just seemed so unbelievable after all that had happened in the book, or maybe it's just not what I expected our characters to do. The ending did not give me the \\"wow\\" that I was hoping for.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This is a great movie! I got it for my God son, and he loved it! Good buy also. He watches it all the time!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Great movie, trust me, just watch it already. I may even read the book now. Better than most of the young adult movies that are out there.
6305972591|5.0|grabbed this old school movie for a gift. this movie is a classic. good buy good buy. came fast in the mail
B008DR2GD6|2.0|Okay, is Eddie Murphy doing kids movies now, or Raw for kids. I don't mind some swearing with my kids watching, but this was ridiculous. Stick with Daddy Day Care, or Dr. Doolittle.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love this show. The first season was filled with great laughs and I am going to buy the next season soon. :)
0547884591|5.0|I'm a big fan of Tim's 4-Hour series and Tim did not let me down with his third book.  I'm always amazed at the diversity of subjects Tim covers in his books.  I love the choose your own adventure style approach he takes.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The film brings you in, but is missing something that we can't put our finger on. Thought it would be better. Good to teach kids about consequences and proper behavior, IMHO.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Love the knife and quality of it.  Could have come shapened but still love it. gave it this rating because was satisfied<br />Thanks
B002RI9PKO|5.0|By a very clear writing and objective tone, Malcolm has persuaded me that there is a fine line between winners and losers in life. And the way we deal with every single matter in our daily life could put us inthis side of success or the other side.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|I'm not sure what these people are talking about it peeling off.  I've had mine on for six months and it's showing no signs of coming off any time soon.  I bring my laptop everywhere - work, school, traveling, I've put this thing through the ringer.  Well worth the money and if you put it on right (which isn't hard to do) I don't see how it could possibly peel off.
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought as a Christmas gift, so was very happy that it shipped so quickly and was packaged so well..
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome app for an awesome site. Easy to use with all the options available. Try it on your Kindle Fire.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I have tried a couple of different cases for my Kindle Fire, and the one thing I was always missing is the one thing this case does very well..it has a strap! The Marware Vibe case for the Kindle Fire HD features a standing option, which I have never used. It feels like a quality product, and features a strap  to keep the cover closed when you are not using it. This was important to me, and it does this very well.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|you shroud definitely get this app if you have Minecraft pocket edition. it is really cool you can add any item in your inventory. you can change from creative and survival! change the name of your map and much more! very satisfied.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|From the very first deeply resonant, and foreboding, note you know this is the best mastering thus far. The packaging beyond compare. At about $200 you might be wondering if this could be worth it with so many $0.99 cent (and even free) tracks. It is!<br /><br />Every element of this German made collection is beyond compare. Gold leaf of black sleeves, in heavy retaining card, the extra DVDs, and most importably, the lossless 24bit Blu Ray audio make this a very desirable collection. THen there are the other book sections including the guides, the libretti in German and English, and book on John Culshaw. No, at $200 this is quite a deal and you wont be disappointed. This is a heritage reference collection. My copy is #6262 out of 7000.  Purchase one of the 7000 copies before it is too late!
B00755646W|5.0|Madonna in Truth Or Dare. Great Image Better Sound. A great documentary about Madonna as you have never seen her before like in Truth Or Dare.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|ive always wanted this game to come to kindle and it did. great game with lots of<br />cool looking dragons i give 5stars
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I wanted to enjoy this game...and I might have if the resource download hadn't continued for more than 20 minutes. I have 5g WiFi in my house so the download reviews didn't concern me. Was I wrong! Boo on Alawar for this aspect.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I never liked this app on my smartphone, but really like it on the Kindle Fire HD.  Primary reason is the small screen on smart phone could never appreciate all this app can do.  Keeps track of current conditions as well as forcasts, and a lot of interesting features.
1609611543|5.0|I heard about this book at the gym and at work. It had great feedback so, Ithought I would check it out. I like to educate myself on different ways of  eating and how it effects our body.  I am amazed at the links they have made with wheat and health issues.  It all makes perfect sense, if you want to feel your best don't eat wheat.  It has definitely motivated me to make changes in our house. Our pantry is filled with less and less wheat products every week. We are all feeling much better just after a couple of weeks of  reducing our wheat intake.  I am reccomending this book to everyone that I know!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I love the app on the smart phone, hope it works as well on Kindle.  Only draw back I can see right now is the fact that with my phone I can include a picture with a particular note.  I suppose I can still do that only will have to import a picture from the Amazon Cloud first.  Looking forward to a lot of good use from this app.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|In the beginning I saw the Goonies and dismissed it as another kid flick.  This film has gotten better with age.  The story is a typical kids save the day looking for lost treasure.  The acting is good and the story is well presented, but it is the gimmicks and the eye candy which draw me into the tale.  Great directing and special effects.  Buy it for a laugh and keep it for the quality.  Funny, quirky and a little bit scarey, this one's a winner.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Saw this app on my Kindle Fire HD and I like to play solitaire. It helps me relax and unwind at night and helps kill time in Doctors office waiting room.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Remember, it isn't Shakespeare, it is an action movie, and very well done.  Brooklyn Decker is solid,  and the Friday night lights guys do a very good job....
B009FXIICK|5.0|I've played Zookeeper across many platforms and have quite enjoyed it. I'm not exacttly a fan, but its always a pleasant experience to pick up and play. Like always, its a cute animal Bejewled-like game.<br /><br />This particular app I find to be of great quality like all of the Zookeeper releases. The graphics are crisp and bold on my Nexus 7 tablet. The game controls are responsive and easy to understand. (And should you have trouble, there is a how to play guide in game) All I can say is that this is a very high quality app.<br /><br />If you want a game you can play quick or have a challenge with, pick this up. Fun for kids too!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|There is nothing like a good story about Santa. This movie will not only entertain the adults but will also keep the little adventurer in your life enthralled.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|I've been waiting some time for this disc -- excellant movie.  One of the directors best efforts on film. Empire of the Sun is one film to consider.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie is so wonderful. Quirky yet refined and excellently written. Everything you'd expect from Wes Anderson and the casts he compiles!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a must-read for those who really want the story of how the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden was carried out.  My initial concern upon hearing that the book had been written was to worry that our national security had been breached.  Not so.  The book takes this concern out in the introduction.  The title tells more about the story than it appears upon first reading it.  Mark Owen, a pseudonym for the author, is really telling the story of the Seals and how they train and what they do on a daily basis, thus, there really is no easy day for any of them.  Ironically, although the Bin Laden mission certainly was not an easy day, it was really no more difficult that the countless missions the Seals perform as a regular part of their job.  Because this one was high profile, it garners more attention and more movie sequels.  Nevertheless, this is a great book giving a day to day view of the missions the Seals accomplish and their preparation leading up to and the completion of the Bin Laden mission.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Yet again, a home run for Mr. Flynn. A real page turner. I hate to have to wait another year for the next one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Title says it all.  Still can't put this game down weeks later.  Always have to come back for one more prize
0375812024|5.0|How I love his books and have fond memories of reading them to my daughters.  As a teacher, I love that he includes the words for items pictured so children can learn to read and spell them.  His characters are always charming and of a great visual variety showing children that the world is made up of many &#34;people&#34; of a variety of descriptions.<br /><br />I liked this story because the family found a different activity when the weather spoiled the one they had planned.  This teaches creative thinking and that the airport can be an interesting place to visit.  As a child in the 1940's, airplane travel was a new thing.  We went to the airport as a family every time my dad flew in or out on company business just to see what happened.  People are too used to experiencing things second hand from watching TV or movies.  Being present can be exciting and inspiring!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The animation for this movie is gorgeous. And the storyline is utterly charming and touching. Great family movie, I highly recommend it! Pixar just keeps getting better and better.
1556438850|5.0|This is a great book containing all sorts of valuable information about traditional Sanskrit names of asanas, pranayamas, 8-limbs practice, and more. This is a staple book in my yoga studio for use by my teachers. If you are a true yoga teacher, you should have this on your shelf to review as needed. I have used the book as references for contradictions and sequencing. Highly recommended!
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is truly an excellent resource for up-to-the-minute worldwide news reportage.  For provision of thorough and detailed information this site cannot be topped.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|It is true the outer border is not the best. But the game itself is fantastic and we play it often at our friends house. I've gotten over the fact that it doesn't fit \\"perfectly\\" but what in life really does? I think some people need to look beyond the perfection and just enjoy the game. (this is true of many people's review of items here on Amazon)
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Unlike the game novelizations, which were somewhat childish reads, this book is a more adult take on the story of how the Master Chief came to be.  It's more about John, Spartan-117, than about Master Chief and is a very interesting look at his origins.
B001CZJKS0|5.0|Michael Myers is my favorite serial killer and I love watching the halloween movies. This set is a great gift for anyone that loves horror films.
1419705849|4.0|Great...Hardcover as it states..no rips at all! and comes totally brand new so dont worry if you think you will get a used one! Great book too
B004M5HUXE|2.0|I fail to comprehend why this book has become such a 'classic'. I've never done so much skimming and speed-reading in my life. Am I missing something?
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I enjoy Adele's music. I love how soulful she makes her music and it is always a delight to listen to.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Most of us will know someone like each and every character in this book. Great observation of archetypal English behaviour. It's what makes you keep on reading an otherwise unremarkable story.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I've enjoyed Train's music for years. While some of the songs have a slightly new sound, I still enjoyed them and I highly recommend this album.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I'm so glad this movie exists. It has a great message and emphasizes family in a heart-warming way. Thank you Disney for finally getting it right.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|great app for my 3 yr old daughter. very entertaining and challenging at a rate that doesnt overwhelm her. definitely recommend. better if u purchase full version. theres tons more puzzles.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I bought this product as a workaround to a hissy output jack on my Macbook Air, but compared to a straight 1/8\\" cable to a stereo (from a non-problematic computer), the E7 improves the sound nearly immeasurably.  Totally worth the money.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Disappointing book. Loved the first book. Second book was above average. The third was difficult to finish. Don't recommend it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling's ability to delve into her character's motivations for their actions is spot-on.  The class structure these characters adhere to it so true......this story could have been set anywhere, and the characters would act the same.  Great literature!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was so enjoyable. Very creative and interesting on. Many levels. Even quite funny in the authors mocking of society. Highly recommend this book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is fun for my 6 year old, 12 year old &amp; we parents!! The competitions get heated and can be never ending!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book. I am so glad Jaycee was able to tell her story. I know it really made me have a new outlook on my life.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As a WWII history enthusiast, a fire-arms enthusiast and as someone who enjoys US Military History, I would strongly recommend this series to anyone who shares any of the above interests.<br /><br />Think of it as Saving Private Ryan stretched into a 10 hour series.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|What will the economy be like in 20 years? How will we prepare our children to deal with it successfully?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen!! It is so amazing and addictive. Watch it.. you will love it.
B003AYPMBU|1.0|When I purchased this there were pictures of a woman holding a booklet with three CDs and two fold out sides. What I received in the mail was a DigiPack version only with the the dvd and studio cd. Not at all what I was expecting. Where is my third disc? Where is my booklet of pictures. What a huge disappointment. This is really nothing more than British Steel with an extra British Steel &#34;Live&#34; DVD.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! Similar to 50 shades of Grey. Lot's of exciting twists. Can't wait until the third book of the trilogy is available!
B004NS710C|4.0|The actors really make this movie great. Denzel is Awesome as the engineer of the train displaying the old wisdom of how things were done. The other actor who coincidentally is also the new Captain Kirk in Star Trek is the new hope for the railroad, and they say they don't type cast in Hollywood. Immediately you have two people that have a reason for conflict. The movie portrays how these two men can set their differences aside because of the circumstances and work together to avert a catastrophe. Kind of sounds like what the American people say congress needs to do to avert the Fiscal Cliff. The movie has drama, action, and a really fast train.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|if younlove star wars Disney bot star wars so now there making star wars 7 8 and 9 of star wars cool right. so annoy this game I rate it 55555555 stars!!!!!!!!!!

0307720748|3.0|If you are familiar with Richard Branson's story, you may know how one of his teachers famously said that he would either \\"be in jail or be a millionaire\\" by the age of 25. It has taken me a while to be able to articulate my thoughts towards this, but having recently read the rather excellent [[ASIN:B001FA0W5W Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]] by Nassim Talem I think I can now put my finger on it.  If you read this book you will learn a few things about how to treat employees well, how to build a consistent brand that retains its essence across wildly divergent industries, and how to live an exciting life. It just didn't live up to the really high expectations friends set for me.<br /><br />Branson is undoubtedly a talented entrepreneur, and one can't help but admire how he has dedicated the latter part of his life to social issues. One thing I love about him is his naivety when it comes to doing good. As the saying goes, when you don't know something is impossible it all of the sudden becomes a lot less daunting and achievable. I think he has, or in the process of proving many \\"experts\\" wrong when it comes to things as far ranging as saving endangered species and creating a commercial space tourism company (which in the long-term, along with Space X, will do much to benefit human kind).<br /><br />Despite this, there are several points in Branson's story where I can't help but think that if one of the many possible alternatives were to have taken place, he would have been wiped out in a manner that would have been difficult to recover from. Whether in reference to his ballooning adventures, or how some Virgin companies were saddled with very heavy debt, one can't help but wonder how much his success (and current good health) are owed to luck. If there were 100 alternative versions of reality, Branson may very well have ended up in jail or broke in dozens of them. However, knowing him he would probably be okay with that.<br /><br />If you are a fan of business biographies, two others I preferred are Peak by Chip Conley, and Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. If you want to learn about entrepreneurship, The Lean Startup by Eric Ries is one of the best books out there on the subject./><br />If you are a fan of business biographies, two others I preferred are Peak by Chip Conley, and Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.

B003QF8E4A|5.0|One of my favorites movies.  I love suspense movies and this one keeps you guessing right to the end. You will love it too.
0307720950|4.0|The maker movement is something I had heard of, but was generally unfamiliar with. The extent of my knowledge about this before reading the book was watching a couple videos of 3D printing, and knowing of advances in robot technology to enable the move towards mass bespoke at companies like Tesla Motors (sidenote: Elon Musk really is the man, If you don't know who he is go Google him immediately!)<br /><br />Learning more about rapid prototyping tools, and how people have taken advantage of them was enlightening. The analogy of \\"the long tail of things\\" (i.e. atoms) following  in the footsteps of the long tail of digital goods (i.e. bits) was a very interesting way of examining the rising maker movement. To use a personal example, it certainly left me feeling there is no excuse for me to not try to get a prototype made for an idea I have for a new kind of iPhone case (the innovation I have in mind is more practical than aesthetic). This book has given me a clear path as to how I could go about doing so even with my limited savings.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have is that at times the book felt rushed/redundant. What a CNC machine is and how it works was repeated at least three times. While this may have been on purpose I imagine it is something that will be fixed in future editions. Kind of funny to have such a \\"macro level\\" error to be in a book written by the former editor of a magazine esteemed as Wired is.
B00005TQKQ|2.0|I have an older Sony camcorder that has a snowy picture issue. I figured I tried this first before looking to get it repaired, however, this head cleaner didn't help.  Don't know if it's the head cleaner itself or the camcorder needs professional service.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This album is good but i didn't like all of the tracks. My Favorites:<br /><br />Rolling In the Deep<br />Rumor Has It<br />Turning Tables<br />Set Fire to the Rain<br />Someone Like You
B009YX02T8|3.0|I thought this was a great soundtrack but there were not as many songs that I enjoyed on this particular soundtrack, compared with the other films. That is purely personal opinion. Sound quality is great and I love how they always select little-known or up-and-coming artists for their music selection. They always do a great job with their music!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|My wife and I were reading together (she on paper, me on Kindle) and discussing it ail along.We discussed it 3 times after both finished.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The movies is so remarkable…the graphics…the costumes…the makeup….all is so amazingly done. My hat off to the Director...Amazing movie and I would see all again
B0071XO8RA|5.0|fabulous! One of the best Sci-fi stories in a long time! I loved how his characters react and evolve in this environment
B000N2HBSO|5.0|DKG is a terrific writer. The book moves swiftly, is exciting, is insightful. She brings these men of history to life!
1554072840|2.0|To be fair, my 2 1/2 year old is currently obsessed with this book. If rating was based on her requests to read, it would be a 5-star. However, I don't love the illustrations and I find the book awkwardly phrased (text like &#34;and I, Prudence's mother, kept changing her&#34; doesn't roll off my tongue). I read to my children A LOT and I never rephrase as heavily as I do for this book. In short, I dislike reading this book and I think that potty books require enthusiasm from child and parent to work well. I'd suggest &#34;Potty&#34; by Leslie Patricelli instead. It does a better job communicating with concrete pictures and it feels more modern.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|I would first like to say that I really like Marware.  I had a Marware case for my original KF & am passing it down to my nephew knowing that it can take a beating.  I will also be buying a Marware case[[ASIN:B005KDYAEY Marware Eco-Vue Genuine Leather Case Cover for Kindle Fire, Pink]] for my niece for her 2nd gen KF.  However as far as the Marware Vibe for KF HD I'm sending it back.  The case is slim, looks great & I really like the sleep feature.  The Marware Vibe includes a strap that keeps it closed & open when you're reading.  It has a nice softer interior & even though it doesn't have the handstrap that I've come to appreciate on the previously mentioned case for the KF its soft interior makes it easy to grip.  Now for the bad....I can't believe Marware would make a case that must be left open in order to charge your Kindle Fire HD OR you have to turn the KFHD around to have the ports out & therefore losing the sleep feature.  I think I saw someone here mention they got it to work but I tried over & over & had no such luck.  Finally after repeated tries I was never able to get the stand to work unless I propped it against something.  To me those negatives are a deal breaker & unfortunately mine is going back today.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I think Star Wars Angry Birds was a very fun twist to the original Angry Birds game. I actually like it better than the original! The levels are better with the Star Wars birds than the regular ones.
B005FISC52|4.0|As One Tree Hill comes to it's final chapter I must say that I was pleased with how it ended.  I really enjoyed the glimpse into the future that was shown. I will miss One Tree Hill.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is a classic movie, although for some it differs as to whether or not it's a classic Christmas movie or a Classic halloween movie! Fun for young kids, but also for adults. Probably 4-5 and up is a safe bet, as there is a little thematic scariness with halloween creatures.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|there wasn't a learning curve with this app! just download and that is it! glad i found the right one the first time!

B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie is great for all ages. My 3 year old LOVES it as do we! The music is fun but not overpowering the movie. The whole thing is colorful and bright. A Must see.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|Not his best film (I think that honor goes to Edward Scissorhands or Nightmare Before Christmas), but a wonderfully told rendition of this classic tale in his trademark gothic style. Johnny Depp brings an interesting interpretation to Ichabod Crane, and I think all the actors really had fun with it. Christopher Walken is great! As for the quality of the streaming video, the picture was clear and I experienced no problems.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you like Lee Child's Jack Reacher series then you'll understand the need to read.  It's possible that there are characters such as Reacher roaming the country ... individuals who become nomads because they experienced too much too soon.<br />Great read, keep Jack alive Mr. Child!

B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I had an afternoon to kill and saw that this was playing at our local indie theater.  I didn't really know what to expect but it sounded interesting enough.  Wow! Interesting doesn't begin to cover it.  I was mesmerized, stunned, transported, fascinated, hypnotized, spellbound, enchanted, bedazzled - in summary, totally blown away!  A bona fide phantasmagoria. To make it even more bizarre and surreal, I was the only person in the entire theater.  It made me feel that I was alone in my own spaceship which had traveled to unimaginable worlds, reality suspended.  I did not want the trip to end but when it did I floated out of the theater.  I have just ordered the Blue-ray and will be an evangelist for this film.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The first one or two chapters from some online reading captivated me, so I bought this book to read. I finished it only because I spent 10 bucks on it. I really regret having bought it and finished it. One star for getting me to buy it.
6305252572|5.0|The parts were written for Nolte and Murphy. Too bad Murphy didn't keep doing these roles instead of the dumb comedies. The action was good and Nolte was excellent as SF cop Jack Cates.
B000021Y77|5.0|A well done ground hog day type movie. A very well done movie, that keeps up the interest all the way through.
0451213092|2.0|The history is interesting, but the book is long on details, a lot of them not important. If you looking for a thriller or action kind of book, this isn't it.
B0007TKH66|5.0|This is a great show. Very charactor driven, and it's a lot more like the origional. Scott Bakula is great as Captain Archer. Much better show than the other spin off shows.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Funny, good family fun, the little brothers were hysterical. Why do i have to put so many words to  rate a movie?
B00005ASHM|3.0|I listen to a lot of music. Music of all kinds and I've talked about it a lot in hopes of finding newer music or missed music.<br />I've been referred to &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; a couple of times before I purchased it, but to me there are only two good songs on it,<br />&#34;Wouldn't it be Nice&#34; and &#34;God only Knows&#34; I read that &#34;Good Vibrations&#34; was recorded during this period but released as a single later. To me it should have been included on this album because had it been included it would have made it worth getting the entire album. As it is now I would rather buy these songs on a greatest hits collection rather than buy &#34;Pet Sounds.&#34; &#34;Pets Sounds&#34; is a failed concept album. Unless you are a hardcore fan of Brian Wilson and want to know his deepest feelings about love and relationships, you would be better off buying a greatest hits collection instead. Don't get me wrong the songs that I named before are amazing and beautiful music, ahead of their time, but the other stuff I just couldn't get into.
0547884591|5.0|I've not yet read the whole of The 4 Hour Chef, but, from what I can tell, it is Tim's broadest book - in that it addresses the most integral life experience of the three books Tim has written so far; certainly globally, where work and fitness - the topics of the two other books - are not as vaunted as food. The common theme the books share is the practice of 'life hacking.' That is, set ways of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the methods we use to create desired results in our lives. More money, bigger muscles, longer - or simply perceptible - orgasms, achieved by: creating an economic muse; single set, 5/5 cadence, compound lifts to failure; and 2 sheets of paper worth of pressure applied to the upper left  quadrant of the clitoris in a come hither motion for 15 minutes, respectively.<br /><br />The virtue of the books is that by precisely replicating the methods Tim details, similar results can be produced. The 4-Hour Chef is particularly suited to this type of self improvement because a food recipe is exactly that - a series of inputs that produces desired results when replicated. In that way, it is perhaps the best vehicle for Tim's message, which is that it is possible to dramatically alter your life by making a few small but precise changes.<br /><br />I haven't followed any of Tim's recipes - metaphorically speaking - from past books exactly enough to know whether they are true life hacks, but I do think that the methods he presents are simpler and consequently more effective than other self help books - of which I have only read half of Tony Robbin's 'Ultimate Power,' which was good, but is convoluted through obtuse new age practices and vagueness about exact practical action; that is, Ultimate Power is more theory than practice, whereas Tim Ferriss' books are mostly about practice.<br /><br />There is a fear that arises with life hacking, which is that books like 4-Hour Workweek/Body/Chef serve as strategy guides for the videogame that is life. Things are no longer practiced for themselves, but sequences of inputs are performed to create desired outputs. If this is the case, and if the books actually function in this way - even if only for Tim himself - we worry that life might lose it's meaning.<br /><br />Yet, these books, because of the categories chosen, are designed to give meaning to life. Even when we can hack life, and direct our living action in accordance with rules prescribed in a self help book, we are given access to some of the most basic elements of meaning and happiness: diet and exercise (the 4-Hour Workweek serving primarily to give us time to focus on these two things.) Once we learn to follow the methods of efficient action contained in the 4-Hour book series, we then are more equipped to engage in meaningful action for its own sake - a phrase which is redundant - like hosting dinner parties, or swimming at the beach.<br /><br />[This review is intended to serve as standalone insight and artistic analysis of the work critiqued, and is not a suitable resource off of which to base a decision to purchase 'The 4-Hour Chef; however, the book is wonderful: expansive, entertaining, and informative, and you should buy it. Also, it's only $4.99 on Kindle.]
0316019984|5.0|This book, and the others by Matthew Reinhart, are incredible!  They are insanely detailed and planned out.  Each page has a large and very elaborate pop-up as the main focus of the page, and then 4 more small pop-ups on each corner.  The smaller ones are just as creative and intricate.<br /><br />Cheaper pop-up books can fold in wrong when trying to close them, but these close just right every time!  They are so complicated in design that I am afraid that when I go to close it that it will bend or crease wrong, but it closes smoothly and correctly.<br /><br />I bought 5 of his books for Christmas present and read them all ahead of time.  You can tell right when you open them that someone put a ton of love and pride into the planning and production of these books.  Highly recommend these!

B000069KGM|5.0|Hands down, the best opening track on any of Chicago release ever, Introduction. I love the improvisatory nature of the whole album and feel it evokes. Cmon, not even Pink Floyd or Hendrix, made it as way out as Terry Kath does on a long exploratory Free Form Guitar track. Other standouts are Robert Lamm's Southern California Purples, their incendiary cover of the Spencer Davis Group's rave up I'm A Man, \\"Someday\\" is another incredible track, starting with da mob chanting \\"The whole world is watching...the whole world is watching\\" Two of Chicago's early classics Beginnings and Does Anybody Know What Time It Is, both penned by Lamm are included on this in all their unedited glory. I love the Duke Ellington-esque piano intro preceding Does Anybody Know What Time It Is and Beginnings has a cool drum/percussion breakdown by Danny Seraphine that is just incredible. You'd be doing yourself an injustice not checking out the LP versions of these two popular early CTA hits (they're much better than the edited versions heard on 'classic rock' format FM radio. Chicago Transit Authority is the only Chicago album listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, so, the clock's tickin KneeGrow! Go buy it now!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show and I was happy I could access it online to catch up on the episodes I had missed.  It ran smoothly and I didn't have any issues.

B000AARKOO|3.0|I always wanted to see Ridley Scott's \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (2005), but it took me this long to finally view it. It's not as good as contemporaneous sword & sandal flicks like \\"[[ASIN:B002O3Z50Q Troy]]\\" (one of my personal favorites) and \\"[[ASIN:B0002YLCG0 King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)]]\\" (very good), but it's not bad either.<br /><br />THE PLOT: After the death of his child and suicide of his wife, Balian (Orlando Bloom) meets his long, lost father (Liam Neeson) who encourages him to go to Jerusalem and start a new life. After a long eventful trip, Balian arrives in Jerusalem and is introduced to Princess Sibylla (Eva Green), the leprous King Baldwin and other VIPs. The political maneuverings of these key personnel is mindboggling but, when all is said and done, Balian must rise to the challenge of defending the city against Saladin and his great Muslim army.<br /><br />Like \\"[[ASIN:B00006ADD5 Lawrence of Arabia (Single-Disc Edition)]],\\" \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a film that can be enjoyed just for the visuals and soundtrack. The film was shot in Morocco where a vast replica of ancient Jerusalem was built in the desert with the backgrounds enhanced by CGI effects, and so on.<br /><br />Story-wise, the beginning and ending are strong while the convoluted soap operatics of Jerusalem aren't very compelling, but Eva Green's awesome eyes help.<br /><br />I'm no connoisseur of the crusades but I realize the filmmakers put a modern swing on the events and ideology of the characters. So what else is new? In any case, I was impressed that all the main players are based on real-life people and that the gist of the events is accurate.<br /><br />The Theatrical Cut runs 144 minutes and the Director's Cut about 48 minutes longer. The DC is heralded as one of the best DCs ever released, like \\"[[ASIN:B0002XVQNU Daredevil (Director's Cut)]].\\"<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is worth it just for the magnificent visuals and soundtrack. The story starts strong and ends strong while the dramatics of the lengthy mid-section are complicated and not very compelling, but Orlando Bloom is likable as the protagonist.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B-strong and ends strong while the dramatics of the lengthy mid-section are complicated and not very compelling, but Orlando Bloom is likable as the protagonist.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B-
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very good book! Recommend to anyone interested! I was recommended the book and felt it was right on and very beneficial for my relationship.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|This book may be good for high school or college course with a study guide involved.  I was bored and got tired of looking up 19th century vocabulary.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham hit it out of the park again. I read it on a trip across the country and didn't want to put it down. This is a fantastic book.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I really liked how this book was told from multiple viewpoints, I wish Ms. Condie had done that with Matched as well. I really liked the foreshadowing, while a book should be more &#34;show&#34; than &#34;tell&#34; it was nice to have an inkling of what Reached would be about. I do hope we get to find out what becomes of Eli; I found myself caring about him quite a bit.
0345803507|5.0|This was the third book in the series and it was as good as the first book! I am looking forward to reading more from this author in the future!
0345803493|5.0|I love this author! I have read book three as well and it is great! I would suggest, Bared To You by Sylvia Day, if you liked this trilogy.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Loved entire double cd. Most of the music is original and the few tunes that were not his original music was excellent.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very fun game,<br />great story with just enough ho and puzzles. Ready for part two, gotta finish what I started.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie! We had rented it and my 9 yr old daughter and 3 yr old son just loved it.  It was also funny to me and my husband (both in our early 30s), so it wasn't a chore to sit through.  Very funny and has a sweet ending (if not predictable)  :-)  Would recommend it to ppl of all ages
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A fun if not unlikely journey with lots of twists and turns.  I am always amazed at Grisham's knowledge and storytelling ability.  If you have enjoyed any of his work, you will like this.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Too much possessive crap. She folds like a napkin ALL THE TIME. Neither of them have an identity of their own. It seems like the author really rushed through this one. I was hoping it would be better than the first, but it only got worse.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My children love this movie and so do I.  Great message about it is okay to be yourself and to be careful what you wish for!  I love that we can watch in on our Kindle, the Play Station or our Roku since it is in our cloud storage.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I could play this game for hours on my nintendo ds, and it appears nothing has changed.  The music is just right, the animals are easy on the eyes, and the gameplay is prefect for sliding fingers.<br /><br />I have never played bejeweled, but that is what everyone compares this to(I always thought more like tetris attack).  Slide animals to form chains of at least 3 trying to meet some quota for each.  If you are missing one animals quota, that animal starts looking  unhappy. Press the binoculars (a very limited resource) to highlight a chain if you are stuck. And it all controls so smooth.<br /><br />As I write this review, this is the free app of the day, but you should get this even if it isn't anymore...unless you just hate perpetual puzzle games of awesomness.
B000I3PERS|5.0|Great movie. A Must see! Mel Gibson did it again. War at it's finest mixed with a love story. Amazing!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|constant restarts loss of data or constant up grades of more data makes this game very aggravating if you want to play this game good luck but I would recommend. something else that doesn't make you feel like you just wasted months of your time for nothing
B001250SAY|5.0|Amazing story of dignity and the human will to survive. Very dark, Very well written. Steinbeck tells a gripping story.
1451695195|4.0|I was spellbound by the account of Dr. Alexander's complete and truly miraculous recovery from what is almost always a fatal condition. If that had been the main thrust of the book, I would have given it five stars. However, as the title indicates, the book aims to provide proof of heaven. I believe that Dr. Alexander was conscious during his week-long coma in a way that cannot be explained by science. Whether his soul was in his body while this happened in not clear as he does not mention seeing his body from above, which is unlike most out-of-body and many near-death experiences. The experiences he does relate somehow reminded me of the \\"Never Ending Story\\" and the \\"Core\\" made me think of \\"Star Wars\\". To him, it was more real than real, but to me, it was a fantasy more than a believable afterlife scenario. Knowledge seems too easily available; once you know the answers to all the secrets of the universe, then what? I am reminded of a joke: \\"Eternity gets really boring, especially near the end.\\"<br />I do not expect my afterlife to resemble Dr. Alexander's description and look forward to a more conventional encounter with God and loved ones that will be either mainly joyous or painful depending on how I lead the rest of my life.<br />The quality of the writing left quite a bit to be desired, but the fact of Dr. Alexander's miraculous recovery and the extraordinary support provided by his family, friends and clergy was truly inspiring and made this book worth reading for me and many others.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|Fresh, original, sexy, dorky, innocent, deep, cascading sounds, tecchno thrills, R&B with sweet sprinkles on top - A very groovy chick!
1455519006|5.0|INCREDIBLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!<br /><br />Baldacci at his absolute best. His key character is quite the loner (what assassin isn't?). And the plot flies along as the protagonist crawls of his shell.<br /><br />One of the best stories I've read.<br /><br />You can see each scene. The author masterfully puts you right into the action, the dialogues, all of the experiences you'll encounter page by page.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed by a single minute you spending turning the pages of The Innocent.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Perhaps the best done installment of the Marvel franchise since \\"X2: United\\"! I expected a throwaway action movie, but was very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Give 'er a spin.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|A must-must read book for a new way of thinking...or at least understanding the most important things in our life
B001AQO3WY|5.0|if you can get past the &#34;F&#34; bombs, and really, what do you expect from war movies, this series is great.  Rudy's  contributions helped to keep this historically accurate, and didn't gloss over the horrors of war that the Iraq people experienced.  It focused on the recon battalion and I enjoyed that.
B002361MLA|4.0|I read only once, but still go to his other book &#34;A New World&#34;  and read that one more often
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out for years, from weights, to running, to structured classes at the gyms and began working out at home over a year ago, to save time and money.  These workouts are 20 minutes long, making it an easy commitment, and if you are honestly working as hard as Jillian is telling you to, and following a sensible calorie controlled diet, these workouts are effective. The three levels of workouts, and 3 2 1 sequence of strength, cardio and abs keep the workout interesting and makes the time fly, I'm done before I know it.  The moves are challenging but there are opportunities to do the modified versions of many of the moves, if a person would need to.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Can't say enough about my love for these books. No better way to spend an evening at home.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Great movie with plenty of twists. One of the best I've seen this year. Lots of action and suspense with a couple of gratuitous nude scenes thrown in as icing on the cake.
B00006EXDM|1.0|play in my home cd player. Research as shown this is due to poor cd quality due to the poor reflective quality of the cd. No more purchases for me from this vendor which is megahit records. RP
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham keeps you on the edge of your seat on this one.  So many twists and turns, it keeps you interested to the very end.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|This movie delivered exactly what I expected from a zombie flick! This film fills in blanks where WWZ the book left off.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I am happy that this book is among those selected for middle school/high school students. Will read other London books
B0036OP0QQ|5.0|I bought as a gift but couldn't resist opening and listening to it myself. I love Whitney Houston, best ever.
0071752854|5.0|I will be reading this book over another 2 times, as the concept is &#34;novel&#34; and very persuasive.  The human mind is somewhat overrated, when considering the source of our decisions and actions.  I feel I have the mental edge, understanding the psychology of the human thought process and have already become an alert observer of others' frame stacking, status building habits.  I realize, the words that flow from my mouth are simply habits I've learned, that are no longer useful and efficient, in fact, they can be down-right damaging.  We definitely train others for how we are willing to be experienced.  I am innately a maximizer and have been looking for this book for a long time !  Thank you Oren Klaff.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Received today in good condition and on time actually a few days early. I missed season one so know I can go back and see how it all started
B004BLTNM0|5.0|I am a huge fan of horror flicks and liked this movie. Packaged arrived on time and in good condition. Warning this is not a movie for kids of any age and even some adults, there is a rape scene in this film and it is very brutal that is why it was band years ago.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this was a epic game  for bronies all around the graphics were Ok and the story is just great and its free so what do u got to loose
B0041KKYCY|5.0|Doesn't come close to the original but it was a very good remake. Very pleased with this purchase arrived on time and in good condition
B00127RAJY|5.0|Out of all the workout DVD's I've ever purchased, this is the one I always go back to.  20 minute workouts, a no-nonsense trainer (\\"There is no modification for this move...I've got 300 pound people doing jumping jacks, so can you!) If you're going to buy a workout DVD, this is definitely one to consider!
1451620829|2.0|None of this matters, of course. Whether or not the book or the man is likeable is completely irrelevant. Maybe that's why it's fun, in a deliberately nitpicky way, to discuss the musicians themselves with fellow Kiss fans. But really...all of the \\"his fault, their fault, my fault,\\" finger-pointing and mudslinging don't matter the slightest bit, compared with what we still have, what keeps us coming back, and what will outlive childish diatribes like Criscola's book, egotistical exercises like Gene's, goofy \\"reality\\" shows or ridiculous cruises: the music.<br /><br />Peter's view of his own history in music is much like the capitalizing of every letter in Kiss's name: after-the-fact and revisionist.<br /><br />They didn't originally intend that the band name be an acronym suggesting their embracing of the lowest common denominator, and this once-great drummer would have told a completely different story if the former two autobiographies hadn't come out. By the same token, he would have told a different story in 1979. Wait...he did. (Read Behind the Mask. It's fun.)<br /><br />The music is all that matters. Reading about the personalities behind it might offer some brief, separate entertainment of its own, but the music doesn't care, nor do your ears, once that music's playing.<br /><br />I suggest not letting this sort of non-musical interruption threaten the flow from the music to your ears to your brain. Think of how much the individual personalities and private lives of the music-makers get confused with the music itself these days. That music is the only reason anyone cared in the first place. We still have the rock and roll that's captivated us from early on. The chords can't be changed, and the melodies can't be dented. The music survives anything that comes in afterward, because it's still purely what it is.<br /><br />To be disappointed with the words and actions of an immature guy who has a hard time seeing outside his drug-informed bubble is to turn your attention too often toward what doesn't matter. Yes, it's funny, but to truly care who played on what, or how anyone behaved off the stage, is to hinder your own reception of the music.<br /><br />Ego has to be separated from the art itself. That's especially true in this era, when celebrity has outweighed artistic merit to such a ludicrous extent. What went on behind the scenes doesn't matter to the finished product, or how you feel when you hear it. When considerations about the humans behind the music change your perspective, you're allowing too much to impose upon your listening experience.<br /><br />All of the B.S. flies out the window when you have one of your favorite albums on, and it takes you again to that fantastic place where you love to be.<br /><br />And the music will continue to make you feel good, if you allow it to exist as music, and not some byproduct of backstage soap operas. I can read something like this book, crack up, toss it into the trash and then push \\"play\\" on the Hotter Than Hell album, the Love Gun album or Creatures, and enjoy that amazing experience just as much as I did before I even knew the book existed. Or Ace's, for that matter. Or Gene's.<br /><br />Music was the least significant focus of the author. This seems to be the popular approach, and the reason I seldom buy books about bands. The music commonly takes a back seat, even though it's the whole reason the authors/subjects even exist in the public eye.<br /><br />But this book doesn't matter, and that's the nicest thing I can say about it. Thanks for inspiring me to be a drummer, Peter. You were astonishing, and your creative choices during the '70s were superb and full of groove. But your work here is done.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I watched this movie as a pick me up for my girlfriend who just had a bad breakup.  It worked quite well.  It had a surprisingly good storyline and the acting was above what I expected.  It was so good that when it completely failed on the ending it was a huge let down.  So overall, I'd say watch it, but just don't expect a good ending and you'll be well entertained.
B0015AARJI|2.0|The battery dies too soon, and even after leaving it charge, its light flickers and prompts to be re-recharged. The buttons were unresponsive. Maybe it's a manufacturing defect, but I've accepted it now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app just the biggest problem that bugs me most is the fact that I downloaded a minecraft app for the first time on 4shared but after that I did iron the amazon app. so now it is all glitchy and I hate it NEVER DO 4SHARED.COM AGAIN!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My son LOVES to listen to the songs from his favorite TV show! I have to make him turn it off at night!
B007WOFXAO|5.0|...this package is worth it.  Sure, I'd love to have their other two Warner Bros. albums (Hideaway and Harbor) in this box, and if you enjoy the sort of liner notes that usually come with box sets, you might be disappointed by the no-frills set-up here.  But, again, if it's just the music you care about, it's great to have five stellar albums all in one well-priced box.  Starts strong (the debut album and Homecoming) and ends with their greatest album (Hearts).  Get it, now!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Enjoyed the movie, but did not have the quality of writing I have come to expect from Pixar.  The cheezy celtic pop songs did not help.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Ok so I was a little worried after reading some of these reviews.  After listening to the entire set I can say my set sounds excellent.  No pops or crackles or anything.  I was getting a light fuzz sound on Abbey Road so I cleaned it and now it sounds as quiet as a mouse.  No warped disc nothing to really complain about.  The book is gorgeous.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen is a better replication of the sleeves.  Other than that the set is awesome. Happy listening!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the game.  The harder levels are definitely good.  Some of the maps are predictable, but there are a few that are challenging and make you think.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|I received this in the mail today.  It is not the US Version, but appears to be a UK version.  Packaging is not as shown (appears to be cheaper).  Discs have not titles on them, only printed information is in Spanish, and they have really large, ugly European censor tags all over the packages and the discs.  Returning ASAP and will buy this from Best Buy or somebody else instead.  Especially considering that other vendors are matching the price.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|The story it ain't better than the one in the first movie but has a lot of fighting scenes and some nudity from the female characters.<br /><br />The animation is not the best and the character design is kind of disappointing at times, i'm not saying is a bad movie but that i could have been way better than the end result.
B00000JNNY|5.0|I enjoy the cd very much.  There are days when her distinct voice sooths the soul!  If you are a fan, I highly recommend this one!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The top of the case cracked and it was only from removing the case two times from the phone to allow my car charger to fit in the bottom.  Emailed the company to try and get another case and they never responded back.  Case is a neat idea but it sucks

0061438294|3.0|Here is yet another book about body language. It is well-written and organized, but very little (if any) new information that is not already available elsewhere is included.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The most addicting thing closest to crack!!! Cant get enough of Pinterest! So many different categories for all to enjoy
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Great music with meaningful choice of words.  Very appealing to the ear and soothes mind and soul for new beginning in Love
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book<br />Cant wait to read,the next one in the series. Couldn't put it down. And i usually don't read these kink of books
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book was recommended to me by several others, and I finally got around to reading it.  The light hearted  reflection of a dog in a human world - evolves into a retrospective that is such an unusual perspective that it really works to display the loyalty and feelings of true friends as they watch with little ability to assist in the tragedies that befall most lives.  It does create a testimony to the value of friendship and loyalty.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|An old fashion family classic that we watch every Christmas.  A timeless treasure!  EVERYONE WILL ENJOY IT!<br />Share with friends & relatives,
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Good plot line, and great actors for this type of movie.  Charlize Theron is a great actress in any movie
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|I am really looking forward to the rest of this series!<br /><br />Very seldom are series written with such depth. The cliche sex, drugs, and rock and roll are played out constantly. But it is done with taste and thought through.<br /><br />Seldom do shows offer so much to keep you intrigued throughout a season.<br /><br />I would put this up with The Wire and The Sopranos as a series which shows you the insides of an underworld in an intriguing manner.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Kept  me reading I could not put it down .Sad that it is over.Try it you will like it. 5 stars
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Is it the requirement of a rear facing camera? It's not an essential part of the app. I can do everything just fine without needing to take pictures or scan barcodes. I do those with my phone. I had to sideload it on my Nexus 7 and it works fine. Please lift this ridiculous restriction.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the graghics.  I could do without the ads, but at least they are easy to x out of....
B005Q1W10A|1.0|One of the discs was defective and skipped a whole section of the disc. The other 2 discs were fine. Came in the mail and I threw the envelope out so not sure how to return it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|You ever read a book and it takes you to places you never knew existed.  This book not only does that but it also makes you think about if any of it could actually happen.  This book is better than hunger games, and harry potter.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great graphics, challenging and addictive. I would recommend this to everyone, Keep the birds coming! How about angry birds and the lost ark?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is a wonderful writer and he brings his characters to life.  I will be going back to reread this one after the holidays!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|once again Blake has done a great job!  very cool read keeps you Pulled in the whole time,<br />as all his books have done I can't put it down till i'm done now I just have to wait for him to come out with more.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|can't wait for the next book!  Write faster!  I'll watch the TV show since it fairly accurate to the books.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|This is NOT Iron Maiden. That is what should be on your mind when you pop this cd into your stereo. The problem is, is that people cannot seperate the name steve harris from Iron Maiden. So, if steve harris plays on anything and anything at all, people will compare it to powerslave and number of the beast. That's not fair. Even Maiden cannot top those classic records. So how in the heck is steve harris supposed to top the 80s Maiden records with a solo debut? British Lion is not really metal but instead a solid hard rock record plain and simple. The vocals could be stronger, but then again this bloke ain't Bruce Dicksinson, Paul Di Anno or even Blake Bayley for that matter. If this lineup stays together I think steve harris' band will improve just like Bruce's solo records got better. Give this british lion group a couple of records to find their sound and mature as a band and they will improve. British Lion rerquires allot of listens to fully absorb, but if you can listen to this without comparing it to powerslave its really a good rock album.
B001NLKT60|4.0|The beginning was a jumble of confusion, but worth the time.  I did enjoy it though.  Not as good as the first.
0307749606|2.0|I look forward to Jack Reacher books.  This audio book was both boring and needlessly convoluted.  It did not help that I read that Lee Child sold the screen rights to one of the best Jack Reacher books to Tiny Tom Cruise who will be playing Jack Reacher.  Oh yes Jack Reacher is 6'5&#34; and 200 plus pounds.  TTC is 5'7&#34; and weights 130 pounds.  This is one movie I will never watch even when it is free.  What a travesty.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The only thing missing from the book was more about Lisbeth's sister.  Unfortunate that the author passed away.  A fourth installment may have included her in it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Mitch Rapp and this is a great one.  Vince Flynn did not disappoint in this novel.  It was both exciting and satisfying.  I look forward to the next one.  Vince Flynn does not just write books just to satisfy his publisher on a timetable like other writers who will remain nameless.
B000W4SE6G|5.0|people are always skeptical until they see it.  it's one of those &#34;Jaws&#34;-type movies that you can watch whenever.  this is a must see film.
B002SRQ214|4.0|I'm a huge gamer and my favorite game of all time is Planetside. Sadle Planetside 2 requires a quad core to play in large battles. I bought this CPU to upgrade my Dell Inspiron 570 with AMD Athlon x2. The CPU replacement was a breeze, but Dell are bastards in that they have to make everything as hard as possible when upgrading their PCs: the AMD A3 socket heat sink that came with the CPU doesn't fit. This is not AMD's fault, it's Dells. The 965 Black Edition works great in my i570, but the heat sink from the original Athlon x2 cools 95w, and the Phenom x4 BE requires 125w. This means that the CPU temp reaches up to 81 Degrees Celsius (way too hot!). Weirdly, Dells i570 requires heat sinks that fit a Intel 775/1155 pattern socket. This can be hard to find in 125w. From searching on dell's forums, I've been recommended the Thermaltake CL-P0326 Intel 775 CPU Cooler. This meets all the requirements, but only time will tell if it works since Dell hates people messing with their computers and does everything possible to make upgrading hell.<br /><br />PS> Planetside 2 works awesome with the new chip. The super huge battles with hundreds of people will cause a drop of 20FPS CPU bound, which is way better than the 3FPS I was getting before.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Watched \\"The Expendables\\" when released and not impressed but watchable, so rented this in hopes of non-stop action. Nope. Have now tried 3 times to watch it and always turn it off or fall asleep. \\"Contrived\\" comes to mind, too contrived. With cast of characters should just have been better. Had its moments but overall a waste of my time and money. Target audience? I not sure. Date movie? Nope. Under 30 males?? Cast just too old. And did I mention the dialogue?? Terrible. Not recommended.
B0091LRZZW|1.0|The title of my review says it all...from a steadfast Beatles fan.<br />It worked for Rod Stewart but unfortunately it's not working for Paul here.<br />Sorry, but Paul has lost his voice and can't even stay on key...<br />I'll keep my memories of him with the Beatles & Wings thank you.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I've been waiting years for Rod to do an Xmas album and this year he pulled a beauty out of his multi-talented hat. Reminiscent of his American Songbook series in orchestra arrangements, and soulfully sung. My co-workers love it too, and ask me to bring it in often.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I love Jason Mraz songs and bought this not knowing all the songs that were on it.  It is now one of my favorite CDs.  Love it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I thought this was very well written, although obviously totally fake.  Great movie.  Great cinematography.  Great acting!  I would definitely recommend!
0140439129|5.0|Dry as dust, difficult to read and, in places, tedious in the extreme - but I expected nothing less from what is essentially a scientific paper from the Victorian era. That said; it is also thoroughly enlightening, and essential reading for anyone who wants a true understanding of what 'Darwinism' is.<br /><br />Getting to grips with this work allows you to appreciate how Darwin's theories have been built-upon, revised, improved, misquoted, misinterpreted, misrepresentated and even hi-jacked over the past century-and-a-half.<br /><br />As a layman I opened this book for the first time many years ago expecting more monkeys and less birds and barnacles, only later did I realise that Darwin covered that topic thoroughly in his one of his other great works; 'The Descent of Man.'
B007IXWKUK|3.0|To much of the same as the first book.  I couldn't finish this book, where the first book I couldn't put down.
0316228532|5.0|Even though this book is way too different from Harry Potter, J. K. Rowling is still an amazing writer. You should totally read it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|not bad in comparison to any other time waster.  several interfaceflaws though.  no need fortwenty word minimum to post<br /> ggggg
B002VPE1XE|2.0|I got this camera bag for free with the Canon SX260 during their Black Friday deal.  I can't complain too much, as it was free.  It seems to be decently constructed, but there are two main issues I have with this case:<br />1.  It is entirely too big for the SX260 (which is larger than any of the other point and shoots I've owned).  The camera actually rattles around in the case.  There is extra space around the entire camera (sides/top).  It's, however, not large enough for a DSLR, so I'm not sure what would fit well in it.<br />2.  The camera compartment is velcro-ed closed vs being zipped.  In case of any hard use, it is not very secure.  There is at least a zip pouch in the front where you could store an extra battery or memory cards.<br /><br />I'll probably pick up a better padded (and more snug) Lowe-pro or Case-logic case soon, but for the SX260, it's a terrible fit.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|I'm glad I read it again even though it was a bit tedious.  I was able to compare...I like the movie better
B009VB7P6G|4.0|We really enjoyed this as a break from our steady diet of Japanese Anime. We don't see enough good animation coming from US studios and certainly not enough originality. This was well done with some moderate plot developement. Could have used more character developement.
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is a solid proof that marriage, motherhood, and a career can be done and combined successfully (if all three elements work together and the stars are aligned), and prior to her absences, being labeled the new queen of soul one can hear that she is not taking that nickname lightly. From the get-go opening of this album you hear an apologetic metamorphosis into a Queen who is taking her most deserving place in musical royalty. After three long years since her last album, Keys returns as if never missing a beat and bettering herself while doing that. Now don't even fathom the thought that she has been sitting on her laurels, Alicia obviously been busy with her writing, and several other projects that have no room to be mentioned within the sentences of this review. As Keys mentioned in an interview with the LA Times, this album \\"is really about finding your own passion, finding your own flow and standing in your own space. And just being fully and completely yourself.\\" This is exactly what the album brings to the table; the inspiration to continue to better yourself without feeling as if you are doing the wrong thing.  This album has Alicia Keys written all over it with the positive lessons learned through a stellar career being kept and the negative, although never forgotten, is left on the floor.
B007V65R54|3.0|This is an interesting and thought-provoking book, as others have said. But the Kindle Edition, at least when read on an iPad, suffers from having been pretty badly converted from the printed edition. Not so badly as some other titles I've encountered, but not good. This one displays occasional inexplicable font size changes, there are more typos in it than in the printed edition, the page numbering isn't quite right and the index doesn't have links that take you to the referenced page. But at least the table of contents works and it's possible to hop back and forth between the text and the end notes, something that's not always true of Kindle editions.<br /><br />A bit of additional care with the conversion to a Kindle edition would be most welcome.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fantastic book. I could not put it down. Mitch Rapp is my hero and Vince Flynn should be Time's Man of the Year!!!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I kept reading, hoping to like the characters and by the end found that I didn't give a crap what happened to them.
0307591549|3.0|Not enough instruction on how to, more like a lot of blather about why it works, and examples. Reads more like a Master's Thesis or research paper than anything else. Too redundant.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In reading &#34;The Racketeer&#34; It was interestingt to find a different use of a lawyer for the story, than previous John Grisham books I had read. The story is fasinating and kept me anxious for more.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love Draw Something.  It's addicting and I'm always checking my Kindle to see if it's my turn to draw.
B0073O0AME|4.0|I can't call myself a Tony Bennett &#34;fan&#34;, but over the years I have enjoyed his music.  While Tony isn't in his prime here, he is more than just &#34;good for his age&#34;.  Seeing and hearing the chemistry between him and his partners on these tracks is worth the price of admission and the respect and admiration of his companions is evident in the music and in the videos.  The bonus with the video is hearing what his partners have to say about their collaborations and their feelings about Tony.<br /><br />I can't say there are any clunkers here, even though I'm afraid I just can't relate to Amy Winehouse.  And although I am a bit of a Willie Nelson fan, I felt that track was a bit of a walk-through and, while still good, was not as inspired as other tracks.  There were a few moments when I felt Tony's voice didn't quite support the inspiration of the moment, but there were many more moments of brilliant, if sometimes subtle collaboration that are purely inspiring.  He really comes alive, both musically and visually on the track with Lady Gaga.  I'd never paid much attention to Lady Gaga, but this performance definitely got my attention.  Failure to mention the other fine artists and performances on this album should not be taken as a slight.  I don't want to over-analyze; I prefer to savor the experience.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole album and we each now have a couple new artists we would like to listen to some more.<br /><br />Thank you, Tony.
B0072X2O3O|4.0|Motorik Neu! beats over early Depeche Mode, it's a surprisingly excellent album. On my 2012 Top 10 list for sure.
0810996596|5.0|This is an amazing book with a truly great visual history lesson in the horror movie genre.  Nothing else like it.
B008D1RD1W|5.0|This is my surprise album of 2012. Who is Bill Fay and how can this old geezer come from nowhere with such an amazing album? Listen to it and decide for yourself
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story was ridiculous.  The first book was fun, this one was absurd.  The story line was entertaining but over the top.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|When this came out in the movie theaters in early summer of 2012, I wanted to go see it, but a plethora of negative reviews persuaded me otherwise. I've been trying to purchase this DVD on eBay for months at a \\"reasonable\\" price. On Cyber Monday, Amazon came to the rescue with a half off deal on the DVD-Blue Ray combo. I watched it last night.<br /><br />The premise for aliens, who can travel light years across the galaxy, but cannot avoid crashing into one of our satellites and losing their only means of communications is a bit ridiculous. They resort to confiscating our telecommunications equipment, which supposedly can work with their super-advanced technology? Hello? Then, the battleships that traveled half-way across the galaxy can only skim across the ocean? There only armaments appear to be these mortar shells, which they lob at our ships and ironically resemble the pegs from the old battleship game. Hello? Where are the advanced projectile weapons and the energy beams and particle weapons? So, if you can ignore all this silliness, then you can sit back and enjoy the explosions and the special effects.<br /><br />If you want good, entertaining sci-fi with lots of action, get Avengers. If you want to watch the best movie of the year, get The Dark Knight Rises (latest Batman movie), which I pre-ordered weeks ago. If you want decent special-effects and can tolerate a slightly muddled story line in the grand tradition of sci-fi spectacle, get Prometheus. Battleship is now part of my ever growing DVD library along with classics such as Predator and Aliens. Happy Holidays:)
B008OOYALE|2.0|i downloaded the app thinking it would be fun. then i kept playing and today it said i need inernet connection and i had wifi connected.
0385344333|2.0|I'm a big fan of Lee Child/Jack Reacher but was sooo disappointed in this edition.  It was boring/repeating and the ending was horrible (seems as if trouble was encountered in finding an ending for this book).  Sorry, I spent money on this hardback copy.  Hopefully your next book will be better.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This app is incredible! Totally worth the 2.99. I was skeptically at first and then I downloaded it and I can't stop playing!!!
0547884591|5.0|As someone that is the same age as Tim I have similar feelings on my lifespan. I love my life, and I want to increase not only my lifespan, but my enjoyment of life as well.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef while being a good cookbook is also a great blueprint on how to accomplish your goals, and master skills in a short amount of time. This book is also a great companion to the 4-Hour Body. I find myself reading the 4-Hour Chef, and then going back to the 4-Hour Body and trying out different skills like long distance running.<br /><br />Bottom line for a very low cost you can buy the Kindle or hardback book, and even if it is just a reference guide it will be worth the price. I bought the Kindle version, and then quickly realized I wanted the actual book as well.<br /><br />Thanks Tim for helping a married guy with two kids continue to strive for his best, and be a well rounded individual.
0385535147|1.0|I've long been a huge Grisham fan. Except for \\"Playing for Pizza\\" and his kids books, I've mostly found them pretty entertaining. When a new book comes out, I buy it right away and I carve out a free weekend for happily reading it. I did that this time and I lost interest about halfway through the book. NO SPOILERS HERE -- I won't ruin it for others, but a character who has little or no significance in the first part of the book suddenly, for no apparent reason, becomes the focal point. If you google that character's name to try to find out why the story suddenly shifts to them, you WILL see a spoiler that ruins the rest of the book. In addition, Grisham resorts to the tired strategy of a character trying to live under an assumed identity. That was interesting in his early books, but it has become tiresome and repetitive. At some point I might come back to this book, but it's low on my priority list, and I notice others have lost interest as well.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It is a truly great animated film. We have ages that ranged from mid-40s down to 3 and just about everywhere in between and everyone (teenagers included) likes this movie
B007HO392S|3.0|I wasn't too impressed with a lot of Carrie's songs that haven't been released yet. I do love her voice.
B0041KW7T2|5.0|Es un cl&aacute;sico del giallo una pel&iacute;cula de culto, es importante verla ubic&aacute;ndose en que se trata de una pel&iacute;cula de los a&ntilde;os 70, con el detalle de que fue escrita, dirigida por Dario Argento, tambi&eacute;n participo en el guion su esposa y participo en la creaci&oacute;n de la m&uacute;sica, que es fabulosa.La recomiendo 100%
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have been hearing great things about this book.  I ordered it on my Kindle a few nights ago and I am only &#34;12%&#34; through the book but I LOVE IT!! I actually downloaded the kindle app for my phone just so I could read this book while I was waiting for take out last night - that's dedication.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is a very addictive game but sometimes it sticks and makes it very hard to do the jumps and slides
B002P4VUMQ|3.0|I like Jason Mraz and this CD is fun to listen to once in a while but he's kind of cheesy when he talks during the show
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't love this game? Gosh, you start and you just cannot put it down! I hand it to my daughter and then it goes onto someone else!! love it!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I just love this entire CD.. My fav songs are Easy way out, eyes wide open and stiutk (yes still haha) I want to see gotye in concert!!
159413586X|3.0|I would recommend only to bring an end to the series but I didn't feel that it was as good as the 2 books. Not as much action, kind of dry.
0316228532|5.0|The NYT reviewer didn't like the book. The book may be better read by someone not expecting more Harry Potter (me), someone interested in the limits and craziness of politics (me again) and someone trying to grasp the evils of poverty and disconnection in the modern world (yup, me). I think of Rowling here as a modern Dickens who doesn't allow the reader to put child poverty, human misery and risk into the nostalgic mists of ye olde times. The book hurts.
1594135851|5.0|I loved this book! Went to see the movie after reading this. Has great intense action and keeps you in suspense.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is the best version of one of the best RPGs ever made. The fact that it is on a portable system is just icing on an already amazing cake. You owe it to yourself to give it a shot if you like role playing games in the slightest.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I am an experienced belly dancer and I tend to burn through instructional videos, feeling they are somewhat incomplete for what I would like to learn from the instructor. Rachel Brice did a great job with this lesson.Its challenging for me, It will keep me busy for a long while. I especially like her lecture on backward bending, and the yoga specific to belly dance activities. The way I see it, self care and self respect of the mind body and soul  are part of Belly dance, so yoga training is essential to this.  It may be somewhat complicated for some people, but the beauty of a DVD is you can keep watching and rewinding until you understand the techniques and character of Rachel's unique style.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is a challenge to the eye, that keeps you searching for a match of tiles.  The different levels of play allowes you to  become more  challenged at higher levels. It is a game that will grab you to keep coming back for more.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Fantastic Book, I could not put it down!  It has changed the way I run and think about running.  I have recommended it to many friends
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead: The Complete SECOND Season....AWESOME SHOW! THIS IS A HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TV SERIES. RECOMMEND EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THEM!
034580404X|5.0|Itmis exciting however I've been sick and unable to find time as I am just leaving hospital.  What I have read to date was great.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Madagascar (Full Screen Edition) is an excellent movie! We love all of the movies. We own each one and highly recommend all of them.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Such a great album...he is a true artist...so much talent! I'm so glad he won Idol. Can't wait to hear all the music he makes from here on out! Definitely get this album!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season....AWESOME SHOW! THIS IS A HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TV SERIES. RECOMMEND EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THEM!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This game is awesome because it's the only one that I could find that was free. I highly recommend it and I give it a solid five stars.
0920668364|5.0|This is the best children's book ever.  Every mother I know cries when they read it!  Always at the top of my list for gift giving!
B006P4FBUE|4.0|It is fun to play but the piano is not quite on key. I would recommend this app. as long as you remember it is not of real piano quality.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I've tried them all and this one is one of my favorites. It's versatile and useful with the ability to do a lot of customizing. Good work guys.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this app for about a year, and have yet to encounter any bugs. I have a lot of trouble waking up in the morning, but this app has made it so much easier. I love that I can set it so that I have to do math problems to turn the alarm off; that way I can't just hit a button and go back to sleep. All in all, this is one of my favorite apps, and I have a lot of them.
B007712XAU|5.0|A great story line. So addictive, Had to limit myself to one disc each evening. Can't wait for the next season.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another winner by Vince Flynn.  Mitch Rapp has to be one of the all time great book heroes.  He's not James Bond yet but he is getting there in my  book.
B009B0CZXU|5.0|Exceptional and original with hints of the sounds of Golfrapp and M83. Love it. The only track I tend to skip is Laura
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My 10 year old granddaughter loves this application, I think it's amazing too!<br />Very helpful in learing the tunes, easily.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was very impressed with Stephen King's writing ability...having been a teenager in 1963, I was enthralled with his version of the activities surrounding Kennedy's death.  The medium of using time travel was very impactful..I was totally enthralled in my reading of this book and stayed up very late on several nights as I could not put it down.  I had previously shied away from King's books as I frankly do not like to be scared, however, his writing skills have changed my opinion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|THE LAST MAN was a great book. I loved this book.  The action started early in the book and just continued on.  Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors, and did not disappoint me at all.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great on my kindle fire.  There are ups and downs to the game but overall it is a great game. It lets you be as creative as you want. You have to wait to unlock things though. The one thing I really don't like is energy because you need it or you cant do anything. Its a great game!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I have read all of McEwan's books, and, while this was no Enduring Love, it was an entertaining read.  I was frustrated with the character of Serena during the first half of the book.  She seemed too shallow to be a creation of McEwan.  The second half of the book proved to be more enlightening.  Although it wasn't implicitly spelled out, I felt like the ending tied things up a bit too nicely.  Overall, I still believe McEwan is a master of his craft.  Not many current authors can capture the shortcomings of humanity as he can.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I used to play Jewellust all the time but got bored with it. This is a refreshing play on an old game. Well made and definitely worth the price.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|These kids are amazing and give me real hope for our pop musical future.  The Singoff was the only talent show I watched and I was sad it wasn't renewed.  This superb group of talented singers will live on for decades. Very exciting.
B00000G3I2|4.0|I had to get The Big Chill on DVD, simply because it's one of my favourite movies from the 80's and I never get tired of watching it.  Its themes are relatable to everyone my age (late 40s), it has one of the greatest soundtracks from any movie, and a superb cast that has gone on to create an amazing body of work.
B001HN6922|5.0|my son loved the movie really creative its a very great kids movie...i rated it a 5 star cause it s a cute movie..lol
B006LSZECO|3.0|RECOMMENDED BY A COUPLE OF FRIENDS.  WRITING AND STORY CAPTURED ME BUT AS I GOT TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS I HATED THEM.
B00006RCOB|5.0|great flick, great acting. theme music by jarre was odd.clint should have oscar'ed for this flick.Toth from Raiders had a bit part
B009SJ46EA|5.0|Yes, this season is different from the first season. So far I'm up to episode 7 and I'm loving this season just as much as the last one. I love the feeling that I'm on the edge of my seat each week watching it wondering how things unfold. For me there have been a few surprising moments and several shocking ones. The characters in the show are amazing and their stories and seeing how their doomed fate in the asylum turns out is very interesting. This is not something though that you can just watch a random episode and understand things.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary defines words and letters so well!  Now I don't have to flip through a paper dictionary and hunt for one little word for a million years.  This is great!
B000002AT6|5.0|I bought this soundtrack back when the movie came out (I was still in high school) in 1994-95. Still one of my most favorite musical scores. All the instrumentals bring me right back  to the movie every time. The music brings emotion and made me realize all great movies have a great soundtrack! Music makes such a difference as with this soundtrack. I listen while I commute to work so calming on my 50 mile one way drive! Highly highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app that I have on all of my mobile devices. I use it every day and love how they keep it updated with regular upgrades. It works very well and one of the best apps available, especially given the fact it is a free one.
1553655427|3.0|The premise of this book is that aid is bad because it encourages African countries to simply take the aid, and not actually improve their economies.<br />Moyo argues this point expertly and I definitely agree with her argument.<br /><br />What I disagree with are Moyo's solutions to the problem. While aid DEFINITELY need to be reduced (if not eliminated), her solutions are way too simplistic and view Africa as yet another variable in a spreadsheet on a bloomberg terminal somehwere in her old Goldman Sachs office.<br />She offers \\"an array of financing alternatives: trade, FDI, the capital markets, remittances, micro-finance and savings\\" but her arguments are way too simple and can't actually work in Africa.<br /><br />For example, how can a country like Somalia even THINK about issuing bonds when they have no infrastructure at all??<br /><br />I don't want to make this review too long, but the point is that Moyo is still thinking like a Goldman Sachs employee and she ignores the actual political situations and the lack of infrastructure when presenting her solutions.<br /><br />I give this book 3 stars because her argument against aid is very well written, but I don't want to give more than 3 stars because her solutions to the aid dilemma are not good enough.<br /><br />Still, DEFINITELY read this book. I do highly recommend it, but just keep in mind that it is not a perfect argument by any means.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|Great book, it is filled with great references on research and proof that it works. I'm actually living proof. I have lost 60lbs in six months by using the principles of this book. Stay persistant, read it, and live by it, and you will see results.

B000UJ48O0|5.0|I started watching this show when it debuted and I was a freshman in college. We would always invite the girls from our floor to watch it with us. The scenery and stories about &#34;life&#34; in California were a great escape for a bunch of Ohio people. As the seasons grew on and more friends were made, our OC parties started to get larger (and less about the show and more about the beer). If you're looking for a great way to escape the cold wintery weather and into some light-hearted teenage drama, this is definitely the show your looking for.<br /><br />The product itself is fantactic! A hard acrylic case protects the DVD's and the full color, fully descriptive book they come in. My only fault is that I can't find the show in friggin' Blu-ray!

1451627297|4.0|Firstly, excellent book with that one bad feature of King, for some indefinite period after reading a King novel the strong nagging desire to be back in that world from which you have been involuntarily excreted when you turned the last page. I read little fiction anymore and I picked this up to see what a man like King would have to say about Lee and John, et al.<br /><br />Stephen: Why did you choose to tell us the Warren Commission version of the murder, attempt to convince us it was just a dirty little commie rat?<br /><br />BTW, we've met. In front of a grocery store in Tillamook, Oregon as you were returning to your truck and fifth wheel. It was evening and you were with your wife and I was amazed but confirmed my perception as I watched you walk from behind and the accident sort of played itself in my mind and seeing what could have been, I was glad for you. \\"Excuse me...\\" (voice rising into extreme honorific) Are you...? and your nod before I had to say your name (desperately wishing my wife would finally come out of the damn store!) \\"Thank you for your work?\\" and I meant it. And you went off to your world and me to mine.<br /><br />I would have presumed your research would have included the statements of every ER doc who looked at JFK's body and remain the same today. The original autopsy was done by someone who had never before performed a gunshot autopsy (only in Texas) and the throat wound was not even noticed. All of the ER docs noted an entry would on his right temple and a massive exit wound in the right rear of his skull. Did you fib here because of the clear association between JFK having the Treasury Department print and distribute REAL American money (Silver Certificates) in competition and eventual elimination of The Fed which would directly and seriously concern all of the scattered spiritual descendents of Herzl (read: clinical psychopaths) and would unleash their Golem, the mossad? Are you of the ilk of Edward Bernays? Is this your motivation in lying to us? Was not George de Mohrenschildt well known to be one of George H W Bush's gofer's (oil leases)? In fact, de Mohrenschildt was Oswald's handler, not a pimp trying to get his Russian friend laid. Later, his wife described his deteriorating condition as \\"... George suffered from depression, heard voices, saw visions, and believed that the CIA and the 'Jewish Mafia' (see Sayanim) were persecuting him\\".<br /><br />I'm disappointed, Stephen. In the end, just another, albeit more subtle, murdoch. Still, you are an amazing writer.in lying to us? Was not George de Mohrenschildt well known to be one of George H W Bush's gofer's (oil leases)?

B002JWD6AS|5.0|this book is a great book for teens and people who loved twilight and other popular sagas. it is quite captivating and well written
B008TRUDAS|5.0|There aren' t enough words to express my love for this book. This book was beautifully written with well developed characters. I will forever recommend it to everyone.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Even though this is different, the story, from the TV series, I enjoyed reading it. It looked good on the Kindle Fire although some of the smaller print was a bit hard to read. Read it, find out what happens in the original story, you'll be surprised how different the show is.
B003O5MOES|4.0|Those of us of a certain age remember Sinatra's concept album \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\\"  The swinger-in-chief resolutely refused to swing and gave us instead a handful of dark ballads of love and loss.  Well, now (or in 1995) the rocker-in-chief resolutely refused to rock, and we now have a handful of dark ballads from him.  This isn't love and loss, though -- it's jobs and home -- and it seems timelier as I write (2012) in the lingering aftermath of recession and with the demonizing on the right of Latino immigrants.  Sinatra's dark ballads were lushly orchestrated, and folks like Gordon Jenkins and Nelson Riddle provided full orchestral backup.  The Sinatra persona in such songs wasn't poor or homeless.  Springsteen's personae are shell-shocked veterans in a world where jobs, stability, and self-confidence are hard to come by or observers of illegal immigrants who've  come to the USA, from south of the border or from Vietnam, not for benefits but for a chance at work and dignity but who have hard times achieving these.<br /><br />What does it all amount to musically.  Almost all the songs are almost whispered, and the accompaniments are minimal -- basically guitar and harmonica.  They are strophic or stanzaic, too, with narrative lines, and while they don't particularly sound like dust bowl ballads, there's an emotional kinship with them.  They are all quite haunting, and the voice sounds haunted.  We so associate him with pretty hard rockin' that it's easy to forget just how beautiful Springsteen's soft singing is.  The writing, all by Springsteen, is strong.  I like them all, but Youngstown, Sinaloa Cowboys, Galveston Bay, and Straight Time are particularly poignant.  It's not the kind of album that you just want to play right through -- a song or two at a time in the car suits me -- and it isn't pop music.  It's a serious album by a serious man.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Lexy Baker was shocked when she found out someone died from eating her popular cupcake toppers, especially when she was told it was her ex-boyfriend. The detective on the case was her next door neighbor, whom she had just met and hoped to meet again! To help her convince the detective she did not commit murder, she turned to her grandmother. Nans and her fellow retirement center friends had just created the ladies Detective Club and talked Lexy into letting them take the case. What follows is an entertaining, light-hearted murder mystery.<br /><br />One thing I like about food-related cozy mysteries is that they typically have at least a recipe or two. Dobbs does not disappoint. I like that she also added information about what to do with the left over untopped cupcakes. To be honest with you, I actually thought about that while I was reading the story and was delighted when the author gave several interesting suggestions.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|If you like GRRM then you'll love Abercrombie.  He creates characters that you can relate too, and in this novel he resurrects one from his early works, changes him and then changes him back.  I have yet to read a book from him that wasn't well written, deep in plot, and left you wanting more.  Give him a chance if you haven't already---he does not disappoint.

B00063F8B2|5.0|This soundtrack is packed with music that evokes emotion on all levels during the Christmas season. It is filled with music from the movie and combinations that mix the scores together especially with the songs a) The Polar Express sung by Tom Hanks and b) Suite from the Polar Express. If you have seen the movie and enjoyed it this CD is must. For those that have not seen the movie I would suggest it and the soundtrack keeps your imagination going. Personally this CD brings in the feeling of the holiday with warmth and love. For adults imagine being a child again, put the CD on, close your eyes, and soak up the feeling of an innocent and joyful Christmas again. The message of the movie and music of this CD is to remember that Christmas can be a magical holiday no matter one's age. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas with warmth and happiness.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a powerful love story with beautiful scenery and solid acting. While this is a bit of a chick-flick, that always makes for a great evening
0425263916|5.0|I am really enjoying this series.  After I read &#34;Fifty Shades....&#34;  I decided I wanted to try another seriers in this genre.  This is a good one and very satisfying.  I can't wait for the last book.  I guess that says it all right there.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The graphics on this are great and have had no problems playing.  My grandson loves to play and so do I.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. It was sad, humorous, enthralling and one I just couldn't put down. For a first novel, it's really good. I'm loking forward to the next one this author writes!<br /><br />I'd highly recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I used to love this game but after it erased my game not once but twice I just gave up on it. Im not wasting my time anymore. you have to wait 3 min for one energy point. Also off kicks me off the game when I go to the market. So im uninstalling...
0525951652|5.0|I enjoy Ken Follett's writings and looking forward to the third book in this trilogy.Would recommend this group of books to anyone interested in this type of works
B004FQX59I|5.0|One of my top five movies of all time. If you never fell for the Warren commision nonsense then this is your movie. When JFK was released I remember some reviewers calling Oliver Stone a crackpot, but then again, as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Col. X said, &#34;You're close, closer than you think&#34;. Same could be said of Stone. Lots of facts in this movie, requires several viewings to take it all in. EXELLENT.
B008GODP04|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It provoked me to think about human nature more as well as how interactions with others need to be recognized in a more conscientious way.  I read it because Richard Russo mentioned it in his new book and I trust his recommendation.  He was right and I am glad I read a book that I probably would not have known about.

B007712XAU|5.0|This was a wonderful PBS production and I know my families will enjoy viewing it.  Maggie Smith is a hoot!  I am addicted to the series and can hardly wait for season 3 to begin.
B005LAII08|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo254VQRM2236GH]]I BOUGHT THIS 3D DVD FOR MY LITTLE GIRL AND TODAY WE OPENED, EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE BUT ONCE YOU INSERT THE DVD (3D) IT PLAYS BUT WITH MANY COLOR LINES IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN ALL OVER THE SCREEN. I PLACE ANOTHER 3D-DVD TO VERIFY THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT MY 3D DVD PLAYER AND I WAS RIGHT, MY DVD PLAYER IS GOOD THE PROBLEM WAS THE DISC. I REALLY HOPE AMAZON WILL SEND ME A REPLACEMENT OR MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN BUY IN ANOTHER STORE. I BUY EVERYTHING IN AMAZON IN THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE A PROBLEM.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day really does Gideon justice in this book.  It is the 2nd in the series with Bared to You being the first.  This book was 10x better than the first, with a story that was much more intense!!  Read it if you loved 50 Shades!
B0042U94UQ|3.0|the DVD did not work but the digital copy did,paid decent price so did not return it. Love the movie!
B00170DEM8|5.0|One of the very best Christmas films ever. It is an entertaining musical the entire family can enjoy. Between Bing singing and Fred dancing, you can't go wrong.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I ordered this as a stop gap for my small dedicated home studio for some work I needed to get done before a better console showed up. I was very surprised by the performance of this USB interface. I have been using firewire for the Iast 5 years.<br />I had just built a new computer that could not even be bothered to deal with my old interface. this one lets me record with 6ms of lag (I was amazed!). I don't even need to turn on the direct monitoring option (which was all i ever did before). While the pre-amps may not be the bees knees compared to pro strips, they are not that bad. If you are a solo home recorder; I can whole heatedly recommend this cheap ass interface. Yes, it is cheap, and it does more than what it should do.<br />I do however recommend that you use the money saved to purchase a nice mike preamp or an optical comp strip. Please, do use the balanced inputs on this thing. For some reason, the 1/4&#34; input doesn't track so well without hiss (however, still better than the old tascam reel to reel). I only knock a star off because you cant record with phantom power on just one mike.....Ribon and a condenser in stereo won't work without a nice mike preamp to provide the phantom power. Other than that, this thing is great! However, i still can&#34;t get native instruments sounds/effects to work with it..........<br />I'm sure I'll figure it out..<br /><br />Good luck!
B00942S4OY|3.0|I was a big fan of One Direction's debut album last year and this is certainly more of the same. Trouble is, I don't really think there was any need for a new album yet. Up All Night is still charting well and I suspect this new CD is the result of the greedy people behind the band trying to make a quick buck.<br /><br />The songs are all pleasant but insubstanstial and too many of them want to morph into What Makes You Beautiful and One Thing. In truth, it feels like the songs are ones they had over from the Up All Night sessions.<br /><br />Little Things is quite sweet but I doubt there'll be any worldbeaters from this set. A bit rushed and cheap sounding, to be honest.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I was disappointed that the kindle version doesn't let you buy special words with your bombs. I hope they will update it to include this feature. If that happens I will give it 5 stars.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Loved every minute!  Great story and let's face it, Channing Tatum is hot.  This is the perfect holiday gift, in my opinion.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I love Pentatonix anyway, there's something about acapella music that sounds so great in today's over-computerized music world. This album does not disappoint, you would never know you were listening to acapella. It's and awesome album from this very very talented group.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|saw the \\"stubborn love\\" youtube video and was blown away, listened to a few sample tracks and bought the CD. more impressed then ever when i got the recording. just \\"AWESOME\\" i loved the review \\"if you dont like it i will drive half way to you and buy you a sandwich\\" i would throw in a dos xx beer to wash down that sandwich.<br /><br />some great music out there and this doesnt disappoint.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Wow! This came in like two days it was awesome. Not only that but the movie was amazing! Super long though!
B00006D295|5.0|i finally get to watch the whole show and not have to worry about the whoop law of everyone around me soooo coool
B000FC1HBY|5.0|.....all 14 pages worth!  I took too long reading this book after GoT season 1 ended.  I couldn't wait to find out what happens so I purchased this on my kindle, but never had the time to read it (my fault).  Then season 2 came out and that was that.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm generally into metal and rock; however, I've been branching out into electronica and classical over the last couple of years.  I came across Lindsey Stirling's &#34;Crystallize&#34; on Pandora and immediately bought this album without listening to any other songs (previous reviews were encouraging...).  Very rarely do I come across an album where almost all the tracks are amazing.  This is one of those albums!
B009CPES4I|4.0|Heartfelt movie on enjoying life and maintaining independence in retirement.  Great actors, a beautiful setting, and a love story. So refreshing that it was nonviolent, real, and not fantasy.  Will watch again.  Could be a series movie.
B0046ECJBY|4.0|Good historical summary and a reasonable explanation of recent history. Worth reading. Author is long in the tooth but knowledgable about China from first hand experience.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|I'm not going to review the content or plot of this movie...if you're buying it, chances are you're already a Potter fan. If you're a Potter fan, chances are you've read the book and/or seen this movie already. It's an awesome ending to an awesome saga, and it looks/sounds fantastic on Blu-Ray.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|The Avengers is a fun and fantastic movie.  Whether you love comic books or not this is still a great film.  It may help to watch the other movies first, especially Captain America, but for the most part it can be enjoyed on its own.  Definitely recommend.  Saw it twice in theaters and have watched it about 10 times since purchasing it on dvd.  I still have yet to watch it on blu ray but I can only imagine its even more epic with a better picture. lol
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I really enjoy this game its great for clearing my mind before I go to bed at night just wish it didn't cost so much for more energy
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very addicting, good mental exercize, fun fun fun fun fun a a a a a a a a a a
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|the score to this movie is absolutely brilliant and haunting. the underlying noir aspect of the film is greatly enhanced by vangelis' music and is possibly one of my all-time favorite soundtracks. will play this until it wears out on me in which case i will have made digital copies and can continue to enjoy it on an ipod.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I never get tired of watching the movie series called, Band of Brothers. The men and women who served during WWII sacrificed SO MUCH. I really like how the movie develops each of the main charactes, so you as a viewer, can understand how this war affected each character. The main characters are all so different, as we all are, in real life. It is nice to see how the bond of friendship and loyalty developed with the men of Easy Company. The sound track that goes with this movie is also fantastic! Watching this movie is a wonderful tribute to the men and women who served their country during WWII.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|i absolutely love this film. there's not much else to say except its medieval scotland with the voices of billy connelly and emma thompson as lord and lady. kelly macdonald does a fantastic job emoting not only as a child but as a woman coming of age in a difficult situation. one of the only of these films that i can think of where the parents are still together and have a strong relationship with the children. children and adults alike will love this movie not only for the humor and music (which has become one of my all-time favorite disney soundtracks) but the artwork. it looks all the more breathtaking on bluray in the highest picture settings possible. do yourself a favor and buy this whether you've seen it already or not. you will not be disappointed. btw, there is also a boatload of extra behind the scenes featurettes on just about every aspect of making this movie for all you cinephiles (or disneyphiles as it were) out there.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|nice time killer.  bright fun graphics.  takes me back to the days of going to carnival and playing all the ripoff games.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I initially found this item though Amazon and it was selling for $80, which seemed kind of steep to me (today it's on sale for $117, outrageous!).  So I went to the Lego site and found it available at the msrp of $34.99, bought it, got it a few days later.  It's hard to blame Amazon for this, as I'm guessing the price is set by the individual sellers, not Amazon...so I guess my point is do your research before you purchase.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I was doing some video editing on my Mac Mini and realized that I needed a FW800 to FW400 adapter.<br />The back of the Mac Mini is a little cramped as well, so I didn't want an adapter that would block access to other ports.<br /><br />The Moshi adapter worked well and since it used a dongle design, it didn't hog any extra space on the back of the Mac Mini.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Im not a super hero movie fan, my husband insisted we rent the Avengers and Im so glad he did. What a great movie. LOVED it.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is one of the best holiday CD's I have heard.<br />Did not expect to like it as much as I do.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I'd suggest simply purchasing &#34;Madness&#34; and &#34;Supremacy,&#34; as they're fantastic. The rest reminds me of old Chumbawamba stuff, with the faux news broadcasts dubbed over dramatic electronica; it felt been there/done that to me.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved it!  It's like a smarter, wittier version of Hackers :)<br /><br />This will definitely be on my re-read list!
B00A7W29BE|1.0|This application requires a camera on the back of a tablet, it is useless on Kindle HD. I wasted 99 cents, but may be still money is well spent as there is a chance that someone will read this review and delete this app from the Kindle store.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Brand new blu-ray set that was price guaranteed as I purchased it during a pre-sale. I can't wait for Season 2 to come available ... Brody!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used evernote for two years now. I am an aspiring YA author. This is such an easy way to carry my book around. If I am not around a wifi network I just save the note (chaper in my case) and sync it when I get home. It seems to be the best writing and journaling app for me.
B008469DGY|5.0|Addictive and lots of fun. I need to keep practicing but hope to keep getting better. let your fingers fly.
B003B02PFO|5.0|I read this book for my book club, and I'm glad I did. I smiled all the way through the tale of a couple who, after their only child leaves homes, decide to take a break from Christmas. I found myself in perfect accord with the main character, Mr. Krank, and his plan to avoid the expense and drudgery of the traditions forced on every one of us during the holidays. This book has it all from humor to touching sentiment. I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone who plans to \\"go all out\\" for Christmas.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door is about a girl named Lola who seems to be happy with the way her life is going. Not only is she making a Marie Antoinette ball gown for a school dance, she has an older boyfriend who sings in a band. The only problem is that her two fathers don't approve of her boyfriend, Max, and a boy she has a history with moves in next door.<br /><br />This book was a very fun, quirky read. Lola is a very loveable character with a passion for dressing up in crazy outfits and exploring the unique city of San Francisco. First of all, I really loved her relationship with Cricket Bell, the boy next door. I loved the author's writing, colorful tastes, and quirky sense of humor. The plot was predictable and a little overcomplicated in terms of the love story, but it was a very fun and lighthearted read. I also loved that her parents were gay. I rarely see that in young adult fiction, and they were both very entertaining characters.<br /><br />Anyone who is in the mood for a light, fun, and wacky read should check out this book! You'll be wanting to take a plane to San Fransisco after you finish.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I can't say enough about this brilliant movie. Disney has done it again! As a middle age woman, I couldn't help but think  about my own coming of age and the differences between myself and my Mom during that time in my life. It's a touching story and it's nice to see that Disney is willing to change with the times as Brave's princess had no need to be rescued by a man. This is my second favorite movie now right behind Tangled. I'm thinking about getting both for my 80 year old Mom (who still loves Disney) for Christmas this year. :)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent movie for anyone retired, thinking of retiring or will will retire at some point in life.  Totally not PC at times but very humorous and definitely worth seeing
B009SQQRH2|4.0|This is a pretty cute movie. I think my husband and I were cracking up at the wicked British humor more than our child was getting out of it, but as much as she loves Santa, we all were happy in the end.
1466216336|3.0|This is a print on demand book, that looks like it was formatted from a HTML web page, then bound into a loose paperback binding.<br /><br />I've never owned a real, bound copy of this book before, so I can't tell if it really the whole thing. Perhaps it is missing things - I'm not familiar enough with the original to know if this is quality or not.<br /><br />That being said, it is worth the price.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I own the DVD edition in the metal box that contains the miniature Robby but wanted to see what the Blu-ray edition looked like.<br /><br />It's beautiful. No it's not as sharp and clear as PROMETHEUS but the colors and details are just fantastic. Skin tones and details are particularly revealing and fresh looking and do contribute to the drama. The standouts are the sets and the special effects. The outside night views of the ship against the sky and stars are stunning and I am still amazed at the beauty of the ship's entry into the atmosphere at the beginning. The interior sets also look amazing; Morbius' study looks remarkably fresh.<br /><br />I am still impressed with how well this movie holds up after all these years. Quality production values and a top notch story make all the difference.
B00926J3K6|5.0|Esta ha sido el  mejor box-set que he adquirido.  Anteriormente compre los immersion de Pink Floyd, los cuales me parecieron fabulosos (con excepcion de The Wall, que no tiene version 5.1 ni BD).<br />Yo tengo la serie del 40th anniversary; pero el 'Larks Tongue In Aspic me parece el mejor... Tiene todas las grabaciones existentes de este proyecto, pero la verdadera joya son los seassons reels y las outtakes... Todas me parecieron magnificamente ejecutadas... la mejor es la version alterna de Exiles... es una lastima que no hubiera sido incluida de esta manera en el album 100% recomendable.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Even though one can't prove the entity of God one must have faith, this is an entirely new point of view and I am thankful that I read it, so I have a better understand of one who has no faith.... When one is hurt  or in extreme pain the first words normally out of their mouth are oh my God ...go figure?  Elisabeth O'Donnell
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Daniel Craig is probably my favorite Bond short of Sean Connery. Casino Royale was a great introduction to his take on the role. It is a must watch before seeing the new Skyfall movie.
B009439HEY|3.0|First of all, I'll establish that Genesis from 1970-77 is perhaps my favorite band ever, has been since I was 13 (which was a long time ago), and is also perhaps the most critically underrated band in rock history, due to their metamorphosis into more of a mainstream pop/rock band in the 1980s and early 90s (a very good one, I still maintain, but that's a different discussion).  And when one gets to know the Genesis canon as a whole, one eventually realizes that the true pushing-the-envelope spirit of early Genesis declined much more when Hackett left the band than when Gabriel left.  The musical trips on which the first two post-Gabriel albums (in which Hackett was still a member of the band) take us nearly equal those of the classic Gabriel years, sometimes even surpass them.<br /><br />So why three stars?  Well, even though the music itself, as well as the guitar playing and the production, is 5 star material, I just don't see myself going out of my way to listen to this more than once for the curiosity.  As one other reviewer put it, it's just too perfect.  What's the point of listening to a reproduction of early Geneis when you just listen to the actual early Genesis anytime you like?  On Genesis Revisited I in 1996, which I also seldom listen to for similar reasons, at least he took some fun liberties, adding some sinister vocalizations to Dance on a Volcano, turning I Know What I Like into a lounge-jazz number, totally reworking the verses of Your Own Special Way, and deconstructing the middle section of Firth of Fifth.  Here, the boldest experiment is having a female vocalist sing Ripples.  Most of it is just note for note reproductions.  Sure, he does do some cool new guitar work at the end of Supper's Ready and in parts of Hogweed (or perhaps it's cool OLD guitar work that Tony vetoed at the time...), but for the most part, it varies only trivially from the original.<br /><br />Not that anyone else in the world could do this - I tip my hat to Steve for being one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time, especially from a technical perspective.  But I don't fall for the whole concept of \\"don't mess with sacred music\\" - the original is always there to listen to if you like, a cover version should add something new, otherwise it doesn't seem worth it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Just want to leave a comment that the 3D works great on my Samsung Plasma 6500. It was great how many extra features they packed into this release.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I hope the country survives long enough for him to write the next one.  Maybe Mitch Rapp could tell the American people what happened in Benghazi.
B0038M2AZA|1.0|I was not able to watch the movie /dvd . Because I live in the Netherlands it is not possible . Its another systeem we have here.
