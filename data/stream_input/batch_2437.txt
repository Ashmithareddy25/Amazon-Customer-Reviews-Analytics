B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an addicting game. It made me feel compelled to beat my friend's score. Every time you hit something it slows you down and you can see the police officer chasing you, or you get caught and it's game over. The further you make it, the faster it goes and more challenging it is because you have to dodge trains and jump hurdles or slide underneath them. As you go through the course you collect coins and other various items like shoes that make it possible to jump over trains and special items that help you work towords unlocking other things.
1451697686|2.0|I picked up this book at the local library and I'm not familiar with the author otherwise.<br /><br />While I agree with many on here that it is refreshing to hear her honesty about the way she used to live, I was really disappointed that reality doesn't really fit into book.First, cost.There is simply no way shopping for a family of five at the farmers market is not cost prohibitive for many. And many of her zero waste solutions centered on no packaging from farmers markets and health food shops...she seems to think finding bull, lotion and soap is a common practice in the US. Or, for example, buying meat from butcher to use her own container when that is more costly than buying pre packages meats....bothers me that cost is only mentioned as if this zero waste is a huge cost savings...well it is if you lived such wasteful life as she did previously but what if that is not your starting point?<br /><br />Finally, book is repetitive and most information you can find elsewhere.

B005MMYBXI|5.0|Blood, guts, sex.  The Roman elite knew how to live.  They use naked women by putting hors'dourves on them, using them as a serving tray at parties.  If a guest wants to screw a slave, well, the slave is screwed.  If the slaves irritate anyone in any way, they feed them to the lions, etc.  It's good to be an elite, but really, really sucks to be a slave in that time in history in the Roman Empire.  But the blood and guts are non-stop and I learned where the phrase &#34;It's the pits&#34; came from watching Spartacus, and what it means.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|A very poignant and sorrowful tale of Greta, a young Jewish girl falling for Wilhelm, a German boy in pre and during the WWII Czechoslovakia. Her family did not practice the Judaism and due to many different circumstances in the political, economical and national, they managed to slip under Nazi's radar. However, unlike Biblical Ruth who waited patiently for her Boaz,Greta settled for his relative lyin'-az and he did not respect her az. He kind of married her because he got her pregnant and in many scenes I wanted to shake Greta and slap her across her face to get her to wake up. She came across totally passive and just went on as the wind blew her, never took an initiative in her life. Yeah, it's bad for Jews and they're getting treated worse and worse by day, but hiding on a German owned farm, hoping her name wouldn't come up, proved as no solution. Wilhelm's family booted her out all the same.<br />The writing style at first bothered me, but once I got into the core of the story and the flow, I didn't pay much of attention. Though, I could see some readers finding the constant head hopping and telling a slow read. Many passages in the book read as if they were cipied and pasted from a textbook. If I wanted to find out all the facts of the political situation, I'd Google it. The story itself reads more like a memoir, at least that was my impression. There's very little dialogue and for the most part the author re-told the events of two families thorough this difficult and turbulent times. The dire circumstances drove people to radical decisions (e.g. Wilhelm sneaking off to Germany with their first born son and leaving his pregnant wife on the farm with his German relatives who treated her as a second class citizen, lying about not being able to get her a fake passport when he - or rather the wife of his relative convinced him it was way too expensive - yet he never even tried, then once in Germany secretly divorcing Greta) and now we can judge them by it all and maybe even hate them, but we never walked a mile in their shoes, and I hope we never do. Some may find the passages where the author describes the political scene a bit lengthily or as a page from a history textbook. I like history when presented in an engaging and interesting concept. All in all, I would've enjoyed reading this book more if I could connect with the characters, though I was somewhat compelled to find out what happened to all of the characters through it and for how long The Luck of the Weissensteiners would hold on.be even hate them, but we never walked a mile in their shoes, and I hope we never do.

0812993845|2.0|I have really enjoyed every Sophie Kinsella book I've read (all of them) until this one.  I was ready to spend $12.99 to get this on my kindle but lucked out and was first on my library's ebook lending list.  There were a few funny moments but basically it was a trashy novel.  I like chick-lit and loved Sophie's books for their light, funny reads but this one was  all sex oriented.  It started out well, but boy did it tank quickly. The primary plot point has the main character trying to consummate her hasty marriage to someone she barely knows while her sister (who also has her own casual hook-ups while trying to get over her messy divorce) tries to stop her - for 3/4 of the book. Just really not my kind of book - very disappointed since I usually love this author.

B006H5120E|5.0|This movie won the many Oscars and I loved this movie when I was around at that the time but I was disappointed with the 3D effects though that could be because we probably have the wrong TV to project 3D but then most people complain that 3D is good but doesn't show much as Disney thrill rides! Avatar was better in 3D then this one!

B007M45PMU|5.0|There's a movement afoot in American music that many are doing, but few are doing well.  The Lumineers capture this \\"Americana Newgrass\\" sound effortlessly, and in doing so crafted the best album of 2012, in my opinion.  Moreover, they've put together a humble folksy sound that demands to be seen live - and have put together a year of tour dates that should ensure new fans like myself get to see them - even if it means a bit of travel.  Foot stomping, backbeat clapping, HO HEY shouting ... can't wait to see them!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I appreciate the first three and don't care much for the fourth but they all beat Predator sequels and those awful Alien vs Predator movies!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book and couldn't put it down at times. Only disappointment was about the last 25 pages are so it just went back to the first part of book one of how they meet. I think it should have talked about how she told her family and friends about there news.

B003SJ4VJ6|2.0|This is not a completely awful movie, just not really worth the trouble you have to take to slog through it to the end.  If you are looking for anything akin to Repulsion or Chinatown, this definitely ain't it, baby.  The idea was a good one, i.e. what if the CIA completely controlled a Tony Blair-like politician who lied his country into the quagmire which was the Iraq War.  But surely there could be a bit more to this thesis than Ewan McGregor looking vaguely worried through two and half hours.  Kind of reminded me of a more recent failure, Robert Redford's disappointing The Company You Keep, which also started with a terrific premise (what if sixties underground radicals surfaced and had a chat with one another before deciding whether or not to turn themselves in to authorities after 40 something years) but piddled into sophistry and melodrama, not to mention unlikely legal outcomes.

B00A2LFXVI|4.0|The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 is the sequel to part one of the animated adaptation to Frank Miller's comic The Dark Knight Returns. In my opinion, this film is just as great as part 1. Personally, I enjoy this film a little better than part one. That mostly has to do with Batman dealing with the Joker and Superman in this one.<br /><br />Dark Knight Returns Part 2 takes place a few months after the events of part 1. Batman, played again by Peter Weller, has returned and is cleaning up Gotham with his sidekick Carrie Kelly a.k.a. Robin played once again my Ariel Winter. Also, the mutant gang from part 1 has reformed into a new group called the sons of Batman, who now fight for Batman. Commissioner Gordon has retired. The new commissioner taking his place labels him a criminal and issues a warrant for his arrest. The government also does not like Batman coming back so the president sends Superman to force him back into retirement. The Joker also is lose again and wishes to take out Batman as well. Batman has to over come the odds and restore Gotham to order.<br /><br />I really enjoy this film, even more than part 1. This is mainly because I find the Joker and Superman to be better adversaries than the mutant gang. The voice acting is good for the most part. Peter Weller and Ariel Winter do a good job once again. The person who voices Superman, whose name escapes me, does a fine job. He is not as good as Tim Dale, but does fine.<br /><br />However, I am not a big fan of this Joker. His look does nothing for me, and neither does his voice. Michael Emerson voices the Joker in this. I am a fan of Emerson in Lost, but here is performance as a bit lacking. Overall I liked him better than John DiMaggio's Joker in Under the Red Hood. However, this Joker is still one of my least favorite Jokers.<br /><br />The art and animation are the same as part one, no change. I thought it was fine overall. The action is great, mainly the final battle between Superman and Batman. This fight is my favorite fight of both movies.<br /><br />Overall if you are a fan of Frank Miller's comic and of Dark Knight Returns part 1, you need to watch this.

B000077VR3|2.0|Moulin Rouge is a classic example of style over substance.  The film has great production values and good dancing, but has nothing else to offer.  Many people seem to get so sucked up in the style of the movie that they fail to realize all the glaring flaws in terms of characters and story.<br /><br />Moulin Rouge is a movie musical that came out in 2001.  This is the film that is said to restore the movie musical.  It stars Christian, plated by Ewan McGregor and Satine played by Nicole Kidman.  The movie revolves around their love story and how they are going to prevent the Moulin Rouge from closing down.<br /><br />The characters are one of the big problems with the film.  The characters are very one-dimensional, even if the movie tries to show you otherwise.  Most of the movie revolves around showing how much Christian and Satine are in love even though they have no real chemistry in my opinion.  They never really have a conversation about anything other than about love.  They never have a normal conversation discussing their likes, dislikes, what they have in common, etc.  The side cast is entirely forgettable for the most part.  The villain is the very over-the-top.  He is basically a one-dimensional mustache-twirler.  There is nothing at all deep about any of the characters.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, the production values in this film are beautiful.  The dance sequences are also impressive.  The songs themselves are good, but are completely out of place in this setting.  The film takes place in 1899, but these songs are all from the 1990s.  This contradiction takes you out of the film.<br /><br />Overall I cannot recommend this.  If you are looking for a good movie musical there are many films that are better like, Chicago, Les Miserable, Sound of Music, Sweeney Todd, etc.  I respect it for bringing back the movie musical, but as a film by itself, it does hold up.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game catches my eye because it is constantly evolving into something better than before. Hope they keep the updates rolling in!

Okay, maybe 2 decent movies - but we're already pushing it. Seriously though - three movies out of one little book!? And though this bit was reasonably well done, it draws out the story to a mind numbing level. Bad Peter Jackson! Bad boy!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a long time.  A new generation of FernGully with saving the trees.  It has great humor for both adults and children.  I love that it has blu-ray for the family room, dvd for either grandparents or spare room, and digital copy for road trips.  Digital copy is worth the investment!

B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I bought this movie for my son for Christmas/solstice and it was a great investment with all the different disc depending on what tv you are watching it on.  The Digital copy is the reason why I got this one especially.  That alone is worth getting all the rest with it.

What these men faced on a daily basis, especially if you were in the Luftwaffe, and were there at the start of the war, you either made it or died trying, and this is brought out so well in this book.  I loved this book!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great start to the trilogy. I liked the &#34;grown-up&#34; vampire story, and appreciated that the protagonist, while a witch, was also an accomplished academic.

I finished the book, and am now going to buy First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) (Wool).  I also love the prices and the personal q & a from the author at the end of the book as well.

Towards the end of the war she was working in a potato field and was strafed by a P-51,  they shot at anything that moved.  In that same attack a person getting dental was killed by a 50 cal. shell from that same P-51.

Haha. And it looks impresive the color!<br /><br />The only thing for me that is not a problem only that I dont use it is the two buttons on the left, I pnly use one of them to zoom the guns or another things in assassin or batman, etc. They are hard to touch because I have a small hand, but maybe someone find it really good!

0316228532|2.0|Why you shouldn't waste your time reading The Casual Vacancy by JK Rowling:<br /><br />1. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. I think part of the problem was that Rowling tried to include too many and wasn't able to go far enough into depth.<br /><br />2. The plot is flat, which would be bearable if there was something to make up for it, which there is not. A town clamoring for a local government position, all the while revealing secrets about one another has potential, but the execution is downright boring.<br /><br />3. Speaking of secrets, the scandals that result aren't really that appalling, nor are the responses of the townspeople.<br /><br />4. There are too many subplots, that, again, aren't done well. There's the overall political line, than one for each of the dozen or so characters. They all overlap and some end up just getting lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />5. The end is contrived and melodramatic. It's ridiculous.<br /><br />6. It's far longer than it should be. Rowling should have worked on tightening up her storyline, concentrating on a few characters, and chopping off a hundred and fifty pages (it's just over 500).<br /><br />7. The \\"naughty\\" parts are so terribly PG. I felt as if she felt obligated to include more adult aspects, but was a little unsure about how to write them.<br /><br />8. The social and political messages (people not having a say in government, the poor being misunderstood, communities not working for a common good) are there, but not inspirational. She could have taken a much better stance.<br /><br />I wanted to like this, despite the fact that I had little hope. It took my over ten days to read- I had no desire to pick up the book to keep going. If you really need a Rowling fix revisit the Harry Potter series.

B005EY2XFC|5.0|I watched this movie when i was younger, i thought it was all about revenge and the action part. But now that i'm older and watched it once more i realized it wasn't just about revenge and action, but about how it turned to revenge and believe me this dude had a reason to be rage.<br /><br />This movie is a story of a rockstar called eric and his soon-to-be sweet wife shelly ready to be married. But their life of happiness comes to an end when three thugs came in killed the happy couple. A year later a mystical crow tapped the the grave of eric allowing him to come to life and get revenge on all who caused him pain, anguish and RAGE.<br /><br />This rated R has graphic scenes, langauage and nudity. Honestly i was a little uncomfortable but i still give it a good rating because it deserved it, it has good moral value of how strong love is, to make the wrong things right as it was meant to be. Love is a powerful it can make anything possible (so i see the crow as a bird of love than death)<br /><br />Plus i wasn't really a fan of gothic films but this movie is a start<br /><br />IT'S COMPELLING,SIGNIFICANT AND GOTHIC MOVIE!!!! THAT'S WORTH THE SEEING!!!!

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So, this was an ending but unlike the Wheel of Time, this is the ending we have all waited for... maybe not perfectly happy or perfectly awful, but extremely satisfying. I commend Brian Sanderson for his dedication to Robert Jordan's vision and the completion of this epic tale. Read and enjoy!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a must read.  It is an excellent book and everyone should read.  Chris Kyle is a true American Hero and we should all thank him for his service to our country.  Without men like this we might not be standing here in America today!

B00BIK3FAI|4.0|Vary cute. Loved the art work. Loved story. Hope because it's app book that it will have more story's. Only down side to it is you can't just close it like other games or books. You have to read to the end if you don't it will keep playing music....  I still really loved it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Life in Ireland's orphanages was an unimaginable nightmare that is brought to life in its fullest through Jamie's story. The. Idea of an ad to find a date for an upcoming wedding adds some much needed humor to a story about two middle aged adults who have suffered most of their lives feeling that something is missing in their lives.<br />I enjoyed the premise of the story's taking place in Ireland but it could have taken place in any country where the Church was able to exert its power over civil circumstances with authorities exercising a blind eye.<br />Enjoy!<br />ejljbl

It's a \\"I find this helpful/I don't find this helpful\\" thing.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 follows on the heels of both previous films Iron Man 2 and The Avengers.  A direct sequel to both films, this is a movie that will please fans of the film franchise but will most likely anger fans of the comic book.<br /><br />A little history, before the analysis, if you can bear with me.  Prior to the release of the first film, Iron Man wasn't a particularly known character outside of comic book reader groups, and even inside it was usually considered a B-lister at best.  This all changed after the release of the first movie, at which point Iron Man's popularity skyrocketed as if propelled by his famous repulsor tech.  The character became more important in real life and inside Marvel's comic universe and all its iterations.  Before all this, some non-comic readers knew about the character due to [[ASIN:B0036EH3XO 1994's Iron Man Animated Series]], in which his most prominent foe was the one considered his nemesis in the comics: The Mandarin.<br /><br />The Mandarin, who was a powerful sorcerer in the comics and animated series, had been teased in the previous two films in the franchise, and he finally makes an appereance here, re-imagined as a powerful terrorist leader.  The plot of the film focuses on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as he copes with post traumatic effects after the events on The Avengers, while also having to deal with both the threat of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and the sudden re-appereance of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce), a man who wants to use Stark's resources to improve the human body beyond its capabilities but actually holds a grudge against Tony due to a past experience and doesn't reveal the true capabilities of his formula, codenamed \\"Extremis\\".  In the meantime, girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) also has to deal with Killian, who used to be interested in her, and friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), formerly known as War Machine has had his armor outfitted with a new paint job and re-named Iron Patriot in order to instill a sense of security on the population in a time of terrorist threats and the aftermath of an alien attack.<br /><br />Director Shane Black does a fantastic job with this movie.  Keeping with the tradition of the franchise of humor, cool tech and great action scenes (of which there's no shortage this time around), he tells a tale that advances the story and its characters without compromising the action.  Iron Man's new control-remote armor (which brings memories of Duck Tales' Gizmo Duck) is ridiculously cool.  The new biologically-altered foes pack a punch and are very visually appealing.  A scene with dozens of different Iron Man armors is fantastic and offers some great references to both the comics and the animated series.  As an aside, Iron Man finally gets a theme!  It's a great heroic piece, and I recommend you get the [[ASIN:B00B9JDAYO movie's Soundtrack]] just for it.<br /><br />In the cerebral side of the story, we get to see a pretty hilarious buddy-cop relationship between Tony and a kid, Tony's realization that his past self has brought him more trouble than he could have imagined and his new self has trouble adjusting to a life of responsibility.  RDJ is as great as ever, of course.  Don Cheadle finally finds his footing in the interpretation of James Rhodes, and does a fantastic job.  Guy Pierce's Killian is not a terribly interesting character to begin with, and his story echoes too much The Riddler's from Batman Forever (this analogy is one of the first things that gets noticed the moment the guy shows up on screen at the beginning of the film, though, of course, this character has a more serious tone), but he knows how to be menacing and does bring some terrifyingly realistic villain moments.<br /><br />And then there's the Mandarin.  And here is where the fanbase divides.  Fans of the film who didn't have previous knowledge from the character will have no problem with him.  Fans of the comics are likely to be mad to the point of hating the entire film for it.  I'm trying to be objective, so while I recognize this is a spectacular film, as a comic book fan I find what they did with the Mandarin unforgivable.  You see, I was a fan of the comic since I have memory.  The very first comic book I ever read over 25 years ago was an Iron Man issue in which he faced the Mandarin.  I was fascinated since then and I was excited for his appereance since the release of the first film.  After watching him here I suffered one of the greatest dissapointments in entertainment in my entire life.<br /><br />You see, once word got out that Ben Kingsley was going to play the Mandarin, the fanbase divided (yep, again).  People wanted the Mandarin to be asian which not only it would have made sense considering his origin, but also his name.  I didn't mind much.  Kingsley is a fantastic actor, and considering that in the first film Stark was captured in the Middle East and not in Asia it made sense for the continuity of the franchise.  When the first footage of the Mandarin showed up, the fanbase divided (happens a lot, huh?).  Some people hated it because of the weird voice and looks, while others feared they might do a Nolanesque version and strip the character of his magic power.  I didn't care much, I just wanted to see Iron Man face the Mandarin on the big screen.  Then the movie happened and...<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />It turned out the Mandarin is not real.  He's an invention.  An actor pretending to be a character that doesn't exist to give the press a target, to give the people someone to blame and hate for Killian's crimes.  After that reveal I spent the rest of the film looking for another twist that would either reveal that the guy was lying all along pretending to be a hired nobody and he would show his true power or that they were going to pull a Ra's Al Ghul and show that while Kingsley was a fake the real Mandarin was still in the background.  It didn't happen.  This movie single-handedly destroyed this and all future opportunities for this franchise to represent Iron Man's greatest nemesis.<br /><br />END SPOILER<br /><br />You see, I understand what they were going for.  And it works great for the film.  But there's absolutely no doubt that they could have easily pulled this off with a villain specifically made for this film.  Or maybe a lesser villain that no one cared about.  Or they could have reversed the roles of Killian and the Mandarin (since in the comics Killian was there just for one story arc, while the Mandarin has a long story of facing Iron Man) Picture if The Dark Knight had revealed at the end that the Joker hadn't killed anyone.  All of his victims were actors hired by the Joker's father to please his son, who was an autist.  And it turned out that the main villain of the movie was King Tut.  They could have easily made the same point without defacing Iron Man's greatest villain.<br /><br />On the plus side, Kingsley is clearly having a lot of fun playing the character, and he does a wonderful job with what he has.  But this only makes me think he would have also made a wonderful job if he had something better to work with.<br /><br />So yeah, while I don't think this particular problem kills the movie, it takes one star away for being a slap to the face of the comic fans, who are the entire reason this franchise exists in the first place.  Make no mistake, this is still a great movie, but sadly there's a huge amount of lost potential.w to be menacing and does bring some terrifyingly realistic villain moments.<br /><br />And then there's the Mandarin.

B0079J28NW|5.0|The quality of this Blu-ray is amazing. All the bonus material is very informative and cool. I highly recommend this for any Beatles fan.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|(Spoiler free)<br />Although it doesn't quite surpass The Avengers, Iron Man 3 is perhaps the 2nd greatest movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It takes a new turn for Tony Stark, and the movie's plot has a whole lot of twists and turns along the way. Its not your conventional Iron Man movie, although the key elements (comedy, action, special affects) are still there. Its a must watch for any superhero fan, any marvel fan, and any human with half a brain ;) jk. Seriously tho. Watch it.

B003XREL98|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this read, given that it was written so many decades ago. While the language and prose was sometimes challenging, Forster's insights into colonialism are unbelievably modern and must have been quite radical at the time of publication. If only we could all see these situations like the author, we may live in a far more beautiful world.

0425241505|5.0|So lets start with book 1 of the Elder Races.  I think I'm hooked.  I am an avid reader of all types of romance novels.  Its hard to find one that does not get old in the reading or start running together when you are trying to finish a series, I'm only on book 2 so I'll let you know if that remains true.  I love Larissa Iones Deamonica series because you get a little bit of everything vampires, werewolves, ect....  I have found that again in the Elder Races.  The best way to describe it is take a little bit of witches of east wick, throw in some Charmed, some Harry potter, some hobbit a tiny bit of Twilight, some game of thrones and maybe a dash of spider wick chronicles, Imagine any mythical character you have heard of in books or school or just plain research and you have the Elder Races. But now take all that and times in by infinity and that's how good this series is.<br /><br />In book one we meet Dragos and Pia, he is a strong character that has been around since before the dawn of time and is a mans man.  He is very protective and likes his orders heard, obeyed and not questioned in anyway. Meet Pia she is just as strong willed and has been warned to keep herself protected by her mother since birth.  Now on her own getting mixed up with the wrong people and not knowing exactly what she got herself into she gets pulled into Dragos world, the world she belongs in but has been warned to stay away from.  This is a love story about two strong people who both don't know what they are in for.  Without giving much away or spoiling the story I can say its a love story, a story of a ruler, a story of the outcast, a story of war and a story with a happy ending.<br /><br />I would recommend the Elder Races to anyone who likes paranormal type romance, I love that Thea Harrison not only builds up the two main characters but also builds the other characters in the book from the beginning, you get to meet these other people who work for Dragos and be introduced to their personality and their loyalty to their people.  I love books that build the characters from each book forward and bring them back as the series goes along, you don't just get ok this book is about A and B and then in book 2 you get C and D and then their stories are over. Thea Harrison keeps it going so if you love character A have no fear they will be in book two and three and so on and so on.  I just started book two and cant wait to start three.  I hope this helps guys.

B003XVYLDU|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut has written a classic novel which should be read by any reader interested in American classical novels.  An author who has definite symptoms of PTSD from his youth spent in the Battle of the Bulge as an enlisted man in the 106th Infantry Division who was mauled by the Germans in the Ardennes in 1944.<br /> Vonnegut acts as the narrator in this novel which describes the life and times of Billy Pilgrim, who serves as our main character in describing the bombings of Dresden which is the focus of Vonnegut's book.  The author after being captured by the Germans in late 1944 was sent to a prison camp in Dresden in a slaughterhouse.  In these quarters of the slaughterhouse Vonnegut was a prisoner when the Allies did the fateful bombing destruction of Dresden in 1945.  Vonnegut was forever living with that memory and hence this rather comical piece of a science fiction novel came as a result of this historic event.<br /> The author acts as the narrator who describes the actions of Billy Pilgrim.  In Vonnegut's story telling he interweaves science fiction.  In his use of science fiction, we have Billy Pilgrim as a time traveler who has the ability to enter all phases of his life at will.  This was done by his introduction to the space travelers from Tralfamadore. Vonnegut has Pilgrim going in and out of the time continuum in no particular order.  In this process we learn of the life and times of Billy Pilgrim, and so it goes.  Vonnegut interweaves the actions of the Dresden bombing with his childhood, his actions as a soldier, his married life and his relationship with his postwar friends, his wife and his daughter.<br /> The author states his case as to the mindset of Mr. Pilgrim.  The actions that he survived and subsequently had to deal with are fully described in Vonnegut's stickler epic dissertation of life after the effects of war.  The author presents to us a man who suffers from what we call today as PTSD.  Vonnegut obviously was a man who suffered this rather unfortunate trauma.  The novel represents his cry for help.<br /> As a reviewer I can say that the author's presentation of these facts is indeed classical within the parameters of a written novel.  However as a confirmed student of history the author has erred in describing the death toll of the Dresden Air Raid as being 130,000 people.  In fact Vonnegut alludes to the fact that the death toll in Dresden exceeded the death toll of Hiroshima.  Not true at all!  Vonnegut's writing was classical, but historical mistakes cannot be tolerated.  This book is of 5 Star quality but Vonnegut who was actually there in Dresden when this occurred did not do his due diligence.  Hiroshima had a far greater death toll and was way more catastrophic.  Vonnegut got this entirely wrong, and for that rates only four stars!!rather unfortunate trauma.

184195425X|4.0|I usually don't read books of this caliber but I was shocked how good this ended up being.  I immensely liked the creativity and imaginative of the book and how it presented a Darwin like approach within the storytelling how man (boy in this case) must take on harsh elements, hunger and dangerous animals in order to survive -- all making for a wonderful a castaway story.  Very entertaining read that kept me intrigued till the end.

B00CL68NOG|5.0|Was not happy with the $4.99 rental price that Amazon charged, and debated whether or not to wait for the price to go down, but the movie itself was great. Laughed all the way through this movie. Keep watching during the credits for the outtakes.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|A show that is written well for the time period,  and worth watching, and it has had a bit of everything, love, lies, manipulation, black mail, war, death.  I hope they are able to keep it going
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game! It is a must try! Even though you are only racing from a guard, it is much more amusing to your brain! The game takes you on a world tour! Every month it changes its settings to a diffrent place of the world.You should get it!

B005A1ER0I|5.0|I discovered this album via a YouTube video that used the \\"Immortal\\" track, and it added so much to the video, I had to check out the composer/album, and based on the samples and other reviews, I went ahead and purchased the whole album.  I ended up listening to this over and over for the rest of the afternoon and evening - every track is epic in its own way.  If you enjoy inspirational/moving/driving soundtrack music and are fascinated like I am with how putting different sounds, tones, rhythms, chords, percussion, and vocals can evoke a wide variety of emotions, you MUST get this album.  It's the soundtrack for an epic movie that isn't written, makes you want to produce your own movie, and is great to have on in the background for just about any task you're doing.<br /><br />I would say this music sounds very much like Hans Zimmer's work. Think of soundtracks for movies like Crimson Tide, The Dark Knight, Avatar, and Inception.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to even name my favorites, because every track is fantastic.  Just get them all!

B00003CXB6|5.0|Although the first Jurassic Park movie is the best, I do like the other two.  I am very pleased to now have the whole triligy.  The quality of the DVD itself was also very good.
B005XI94HY|5.0|I have been a fan for a long time and was lucky enough to see these songs performed live. Florence is amazing at painting a picture with her lyrics.  I can't wait to see what future album's bring.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|First of at least two movies to cover The Hobbit. A little boring at first and hard to follow. Some of the scenes are pretty implausible. I enjoyed it none the less.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|This game uses spyware and reads ALL information on your device. Games like this are scum and should be promptly removed from amazon, but you should ALWAYS read the reviews first. You have been warned. Ignore the fake five star reviews.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Pros: Visually stunning; great performances across the board<br /><br />Cons: Pretentious, lack of depth, narrow-minded.  It doesn't promote imagination, it kills imagination.  By the film's logic, we ought to believe in fairy tales because they have a \\"better story\\" than real life.  Pi's story doesn't make you believe in God in any way, instead it attempts to force you to prefer \\"God's story\\". People may choose to believe it but in all seriousness nobody really believes the story with the tiger because it's simply made up.  It's not another perspective or anything because the two stories CANNOT be true at the same time.  It equates religions to stories that help us cope with reality; major diss to religion of all kinds.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Thank you. This book is just what I was looking for. I needed to understand what makes a story compelling.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|i love my little pony but my only problem is that it crashes too much AND it requires you to buy stuff in order to complete the game.
B00B5AIB14|2.0|I have all the other deluxe editions of Marley's albums, and I really looked forward to this one.  The first disc sounds great.  The concert disc is just insulting in terms of sound quality.  It's not unlistenable, but it's like listening to a so-so bootleg.  The performance is really good--it's Bob Marley after all--but not so extraordinary that it excuses the lo-fi audio.  Considering the price, I feel like I've been tricked.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am happy I have this app, but too bad I get absolutely no notifications as I do with other apps on the Kindle.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This app is...Okay the fun of Pac man at your finger tips is cool but there are problems with it. First the controlled are ridiculously confusing I cant tell you have many times I lost a life because of it.<br /><br />  Mystery236
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Yes, I'm very happy to have downloaded this app. I've been using it for my notes instead of an actual notebook. I'm glad because I can PDF my notes or just email them to back them up.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I needed a replacement as I gave my first copy to a friend. This movie is one of my favorites! Arrived on time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't need this app for myself. This app is so helpful to keep my daughter occupied when there is no WiFi available. I DL all of her favorite videos.
B000ID3E9S|3.0|I thought this movie was more for a younger person.  It wasn't a bad movie just wasn't what I expected
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I definitely enjoy playing this one more than the first. I got much further than I did before. It's better.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|There's a simplicity about this book that I really liked. There is a genuine kindness about the key characters that draws you in. This book includes some sad facts from our history but also brings  a hope for the future... I enjoyed the read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app comes in very handy, although I usually use the calculator on my phone since it's always with me :)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like this cable I am glad that I made the purchase.  It works well with the charger and It charges quicker than the charger that I received with the Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've always enjoyed this game. I don't love it, but it's cool and helps when I'm bored if I'm not reading or interested in any of my other apps.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It wasn't long enough, I almost expected it to be longer and perhaps never ending. I wish it had been more interactional, maybe adding some characters or changing scenery or something like that.
B0086700CM|4.0|I've always had fun playing this game, but ever since number two came forget it. I haven't played this one since and forgot to type the review.
0988936402|5.0|As you follow Owen in his quest for greater good and restoring the<br />balance in his world and Everville you are not just watching idly<br />the story unfold in front of you.<br />Owen has a way to make you inherent part of the story. You learn with<br />him and his quest becomes your Odyssey.<br /><br />The world created by Roy Huff is filled with details and novelty.<br />The characters don't only move through the world but evolve and display<br />great personality. There is a very strong line between good and<br />evil and Roy Huff gives you clues through the entire book to help you<br />discover by yourself what happens next.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone willing to undertake a journey to<br />improve themselves following the lessons learned by Owen and his friends.<br />I'm looking forward to the second part.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is great and my mom likes her as well. She requested this CD and got it from me. She was very pleased!
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|This would be a good book for grade school kids.  However we read it in an adult book club and I felt it was too youthful for our group.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I was really looking forward to trying this game app on my Kindle Fire HD. Unfortunately, it didn't work at all :(
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Before auto tunes this was what music was about. A great effort with some classic songs. Alice in Chains isn't the same without Layne. Over all a great package with nice bonus material and good sound.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Without giving away the ending of Season 3, I am hugely disappointed in the ending of season3. If  things progress in the way I expect, I will no longer be a fan of Downton. Hope I am wrong.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to see individual tiles.  Some of the games with many tiles can be small, but that just makes it more of a challenge.  I turn off the sound because I tend to play when I am awake in the middle of the night.  However, the sound is the perfect compliment.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This was a very dark and gritty movie. I didn't think Jennifer could pull it off. BUT BOY DID SHE EVER!!!! Can't wait for &#34;Catching Fire&#34;. I also highly reccomend &#34;The Poker House&#34;
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It shows wrongs can be made right with determination and a plan. Details of a complex situation were easily followed and explained quite clearly.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I have never been big on fantasy but was looking for a book to keep me busy after reading all the Game of Thrones. After sampling a few other fantasy titles and not feeling at all compelled to make a purchase, I stumbled on The Way of Kings. I like to feel connected to the characters in what I am reading and this one really got me curious about each one. I like that it had the right amount of action and drama and left me dangling enough to go right out and find book 2. I was pretty disappointed though to find out it won't be out for another year! I look forward to the next one though and highly recommend this one to anyone.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I recently had the luck of learning about Tesla's name which only proves that history is written by the winners. I liked the style and beautiful message of the work. I also think that the fact that the book starts with the many posibilities about imagination and creative making it more appealling to all. I finished it super fast and I am already giving to my family to read. It reminds me of the video on TED talks that Elizab Gilbert gives called Your elusive creative genius which as this book short, imaginative but most of all : full of hope.
B00003CXDG|5.0|The most artistic film in the MI series. Highly recommend it to everyone . You wont be disappointed. E w
B0097C8XL0|3.0|My 5&amp;6 yr old like this because it is a little bit easier for them to play without constantly falling off the ice.  It is cute they just get frustrated because they aren't allowed to buy any extras
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|After reading the Vince Flynn series and Brad Thor series, I decided to give this one a shot. I am readign the second one now! I highly recommen it to anyone with a military or law enforcement background.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Edge of my seat every episode!!! Can't wait for Season 4.  Best tv show on in my opinion..  Daryl is my favorite!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is well done and impressive for what could have been a rather terrible game. I do enjoy it because of the touch screen features and smooth game play. I would have thought it would have had many glitches but so far it is all good.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Love to play this game to pass my time. I recommend this for all ages be the 1 to 111 its a super cute game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great game could be easy for small kids but still great game need free stuff for suits takes to long for you to earn them
B005F9CPG8|5.0|A gift for our four old grandson. He know and sings along with his Beatles records. Funny , he listens to it on the drive to daycare.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I feel as though the story was crammed into one book when it could have been a series. Although this is a great stand alone book. I want to read more about their life together.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Again, bought this for my 88 yr. old sister. She requested it. She has good taste in music. Loves Mark Knopfler
0062197266|4.0|Excellent story of love turning to abuse and obsession. Vulnerabilities in women and how this happens are right on.  It was tense and powerful.  It will stay with me.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Actually bought this as a gift for my 88 yr. old sister. She loves it. This lady knows her music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book! There was much action! The only thing I didn't like was the cliffhanger at the end. Can't wait to read the next book Mockingjay!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the drama and mystery! Cannot wait to read the third one. The characters are amazing as is the story line.
0525425764|5.0|My son loved this one as much as the first two books in this series!<br />For sure recommend for 5th/6th graders.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|pretty cool... u have to get used to it other. than tht its cool like me lol!!! little hard but gets easier along the way!
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|Well it took me a few minutes to understand this game but it gives you a tutorial. Once I figured it out I was Hooked... This game is challenging and fun and very unique. There's no other game like it on here. So it is well worth the $1.99  I spent on it and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I am now. I takes you on a journey to buy paintings and sell paintings and you can attend an auction. It really is a great game. You can purchase your own gallery. It's a really neat game. So to anyone that is looking for a fun game that is different from everyone else's this is the game for you.<br />BID ON...LOL.
0307949486|5.0|I wasn't exited of the idea of reading a book as long as this, I prefer short stories. But this book, it was well worth it. I enjoyed every page and wanted more when i reached the last one [[ASIN:B00CJ2BR6S Kings of Awakening Vampires and Purebloods]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game! Its fun for older kids and littler kids too. It never gets old. I can play this game for hours! I love how there's always new updates comming out so the game isn't boring and the same.
0307454568|4.0|I was upset to find out this was the last book, but boy was it worth every page and second. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone [[ASIN:B00CJ2BR6S Kings of Awakening Vampires and Purebloods]]
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Layers if reading enjoyment:<br />Character development, humor, tragedy, adventure.<br />Also, intense stimulant for reflection on God, relationships, grief. Creative parallel of animal and human life
0061478784|4.0|I saw the movie and I knew I had to read the book as well [[ASIN:B00CJ2BR6S Kings of Awakening Vampires and Purebloods]]
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Perfect product
0439023521|4.0|Loved every minute of it! The movie doesn't do it justice, trust me. It's hard to adapt a book into a movie perfectly, but they did a good job compare to other movies who adapt from books.  [[ASIN:B00CJ2BR6S Kings of Awakening Vampires and Purebloods]]
1250010403|5.0|Archer is a master in intrigue.  A fascinating plot and intricate story line.  Exceptional characterization of major individuals--they were real and admirable.
0307269981|4.0|I didn't think it would be even close to be as good as the first, but the author proved me wrong. I love the whole series [[ASIN:B00CJ2BR6S Kings of Awakening Vampires and Purebloods]]
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I really hope that the 13 reality (also by James Dashner)  is just as good as this book but this book has a really sad ending
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Downloaded to the kindle.  It was fun watching the kids crowd around to see the movie.  Overall it is an absolutely great movie.  If you've never seen it, definitely watch it. Even though you are an adult, you can still be a kid at heart.
1605065684|2.0|With silly typos and punctuation errors on nearly every page it becomes difficult to enjoy the read. Especially when the publisher's mission statement is about preserving the original texts of classics this kind of sloppiness is disheartening. Forgotten Books needs to remember to proofread.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I downloaded this to my kindle. I had trouble playing it but my 9 year old loves it.  Graphics aren't too bad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest! my newest addiction. its full of wonderful things and very creative ideas! I'm always finding new things every day.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Misremembered man is a quick read,I grew to love the characters and the setting. Was very surprised at the ending. In all a very interesting story
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was interesting. I like how interactive the puzzles were. The graphics were great. Story line was a little cheesy, but I hope they make a sequel. I'd buy it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An easy read.  I loved all the details of how our military works and the dedication it takes to become a Seal!  As I was reading it, I kept thinking how proud I was to be an American!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This review is late, and for good reason.  This was the third mouse I bought within 4 months, so I had to make sure this was good for me before reviewing.  I originally had an OCZ Behemoth, and even though the electronics were junk on that, the form and grip of the mouse was comfortable and just worked out excellent for me.  Since then I have been looking for a similar feel, and this comes close enough.  My hand doesn't hurt after gaming with this for hours on end..hah.  I love the extra buttons and use them more than I originally thought I would.  I used the software once to set up DPI and colors and button assignments, backed up the profile I just made, and haven't had to use the software again.  It put an autostart entry on your computer, but you don't need to have it running.  So I did MSCONFIG and took it out of startup, and have been using the mouse with all my customizations ever since.  About a week after I bought it, I got an email from a Customer Service rep at Anker, asking me how things were going and said if I had problems, that she was there.  I actually couldn't believe that...Proactive customer service?!  I haven't needed any help or support, but that was really cool to know they were right there if I did.  Excellent buy and only had to buy 2 others before finding this one.  Very happy, excellent mouse.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This blu ray release is perfect! The sound is incredible and the picture is amazing! The night scenes are clear and the underwater shots are pristine! Whenever you buy an older movie on blu ray its risky some don't look to good but this one you want to add to your collection! The story is just as powerful as it was on its original release, the acting brilliant and the shark attack scenes are still horrifying! Get this blu ray, watch it in surround sound and have your popcorn ready!
B004QL7K6G|1.0|Absolutely huge waste of time. So tired of good actors making trashy, stupid films. I stopped watching half way through. Would not recommend to my worst enemy. Don't waste your time.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|fun for young children.  I use it for an incentive in my kindergarten classroom.  Don't forget that stylus work is better than finger work
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Just when you think it can't get any better..... it does. Every episode has new twists and turns. Boring??? Not this series.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is the best of the city builder type!  You can buy pearls ( the gold or premium currency) for the game but if you conceive the ones given you won't need them!  My new favorite way to waste time!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Just keeps getting better and better. Starting to lose sleep now because I can't shut it off... Have ordered the fake I.D's and &#34;tools&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this wonderful horse game.I get to experience the adventures that my horse goes through.I would definitely recommend this app to all people who have an electronic device.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I have to warn you....... You will become so TOTALLY ADDICTED to this series it should have a warning label on every season! (LOL)<br />A definite must buy!! oNE OF THE BEST SERIES OF ALL TIME!
B008MM9630|3.0|The girls look inappropriate for kids. The gems don't get you much then you have spend money for only a few crystals or coins. I freezes way too much
B000R7GKQE|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better. Couldn't ask for a better series to get addicted to. It's a constant &#34;Supernatural&#34; marathon around this household. I'm afraid my DVD won't be able to stand the strain. (LOL)<br />If you love Si-Fi this is a definite MUST HAVE collection in your movies. I have ordered all of the seasons and wish there were more than eight.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this as a recommendation from a friend. Much better than the movie. It explains parts of the movie that didn't make sense.
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I wasn't a big fan of theirs when they were kids, but now that they are older and their sound has changed,they have sort of won me over.  Before I bought their CD, I saw them on the Today Show and was impressed enough to spend my money on their CD.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book, though slow to establish the plot, will keep you riveted. One cannot imagine the ending, which seems to come to fruition on multiple occasions. A true emotional roller coaster that makes it difficult to put down.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Huge Veronica Mars fan.  Great character stories.  The intertwining stories compel you to continue watching.  You want to know what happens next to the characters.
1423136802|5.0|My daughter loves both fantasy and Greek mythology and she absolutely devoured these books.  She has also started reading some of the author's other book series and has enjoyed them immensely as well.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Enjoyed the entire series especially the conclusion of the series.  I finally found a lot of answers to the questions of what had happened in season 1.
0553801473|2.0|After waiting 6 years for this book to come out I was sorely disappointed. Hopefully the author's many distractions (conventions, appearances, tv series, etc.) is not the reason behind the decrease in writing quality. The story never seemed to get off the ground and to me it seemed like a cheap writer's trick to hold the \\"big payoff\\" for the end of the book. A trick I would've thought George Martin was above.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I loved the series and wanted to be able to watch it in chronological order.  The part of Veronica Mars was made for Kristen Bell or maybe Kristen made the role hers.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I've loved Bring Me The Horizon for as long as I can remember. This album is a masterpiece, no more, no less. Every single song is magnificent. I would recommend this brilliant record to anyone who is a fan of great music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my favorite game! If u like temple run u'll love subway suffer. And u can conect it to facebook!!!!!! And no Sufi is needed to play this!!! This truly is a awesome game!<3
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Interesting, well written and tender.  Good reading for just anyone.  It kept my attention till the end since it does not describe what he had done prior to the mental institution.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is wicked awesome with the giant animated fighting robots!I love this game so much!Especially now that there are more robots than before. Like axelrod or danger zone the very newest bots on the game!It's also cheap!GET IT NOW BEFORE ANOTHER UPDATE HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B009MYAQK4|3.0|the information on finding the manuscripts in Hamra Dorn in Upper Egypt was very interesting but, the description of what the verses mean was too philosophical for me.  I just like Paulo Coelho and I have read most of his books but, I was disappointed with this one.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Well, I've been hoping for a new Angry Birds game for some time, and am terribly disappointed that this one requires you to be part of the Facebook crowd. Sorry, Rovio, I will not be adding this one to my device. One star because I can't give it a big fat ZERO.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|its the same thing over and over again, I'm glad I didn't have to spend any money on this because I was greatly disappointed
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Really loved this book. This is the second book by this author I have read. Will be reading more. has been highly recommended
B00940XIGU|5.0|I love the remixes of all the songs!  I was dancing all around the room the first time I listened to it, and I still am!
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Loved the suspense of this story and did not expect the ending. This book came highly recommended by a book club.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|If you're looking for a game that will challenge you mentally then you've found it. Under the guise of such games like Bejewel you are challenged<br /> to find 3 or more matching icons to either unlock or clear away the colored blocks. If ever you become stuck in a situation you have different power ups to help you. In turn you will be playing for hours on end and the ultimate end result is helping a village rebuild.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game freezes constantly especially in the Daily Free Tournament option.  It is so annoying to not get your points and prizes when you get bingo because it freezes and loses everything.
B001TAM3DW|5.0|First a few words about this edition as it now appears to be collectible based on the price of ones in fine condition.<br /><br />This was the edition of Clarke's famous novel that I bought and reread in the 70s. It was a book club edition that must have been remaindered when I bought it as the publication date says 1953 but I got it as part of a science fiction book club offer in the 70s sometime, after first reading the novel in the mid-60s. I liked the larger print compared to the paperback edition I had read some years earlier and it was also hardbound with a decent binding compared to the glued bindings in paperbacks which don't want to lie flat and are susceptible to cracking. The page registration was a little off because I think the page blocks were cut before being sewn into the signatures for the binding, but it was still okay. This wasn't meant to be a fine limited edition after all. It was printed with a serifed font, possibly New Century Schoolbook or something similar which I prefer to the modern non-serifed fonts like Helvetica or Verdana which have become so common these days. So if you're looking for a quality edition of the book this one is pretty good despite its age (the pages had darkened somewhat with age but not too much).<br /><br />Getting on to the actual story, this would probably be my pick for the #1 Sci-Fi novel. It would certainly be in my top 10 list, which would include books like Dune, Starship Troopers, The Forever War, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Uplift War, and so on.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Spoiler alert!!!>><br /><br />In this captivating and poignant tale, the human race comes to a bittersweet ending by evolving into a strange, communal intelligence with super-human psychic and psychokinetic powers, thereby leaving the limitations of isolated corporeal minds behind. The Overlords, who have reached the pinnacle of \\"individual\\" evolution, and whose minds are perhaps a hundred times more powerful than a human's, are memorable characters. Although the Overlords as individuals are intellectually far superior to humans, they are unable to transform to this final stage of a collective super-mind as humans are. As a result the Overlords in the end serve the Overmind, as it's called, which will now include the former human race.<br /><br />Some have complained that the rocket science is now somewhat dated but one must remember that this was more than 15 years before the Apollo moon landing and no country on earth as yet had satellite technology let alone a moon landing program. And the discussion of the rocket program is over after the first chapter or two in the book, so that shouldn't deter you from reading it as the tale of what happens to mankind after contact with the Overlords is the real story and one of the most moving and dramatic in all of science fiction.<br /><br />If you only read one Sci-Fi book, this should be it.<br /><br />I have to mention that some years ago I was contacted by the webmaster of Matt Groening's (famous as the creator of The Simpsons and Futurama) webpage.  Groening, who is a big SF fan, lists his favorite sci-fi novels there, and they liked my Amazon review the best, and wanted permission to post my review there, which I was happy to do as I'm a big fan of Groening and the show..

B005S9EKCW|5.0|great movie I really enjoyed it, and I think Russell Crow did a pretty good Javier all the other characters were simply amazing
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I used to use this product a lot for scrubbing through videos I was editing in After Effects and Vegas and such. I thought it would help a lot more but my found that constantly taking my hand off the keyboard to scrub got sorta annoying. But other than that FANTASTIC.
B0036T31YY|4.0|Since 1975 there have been over 1,000 unexplained disappearances of major aircraft, ships and smaller boast crafts. A quick Google search confirms that as early as 1609 ships began to disappear, never to be found again.<br /><br />Numerous theories abound, but the phenomena remains to this day unexplained. And so is the story of \\"Triangle\\" . Talk about a sleeper, this little Independent film, is smart, crackling an makes you think - as it poses more questions then provides answers.<br /><br />There's a unique spin to this film, that reels you in an keeps you're attention.<br /><br />Director  Christopher Smith doesn't dumb down the audience, we know this particular ship is within the parameters of the Bermuda Triangle - to both his credit and that of the script there are no lines such as \\"Oh look, we're in the Bermuda Triangle!\\"  In fact aside from the title it's not mentioned at all.<br /><br />Well written dialogue complements a stellar cast. The lead character  Jess played by Melissa George - turns an excellent performance as the lone survivor, or is she?<br /><br />Where the film breaks down are periods of drag, and a sense of predictability that at times is palatable. That said \\"Triangle\\" is creepy enough and the unexpected twist at the end more than makes up for what flaws the film has.<br /><br />Recommended
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I normally read reviews before I rent a movie and wish I had done so with this one. It was on a \\"New and Noteworthy\\" list so I just went for it. I've never written a review about a movie before but if I can prevent one person from wasting 2 hours of their life by not watching this movie, I will feel like my 2 hours was not entirely in vain. Please spare yourself; this movie is dreadful!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a fabulous book for at risk kids and anyone else for that matter.  It is easily team taught language/government and creates all kinds of opportunities for talking about risk taking, relationships, government, women's roles, writing techniques, dystopian worlds, and the role of family.  There are very few books where young people can see how opportunity can come from what seems to be a tragedy.  For example, the death of Katniss's father makes her have to take on an adult role at an early age creating someone who could become a winner in the Hunger Games.  The movie and its discrepancies only add to the opportunities for discussion.  Adult themes but what young person at risk is not living a life of adult themes and hungering (pun intended) for hope?
B000FA675C|3.0|It is a good book and I enjoyed it reading till the almost very end. At the end, it kind of lost it power over me.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|My husband and I were looking for movies to watch together.  This one was new to me but we tried it and really enjoyed it.  Humorous but touching.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I give this book 4 stars for its unique way of story telling and the fact that I did not have the end right.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I liked the combo because people are always borrowing movies from me and I don't like being without a copy.  This way I can lend out the DVD version and keep the Blue-ray for myself.<br />The special features were nice as there was some information there that was not in the HBO Series or the books, so it helped round out the picture of this setting.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|An unexpected, wonderful story with rich, broken, lovable characters. I'm now looking forward to the movie.  Love the enthusiasm for football lacing the men together.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I liked the combo because people are always borrowing movies from me and I don't like being without a copy.  This way I can lend out the DVD version and keep the Blue-ray for myself.<br />The special features were nice as there was some information there that was not in the HBO Series or the books, so it helped round out the picture of this setting.  I was surprised that after reading all the books that were currently out, that there was any new information in the special features.  The interactive maps were a bonus as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Thought this was a great read.  It was familiar enough not to alienate the reader, and original enough to intrigue the reader. Great ending to the first book!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Very good quality. Thank you very much. I am enjoying watching the DVD'S. Very good DVD's.<br />Enjoy watching Dr Who. Again Thanks.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I was a bit concerned when the DVD's stsrd and they seemed to have been opened but they all played perfectly fine. I was however somewhat unhappy when I realized that it was going to take nearly two (2) for weeks.  Amazon has made the process of ordering quite some and enjoyable.  I will definitely order online with Amazon again and again.<br />Linda Lundgren
B004GJYRKA|5.0|It's Bruce Lee. Classic.  Great fight scenes. Great movie, well worth the money and I enjoy watching it over and over again.
B00321MGPG|5.0|Vibrate videography with breathtaking angles. The aerial shots are just amazing. Really opened my eyes to what an amazing world we truly live in. Great series.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie is an amazing author! I will always recommend her. There's not one book she wrote that I haven't read.
B00005ONMP|3.0|These disks vary too much in volume so that one hears the music too loudly or not at all.  It is hard to find optimum volume
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|it was the most poupuler hicock films its my most favoret film of all because its where birds attack the students at the school in in the movie
0385336691|5.0|I have just recently discovered Lee Child as an author.  I am finding his books to be very hard to put down before I finish.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|my favorite part on the movie was the plant gets shocked at the end and before it blows up it says a bad word.
B001I0T92Q|3.0|For the price, what do you expect. But I thought the plastic thickness would at least be able to stand up to being slid in and out of a SD Card reader repeatedly. Boy was I wrong. it ended up cracking & I had to use scotch tape to hold it together. It still works though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a free great app my kids love it and so do i I wish they would have not characters though
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|An excellent film, one of the best ever, hands down. However, I recommend reading the book after watching the first time. Then watch the film again, and you will pick up on a lot more!
B004GHYCKW|2.0|To start, I'd like to say that this album's worst offense is how weak it ease.  Its just has no impact, just a lot of whining.  In fact, I think PJ was channeling Yoko Ono on this one.  Another issue is that PJ does not sound like PJ.  She's singing a whole octave higher than how she used to.  Gone is the guttural, fierceness that PJ fans love so much.<br /><br />I'm fairly certain I would have disliked this album regardless, but if she had released it under a different name (Polly or Jane Harvey, etc.) then it wouldn't feel like such a sucker punch.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Loved the information and the care taken in presenting a full picture. But seems threatened by anyone who might recommend something different. Not all trainers who disagree with the author can be out of shape.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Simple and uncomplicated and it works. Highly recommend the diet as explained and detailed in this book. Backed up by solid research.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read.  It starts off seemingly predictable but then takes off and surprises you at every turn.  College Hoover is now one of my favorite writers!
B00BXJZ07A|5.0|Honestly I like the sound here better than their 80s output.  They sound like they know what they want and they will put it out regardless of aiming for how they think people think they should sound.  Great songs (Me & The Lord Blues, Princess and yes Chicks, Man... among others).  Neil Young cover is also a nice touch.
B000MCIBB6|3.0|good cd l like the songs in it and hear it when i want to hear it  when i can
0802473156|5.0|Boyfriend and I read this on vacation, good book. Got a bit repetitive, but was an easy, enjoyable read. Very sweet message that is fun to learn about.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Great read can't wait to start the next one ! Looking forward to reading them all. I'm downloading them now.
B001DF68MA|4.0|The seat is a bit smaller than I expected and you need to make sure you have the right bike.  I needed to lower my seat for ease of exiting and raise my handlebars so his head wasn't hitting my chest.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|keeps good time ,no need for battery,  second seiko watch,  first one ran good with lots of work vibrations  -sawsall ,hammer eccetera till I nicked the face with a small power saw ,good for me- bad for the watch . This one runs fine but hard to set date.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Very impressive album, even more than his last one, which was a mighty fine recording. This time around Trombone Shorty surrounds himself with an all-star lineup of musicians and singers, including Lenny Kravitz, The Rebirth Brass Band, Jeff Beck, and Warren Haynes. And yet, with all these cooks in the musical kitchen, mixing various genres, it doesn't dilute the soup. Tasty indeed! This album is nothing short of delightful.<br /><br />One reason why this album is so memorable is the strength of the songs themselves. Trombone Shorty and friends are not simply jamming and showing off their musical chops; they have high quality compositions to back them up. And of course these tasty tunes are enhanced by the incredible musicianship on display. Whether the tunes have vocals or are instrumentals, they flow, they rock, they roll, they thump, they sizzle; crossing several musical boundaries to create a heady mix. Who cares how you classify this music; it's just fun, addictive stuff.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Hopkins performance as Hitchcock was impressive and convincing.<br /><br />As someone who has read much about Hitchcock, the history of the film Psycho, and Ed Gein, this film only lightly scratched the surface and left me very unsatisfied.  The treatment of this bio did an injustice to viewers with less knowledge because it didn't delve into a lot of relevant and interesting information.<br /><br />At times the film dragged and I found myself losing interest.<br /><br />I was puzzled as to why Hitchcock's daughter was never mentioned considering she was featured in Psycho (the other secretary that worked with Marion).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Entertaining and is always fun to play with and always has new update and special deals. Fun for all ages.
0553382179|1.0|The author immediately alienates the reader by stating, \\"A few years ago I hit bottom and, friends, let me tell you there is no place lower than where I was.\\"  For people who suffer from serious lifelong disabilities, the last thing they want to hear is how someone had it worse than them.  Self-help books should offer a sense of community rather than a categorization or assumption of how low someone's bottom is.<br /><br />Another complaint I have with this book is that the author is self-aggrandizing and promotes her \\"unique method\\" throughout her entire book.  Each chapter has \\"Dear FlyLady\\" testimonials from so-called successful \\"followers\\" who boast about how well her method works.  The book reads more as an endorsement of a collection of ideas rather than ideas themselves.<br /><br />The author is often insulting making assumptive or judgmental statements.  One example implies that people who shop at yard sales are basically belittling themselves; hence lowering their self-esteem and self-worth.  She obviously doesn't understand the difference between bargain shopping and true collecting.  Though I can certainly understand the point about limiting such activities to control clutter.<br /><br />Finally, very few of the techniques the \\"FlyLady\\" offers in her book are original.  Most of these ideas have been offered in cognitive therapy for years.  She admits in several places in her book that her ideas have been \\"adapted.\\"  For example, she has a \\"27 Fling Boogie\\" which involves getting rid of 27 items.  The idea was originally Suze Ormans; however, Ormans idea had 25 items.  The \\"FlyLady\\" takes the ideas of others, adapts them slightly, creates some cutsie terms and acronyms to legitimize her system.  Cilley argues that anyone can be a \\"FlyLady\\" and she wasn't kidding.  One does not have to read this book to \\"discover the secrets that have changed the lives of more than half a million families\\"
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not only does the app tell you the time you have remaining on your battery by usage types (I.e. movie watching, playing games, etc.) but you can also look at a chart of your usage by hour, day, etc.
B0090EIILU|2.0|Ok,  I realize this is a Sacha Baron Cohen movie and I should expect crude humor.  However, I draw the line at the horrific.  There is nothing funny about the casual discussion of raping boys or implements of rectal and genital torture.<br /><br />The idea that a terrorist would be so ineffective that all of his assassinated foes are alive in the U.S. is a hilarious premise and the only reason I didn't give this one star.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game!! I always wanted a horse and with this game I feel like I have one. You treat this horse like you would treat a real horse. :-)
1439152802|2.0|This book is so boring!  Geesh, I have about 50 pages left and have to make myself finish.  It puts me right to sleep.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Funny movie with some of the original characters and few more of their friends.  I hope they come out with another.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|very fun.  not very challenging but it is fun enough that the difficulty doesn not matter. I definitely recommend this game.
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|I am not a big Mathew fan.  He was crazy and Bad &#34;A&#34; in this movie.  Kind of creepy situations, but still a good movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I would have given this game 5 stars but it gets frustrating when you play and have guarenteed bingos and they just get wasted, and in the daily tournaments you get no coins for points. But despite the frustration, I love this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything you could want in a Dystopian novel and more. You will not be disappointing on this purchase, well maybe the wait for all three moves to come out after reading the books. :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl's description of her life changing adventure is proof that anyone can be strong beyond belief. Very well written, letting you be so into the story that you're there with her.<br />I recommend this book to all who wants an adventure.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book too hard to put down is an understatement.  This is a book which may or may not have started with love; but, ended with complete control...a must read!
B00132S74A|5.0|His books are always very entertaining.  Really kept my interest.  I would recommend it to everyone.  I liked all the characters.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This was an awesome movie. Lots of action and can't wait for the next one to be out on dvd.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|A little slow at the beginning.  Had to wonder where Mr. Archer was taking us, then wow.  Really enjoy his game into investing of money.  Always so interesting.  Loved it.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Good graphics, fun game play but expensive compared to alawar and big fish games. I expected a much longer game for the additional cost and was disappointed that it wasn't anything more than provided with the other developers.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I think this book had a lot more potential.  Although I enjoyed it for the most part, I thought it was missing something.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I hate when you like a certain song and when you buy the CD, that's the only good song on it.  That is not the case in this instance.  The song that is played on the radio is definitely the best.  However, the other songs are in that vein and are very enjoyable.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I bought this for a rocking deal of $29.99 (more expensive now, unfortunately). I'll spare you what I think about the actual film, because this isn't the place for that. If you like the trilogy, then this set is sleek, sexy, and a great addition to your Hugo-Weaving-Was-In-Every-Epic-Blockbuster-Film-In-The-Last-Decade collection.
B000GGSM94|5.0|I love this album, it has great songs, great energy. It also has very good reviews (5 or 10 stars). This album is from 1987, but I don´t think it sounds &#34;80´s&#34; adn that´s a good thing...timeless haha.<br />This deluxe edition comes with the original album remastered plus a CD of rarities, and also, the packaging is very beautiful and comes with a very nice booklet.<br />All in all, I think it´s a nice set, a great album and it´s worth the money.<br /><br />The shipping and packaging were OK.
B003SI05PG|5.0|One of the best animated films out there, and who doesn't love being able to watch it for both Halloween AND Christmas?
B000002H70|5.0|This is a great album, you´ll find that it has been highly rated (5 or 10 stars) and it totally deserves it. It has a great atmosphere, and I think even if you´re not a fan of The Cure, but you like music, this album could work for you.<br /><br />The shipping and packaging was OK.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|You get to play doctor and treat patients! Awesome. The patients come to your hospital, you let them take a seat in the waiting area, you put them in a room, in a bed and treat them. So much fun my child and I take turns playing. For example, she picks germs out of the teeth and I get to brush them. etc. I think it's pretty cute and she likes it so five stars! Great for little ones: mine is two in a half-ish. The only thing I guess I don't like is one &#34;treatment&#34; is just taking blood pressure ( I get to do that one too. lol).
B00005QW5X|5.0|I don´t like musicals, but this is something else,,,Hedwig is a really funny movie, and of course a bit sad too. But it´s great, John Cameron Mitchell made a terrific work as so did the rest of the team. I really think it´s a great movie!<br />The DVD comes with bonus material, the making of the film by John Cameron Mitchell, it´s really good material, about 80 mins long. I enjoy it very much.<br /><br />The shipping was OK and the packaging too, no problems.
B00992CF6W|5.0|DUDE! This game is AMAZING! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! awesome! Cool sweet superfragicalalisticexpealadocious!(breath) how do ya like that! so nice.  awsome
B000007UXS|5.0|I think this is one of my favorite Radiohead albums,,,probably number 1. I think it´s a really well played well written well everything album, the songs are strong and with lots of energy. That´s why I bought the vinyl, it´s even better!<br /><br />The shipping and packaging were OK, no problems.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw the movie on the day it was released for general circulation and bought the Blue Ray Disc set as soon as it became available. I've seen it three times in total and this speaks volumes for the quality of the movie. The acting is superb, the plot excellent and the script amusing. This is a benchmark for movies of a similar genre and sets a very high standard. It benefits from being viewed on the big screen but a good home cinema set up will not leave the viewer wanting. This is a great Movie and arguably the best Bond Movie ever.
B0013D8JAQ|5.0|Well this is another good album by TJAMC, although it has not as good reviews as its predecessors. This album was released on 1989, and you´ve probably heard the song &#34;Head On&#34;.<br /><br />The shipping was OK, and the CD arrived in perfect conditions.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Rented this and had to admit I enjoyed watching this as much as my nieces. Great family movie. Don't forget the popcorn.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It serves it's purpose...good alarm clock. Not really sure what I can say about it, if you need a good alarm clock for free, this is it...especially if you lost your phone and need to get up at a specific time the next day like I did...Haha!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I do like this application much better on my kindle than on my Iphone. I don't have children but do a lot of home renovating & love the ideas that I've found & images I can view. The app could suit many needs I'm 30 & enjoy it & mother is 56 & also enjoys the app.
B005651QBG|5.0|My 12 daughter and read this book together, we both loved it. Rebecca Stead has really grasped what's important in the life of a 12 year old girl and how she sees her world. It's an engaging book right from the start even though you read it and think what is it about and where is it headed? The end is surprising and suddenly it all makes sense. We found it a refreshing read, I haven't come across anything quite like it before so it is certainly sticks in your mind. There is a real depth to this book and I highly recommend it to children and adults alike.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|Buy it. When you drop your phone, as you eventually will, this heavy duty beauty will save it. Every time.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A little slow in the beginning but it was a page<br />turner. I will recommend this to everyone who likes a good story.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I never heard of him before but I previewed the CD.Then I realized alot of the songs on the CD I heard before and love them.  This CD is truly Jazz meets hip hop and they are in love!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun game where you fawn actually earn all the types of currency so you don't have to spend money if you don't want to.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I've been playing this game for months and I can't get enough. Even at the age of 21 haha. So fun.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Bradley Cooper continues to amaze me as an actor, and to prove that he is much more than just a pretty face. And Jennifer Lawrence is sly and funny and at times some of the things that come out of her mouth tend to be shocking. This is a very different kind of movie and well worth seeing.I think both of these actors will be around for very long time.<br />This movie is hard to describe. Bi-polarism is not a laughing matter, but Bradley Cooper's performance gives in insight into the co.ndition and shows some of the struggle patients can have trying to cope
B00992CF6W|5.0|For those who like minecraft on the Xbox or pc your going love this, it is addictive, and you can do many things and mods, maps and texture packs you can add to it I really recommend this game.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I had read all the advance hoop-la about this movie and wondered how it could possibly live up to expectations. I was blown away!<br />Even on the second viewing the suspense was enough to make you chew your nails. So glad it won &#34;Best Picture&#34; Oscar and I think Ben Affleck should have won &#34;Best Director!&#34;<br />I have and will continue to recommend it to everyone.
1601251505|5.0|Anyone thinking of buying 4edition D & D should go with pathfinder. This game is great, well worth it. I have been running a game for a while now and I am loving it. Looking forward to every session. I would say that it is rules heavy, and the size of the codex makes it difficult to look through and find what you need so learn the basics before you run a session or you'll hold up the immersive game play. Happy gaming ;)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works great for me. I especially like the large numbers. Easy to use when I have my Kindle with me.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Twenty words to say dont waste your time on this boring fantasy. Read something by Sandford, Le Caree, or Thomas Perry and improve your mind
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I am sure that life was that way then, it was well written and I didn't,t want to put it down.
B000IZAHB4|4.0|I saw this when it first came out in theaters. It was scary then. My second viewing allowed for style points in projecting what &#34;pure evil&#34; might look like. I noticed that Eileen Brennan had a role shared with about 200 cats. Fun stuff!!
B004VFK5LO|5.0|Love this movie! Great actors and really great plot line! Suspenseful thriller with fantastic acting. Helen Hunt and Sigorney Weever did a wonderful job a portraying two powerhouse female role
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This is first of all a Tarentino film so it is violent, quirky and intelligent. The actors and actresses did an exemplary job and the story was well told, dark, but well told. The dynamics between the powerful and powerless was very interesting.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Not only is this book really well-written (I can visualize these characters as if I've known them my whole life), Sanderson has come up with such different plot twists that are unexpected and amazing. I plan to download the third book as soon as I finish this one. These books would make a great movie!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Gorgeous sets and costumes, interesting scripts, fantastic acting. A little gratuitous sex and corrupt politicians for spice and you've got the Tudors.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beautifully written.  I was on the edge of my seat wanting more from chapter to chapter.  The author has a very generous imagination that's poetically justified.  I have been entertained. - Taria
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved this movie and when I was able to get it at the pre-sale price, I was one happy camper. Arrived on day of release.
B00371XIJE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was a heart-tugging, emotional story, but I am glad I saw it.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|This was a great book. I'm really enjoying the Stephanie Plum books. They're both funny and have some mystery. I started with #1 and I'm now on #15.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  I love movies and it is very hard to find decent ones these days.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I honestly hate movies like this, but my husband made a deal with me if I watched it I would get an hour back rub and let's just say I got to watch a very good movie it was very thrilling!! I do not regret watching it! I did not expect to like it either but very worth watching!!!
B00CL68NOG|2.0|thought it would have more humor. Too slow and choppy humor.Was let down from the previews. Had some good moments--- the ending.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I love movies that show the kids to be smarter than the adults. I love most everything by Wes Anderson, who always seems to find a scenario that delights and make one think. How he comes up with these ideas is a wonder, and he never fails to amuse. (The Oscar nom for screenplay attests to that.)<br /><br />The use of color, and that little element of fantasy is something I always look forward to in a Wes Anderson film. The BluRay does not disappoint. Glad to have it to watch after a disappointing day. A true upper for the senses.
B000I9S64U|4.0|It helps to have read the book, but it's entertaining nonetheless...similar to &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34;. Not for the occasional sci-fi fan.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Awesome- Grisham  spins you a story and just when you are wrapped up in it like your favorite blanket- he pulls it away to reveal layers you were not expecting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's one of the best games in the world but next up date they should actually have a rill nether portal. Oh and buckets
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so much fun! my brothers love it and its definitely worth seven bucks. GET IT NOW BEFORE IT DOESNT EXIST ANYMORE!
0810989956|5.0|It is awesome I would like to get the whole serious but there to expensive you guys should lower the prices
B004FQX59I|5.0|This is a classic story of the Kennedy assassination that is a must see. It is based on Jim Mars book Crossfire.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This just wasn't the type of games I'm in to. Not a bad game if your into this kind of game
B00003CXBK|5.0|this anime is fantastic if you get a chance to watch it then do as it is indefinably worth a watch.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a short, simple and profound book that will inspire everyone who reads it.  I intend to recommend it regularly.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|the case is good but after using it for a little bit (6-8 months) it turned yellow. I have heard about this problem from other reviews as well. But, still a good case for the price.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|And that was Honest Abe's favorite way to launch into one. I think he would have gotten a real kick out of this movie.<br /><br />I truly expected this film to be terrible; after all, the premise is absolutely ridiculous. After a while, though, I found myself able to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. Why not a superhero President, after all? Especially the greatest of all our Presidents?<br /><br />Young Abraham Lincoln, rail-splitter, flatboatman, lawyer, and political aspirant, has a deep dark secret: He's a Fearless Vampire Hunter armed with a silver bladed axe which he handles like a nunchuk, and when he's not splitting rails he's splitting vampires, who seem to be a plague on the frontier.<br /><br />Actually, they're a plague everywhere, especially in the South, where they've set up their own secret Vampire Empire (Vempire?), feeding off the slave population for generations. Tired of living in the shadows, the vampire hordes decide to set up their own country, and Abe Lincoln must lead an army to conquer them before they destroy every mortal below the Mason-Dixon Line, ultimately moving North in search of victims. And mortals call it \\"the Civil War.\\"<br /><br />So, in sum, the film's message is that the Confederacy is a nation full of murderous bloodsuckers. It's an interesting twist on history (and the history in ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is pretty twisted, so kids, don't do a book report on it), and, oddly enough for a film of this type, a direct political statement on human rights.<br /><br />It's very clear that this movie wouldn't do well on Stone Mountain, Georgia, but if you just like fast-moving action and good special effects, and excellent cinematography (the film has a definite tintype feel to it), then sit back and go for a wild ride. Just don't mistake this for [[ASIN:B00C1BU7V8 Lincoln]] with Daniel-Day Lewis.<br /><br />A one star reviewer asked, \\"What's next? ALBERT EINSTEIN VS. THE ZOMBIES?\\"  Hey, thanks! I'm already on page 6 of my latest screenplay.screenplay.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Been using the G930 for over a year now.  The range and battery life is impressive and it recharges very quickly.  The included USB recharging base is a major added bonus due to how versatile it is.  The software has many advanced options including a ten band equalizer.  This headset is solid, reliable and sounds amazing.  Excellent purchase.
B0026O475M|5.0|This is a great movie....an adventure story, but more. A lot of good moments. The theme music will stay with you.  I liked the ending which was a bit hard to figure out.  I credit Fred Smith of FedEx for allowing a FedEx plane crash to figure in the plot(incidentally, he got a C grade from a Yale College Professor for a paper outlining his idea for FedEx...).
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I think anyone that loves books or a good story will enjoy this one. Setterfield is a talented author and understands what the reader wants. I worried there would be unresolved story lines, but thankfully, there were no loose ends.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Although tough to read at times, a wonderful story, well written and the characters are wonderful.  I love how any of these stories from the concentration camp/nazi genre open up such a personal perspective and another glimpse on human nature at its best and and its worst.
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book and read it twice in two weeks.  Many thanks to the author, Dr Alexander, for his thoughtful, caring, intelligent sharing of this information.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love old English movies, this is one of the best!  Will continue you to<br />follow each new season.  Wonderful!

B009MYARIK|5.0|Another great book from Sophie!!! Fun and touching! A funny story about a sister going to the extreme to protect her little sis!!
B001N8Q6V0|5.0|Although this is an older movie, it was one of his best action/spy flics ever made! It made you really see his quality!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Provided me with exactly what I wanted with no damage! I love pretty little liars and now I get to enjoy it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author does a wonderful job of developing the main characters and weaving the present day into Vivian's life story.  I found this book very interesting from a historical perspective.  My emotional bond with the main characters made it hard for me to put the book down.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game! Its just like mario! Leps World 2 is a very run and addicting game! I play it all the time! And another thing that makes this game better is the its free! So download it.....i bet youll love this game and if u dont just delete t cuz its free! :)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's nothing special, but the game is very relaxing and not difficult. Just a little fun. Much like Farmville or the likes of that.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I have seen this version of Gatsby at least 10 times and I never get tired of watching it. It is mesmerizing. Robert Redford is fantastic as the mysterious Jay Gatsby.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|good to hear new Johnny winter with other artist, classic blues. Great mix of classic blues with various artist. Smooth!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|A very good movie.  It is full of history and moves rather slow.  It was alittle advanced for our 9 year old grandson.  Will try again next year.  Even if you aren't a history buff you will enjoy the movie.
B00C9VNC0S|5.0|After a long and glorious career, Cathedral announced this would be their final album.  Personally, I have been a Cathedral fan since the Forest of Equilibrium and have faithfully purchased each of their albums.  Within their 20 year plus catalog lies quite a bit of variation of styles, from the slow, monolithic doom dirges of the early days to the more prog influenced material of the more recent titles, particularly 'The Guessing Game'. For my taste, Cathedral was most successful with 'The Ethereal Mirror' and 'The Carnival Bizarre' where they were able to meld all their influences into a distinct and cohesive whole.  So now here we are at \\"The Last Spire\\". In a return to their roots, this album is far doomier than any of theirs since \\"Endtyme\\". The album is distinct from that effort in that this sounds like a band who is comfortable in their own skin, writing and performing songs they themselves enjoy.  The material presented here has the slow, chunky progressions of the early days, but it is tastefully supplemented by ornamental flourishes of the prog aesthetic the band obviously has an affection for.  As always, the guitar work by Gaz Jennings is a highlight of the album. The vocals by Lee Dorian have always been a polarizing aspect of the bands work, and this album will do little to bring naysayers into the fold. Having said that, I am a fan of Mr. Dorians, and very much enjoy the rawer, less produced sounding effort presented here. All in all, this album is an apt way for Cathedral to lay the band to rest, as it has a very funereal and dirge-like feel while hitting the high points of what makes them who they are as a band. Longtime fans should jump right in! If you are new to the band, this may be a good place to start, though I suspect your favorite will eventually surface from the bands back catalog.
098357670X|4.0|The drawing in the book are almost worth the price. Very good information on learning to look more closely at you subject and how take what you see and apply this to you caricature. It will not teach you how to draw. You must have some talent or hard work under your belt before you can expect great results. Well worth the money and time to read and learn.
B005PK553C|5.0|Everyone should see this. If your a horror fan you will watch from start to finish and it leaves you wanting more!
B004UJN1XA|4.0|This is a terrific comedy, with amazing timing and quality acting; everything good one would expect from a British production.  I highly recommend it if you enjoy British humour - a laugh from beginning to end.  I did not choose to rate this movie with five stars only because, disappointingly, the blu-ray edition seems to lack the Special Features section which the box advertises, and the sound quality, for some reason, is poor.  Be prepared to turn up the volume for best effect.  I do have a very new television and sound system, so my equipment is not the problem in this case.  The movie is still worth buying for its entertainment value, although I would have liked to have had access to the other features as well.  Perhaps this will be corrected with future editions?
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie is amazing. The ending is an absolute must see. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Watch it!
B0054JELS4|5.0|I can't say enough about this series and others like it. I plan to collect them all when I can, as I can. I've already got about 10 complete series some that I've watched since I was young.
B002VE5472|4.0|Edge of your seat movie with crazy plot twist! Once your done watching you want to immediately rewatch to see what you missed!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I will up to 5 stars soon. When I first downloaded, it would not open. I would have to uninstall and reinstall. GREAT customer service, last 2 weeks no problem. If it continues to not have the issue, I will upgrade to 5 stars!
B00B19DMUE|5.0|This movie is unbelievable. It is based on a true story and it makes the hair on your body Stand up!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I was excited to finally try this game -- Scribblenauts obviously gets a lot of love.<br /><br />However, it was a fairly big let down. It seems like the developers, who've come up with a cool concept and, for the most part, execute it really well, just can't figure out what to do with the idea of being able to conjure up nearly anything you can imagine. So what ends up happening is it becomes a dumb sort of guessing game a lot of the time, and it feels like a game that is used to educate kindergartners about basic problem solving and deduction. I tried for awhile to come with with wacky and off-the-cuff solutions to puzzles but they typically don't work unless they fit a basic few dozen or so parameters, most of which are boring and glaringly obvious. I got it for a buck and am just glad I didn't pay more for it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I would read this at lunch while I ate.  When it was time to go back to work, I had to struggle a little to shift back to the real world.  That's a good book.  I read this for book club (one with 2 librarians) and we all liked it.  Lots to think about, but mostly a &#34;book to live in&#34; for a while.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very spacious and, perhaps surprisingly for the price, very high quality. A lot well-organized and thought-out space for my accessories and camera. The packaging is awesome and indeed, &#34;frustration free&#34;. I totally recommend it for any photography enthusiasts looking for something new to tote around their crap.
B003O86FMW|4.0|What does it take to move us to action. This is a very thought provoking yet engaging story. The action continues and the dark side of our human nature blooms in many of the characters.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|For me this is the best bingo game I have played. Really,really fun. I can play this game with my husband when he is traveling. Pretty cool.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Running on Windows 7 Cubase and Ableton, no hassle setup. Records at 24bit, and works as advertised! Using to record rock vocals with just an SM58 and MP75 and getting great results! Recommended!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's has amazing graphics and tons of equipment not to mention weapons,armor,and millions of evil people skeletons mostly he's yes
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This is a bit frantic but very funny and enjoyable love story.<br />The charaters are believeable and it has real heart.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I've never had this much fun playing PvP.  Learning different roles and challenging  myself to play out of my comfort zone.  extremely  addictive.  Hours of fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was so much fun!  I can't wait for the next one!  I am going to start a new game with my 5 year old. She will love it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Like it a lot. had lost of Great acting , and a political plot but was vary entertaining and I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|This ap did not work!~It should not be sold if it doesn't work on the Kindle Fire, I do not have a smart phone, was trying to load it and it said turn phone off then back on if this is not working, I did even though it was not a phone and it didn't work, I guess it has to be a phone, the ap should not be available for the Kindle if it does not work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it  is so addicting I can't help but wonder where they are going to be next every one should get the latest version of this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like the saga of the series...... lots to find out, I like the characters and the writing, to me, is good.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game but with updates freeze the game or don't give payouts from winning.  Went from 5 stars to 3.
1452110581|4.0|My friend, the cat lady, really enjoyed this read. She likes to read and loves cats so this was a big hit.
B001BWQVUO|5.0|Is a very interesting docu, and has subtibles in german. Could be very helpful for jung musicians or for children who dont like to practice
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Great game! Lots of fun playing against friends. Great idea to have on phone to take and play any time.
0321885112|4.0|I like the overall book design, it provides me useful tips, how to start writing own Sketchnotes and moreover lead me to the other sources, where to find others.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|very challenging. I have played several of their games and have loved the all...However if you get stuck in the little girls room getting the last Crayon behind the back button just inlarge your screen. you will love this.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I bought this movie because I am a fan of Charlie Cox and I wanted to see some more of his work.  I really enjoyed this movie and the entire cast was great.  I am 30 years old and even though it's pretty much a fairytale I liked it a lot and didn't think it was childish.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|First things first, this came a whole day early before 'estimate delivery' date. I was like a child on christmas morning when I got this in the mail. I love it. And it has been realky fun! You DO need a screwdriver to open the battery compartment on your sonic screwdriver. Which in itself is ironic and funny.<br />It does not look EXACTLY like 9&10's screwdriver but its pretty close. It also bigger than I imagined but in the description it does say its dimensions, so I'm not upset about that. The only thing is that my pen tip doesnt fit as tightly as the uv ink pen does. Its slightly loose and when i try to take the cap off to use the pen, the whole thing come out. Which is slightly annoying. But really other than that this toy has been so much fun! The noise it great! I love this toy more than I probably should, being an \\"adult\\" and all! I just can't help it. Its been great. And I will definitely be buying the 11th's and river song's screwdrivers in the future!  Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this a five star because it had me hooked very early on. This is well written and doesn't leave wondering what the author is trying to relate
B002WN35DC|5.0|Es un cl&aacute;sico que debes uno de tener en cualquier biblioteca, la traducci&oacute;n es buena y creo que aporta m&aacute;s de lo que cuesta por lo que lo recomiendo ampliamente.
0316017930|5.0|My son read this for a college class, recommended it to me,  and our whole family has been impacted for the better.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Fun styles. It does have a calendar feature that works great. Great for a shopping list since it does have a checklist featue.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This movie is not for kids. Imagine an evening out with the wife. You stop at the video store so the kids can pick up a movie to watch. They see that cute little Teddy Bear on the cover and grab the movie. The Dad notices it looks like a movie for kids, and off they go.....with one of the nastiest movies I've ever seen, as far as bad language and sexual situations go! That \\"R\\" rating should be very large on the front. As for the movie itself, I think it was made to shock, because I don't see any other use for this trashy waste of a DVD.
B005HSL626|5.0|I would recommend this game for anyone who wants a kid kept entertained. It works great for fun and great price since was free.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you can read through this book and finish the final chapters without a lump in your throat, do consult a cardiologist. You may be missing a heart . . .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very good game for the ages that have played temple run. It is very fun. Updating it is the only problem I had but if you have  kindle fire hd if you say remove from device and then redownload it it should be updated
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is great because a lot of its cast is relatively unknown yet they still give captivating performances. The special effects are top notch and the story keeps me anticipating the show every week. Overall a great sci-fi thriller and I hope they continue for many more seasons.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very addicting game. There so many ways to pass a certain level. I enjoy this game a lot until I get stuck on a level.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|If you like romantic music at its best, you will love Mr. Bocelli.  We thoroughly enjoyed hearing him sing on Whyy Tv. It is nice to have our own copy to play and enjoy.  The service of ordering and shipping were timely and up to high standards.  DMF
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't like it since it keeps getting updated. But it is fun game though . Very cool and fun game.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A nice movie to watch with your wife. Different and crazy yet romantic. Very funny. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. P. S. Jennifer Lawrence is smokin' hot.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is really fun don't get me wrong. it is just a knock off of temple run.it is stupid how you get your characters you have to get a mystery box. in temple run you buy.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I disliked everything in this book on the HD kindle fire. The only thing I liked about the book was that it had a touch pad on the front of it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is awsome because my friend showed me it and I thought I should check it out played for 1 hour then I knew I finished the game and I like it
B009G78EE2|4.0|Catchy songs that actually say something meaningful. I would totally recommend it. Good for parties. I´ll probably buy their next CD.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|a hidden item is stuck behind the menu bar on the bottom & impossible to click on, so game can not progress.  what a waste!
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Wasn't as funny and intersecting as it seemed. My 5 yr old daughter thought it was alright. Not sure I would buy.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book is very funny. The characters are well presented and real. The plot, although somewhat predictable keeps a good pace throughout.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The movie was awesome and it had a good plot and a lot of action  it also if you are an iron man fan like me had a lot of tony Starks awesome iron man suits
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a fun group of puzzles. There is a minimalist story line that gives it a little extra, but this game is all about th  puzzles! The puzzles all work as they should and vary in difficulty enough to let everyone have a good time with them.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I still cannot open any Adobe files, so it was a waste of my time and the space that it took up on my kindle
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Lynne Olson is a great storyteller.  This book reads like a novel, while giving readers serious historical context about a 'forgotten' era in American history.  The author expertly blends intimate personal stories within the broad sweep of world events.  A must-read for anyone interested in how the US entered WWII.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|i got this for a buck knife and it works pretty good, i guess i would recommend it because it works.
0345525558|1.0|Is it me or does anyone else feel robbed by the fact that you can get a hard copy of the book delivered to your door cheaper than the kindle version which costs the publisher next to nothing?  I don't think Amazon can do anything about it.  This is all about price fixing in the industry.  Write your congress person.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This story unfolds quickly to place the reader at the center of a missing person crisis with Dana, the main character of Solstice, cast in the unwelcome role of witness.  As Dana tries to work through the unsettling situation, she finds little support from the local authorities or even her own sister, based on lack of evidence that Jack actually exists.  With Jack's questionable disappearance propelling the plot, Dana struggles to establish credibility for herself or her claims.<br /><br />Dana's arrival at her sister's home, Thornhill House, home of The Rainbow Collective, is overshadowed by her fears for Jack's safety, and her reunion with her sister, Zoe, adds mounting layers of conflict to Dana's situation.  The author does a good job of supplying just enough details throughout the plot to entice the reader to the end, as Dana makes full use of every tool and resource available to work through the mounting turmoil that puts multiple lives at risk.<br /><br />Overall, the plot moves quickly and takes the reader on a suspenseful journey to secrets held on the grounds of Thornhill House, while giving Dana the resilience to take care of business.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I found the women all strong no matter the adversity they faced. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it really puts the science in science fiction ... great story of survival plus witty as well. Happily recommend this book to others to read.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I thought it was an interesting read.  I can't imagine not remembering yesterday...  It also kept you thinking all the way to the end.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I loved this game on my pc and now I can love it when I am on the go. I have been a bigfish game club member for years and it's great to be able to take their wonderful games with me. This is one of my favorite match 3 games because there is a storyline. There is more to do them just one board after another and the little characters are so cute.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought it was a fun read.  It makes me want a sequel.  Hurry up Gillian Flynn, your readers are waiting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfer is extremely fun and challenging! i really like how you have to earn coins to get things like boards and characters. daily challenges are probably my favorite part of the game. i personally rate it *****
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I loved Fifty Shades, but this book was very self involved.  Plus it is taking her way to long to come out with book three.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is many most favorite game. It rocked and I would recommend this game to every one I know. I love it. My whole family plays it.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have played this game on other platforms and I truly love all I have played. Keep them coming. Thanks bunches.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is great, but it does have a few complications sometimes. Still, it's really fun and I also love how you can meet new people and make new friends in it. It's great how there's new things often too. Keeps the game interesting.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Had no idea what to expect, and when I realized this was part one of a series, I wondered if it would be worth the time and money.  Surprisingly, Milan seems to be a very good author, with a talent for great repartee between her main characters, and a penchant for strong heroines...so I am hooked now!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I do enjoy this weather app on my kindle fire. I think it is a great thing to have to look forward to what is expected in the days ahead so one can try to plan ahead for certain days. I think it is well worth having it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think dis temple run is rached more money for dis stupid app like temple run 1 I'm NOT looking forward to temple run 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 or any more uggg!!!!!!!!!! So hard NEVER AGAIN download temple run or temple brave or  oz either Just joking dis game is the bomb dowload All of dem they ned to emake more plz rate my comment
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It was very mysterious and entertaining and as always very sweet and romantic. I definitely recommend it!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|the impossible was heartwarming. but i wish they would have had more pictures of the real family at the end and let us know how the were doing after they returned home
B002W1UEW4|4.0|For an action movie I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did.  My husband picked it out.  Its a little over the top on the special effects but who can't not look at Channing Tatum!
B002VEEAYA|5.0|This suspenseful movie has got great scenes of Hawaiian beauty and it's unpredictable. Plenty of action and adventure. The actors are at their best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|just 3 words, BEST GAME EVER. EVERYONE SHOULD GET THIS GAME, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL GET ADDICTED TO THIS GAME.
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|I remember when the original came out and thinking how great it was, but, by comparison, this version makes the original look like a steaming pile of turds.  Sure, it has it's nostalgic charm, but this movie has much better production, acting, etc.  It's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but if you just want something to kill some time, you could do much worse.  Fun, mindless entertainment.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Well, Russell Crowe was a poor Javert and Hugh Jackman can't hold a candle to Colm Wilkinson in his prime, but Anne Hathaway is thrilling Fantine and the rest of the cast is good.  The visuals are entrancing.  For anyone who loves the musical, this is a very faithful screen adaptation and easily earns the highest rating.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i love this SOOOOOOOOOOO much! its fun and a bit challenging. i love Om Nom he's so adorable! it is definitely worth $1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|My daughter loved Hey Ho and sent me the link.  I loved that song and purchased the CD.  All of the songs are fantastic.  I wish there were more.  I would recommend this band and cd.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is very simple but easy and relaxing.  I would recommend for adult or small children.  I do not think its a teenager game.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|On of DeMille's best.  Keeps you attention and makes you want to turn the pages before you are finished to see what happens next.  The plot is well woven with dialogue and interesting sidelines to enlighten the understanding of what is happening and some of the reason behind the events.  Well worth the time to read it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|LOVE this game. Great for passing time. Have experienced no glitches. Love that you can turn the sound off, pause a game and choose a formation.
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|too many apps and not enough space on a Kindle. need a magnifying glass to play on the 8.9\\". Better for the large screed computer
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Excellent value and Blu-Ray is the perfect way to end the series!  Behind the scenes is a plus and DTS makes you feel you're in the middle of the action!!
B008AYCSE4|4.0|Great movie. suprised it didn't get more play in the theaters. Good quality disc.just as described. A film not for kids.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Come on...let's face the facts...MOST people today enjoy the Angry Birds phenomenon...I'm the creator never thought it would go global!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is the third Ken Follet book I read, the other two being Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  He does not disappoint in this novel.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  I loved all three books.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|As the title says...it could be better...and is better, Angry Birds Star Wars! To bad since this one actually requires less space on your phone or other device.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|One of the best series I have seen on television. My husband and I watched it continuously, every moment we had, until we finished it.  Not for children, as sex and violence are graphic, but a riveting account of the life story of King Henry the 8th.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|...even when you don't check the box for it to stop the app after the time is up. When I come back for a new session, and start unclicking some sounds and clicking others, thinking I have it all set up for a new and different session, I go to the timer to start the time running, and I get an error message that the app has stopped. I have to click OK, it takes me out of the app, then I have to come back in and do it all again. Other than this, there's plenty here for everyone. I'd love to use the binaural beats more, but you have to do it with earphones, and I prefer not to use them when I am trying to fall asleep. Well worth the small price.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is exceptional reading.  If you like reading long novels that you cannot put down, which I do, this is the book for you!
B00CDFWJIG|2.0|[[ASIN:0316042676 Beautiful Creatures]]<br />If I hadn't read the books, I would be completely lost.  It's missing too much.  I recommend reading the books.
B00992CF6W|4.0|the game is good and is worth the price but it needs mods and more animals and skins should be optional plus if you type nyan as the seed it generates lava falls and floating mountains
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I chose this rating only because there wasn't an epilogue, otherwise it would have gotten a 5 star rating. This book had real life characters that make you have hope that their life will<br />get better. I recommend this book to all.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love this movie. It has fantasy and the special effect are great.  Chris Hemsworth plays Thor really good. Tom Hiddleston plays Loki really good too. My favorite part is how Asgard use the bi frost to travel.  Watch the movie.
B008KWHL6G|5.0|Unbelievable, any music fan must have this in his/her collection. Don't let this gem pass you by. Buy it now.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|This was absolutely a wonderful and amazing fantasy. I absolutely loved all of the water acrobatic movements and dance it was amazing
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was truly a great book as were the first two in the series. I loved the story and I honestly wish that it didn't have to end. Can't wait for the next two movies too.
B00CBKVMG8|5.0|I am definitely recommending this to both my boys to watch and my dad. Josh Brolin is most excellent  as I just knew it
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|my husband loves it . it is very sleek, and thin. chic, looks good on him, he likes it very much
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|keeps my kids entertained on long car rides. I find myself playing it often as well. I highly recommend this game.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is a wonderful book.  If you can embrace the truth of this book, you can open your heart and your spirit to some of the power and the Presence which Dr. Alexander experienced.  If you have trouble embracing the truth of this book, or if you have questions about Heaven in general, I recommend reading Elton Trueblood's \\"The Logic of Belief.\\"  Professor Trueblood made the point that absolute proof of anything is an illusion, and that the best we can do in the real world is to give diligent study to converging lines of evidence.  When sufficient convergence occurs, then we may be said to have achieved proof \\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" Prof Trueblood also points out that genuine science does not form opinions in advance of studying the available evidence, and he notes that when we apply scientific thinking to spiritual questions, then the available evidence has to incorporate information which comes through the sensory apparatuses (apparati?) of human beings.<br />Dr. Alexander's account of his experience in Heaven constitutes data which deserves a fair hearing, and which adds to the existing body of data about Heaven.  If you have trouble embracing the truth about Heaven, you may want to reflect on why you are resisting truth.  If you can embrace the truth about Heaven, and about life in general, there is great blessing available to you.  If you can embrace the truth provided by Dr. Alexander, there is a taste of Heaven available, and that is a taste worth experiencing.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really great game. Cannot wait for the next room. Impressive design and beautiful to view. Fantastic job for their very first game. Keep them coming.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I picked up this book because my 6th grade students could not stop reading book after book. Now I understand why. There is a real connection to kids of the age. They can relate to the characters and are not bombarded by themes that are too complicated. Great Book!

B001U3Y5XE|2.0|this is a brilliant brilliant idea. but it fails miserably. the pictures on the cards are too hard to recreate using the lego provided in the box. Some are too hard even if you had a house full of lego. Couldn't recommend

160774273X|5.0|Congratulations to Ken.  His book has been chosen as the 2013 winner in the James Beard Awards for Baking & Dessert.  If this is not an endorsement, I don't know what is.  Oh, one more thing - for those of you on the fence about this book or Ken's home baking technique, there is a series of videos on Amazon so that you can watch as Ken demonstrates what the book contains.
B004I2K4DY|3.0|There were only three highlights to this production.  The first of which is the production itself.  Brilliantly done and well-executed.  Choreography and staging were superb.  The second highlight was Eponine.  She was superb and the only one of the cast whose performance was equal to or better than the original cast.  The last highlight was the appearance of all of the Jean Valjeans of previous productions as well as several other original cast members.  That was a pleasant surprise and definitely elevated the level of performance.  Except for Eponine all other cast members were sad impersonations of the original cast.  The DVD cover crows about the &#34;brilliant&#34; casting choice of some member of a boy band.  He and his boy band may be very popular, but this man does not have the vocal range or depth to play Marius.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|It is always a funny show. The picture and sound are always in very good quality. I watched on my roku.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|As a physician who works with neurological conditions, I found the material very useful.  It has application at many levels and in many professions.  It is clear to me that many of our habits have unintended results -- so we should review these habits in both our personal and professional lives.  Our brain's ability to be modeled by our intentional change is one of the best parts of being human.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first &#34;part&#34; of this book was okay. It made me feel that it was just another husband killed wife story with some twists...not super exciting. The second part was a lot better, more suspenseful, etc. I was really hoping for this killer ending, the ending came, and I was thinking I must have skipped some pages. That's my biggest gripe- I kept reading with my own hopes for the end but it was very anticlimactic. Oh well...onto the next one.
1592332803|5.0|I love this cookbook.  It is simply written with common ingredients and easy to follow instructions.  I am slowly trying out every recipe in the book and they are all wonderful!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good graphics....puzzles not too difficult nor too easy.  There were many hints available when needed, but for the most part I seldom needed them and when I did it was usually to point me in the right direction only....this is nothing new to me as I lose direction where to go I<br />n life also.  :)  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys adventure puzzle games.
B000S9HVZU|4.0|I'd never read a book with homosexual relations in it. They weren't prominent, but they were implied and there. I don't know about the present tense, but I did like the book.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I liked it too much. I love those kind of movies because I can see my friends crying, in fact, I saw it two times!  I would like to watch others as this one.
B007TR1R22|4.0|I not only found this film not confusing, I admired the very structure that seems to have confused some. It made a rather average story and gave it the drama it needed. I was constantly wondering what would happen next and what had happened before.<br /><br />As others have said, it is a excellent mood piece. I thought the slower pace was perfect. All three actors are outstanding, and I was engaged from beginning to end.<br /><br />I saw this film because I find Tom Hiddleston to be the most interesting actor out there today... his star is on the rise and I hope it continues. Interestingly, Freddie could have been a totally unsympathetic character (like his Loki) and yet he brings humanity to the part. Rachel is amazing.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to those of you that enjoy acting and films that explore the human heart.
B0002IRY0O|3.0|On the credit side, Celibidache made a fine orchestra of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony. He arrived there at a time when they were in the doldrums, they liked his way of working on a beautiful, harmonious and rhythmically coherent sound and persuaded him to stay. Typical for his manner was his refusal to be appointed; but he stayed anyway and laid down the law. According to credible testimony, after a year or so the musicians felt they could claim to being the second best in the land after you-know-who. This was before the Leipzig and Dresden orchestra re-joined \\"the land\\", but let us not quibble. Some of his rehearsal tapes accompanied editions of these posthumously issued recordings (all live), which give one a good glimpse into his methods. Celibidache always wanted the musicians to understand where certain phrases came from and where they are going. My first impression of his conducting came on a day when I walked into a record shop where Brahms No. 1, the Finale was playing. I was astonished at the vibrancy of the performance, and even more so when told that it was a Celibidache concert (I knew he never made recordings). Anyway, I bought the set there and then.<br />These Bruckner tapes were issued later. By this time I had become somewhat used to Celibi and returned from his to the Brahmsian context. Repeated exposure familiarised me with his approach, which in the long run was revealed to be interesting, but not ultimately convincing. For lack of a better word I will call it \\"a search for the grace of the hour\\". It is notoriously difficult to sustain over a long work and in a public performance, where you are not alone, but susceptible to audience reactions and other fortuitous circumstances affecting the music making. In fact, one musician who was interviewed stated that the rehearsals with Celibi were like rituals devoted to that crucial moment of insight, and the performances in the public glare very often dispelled their concentration.<br />Considerations of this kind apply here as well. The performances are not all that different from what could be called the norm. Tempi are not extraordinary; the ensemble goes awry occasionally, as do balances especially within the brass group; audience noises add annoying non-musical contributions; and the recorded sound is less than ideal. The deep mystical sense of the musical flow suffers here and there from imperfect realisation, requiring the listener to imagine rather than to sense it. This is in part because we are not in the audience of a single concert, but hearing a stitched together product from two or more occasions, because DG in their wisdom expunged/exchanged sections with mishaps. So the greatest benefit of issuing these recordings is partially annulled.<br />I have to record these deficits for buyers who may not be aware of them and may have been led astray by reviews from sundry madly over-enthusiastic Celibi fans, who tend to hear and describe what these discs do not, in objective fact, deliver. This conductor's Bruckner was never an towering testimony to his greatness as an interpreter. In certain respects he falls down on precisely those elements of Bruckner's music that are crucial to an understanding of the music - the inexorably majestic pulse that grabs hold of your soul and accumulates the tensions of a larger than life tragedy, releasing them in cathartic denouements where the peace and the faith in God is restored. A conductor who wishes to reconstruct these symphonic cathedrals with the whole of the Pythagorean and Christian mysticism that fills those huge spaces, has to do more than emphasise the beauty and harmony of the sound. He must take account of the sounds that swing unheard in the soul of this music, and of the silences which Bruckner wrote into his scores for the music to take breath. He must also lay aside his egoism and let the music speak of what it intends to speak. In these respects, Celibidache cannot be said ever to be at one with the composer. Too much of his phrasing, and his manner of articulating the long-breathed melodies, smacks of \\"great conducting\\" rather than \\"great Bruckner conducting\\". Without bringing the names of Furtwängler or Karajan in, it may suffice to point the example of Günter Wand's performance of No. 9 with the same orchestra--a performance of utter conviction that never slackens off for a moment until the capstone has been set in place with the final deeply moving pages that reverberate long in the listener's memory after silence ensues. This kind of inspiring Bruckner conducting is largely absent from Celibi's readings.<br />All told (and ignoring the Mozart and Schubert, which are totally misplaced on this album), this Bruckner set will appeal primarily to admirers of Celibidache. They fit in with the Bruckner tradition by staying within that tradition, but it would be saying too much that they rise to the top. In fact, it says a lot that Symphony 3 is to my mind the best performance of this set. Brucknerians will on the whole benefit from recognising the relatively few idiosyncratic departures for whatever light they shed. But altogether this is a conductor's view of Bruckner with rather greater focus on the conductor than on the composer. He has not yet arrived at the point where he simply substitutes Celibidache for Bruckner, as in his Munich performances. But the quivering of such sentiments is discernible and, for someone who has now auditioned this set for about a dozen times, they gradually amount to an irritant that one can do without.

B005DOJ68K|5.0|I cut my teeth on CCR well not really, I was long in the tooth when I first heard them. To me songs are time markers in my life or<br />triggers of memory threads. The first clear memory of hearing CCR was at a 4th of July celebration in the small town of Prattville<br />Ala. My father was in Vietnam and we we're living close to my grandparents. It was a small band that player the music in the town<br />park by the segregated swimming pool. The boy who sang the songs, wore a Naru shirt. Years later when I returned to visit my grandfather after Vietnam, (you see I was not a fortunate son). My grandfather told me they had found that boy shot in the head<br />under a parked school bus, &#34;a drug deal gone bad, rumor was.&#34; Ah what can one say, &#34;who'll stop the rain.&#34;

0062238868|5.0|American Sniper<br /><br />A quick read this memoir ranks up there with Audie Murphy's, \\"To Hell and Back\\" in American Lore.  Although similar to \\"No Ordinary Day\\" out about the same time, this book reveals another eye witness account of a SEAL's experiences in the\\" War On Terror.\\"<br />After a short biography Chris Kyle provides a fascinating account on the \\"grunt work\\" in the battle of Fallujah and Ramadi.  His candid and eyewitness account revealed the truth of the missing weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which I was briefed at HQ Pentagon, were present in Iraq in the early turn of the 21st century.  Additionally, his recorded observations regarding the Iraqis Army we were training, he reveals incompetence in personel even toward the end of the insurgency.<br />This account left me with much admiration for his wife's feelings.  This contribution to the book  provides all Americans the view of the toll putting on the uniform takes from us.  I salute you Chris Kyle-job well done!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is an awesome album! I've jammed out to it for a few weeks now. It's honest, relevant, and honestly kind of uplifting. I'm not usually a hot hop listener, but Ryan LEwis and Macklemore are creative inspiring artists.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I am so disappointed in these two stars.  I can't imagine whatever possessed them to make this movie.  Their characters were funny in &#34;Knocked Up&#34; but this was pathetic.  A good reason never to make a follow up to a hit movie.  Not only was the storyline lacking, but the content was disgusting.

B008JFUO72|5.0|Iron Man 3 is awesome. this is the best one yet, and you can't say that about to many sequels. this movie does in fact leave off the avengers and it does lead into the avengers two. just make sure you watch after the credits. I really enjoyed this movie. hey what can I say i'm an iron man fan. and a superhero fan as well. I'm finally glad to see that they put the mandarin in the film since he is iron man's main nemisses. I was very pleased with the actor who played him. they changed it up a little but that's okay. the movie was great. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do

B008AX18Y6|4.0|Salman Rushdie's memoir of living with the fatwa declared in Iran after publication of The Satanic Verses. He needed to take the threat to his life seriously, there were plenty of protests in England to demonstrate this, but he also wanted to keep living his life and not be &#34;shut down&#34; by fear. The memoir documents how he did this for nearly a decade, maintaining normal life for his son, falling in love and marrying (twice), writing new novels and fighting to get them published and promoted, travelling overseas although so many airlines were terrified and banned him from flying including British Airlines. Rushdie is an excellent writer and there are many great sentences and descriptions in this book. It's very long and at times feels as though he including a &#34;shopping list&#34; of whom he met, where and what for. However, his description of the challenge of living with the threat of murder from unknown assailants, of the importance of fighting back against the concept of banning novels because people don't like your ideas, are woven throughout the book and supported by many other writers. I very much enjoyed this memoir, and found it a fascinating insight into the time before 09/11which as Rushdie points out as changed the landscape again with how the West and fanatical Islamism collide.
B00BLLXGS0|4.0|Biffy Clyro is one of those bands which continue to stretch themselves without losing touch with the sound and edge which has made them special.  Although this album did not have the immediate appeal that Puzzles or Only Revolutions had for me, I believe it will continue to grow on me through continued listens.

B00BG4UWPC|4.0|Four years is quite a long time to not have any music from a group that is still together. 2009's &#34;Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix&#34; is one of the greatest albums of the last decade and it was one that I played over and over and never tired of it. It's an album that I always listen all the way through without skipping any tracks. Their previous album &#34;It's Never Been Like That&#34; was also a pretty spectacular album as well, but it wasn't nearly as profound as &#34;Amadeus&#34;. I wanted more Phoenix by 2011, per the usual 2 year gap between most artist's albums, but I was patient enough to let them do their thing after their huge rise in popularity and success. Once their site became the teaser for the album (consisting of part of what would be &#34;Bankrupt's&#34; title track) I was super stoked and ready for some new Phoenix music.<br /><br />Now that it's out I can safely say that &#34;Bankrupt!&#34; is quite a fine album from them. I still find myself listening to it and enjoying the hell out of it even weeks since it's been released. It's still the same Phoenix from albums past, though with a little bit of a skewed sound from what we heard on &#34;Amadeus&#34;. &#34;Bankrupt!&#34; shows us a noisier side of the band that we only saw glimpses of in past songs like &#34;1901&#34;. Synths, drums, and guitars feel like they're cranked up more than the band has ever done before, but it's not a bad thing. It's easy to see how much Phoenix has changed over the four years and it's turned out most successful. They're sill the four guys that crafted &#34;Amadeus&#34;, but trying something that isn't just more of the same. &#34;Bankrupt!&#34; is an experimental album for them, but it's not as if they're becoming a completley new band playing a different genre of music now. Phoenix is one of those bands that really doesn't have a set sound. Each album of theirs has a sound unlike the one before it, but not one that is so far off that you wouldn't recognize them as the same band.<br /><br />I enjoy the album all the way through when I listen to it. Each song is great, though &#34;S.O.S. In Bel Air&#34;, &#34;Drakkar Noir&#34;, and &#34;Bourgeois&#34; are probably my favorite to hear. Although I will admit I mostly listen to &#34;Drakkar Noir&#34; to hear the way the lead singer pronounces Drakkar Noir, it's fantastic! The title track, &#34;Bankrupt!&#34;, is another mid album instrumental as they've done with their past two albums. It's good, but it feels somewhat out of place in this album. The levels on it sound a bit different from what part was on their teaser page on the website so it doesn't quite sound as good when it hits it's climax. My only real minor gripe with some of the songs is the overuse of that Asian influenced synth sound, heard in the opening notes of &#34;Entertainment&#34;. It's a neat sound for sure, but they use it in about three or four more songs and it does seem overused throughout the album. It's not played the same each time, but it sounds super similar and makes me wonder if the keyboardist just became super infatuated with the sound and kept using it throughout the whole recoding process.  It is a minor thing and I really don't mind it as much now that I'm used to the album.<br /><br />&#34;Bankrupt!&#34; is a extremely solid album from one of my favorite musicians of the past decade. I don't get the same feeling that I do listening to it as when &#34;Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix&#34; came out all those years ago, but it's by and far much better than what most bands make after such a popular critical success. If you don't go in expecting &#34;Wolfgang Amadeus Part 2&#34; and settle for more of a &#34;It's Never Been Like That&#34; level of greatness, you won't be dissapointed. It'll be a long time before I write off Phoenix and &#34;Bankrupt!&#34; surely isn't the start of their downfall. I eagerly await more music from them, but I want them to take as long as they need again to craft something truly great. My only real fear is that they could become pale comparisons of what they used to be as The Strokes have in recent years. Though with three solid albums in a row I find it unlikley Phoenix will fade anytime soon. If they only made &#34;Bankrupt!&#34; quality albums from here on out, I'd be satisfied with that. Though a &#34;Amadeus&#34; every so often would be a nice treat, but not an expectation.reat.

B0042JH0EE|5.0|How you view the making and production of this album/dvd is really a matter of perspectives AND biases.<br />When I first started listening,I was biased, so I missed a lot of the nuances and chemistry. I was born and raised in Detroit ( not the suburbs either I mean 1 mile from Chrysler's  Jefferson assembly plant ) and having heard the originals my whole life, I have become accustomed to AND spoiled by ( does anyone really have anything close to or as generation defining stuff as Motown and the music? ) such masters as matter of the fact, the par normal. So I let my biases color what I heard, but soon it was obvious there was a lot of effort put into making this production. From the long deserved admission you can't do it with out the \\"funk brothers\\" to the 60's Motown girls on the stage singing along, Phil knew you can't replace or better the sound, it was an era a generation and like wine, much different now than then. Phil did a great job to keep the idea of the song intact( people these songs are #1 chart topping song!!! The same people that want him to change the vibe are the same IDIOTS that mag wheels on a Honda civic, and you know who they are!!) and instead add to it a certain flavor. He tries to maintain and add to rather than redesign it over( Was the wheel a good invention? Why replace it then?). IF you can listen and understand that these songs were written by blacks that couldn't even use the same toilets as whites ( I mean how do you reproduce that kind of ignorance that leads to dumb !@%^^Y* like that?) and still they overcome to produce the most soul stirring sounds on vinyl!!! These are the sounds Phil was reproducing, and does a great job with it, a little Phil and a little Motown, a whole lot of a different era... makes for one my favorite remakes. Oh by the way I can't stand him as a singer, but I like this one by him, his best by far, for what he DOESN'T do!!!!!<br />jeff

B000PAAH3K|5.0|Engaging from the first page, Gladwell weaves stories, anecdotes and reason seamlessly to startling conclusions. He continues to refer back to past stories, but always moves to new people and totally different circumstances to show his point in a totally new way. Though unexpected, his theories and conclusions are totally accessible and the journey is just as entertaining as the answers are surprising. I recommend any of his books for people who want to see the world in a new way.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Love this game. However the daily challenge has a serious glitch. It lets me do the first two days, then won't ever give me the third daily challenge. Instead the clock saying \\"come back in xxx amount of time for your next daily challenge\\" stays on all 000's for the whole day, with no challenge in sight. Then resets back to the first day. This is frustrating for someone like myself that plays EVERY DAY NUMEROUS TIMES A DAY! Give me my other challenges already so I can win the super mystery boxes.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Definitely no Iron Man 1 or Avengers, but still really good. RDJ's Tony Stark is always countable for a good laugh. Great graphics and special effects. Certainly worth watching.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My grandkids loved it. I am the Nana movie connection. I will be back to buy more. Your prices can't be beat.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love the game, but once I got to 12-9, none of the solutions I found online, nor my own, worked. I don't know why, but that's the only bug I found. Great job!!
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|The product was received in new condition,sealed in clear plastic.received product on time,no scratches or freezing up. Movie its self was disapointing no where as good as the first one. acting had a lot to be desired and where were the special effects?to be honest there were a few but not as good as the first men in black.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|This is one of the best biographies I have ever seen.  I don't believe that the movie set out to be any kind of biography of Capote but was about how he came to find out about the killings in a small Kansas town and set about to write a non-fiction novel about the killers and the family they killed and how the town and the towns people got through it all from the beginning and then to the  trial and then the death sentence of the killers. In going through the years this all took place we learn much about Capote's childhood, his mother and much about his life.
B0086213XW|3.0|Good acting, well filmed, but not my typical preference for movie. It was just a bit darker than I usually like.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I chose this rating because my new Kindle Fire 7inch HD tablet quit recharging.  I called an Amazon representative and she sent me a new cable and the wall charger and now the tablet recharges without any problems.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|No surprise that once again a book is better than the movie.  I liked the movie a lot, but the book had me waking up at 2am and reading till 5 to finish it.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Just wanted to add my 'two cents' to validate the previous 5 star reviews here.  Because of them I picked this film and I wasn't disappointed.  Once it gets going, the plot and plot twists are hypnotic! I was glued to my screen until the final credits rolled.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I wanted to see this and my son wanted it for his B'day. Perfect match!!  It was extremely well written and acted. I was on the edge of my seat til the end. Excellent.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Could have used a little more length to be truer to the book.  Would have made a great mini series.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Love this series! I like the character a lot. Good story line and easy reading. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B000002HIK|5.0|Richard's last true analog album.  This is a must-own album for anyone who calls themselves a fan of electronic music.
0385349947|5.0|This is another must read. This is not in my range of books that I typically read, but for some reason I felt this urge to read this book. I am so glad I did. After finishing this book I could not help but think that this book should be required reading by every single girl. They need to have their eyes opened to let them know to that they can be a leader and don't settle for anything but the best. Having two daughters of my own I will help them to see that they can do whatever.<br /><br />I am not a female, but I walked away with some essential ideas about life. Not being afraid to trust your instinct, taking chances, and believing in the process.<br /><br />This is an easy read that really packs in some quality ideas about being successful and how to deal with issues that arise. My Evernote page on this book is loaded with passages that I will be using in my teachings at school and perhaps even a Twitter chat in the near future.<br /><br />I feel that this is a very important read for the next generation of kids to read to understand their potential and how to treat each other whether man or woman.<br /><br />This book ranks up there in one of the best books of the year.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book immediately drew me in and took me on an emotional roller coaster! I couldn't put it down until I was finished reading it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Great for downloading your favorite youtube videos, bit acts as a virus and pops up with ADs every single day, its annoying. lets ads pop up on my kindle fire, even after I've uninstalled the application. I will no longer download this app because it needs improvements. it lead me to factory resetting my kindle to brand new. Great app but horrible because it acts as a virus.
B0063M22QO|4.0|As a time killer this game has always done the job. The graphics are quite good and the pieces are easy to read. The shapes are also well defined and clean.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|enjoyed the album...one of the best!  Recommended by a friend & it meet all my expectations...Bocelli voice is a gift!
0887081770|5.0|I love the story and the pop up is amazing.  I think the whole book is pretty clever and I love it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When I first downloaded this app it was great. after a while it stopped working. I tried downloading it again but it still wont work!
B007JCP8FE|5.0|all the songs in this album are great, a definite to have in your collection, you won't regret it ok
B000VMFDW2|4.0|I generally like good ,well written books about WW 11.  The love of our country that existed during that period is sadly lacking today.
0345529057|5.0|This set is an awesome deal for the price.  The stories are amazing.  Just an FYI, the books do have extremely small print that goes way into the binding.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades is a great book and came highly recommended by several friends. If only we all could have a little fifty shades guy.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Blows away season 2 . The video is super clear, sound is crisp . And amazon shipping was crazy fast . Season 2 was great but the remastering on this season is far and away better .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 is as great as the first, a must read for all women who want to jump into a fantasy relationship with the possibility of exploring in your own relationships.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great book that explains the science of how the nutrients we eat effect the hormones that determine holing fat or burning fat for fuel.  With this understanding you can finally get off the roller coaster of diet programs and regain body health.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|My son loves it! He is a Speed Racer fan and watches at lease once a day! Vaaaarrrroooooommmm! Thanks a lot.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have gotten the original cut the rope 5 days before I got this one and I admit that time travel is better. You get to go to all these ages that are really fantastic. Cant wait for the update!!!!! GET THIS APP!!!!!!!
B008MWBY6W|4.0|It's a case, the camera fits in it. Seems like its good quality and would stand the test of time.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie encompasses the great human spirit that allows for helping others in need dispite differences in nationalities.  The people that step forward to help out travelers in great need, despite the danger,  In addition, the human need to protect family,<br />especialy children, displays the hope in the potential for doing good in each of us.<br /><br />MM
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How are they gonna top this and Breaking Bad?  I can not wait to see what AMC comes up with next!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie encompasses the great American spirit that allows for heros amoung to overcome our own government incompetentcies!  The hero's that step forward to help out fellow Americans are selflless treasures that we hope we all canbecome in time of need.<br /><br />MM
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The show is awesome!  If you are looking for edge of your seat excitement, this show is for you!  Watching on Amazon is very easy as long as you have either Firefox or Internet Explorer.  Load times are excellent and I'm pleased with my purchase all around.  :)
B00BF11STU|5.0|The movie was very good.  It segmented each of the different portions of the operation incliding government SNAFU's  that are certain to occur in such type of complex operation.<br /><br />Great movie and I would highly recomend it!<br /><br />MM
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book, as do many.  The characters Anastasia and Christian are incredibly interesting.  The world that Christian introduces her to is particularly intriguing to me because I truly knew very little about it.  It's all so hot and sweet at the same time.  Loved it, loved it, loved it!
B00005JOA0|4.0|This is a good movie.  Has a lot of drama.  I can't watch it late at night, because the drama, upsets me too much.  I have watched this movie, about 3 times since I have had it.  It is a good story, but the star has an abusive husband, who is a millionaire, and has nothing to do, but drink, party, and beat her.  She finally gets away from him, and in the end she finds love, and all works out good for her, and her son.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie far exceeded my expectations. Peter Jackson is on his way to sweep the oscars again!  The Hobbit rocked!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv to play subway surfers all the time in the car at my house and [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]when I'm at a friend's house
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was good to track the case through the fathers eyes.  You find you self all over the place, guilty, not, circumstantial evidence, history not proved, they should move, desperation, and the ending was totally not what I would have expected.  As a parent reading this it really is gut wrenching to go through the emotions of these parents, and the wondering if.....  This novel really takes you on a ride and when you are done you are sort of shockky!!!!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I bought the album here for the price which is cheaper than buying it in the store. I have been a big Justin Timberlake fan since Justified and this is his best album yet. Timbaland and Justin collaborated on this album. Some of my favorite tracks are &#34;Strawberry Bubblegum&#34;, a very poppy smooth song about an admiration for a young lady that caught his eye. Another one I enjoyed was &#34;Don't hold the wall&#34;. I wanted to get up and dance everytime I played it. The production is great and I love the live band.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was an interesting insight into people with mental illness.  Would recommend this book to anyone.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Loved it when I was 9, still love it now that I'm 19. I can't wait for the next one.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Absolutely love their music. There is not one single song on this Album I don't like ! This Album is definitely worth buying
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I was in middle school and high school during the 80's. I'm 43 years old now and The Breakfast Club still moves me now like it did then. I can watch it a hundred times and never blink.
B00846WWVM|5.0|As a person who recently beat this game, I wanted to say it is possible. This game was epic. The music was so peaceful. I found myself plugging in my headphones to simply listen to the awesomely composed songs. I really wish there was a way to have a play list of that. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that water pressure stopped around the end. I know that's how it happened in real life but it's alittle bother some when you only need that little bit of water and the water pressure is to low to reach it. Overall I love this game
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It started a little slow, trying to understand HOW it was written. (I thought the first chapter wasn't part of the story Lol) but once I understood the format I enjoyed the book. It was perfect for taking on a long flight.  It forced me to read until I got into it. Depressing. But what book about the holocaust isn't? I would recommend it to others.
B00ATP24NW|4.0|Except for a couple of tracks that i personally didnt like it, the majority of the cd is very good!
1935597760|1.0|This is one of the worst 3% of a book that I have ever read.  If I could have given it 0 stars, I would.  The second sentence of the book is one paragraph long, with everything but the proverbial kitchen sink thrown in, trying desperately to give us everything we might need to know in one long sentence/paragraph.  I have the feeling that the author aspires to be a LITERARY genius and keeps trying to be oh-so LITERARY.  For example, \\"His long nose and morose mouth stopped him from being handsome, but his blameless green eyes made one forget the imperfections of his face\\".  Say what?  What the heck are \\"blameless green eyes\\" or any kind of blameless eyes?<br /><br />I gave up reading the book at this paragraph:<br /><br />\\"She sighed with pleasure at the prospect. With a light heart and a head full of joyous ideas, she danced to the mahogany closet, and - like a magicians's assistant - flung the doors wide open.  Inside, lay a stack of neatly labeled boxes containing the much more attractive lightweight blouses and frocks which signaled the insouciant nature of the next two months\\".<br /><br />At the risk of being repetitive:  Say what?  \\"The insouciant nature of the next two months?\\".....?????  And when she danced to the mahogany closet and flung open the doors, I fully expected her to say, Ta dah!<br /><br />And, oh how cliched are all of her images (except of course, when she is trying to be LITERARY). And I only read 3% of the book!  Think of all the cliched images and overworked LITERARY alusions I have missed!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Super fun! I love learning about the reef rocks fish plants and coral while being creative with my own reef. Love Nemo &amp; his friends  too....I'm addicted!
B005TVYVI2|5.0|I use this for keeping my tempo for running as well as swimming. It does get water in it after daily use in about 3 months. If there was a better way of sealing it, that would be the only improvement.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Great story which I have read in the past. I was happy to be able to add it to my Kindle library.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. Really makes you think of the choices you would make if these circumstances effect your family.
B00BRPH4EC|5.0|I considered giving this 4 stars because the album is too short. I decided against it because it leaves me wanting more, which any good CD should do, Anyway, this is my favorite HIM CD since Razorblade Romance. The overall feel of the album is haunting. It has so much beauty. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't rock, there're plenty pounding rhythms and squealing guitars for you to bang your heads to.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|This was not a good movie. I love Mark and Russel but this movie just sucked. Glad I rented this instead of buying it.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Not bad! Not into comic books or superhero's and thought this would be total cheese but it's pretty good! Ties this character to the eventual Avenger's movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Gameloft is the best game maker aside from the creator of angry birds but i love this game way better than angry birds plus IT
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a beautiful app. Nice music. Fun at any age!  It has a calming affect for me.  very nice
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app works really well if you want to just browse Youtube..... But you can't search for videos. It is so annoying. Unless you want to watch a popular video don't get this app
B004P1JEXE|2.0|It has taken me a long long time to wade through this book and I am normally a fast reader.It doesn't seem to go anywhere and the plot is very tedious. I hate the way that it chops and changes through out  the chapters. Originally I had planned to read the entire serious before making judgement but I don't think I will bother.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I find this book is a bit hurkie jerkie and it is more difficult to keep track of what is happening. There are to many new characters and not enough of the people you have learned to love or hate. Who is dead who is alive and where is everyone?<br />Not as good as the others. I think the author has grown bored with the story and uses more violence as a filler. Too bad as I really looking forward to a good read.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Sega's &quot;Sonic Jump&quot; is a fantastic game. It works smoothly on the Kindle Fire. It is basically Doodle Jump with a twist. You play as Sonic the Hedgehog and you can unlock other players as you go. There is a small &quot;Story Mode&quot; and an &quot;Arcade Mode&quot;. There are missions for you to do as well to keep you busy. Overall it is worth your $0.99.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I like all the Angry Birds games.  The idea of being able, to choose '' how to play ''  was fun and interesting.  It also, was  challenging , playing against other players.  I thought, the idea, of being able to '' buy ''  with the coins you earned, was an added bonus.  Please keep the new games coming !
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the best action game yet, I play it all day and forget all my other games. they should let us connect on twitter too cus not everyone has a facebook
B0072PUC7W|5.0|I am a Baby Boomer.  Born in 1955.  Most of my kind think that music died with Elvis, Beatles, and Buddy Holly.  I like to listen to the newst beats.  The old stuff gets, well, old.  Horrible recording equipment.  Sound is terrible.  Now with a up-graded music system, one can truly appreciate the advances of recording techonology.  While Elvis sounds the same.  Tinny.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very hard to get into, then you ride a wave of mystery and then a complete shutdown at the end.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|A bit melencholy album.  Dido is not known for &#34;happy&#34; songs.  However she wrote this after a break-up.  So it is a bit more of a downer than usual.  Still, easy to listen to.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|Well, it is a classic, so I should have expected the flowery style so removed from what I'm used to.  The homoerotic attraction between characters is almost palpable (if not quite blatant to me), but he manages to focus the attention on the circumstances revolving the... gradual transformation of Dorian.  I enjoyed the whole melodrama a lot in certain places, but I can certainly say the whole business of taking pages to describe the blasted garden and every single flower irked me like you wouldn't understand!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|This album hits the spot of why so many love Rush, it's got the blend of hard-edged guitars and of course Peart's drumming is ever-present as a backbone of the sound.  And Lee's vocals.....sure they're not any better than they were before, his voice has never been something to brag about, but it's a signature &#34;rock&#34; band sound....this band's sound.  And guys admit it....if you were singing, well you'd be no different!  I just love this album.
B0081336FO|5.0|What can I say? Cumberbatch and Freeman are perfect.  Moriarty is an unhinged creeper who's too smart for his own mental health.  The episodes are greatly done and some of them contribute something to the global plot.  The last episode left me wanting for more.when is the next one finally coming!?
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I've been a D.J for over 30 years now. When I say I like all genres of music, it's because it's both true and heartfelt. With that said, I have well over 1,000 albums/LP's/ extended plays and this album portrays the name of the band. When you come to it innocently you feel the artist expressed their vision effortlessly. Some have mentioned Queen, others Elton John. It is pure pop in an age when music is trying to pretend to be something it is not. This album pretends nothing. I like that honesty.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I love to play this to pass the time. Sometimes it's challenging to make the special jewels but it's hard to put it down.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|After reading the beautifully written  but extraordinary book of the Life of Pi, I could not imagine how anyone could make a movie of the story of a young Indian boy trying to survive on a small boat with a tiger! However, this movie is the most amazing and beautifully done movie that I have ever seen!The story is beautiful. It's symbolism gives me the chills.The cinematography is superb!  It is a movie for the whole family to see. How refreshing!
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. I wish it was in English so my younger daughters could've enjoyed it as well.
0385537697|5.0|while it got tired of the sex by the second book my heart had fallen for Christian and was overcome with joy at his happy ending. who dosent love a happy ending?
B00BYKIKJS|2.0|I wasn't impressed or entertained by this movie at all. My wife and daughters felt the same way. We're not sure why all the critics fell in love with the movie. It was depressing and definitely doesn't live up to the hype.
0385537689|5.0|how ever much sex it was it about, i think people are missing the real point. it just entertainment!!!!!!!  let try and stay focused
B005DJREJS|5.0|I loved it!!!! I was enjoying season 2 also under Prime then all of a sudden it was not Prime and want $2.00 a episode! !! Yikes not happy about that!!! But love the show!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is totally wicked I love the graphics of the suits and I love the fact that it-SPOILER ALERT- has every suit you see in the movie this game deserves 6/5 stars
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Persuasion, the title alone carries an hundred fold of meaning and conjecture, but also so much more meaning to anyone's life. What is our life, but a persuasion we have  made; be if from someone else's point of view of us, or our own point of view a  we precieve it to be from another's point of view. All lice is is choices we make, good or bad, but being dependent enough to live them through to their end, that I  What makes, and also the reverse of breaking, us. I believe this to be a very good book to recommend to anyone to read. I greatly enjoyed it!
6300248550|3.0|The moment the adult Jane Eyre appeared on the screen I was stunned that they would cast someone so obviously overweight.  Of course the empire waist is only attractive on a very slender woman and this is not a slender woman. In those costumes she looks pregnant. Way too much bust. And, her neck is so thick. Jane is supposed to be very small and thin.  And, then, there are the ever present lumps on her chin - acne?, moles they choose to cover up with makeup instead of darkening to at least make them appear to be moles (beauty marks).  You may get away with defects like this on a small t.v. screen but when blown up on a 60 inch screen, there they are - larger than life. Of course Timothy Dalton is too handsome for the role but does a good job.  I'm only about 3/4 through the first VHS tape and find Jane's appearance so distracting that it interferes with the enjoyment of the movie.  Adele is too large a child for the role. She is almost as big as the actress portraying Jane. I've seen many  movie versions of this story and find it hard to believe that such an ambitious effort should be so marred by miscasting.  So far, the story seems to be pretty close to the script.  I hope this will continue. I'll continue to watch it but don't think she is going to get any thinner. Every time Rochester refers to her as \\"fairylike\\" or something similar from the book you just want to burst out laughing. I sure am glad I didn't spring for the higher priced DVD but instead bought the much cheaper VHS tapes. LATER: I have now finished looking at this and my opinion remains the same. If it were not for the casting of Jane, this would be my favorite version of the book as it contains most of the last part of the story after Jane leaves Thornfield Hall. Also, Dalton is a very appealing Rochester even if a bit too good looking.  It would appear that this actress is quite short as I always supposed Jane to be but, unfortunately, in these costumes and on the wide screen, she appears to be almost as big around as she is tall. Rather like an elderly Queen Victoria from the back. Take 25 lbs off her and she would fit the role as she has a very nice face with lovely eyes. I would be willing to overlook the large lump on her chin which seemed to appear, disappear then reappear according, I assume, to when certain scenes were shot. SEVERAL DAYS LATER - I looked at this movie on a 2l inch square screen t.v. set and she looks much better. You can still see the lumps on her face but they aren't right there staring at you as they are on a 60 inch screen. And the square screen doesn't make her look so chubby.  This time I enjoyed it but I think any movie should be suitable for a large flat screen t.v. set.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really enjoy the game. But having to either wait months to level up 70 times for gems is ridiculous. Its just setting us up to pay money. But over all, great.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I love it because it protects my kindle in my purse. I love that it doesn't get nasty or dirty easy. Charcoal is a great color.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is not a waste of money I love it lo no yo to but kind happy nineteen 20
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I am so glad i bought this movie. This movie is an emotional roller coaster. Not to spoil it but I cried and I laughed but mostly cried! The movie came fast and it was a good price!
B005779X4U|5.0|I bought this a couple months ago for my apartment kitchen and it has been working great. I like the slow closing lid so after I throw something out, I don't have to worry about the trash anymore. When changing trash bags, you just have to lift the compartment up a bit and it stays there, about 3-4 inches higher than the rim of the stainless steal outside compartment. I don't have to take the inside out or try to hold it up to put in another trash bag. I don't know about you but I found this pretty amazing. The recycling bin is a bit narrow so if you just throw bottles in randomly, you'll run out of room quickly. However, it is tall enough to not be an issue often.<br /><br />My kitchen is rectangular and relatively narrow and small so I was worried about how bulky this would be. However, it fits perfectly along the narrow side wall and doesn't protrude annoyingly. You can also keep the lid open with the small switch on the side.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to manage<br />Convenient design during use and while dumping.<br />Great for narrow kitchens<br /><br />Cons:<br />Narrow recycling.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great convenient design that's good for apartments with a couple of people. It might be a bit small for the waste generation from large families though.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We have all the other seasons so we had to have this one as well. It was not a let down at all. Very funny and i am glad they added 2 more females!
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|My daughter loves these. Easy to put on the wall just need to be careful when pulling them off of the paper.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|This movie has the look of an epic crime movie. Unfortunately it falls short in any sort of cohesive feel. All the actors deliver their lines well, but the editing and overall story line doesn't measure up. Can't blame Sean Penn for failing to deliver, and his one liners sound good by themselves. This explains why the trailer looked so good. All the blame rests on those responsible for taking those great talents and making a memorable film with them. Big let down.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Just wonderful to finally get this on Blu-ray. They did a wonderful job.<br />Still retains the classic film look, not too much noise reduction.<br /><br />I wish My Fair Lady would of been done like this!<br /><br />While you're at it, checkout Hello, Dolly!, which also looks fantastic.<br /><br />I love digital downloads for rentals, but there's something about<br />owning the classics. I also appreciate the low price. To me the<br />big box sets are mostly a waste of time, money and space.<br />Sure they're nice, but who really has time to look at all<br />that bonus material.<br /><br />Frankly if the bonus content was online, that might make more sense.<br />You really only need to look at that once.<br /><br />I say keep the classics coming at a price like this,<br />and with the same quality.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|All though I never same iron man 3 the movie but right of the bat I think this game is better. First I thought it was lame ,but when I got the hang of it I thought this game was awesome. I bet this game is going to be better than the movie I am going to watch right now. Download this awesome game now. You won't regret it
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Every Leonard Cohen fan should have this CD. We bought it for my brother in law and he loved it.
0321127420|5.0|What can possibly a rather young kid such as myself learn from 11 years book /as of 2013/ on architecture of enterprise applications? Well as it turns out, a lot. Even though that most of the Java enterprise systems I have ever seen were already built with Spring or modern Java EE, this was like an adventure to the basics. How it all began. What was before Hibernate, Spring, EJB3 - where did they get inspiration.<br /><br />What really surprised me a lot is that most of the ideas back in 2002 were actually more object-oriented than what we have today. And the book certainly made me rethink some patterns and practices. Arguably, domain-driven-design (according to Martin) was supposed to be a bigger thing than it is today.<br /><br />Today we're surrounded by TONS of frameworks that solve huge amount of things for us, but if you want to have a deep dive back to basics /on the other hand prepare for some level of obsoleteness/, you can't go wrong with this one. And one more thought for the end - even though I have tremendous respect for Martin Fowler's work, I am not very fond of his style of writing. I usually consider it to be too abstract and ... boring. This was not a case in this book.
B00005KB9T|4.0|I was very interested in getting the Deluxe edition with both the original pure recordings done in Jamaica and the doctored up versions done by Chris Blackwell in London, so thought I was getting both discs but instead got only the originally RELEASED Catch  A Fire disc, with the Blackwell-inspired overdubs.  Great stuff on that but be careful if you're ordering Catch A Fire Deluxe to make sure you're going to get both discs.  If I'd gotten both, rating would be 5 stars.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|No, sometimes the actors voices aren't stunningly perfect (yes, Russell Crowe, I'm looking at you),  however the fact that the actors set the tempo and pacing of the song themselves was brilliant. When you give actors as skillful as Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman the ability to pace the song to their emotions, it is now obvious that true magic happens.  If you can accept that this version is about true emotions and story, rather than perfect voices singing perfect songs, then you will love this. If, however, you prefer to have a Fantine slowly walk toward the camera to sing a lovely, stunning,  tearless, and unemotional \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", then look elsewhere.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|With last summer's gargantuan financial and critical slam-dunk of Joss Whedon's THE AVENGERS, it's sure that any film following that from Marvel Studios would have its work cut out for it. And since it was the franchise that paved the way for THE AVENGERS, it's only natural that the film that would be the follow-up would be the third (and perhaps final) film in the IRON MAN series. With expectations extremely high, but a little shaken after the lukewarm response to IRON MAN 2 (which is a film I do really enjoy despite its flaws), people are sure to go in feeling comfortable in seeing star Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the sardonic wit, effortless charm, and supreme snark of Anthony Stark facing off against what fans consider to be his greatest villain, The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley, one of the finest living actors on Earth). And with fresh blood in the director's chair as Shane Black (whose only previous directorial feature was the criminally underrated KISS KISS, BANG BANG, but also is the screenwriter of the first LETHAL WEAPON, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and THE LAST BOY SCOUT) takes over for Jon Favreau, who directed Tony Stark's previous cinematic outings, this seemed sure to be a summer feast for the eyes and ears and mind.<br /><br />But unfortunately, while this film may be somewhat entertaining, both the plot and the star seem to run on autopilot the whole film.<br /><br />The central theme of the film is the answer to the question posed by Captain America to Stark during THE AVENGERS when he asks, \\"Big man in a suit of armor; take that away, what are you?\\" and this film is very determined to give you that answer. The film, also being a direct sequel to THE AVENGERS deals with Tony Stark's frame of mind in regards to the events of that film. He hasn't slept much, and has somewhat severe anxiety attacks whenever anyone brings up the events that almost led to his death in that film. It has alienated him from his girlfriend and CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, returning again), and he has spent all of his non-sleeping creating new armors. Meanwhile, a mysterious Bin Laden-esque terrorist known only as The Mandarin has been setting off explosions all over the world against American targets, prompting Tony's best friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle, reprising his role he took over from Terrence Howard) to don the War Machine armor retrofitted to adopt a gaudy rebranding as The Iron Patriot. Another explosion hits much closer to home, critically wounding Tony's longtime friend and Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Favreau), prompting Tony to hunt The Mandarin himself essentially inviting an attack on his home. Entering the picture at this time are Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall of THE TOWN), an old flame of Tony's and bioengineering expert and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), rival scientist for Advanced Idea Mechanics, who are both working on a project called Extremis. Tony's newest armor, the Mark 42, fails after the attack on his home, Pepper is kidnapped by The Mandarin, and Tony is forced to rely on his intellect and his savvy to make it to the final confrontation between him and the forces of The Mandarin, where, naturally, the free world hangs in the balance.<br /><br />There are many things about this film that work: The snappy patter in this film is golden, and that's Black's bread-and-butter, if you've ever seen any of the films he's done; Ben Kingsley is absolutely magnetic as The Mandarin; and sequences like the Malibu house attack and parts of the second act where Stark is armorless and the scenes with Tony and Rhodey as they do the Riggs/Murtaugh prototypical buddy action stuff are terrific. However, for everything they do that's right, there's an equivalent number of things that go wrong. First, there is a very distinct lack of Pepper Potts in this film, and that loses big points right there. Black is someone that has never written women particularly well, and tends to use them more as damsels-in-distress rather than fully fleshed-out characters. Black does do a bit of a turn-around at the end with Pepper, but it seems like it was shoe-horned in. Secondly, there are some parts where the effects look downright clunky, but that's seldom. Also the second act is a MAJOR slog to get through, and the sequence where Stark has to MacGyver his way out of an assassin's grasp, while clever, feels very inorganic. The two most troublesome parts, though, are A: the autopilot that Downey is on as Stark, and B: the almost complete absence of actual plot. Tony Stark has become, for better or worse, Downey Jr's definitive role and he wears it brilliantly, but here in IM3, he seems like he's coming in for a visit to this character rather than living in it. Also, what's really going on in this film? Once a huge reveal is made about The Mandarin, the audience is left with far too little information. Why is this group doing all these things? How do certain players really fit in? What's their ultimate motivation? In the first film, Obidiah Stane wanted power. In the second, Vanko wants revenge and Justin Hammer wants the spotlight. Here, the villains seem to exist solely for the purpose of having a villain to fight, and that's just not enough.<br /><br />Black's direction is much more confident in the non-effects oriented scenes, and the final battle sequence is far too spastic to maintain any focus, and the fate that meets one of the main characters that is meant to shock really doesn't provide any shocks. Yet, everything is wrapped up in a neat enough package and we get a post-credits sequence that, while hilariously funny, does nothing to continue setting up the future of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. There are some nice easter eggs for Marvel fans, such as the existence of Advanced Idea Mechanics and Roxxon, but neither are utilized for full effect. And Marvel and Iron Man fans are likely to be very disappointed by the big reveal of The Mandarin. I understand why, to an extent, this was done, and I found it alternately clever and frustrating, which sums up this film perfectly.<br /><br />There's a lot of cleverness to IRON MAN 3 and it's not a terrible film, but ultimately, the film is undone by its own cleverness and that leads to a great deal of frustration in seeing what this film could have been rather than the bloated spectacle it is.<br /><br />2.5 out of 5 stars.msels-in-distress rather than fully fleshed-out characters.

B0019N95IK|2.0|Although I'm financially pleased I won't have to double-dip, it was a major disappointment to check the picture of the episodes. I only watched the pilot and the following episode and to me the whole thing seemed up-converted, and I mean every scene and not only the special effects which were originally rendered in standard definition. If you rate the Next Generation Blu-rays 10 and Enterprise DVDs 5, the Enterprise Blu-rays would be at best 5.5.<br /><br />I only hope that Paramount didn't do it intentionally so they have an excuse not to release Deep Space Nine and Voyager when the Enterprise Blu-rays don't sell as much as the classic series or TNG.<br /><br />So if you're planning on buying this I'd suggest that you rent it first and find for yourself if it's worth the purchase. I gave this review 2 stars in respect for the show, which I really like, but the quality of the image, especially if you consider the other Star Trek shows already released on Blu-ray, is insulting.<br /><br />-------------------UPDATE-------------------<br /><br />Following the suggestion of another customer, I checked another episode further ahead, and although the picture does improve, I'd give it a 7.5, which doesn't come near the results they had on TOS or TNG, so I still humbly maintain that it isn't worth the upgrade unless you are really interested in the new extras or if you have money to burn. Therefore my original conclusion stands.

I can however say that I was hooked from the start and found it nearly impossible to put the book down. I highly recommend anyone contemplating reading it to do so. It's a wonderful journey that wouldn't disappoint you.

The book also gives non-business owners a glimpse of what it's like to start and run a business. The bottom line is it takes a lot of hard work, long hours and a passion for business, there are no shortcuts.

0061950726|4.0|The first orphan train book I read was James Magnusson's 1979 novel, Orphan Train. Before then I'd never heard the stories, but by the 1990s orphans and their train experiences had become common knowledge, made public by a spate of novels for both adult and young readers, with occasional nonfiction first-person accounts.<br /><br />In Orphan Train, Christina Baker Kline reports that between the 1850s and the early 1920s, an estimated 250,000 homeless children were relocated from cities such as Boston and New York City mostly to the Midwest, in a welfare movement led by the Children's Aid Society and, later, the Foundling Hospital in New York. Some may not be aware of the wide-ranging scope of the orphan-train movement, and this will come as a surprise.<br /><br />Orphans were put on the trains to find new families in the West; they were paraded before townsfolk in small towns, and some were chosen to be farm hands and household servants; others re-boarded the trains and went to the next towns. Those that repeatedly re-boarded the train sometimes ended up in Texas. Riding these trains was a grim experience, and reading about it was often equally so.<br /><br />Vivian, featured in Orphan Train, wrote late in the novel, \\"This bad thing happened, and this--and I found myself on a train--and this bad thing happened, and this...\\" Vivian was an Irish girl (counselors say her ethnicity and red hair worked against her) whose family, so she believed, perished in a fire. On the train, Vivian cared for an infant named Carmine, who was later taken out of her arms by new parents, and she met Dutchy, a street boy as hardened as she.<br /><br />Kline deftly relieves the grim monotony in Orphan Train by introducing a second story, that of Molly, a foster teenager in Bar Harbor, Maine, where Vivian, now a rich ninety-year-old widow, lives alone in a huge mansion. Molly, a Penobscot Indian whose dad died in an accident and whose mom retreated into a world of drugs, is rebellious and anti-social, hiding behind a Goth manner and appearance with streaked, spiky hair and outrageous makeup. Molly is arrested for stealing a copy of Jane Eyre from the public library. (It was, she says later, the most battered of three copies and she figured no one would miss it, to which Vivian responds they should have given her an award.) Molly ends up in court, faced with either juvvie or community service. She is given the latter, and assigned to help Vivian clear out her attic.<br /><br />The grim story of Vivian is interrupted by frequent flash forwards to the story of Vivian and Molly. At first Molly resents the chores. Gradually, with Vivian exerting no pressure or control, Molly's attitude begins to change. She does well in school; she looks forward to Vivian.s visits. And she discovers that, with her computer skills, she can help Vivian unlock secrets of the past she thought forever gone.<br /><br />No spoilers here; both Vivian's early train riding life and Molly's contemporary life take dramatic changes which eventually find Molly living with Vivian, ushering Vivian into the computer age. Each has wrought a great change in the other.<br /><br />Orphan Train gets off to a slow start, but the reader who stays with it through grim train rides and separations from loved ones that break hearts will be reassured that sometimes life does work out for the best. Orphan Train is, above all, a novel about redemption, beautifully written in flawless prose.<br /><br />by Judy Alter<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about womennti-social, hiding behind a Goth manner and appearance with streaked, spiky hair and outrageous makeup.

B000NI8F5G|5.0|Generally, I am not a fan of movie. Especially I do not really enjoy old English/American movies that much because I wasn't brough up here my whole life. I had to watch this movie because I am in an orchestra of the musical, but I really did enjoy watching this movie. Personally thinking, Singin' In the Rain is one of the well-made movies I have ever watched. The general cast was pretty well-selected and they were very entertaining. I particularly really enjoyed Gene Kelly's tap dancing. It visualizes a part of American History when talkies were invented during the 30s.<br />I highly recommend that you watch this movie; however, if you hate romance movies, then you probably will hate this one too. The only thing I really hated about this movie was its obvious storyline, but the cast and all the flamboyance concealed the jaded plot. Thus, even if you hate romance movies, you still might want to watch it because it is worth your time and is a great opportunity to indirectly experience the culture of 30s.

Special mention must also be given to the brief but delightful performance of Jack Elam at thee beginning of the film.  All in all an unforgettable motion picture - and one that MUST be seen in HD.
0142412147|4.0|Kay, I read this, like, two month after Christmas. And I still loved it! The stories intertwine cleverly and the authors different writing styles compliment each others perfectly.<br /><br />The stories and characters are both funny and heartwarming. Personally, my favorite story was the last part by Lauren Myracle, The Patron Saint of Pigs. Just hearing the name makes you smile, and I was smiling through out this whole story!<br /><br />The first story is about Jubilee. Her whole Christmas is kind of a fiasco. Stuck in a weird town, with a train full of cheerleaders, and her parents are in jail, plus a boyfriend crisis. This story was probably my least favorite, just because the romance seems uber quick.<br /><br />The next story, by John Green, claims second place. It seemed to drag in some place, but still funny and sweet... And a lot of immature boys who ruin their car to go see cheerleaders. My favorite characters in this were either The Duke or Tobin.<br />The Duke is this girl who has hung out with the boys for forever, but has yet to feel that anyone has noticed she is actually a girl. And Tobin, who is noticing Duke as a girl for the first time, and has to remind himself they are just friends. Duke is cool and confident, traits I like. And all the characters have hilarious comments!<br /><br />The third story, my favorite, is about a girl missing her old boyfriend. And, to try to deserve him, tries to be less self centered. Also, her friend just got a little pig. Sooo cute! This story is extremely enjoyable and a breezed through it, or should I say blizzarded? (PS that's not a word, I know) Also, you visit old characters from the two previous stories and learn more yummy back story!<br /><br />A lot of characters, places, gossip and more are intertwined between all three stories, leaving the readers charmed.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|The suspense builds as the story unfolds; I had to read faster and faster.  The story is told with the juxtaposition of &#34;past&#34; and &#34;present.&#34;  Once you get into this routine, it works very well.  I don't want to give away too much, but will say the plot revolves around a woman suffering from OCD and PTSD and the scary man who causes these conditions.  It is all very well constructed.  Read it if you like suspense and can handle the violent sex.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The Nemo's Reef game. Is the best game ever. I would defenitly recomemd this game to anyone. I think that everyone should play this game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very interesting. I really likes this book a lot. Tons of action and the plot was great. I highly recommend.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|recommended by a friend. fell in love from the very first scene. characters are well developed and the acting is just outstanding. the story line is just a little bit out there.
030758836X|2.0|Let me be upfront and say this is not my typical read, and my negative reaction to this book was more because it was not a good reader/book fit, than because the book was badly written.<br /><br />On the morning of Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary, Amy disappears. Was she abducted by a stranger, a man from her past, killed by her angry husband, or something else? Through Nick's narration, Amy's diary, step by step the reader finds a tangle of negatives leading to bad choices and carefully laid plans.<br /><br />The writing does an excellent job of building the suspense, it is interesting and often terrifying simply because the suspense is so tight. The twists are really curvy and unexpected and creates an interesting, tightly-woven plot.<br /><br />But the characters.... oh, how I hope I never meet any real-life versions of the characters. They are just all unlikeable, unsympathetic people who deserve every bad thing that happens to them, or they are lesser, two-dimensional characters. Flynn's characters are all so deeply flawed there seems to be no spark of humanity for the reader to empathize with.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Really excellent! If you haven't read the book, this season follows the highlights really well. Can't wait to see season 3!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a great movie. We watch it over and over again! It's rated PG-13, but the only bad thing we noticed was the language.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I've been to Ireland a lot of times and this book epitomizes the country Ireland that I know and love. I've never been to Dublin or Belfast because it's the wonderful people in the country that are the beauty of Ireland! This book is precious. It made me laugh, cry, and feel horror at the same time! Great entertainment!
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|Upon introduction, this looks like a game fit for the casual gamer with really cute graphics. However, that is where it shall end for me. For the intensity of the game it would seem that 99 cents is a steal, but it is the manufacturer of this app that is actually doing so. I am never for apps that are created to obtain information about anything on my phone. You do not need to place a thumbnail on my phone to decipher what I am doing, what I am running and a vague 'etc' -- none of that is your business or of your concern, and holds no bearing on the playing capability of this game. I will pass.
B0047747A6|5.0|I loved reading Moonwalk! It was exciting for me to read about Michael Jackson & who he was behind his music
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Took a little while to make sense of this game having never played a card- sidling type of game before, but after I got the hang of it, Ive found it difficult to put down. There seem to be a few server glitches that have closed my games down, and I don't get the&quot; fake welcome screen &quot; thing. Other than that its quite entertaining.

B0002W19KQ|5.0|There are 2 Les Miserables \\"types\\": the musicals, and those that portray the novel in it's literary intent by the author. As far as the latter, for my input, nothing compares to this version. Before you buy it, MAKE SURE YOUR PLAYER WILL PLAY \\"REGION 2\\" DVD'S.<br />I saw this version on Fox Movie Channel around 2000-2001 and was mesmerized by it. I HAD to have it and when I finally found it back then in Europe I bought a player (the Oppo unit) that plays it.<br />One can see from this production why Gerard Depardieu is revered in Europe. His portrayal of Jean Valjean is stellar from the hard ex-con, winding through life to the kind, sacrificing, loving giant, and protector of the sweet Cosette. The final scene with them will break your heart when he thinks he is seeing an angel as he is dying.<br />Imagine for a moment what kind of a persistent hound John Malkovich is as inspector Javert who would imprison his own mother for walking on the wrong side of the street. When he speaks in this film, you are taken aback.<br />Fantine's character played by Charlotte Gainsbourg is done so well that it's actually a hard watch seeing what she has to endure.<br />Marius is wonderful with his initial infatuation and later obsession with Cosette and finally with how he treats her so tender and lovingly as she so richly deserved.<br />I could go on and on but if you know the novel, every aspect of it here will captivate you. If you are a \\"deep\\" type, you will have several tear sessions and this DVD will become one of your cherished possessions. I think it is 3 hours, maybe a little more but that gives the director the leeway to keep important detail intact. Some will say it is too long. If you're into the intimate detail in scenes, you will enjoy every minute.<br />This Les Miserables version is not a musical, it is not a scaled down version, it is not a \\"Hollywoodish\\" (for lack of a better term) version. It is a reference standard of the novel that will leave a permanent impression in your heart and mind. Unreservedly recommended with the highest respect.on in your heart and mind. Unreservedly recommended with the highest respect.

B0045NXMMQ|5.0|Did you HUGO?  If so ...you will see that the designer precedent was MIC MACS and other films by the great team of director  Jean Pierre Jeunet and designer Marc Caro ( Amelie, City of Lost Children , Delicatessen....)<br /> These guys are the best team going at present and MIC MACS will prove to be a classic.<br /> A must see!

B00881PTRC|4.0|This is the old  'hangman'  game with some clever hangman cartoons.  Love to watch the poor guy sweat while I try to come up with the correct letters for the puzzle.  So far, I have only tried two categories of words, animals and winter/christmas.  Some of the animals were unknown to me but I still managed to fill in the blanks.  I think my grandkids will also enjoy this game .
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Should have bought the original soundtrack..  Not everyone can sing ;(  Didn't realize this when I ordered the CD.  Otherwise, no problems.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is very handy for timing anything.  I use it for cooking & short naps.  You can time several items at once when you are cooking and I have found it to be accurate.  I suspect that I will find more uses for it but really have not  had it long enough yet to test and experiment with it.  It is simple to operate.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|its soooooo cute and I LOVE LOVE LOVE nemo!! download this for sure!! I think everyone should have this adorable game!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Downloaded this book to my Kindle as it had been suggested to me by Amazon. Didn't expect great things; however, was pleasantly surprised as it was fantastic. Superb Irish wit which I'm sure must be written for the English reader. Parts made me laugh out loud whereas at the end I had tears in my eyes. Although written as fiction it is also based on reality. Came away thinking how a little kindness can go along way. Congratulations to the author  . . . please, please let us know what happens next!
B008476HBM|5.0|love it! a wonderful classic that everyone should have on their shelf. A look into history and love through a very talented writer
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson did will with his 3 book treatment of the WOT ending and AMOL is a great final chapter.<br /><br />While at times it seemed to simple for a WOT book, I had to keep remembering that this was about the Last Battle and it would have been unreal for key characters not to die or have major changes (no spoilers - you could guess that SOMEONE would die)
B00947N6D8|5.0|Totally an awesome movie, because the Easter Bunny is a tall jerk-ish kind of guy played by Hugh Jackman. Awesome :D
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|kept you at the edge of your seat all through the movie,great to be able to down load on laptop etc..
B00A83075M|5.0|I love this movie :D No other review needed, because it's awesome all on it's own. Unless you need four more words for the review...
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I would recommend this app to everyone. This is definitely worth the money I paid for it. It is very fun to play and you will soon get addicted to it. Overall, I LOVE it!!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Honestly, one of the most moving and beautiful musicals ever written. I love the controversy, the constant misery that the people seem to go through. I suppose that's how it got it's name, hmm?<br /><br />(please note that the last part of the above comment is slightly sarcastic)
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Nice take on card games. Fun to play and a little bit addictive. Multiple hero's to choose from and a good selection of cards and strategies to choose from. Would definitely recommend to friends.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|It requires a great deal of space to play. All the reviews I read were fab so I tried it but my poor lil tablet can't handle the memory for it.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so so fun it makes me wanna keep on playing it its a perfect fun game the whole family wil lenjoy
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love these kinds of games interactive and building. It's really quite fast paced and the more you play it the more you can build it up. But that's also what i don't like about it. Some things take time and then all you're doing is waiting and tapping to collect. You can only go out and 'collect' animals every so often, and without real money there's only a 50/50 chance you'll rescue them. Good for checking in and then checking out.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Johnny Depp  ontinues to display his comedic acting skills while stickimng pretty close to the vampire ledgend. Thouroughly enjoyed the film.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game has some great graphics but, in my opinion its more for kids. They have all sorts of types of animals which makes it really neat.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The app itself is very informative.  It even updates your google calendar with a 2 week temp forecast.  Only issue I have is the notifications that the app sends.  I uninstalled the app on my phone to help with battery life, and besides I have beautiful widgets which provide the same information as AccuWeather .  I do recommend this app to anyone who doesn't mind a daily, sometimes twice daily(one notification for the days weather, and another one later in the night that provides the following days forecast,  This can get rather annoying at times, however I believe you can disable it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game! It is perfect for all ages. I got it for my six year old and I ended up playing it just about as much as he does.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|It's easy to resent very wealthy, successful people. It's even easier to resent them if they are women. The author's privileged upbringing has caused some to question her credibility for writing this book. Before questioning her upbringing we should first ask whether the book is effective, does it ask the right questions and expose the important issues? I'd say yes. This book is a call to arms for working women. Sandberg respects hard data, so her book is packed with up to date numbers on gender driven studies. We need to know these numbers, for that alone I am glad this book was written.<br /><br />Her strong support for working women rings loud and clear, as does her respect for stay at home moms. It doesn't have to be one or the other, it's possible to believe in all and make room for everyone to make their own choice. But for those of us who are career-driven, she gives a renewed rally cry that we go for it and takes a good stab at absolving any guilt we may have.<br /><br />I like the thoroughness of the book, that it covers such a wide range of topics relevant to women's challenges: communication issues, innate gender behaviors, many aspects of workplace culture, marriage, motherhood and more..<br /><br />I am also happy she addressed the following issues, which I consider to be more recent issues that stress women out:<br /><br />-the &#34;intensive mothering&#34; phenomenon.<br />-perfectionism and the &#34;having it all&#34; myth.<br />-women being competitive with each other and the 'queen bee' attitude - that there is only room for one at the top so the successful ones don't help the others.<br /><br />My only complaint is that she is too self deprecating. Her personal story is woven throughout the book.  At times the book felt a bit too confessional.  I respect her, I don't need her to take her self down a couple notches in order to like her. She's a powerful woman, she should own it.<br /><br />Sandberg has had tons of help throughout her life. Why should anyone be criticized for 'having help'?  She should be praised for proper use of her help. Plenty of people born in to rich families become unproductive people because they misuse their resources. Sandberg is successful because she did the right things along the way with the gifts that were handed to her. Good for her.<br /><br />This book is an easy read, accessible to many and most importantly, delivers a strong message in support of career-driven women. Bravo Sheryl!ld anyone be criticized for 'having help'?  She should be praised for proper use of her help.

B009NG1Q96|3.0|So there's this thing where the 2nd book of a dystopian trilogy is the wishy-washy romance book. I don't know why, but it always seems to be that way. Romances that were strong in book 1 suddenly become weak for seemingly dumb reasons or the barely existent love triangle suddenly becomes very strong.<br /><br />I loved The Selection, which I read overnight. The Elite took me a few days, still faster than I've been reading lately, but it was not the gripping read that The Selection was for me.<br /><br />I found myself frustrated with America's indecisiveness. In The Selection, the love triangle was presented perfectly. America starts out with Aspen, who breaks up with her because he doesn't want to bring her down to his lower caste right before she gets selected. Then we get a focus on Maxon for quite a long time. Aspen comes back at the exact right time, late in the book, and the love triangle never reaches that level of back and forth that can so often be annoying. That was saved for book 2.<br /><br />What most annoyed me was how many times America assumed that whatever Maxon was doing meant he was sending her home when it was so clear that he'd do anything for her. My favorite of these is when she sees him clearly asking her dad for her hand in marriage and she thinks he's telling her dad she's about to be eliminated. There were times when I can totally understand why America was upset at Maxon, but other times she was completely being unreasonable. When she outright rejects him, of course he has no choice but to search for an alternative. And, wait, what is America complaining about? She has an alternative guy too.<br /><br />So, then there's Aspen. It's one thing for the two of them to have a secret romance when the consequences of being found out (death, btw) are just words on a piece of paper. But they see what happens when one girl is found in a relationship with a guard: the punishment is lowered to being caned and becoming Eights (beggars). All of a sudden Mr. I Can't Marry You and Lower Your Caste is perfectly willing to risk both of them being cast into the lowest caste level there is, as well as both him and America being physically punished for it? This is not the guy who would do anything for her. I'm pretty much dreading the inevitable moment when Maxon figures out what's going on behind his back.<br /><br />There are some things I think this book did well. It upped the conflict a lot. There were more rebel attacks, including some where America doesn't get to the royal safe room. The aforementioned caning scene was seriously intense. There's a physical fight between two girls. The contestants are given tests to prove their worthiness of becoming the princess. And we the readers have actual reason to think Maxon might pick another girl. Furthermore, we find out some things about Maxon and his family. And Maxon has a truly righteous telling off of America late in the book, which really saved the whole wishy-washy romance for me, haha.<br /><br />World-building still is lacking, but except for some excerpts in the diary of the first king of Illea, which basically had me scratching my head to understand their relevance, it didn't really bother me. Oh, and the names, I guess, which it turned out were somehow related to the history. But seriously horrible names, folks.<br /><br />So, overall, not as gripping as The Selection, even though with the heightened stakes, it had so much potential for it.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of: The Selection, the wishy-washy romance second book of dystopian trilogies, love triangles, heightened conflict in sequels
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Just perfect romance drama book just the kind that I like , very happy. I most def recommend this book to all those that loved 50 shades but had less of the sex.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck It Ralph was a much better movie than I thought it would be.  It was funny, fast-paced, and it dealt with sensitive issues deftly:  loneliness, rejection and exclusion.<br /><br />No heavy-handed lessons, just a spirited duo, an unlikely pair of helpers and an ironic mantra from an unorthodox self-help group.<br /><br />This movie works on more than one level and there are comic elements for all ages.  Overall a very good family movie.

It really worked well for me.

She has the most integrity and I hope and pray she gets together with Mr. Carson next season--or someone other nice gentleman. She certainly deserves it. I was horrified by the the cliff hanger of Matthew dying in that horrendous car accident. Poor Mary and the baby...... Episode 1 of Season 4 will be chilling!  Long live Downton Abbey!

0385349831|4.0|I would have enjoyed this book much more if there had been a real story in it.  Instead, it was just a collection of proverbs, aphorisms, and wise sayings.  Many of them I enjoyed since they represent eternal truths, however, I think they would have had more power and punch if it was tied into a story with characters that the reader would come to know, love, and care about.<br /><br />Not a bad little book, just be warned that you are not buying a novel.

B008JFUO72|5.0|\\"My husband and I watched and enjoyed both the first and the second Iron man films when they were released to the movie theaters.  The action gets even better in Iron Man 3 and returns with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow reprising their dynamic couple persona (in a regal way) of Tony Stark and Virginia Potts.  The character of Tony Stark ends up having dealings in Switzerland and Tennessee at different time periods.  Don Cheadle plausibly returns in the essential role as Tony Stark's right hand man.  The characters of Dr.Maya Hansen (played in a cunning way by Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (attentively played by Guy Pearce) indirectly contribute to the plot unfoldment as well as endurance of the union between Tony Stark and Virginia Potts.
B003WE9TU8|2.0|The way the book is written starts out as a plus but becomes increasingly monotonous as the book goes on. The first third of the book hooks the reader in on the terrible events in the format of a historical event. But the book keeps jumping around the world and different events and I lost interest.<br />There is no central character or characters and so it just becomes short stories of different people we have no attachment to. The movie will be totally different to the book.
B00CM96A60|5.0|As mentioned in some of my previous reviews, I discovered the music sounds of Armin Van Buuren in 2009 (via a public library) when I was still living in Orlando, Florida. Naturally, obtaining and hearing this \\"Intense\\" collection symbolizes a continuation of my interest in his music. There is a harmonic balancing and blending of trance and vocals within these musical tracks.  I am completely aware that personal song preferences from \\"Intense\\" are going to be subjective depending on the person. However,  \\"Intense\\" (feat. Miri Ben Ari), \\"This Is What It Feels Like\\" (feat. Trevor Guthrie), \\"Beautiful Life\\" (feat. Cindy Alma), \\"Waiting For The Night\\" (feat. Fiora), \\"Sound of the Dreams\\" (feat. Laura Jansen), \\"Alone\\" (feat. Lauren Evans), \\"Turn This Love Around\\" (feat. Laura V.), \\"Won't Let You Go\\" (feat. Aruna), \\"Forever Is Ours\\" (feat. Emma Hewitt), and \\"Humming The Lights\\" (Armin Van Buuren & Gaia) are some of the multiple songs on this collection that are great to listen to right away.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really loved this one.  All his books are good but this is the very best.  Don't want to say too much about the plot, but it never stops; and the characters are all believable.  Truly enjoyedit.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly knowledgeable about Mr. Tesla life and experiences. I also found the book a little inspiring with  all of the quotes and the manner the intro was written and look forward to reading his next book. I read this book in one sitting and found it was worth the read. Hope this review is helpful.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|This is the worst. I want to install TV Portal on my SmartStick. Since it is only available from Amazon I am forced to use their app.<br />It won't let me download and install TV Portal. My only hope is that TV Portal will move back to Google Play.
0156027321|4.0|Overall an EXCELLENT book. Very much enjoyed the introduction and early chapters - little slow in the middle hence the 4 star rating - and then BAM!  The last chapter is eloquent, beautifully written, and makes you say WOAH!  I recommend this book, and encourage readers to make it through to the end (even if it involves some skimming to get there).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game because my granddaughter said I should get it, but since I started playing...I cant get enough of it!  The graphics are vibrant & fun; the daily challenges & missions keep you coming back for more.  Especially love the Tokyo edition.  Keep the fun coming!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best book ever. The intimate parts are really detailed. I wanna read the third. I couldn't put the book down
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game, it is so much fun, keeps me trying to get them piggy's from laughing. Get them piggy's
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Very funny and I loved it, even though it was set in England. Loved the romance and the trouble she always found herself in.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|JOHN GREEN DID IT AGAIN I FREAKING CAN'T SUCH A GOOD BOOK WITH ONLY HAPPY FEELS I PROMISE. (i'm lying a little bit)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great book that everyone can find something to relate to. I think that teens should read this book becouse their is so much knowledge to take in.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book could have been a lot more exciting if it wasn't so repetitive.  The story of her waking up every morning not remembering anything was repeated too many times, and I got bored with it.  I did read to the finish to find out what happened to her, and the ending was good.
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|this brad nailer is very well built and shoots brads all day with no problems it is a pleaser to use
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|The story lines were so thought provoking and entertaining.  Now as then, these are classic and timeless shows and I wonder how many of today's shows will meet that standard?<br /><br />For those who grew up with this, the collection is a treasure.  For those discovering it for the first time, they'll enjoy them for a long long time- as we have.  &#34;Live long and prosper&#34;
1476734941|4.0|This book is like the companion guide to the documentary. It contains all of the basic facts about the 5:2 diet and plenty of useful recipes and color photos to get you thinking about fast-day foods. It is light on the scientific studies (which are available elsewhere), and instead focuses on being a more practical handbook for the dieter.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This was a great gem of a film. Seth Rogen sure lucked out to have Barbra as his screen mom. She delivers an Oscar worthy performance within a film that could otherwise have been utterly forgettable.  She really does raise the caliber and content of this film, and even makes Seth look like a better actor than he truly is.  Her performance is heartwarming, nuanced and top-shelf.  it's like an acting master class.  Remember, there are no small parts, only small actors.  Actors with real talent, raise the caliber of every film and every part they play, which is exactly what Babs does here.<br /><br />This is actually a perfect Mother's Day movie.  It's all about a mom who loves her boy to a fault, and knows best, even when it seems like she's downright loony. Very touching.  Buy it for your mom, then sit down and watch it with her.  You'll both love it.
B003TY3F06|5.0|TRUE romance!<br /><br />With such an amazing cast of unpredictable, fun and wild characters and the award winning talent portraying them, this film was absent from my life for far too long. Having said that, as an older viewer now, as opposed to 1993, I appreciate and enjoy seeing this phenomenal cast as much as the intriguingly classic and wild story delivered.  Like looking at pictures for the first time of friends from high school.  Newly nostalgic.  I love it!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|We just watched this again tonight from our [[ASIN:B0084I9QI2 Bad 25]] boxed set, and this concert is full throttle energy and talent from lights up, to curtain call. MJ just makes my heart soar. And ache. And cry. And Love. What a concert. And what a beautiful human being. KoP, undisputed and forever. Watch it. You'll be entertained, moved and inspired.
0060557818|5.0|It's no surprise to anyone who's ever read anything by Neil Gaiman that he's a master of words. Actually, he wields words like a sword or a feather, crafting a feeling about a thing that one never realized they should, could or might feel.<br /><br />\\"His skin felt clammy, and his eyes felt like they had been put in their sockets wrong, while his skull gave him the general impression that someone had removed it while he had slept and swapped it for another two or three sizes too small.\\"<br /><br />And then there are the characters he... illuminates. Because reading his stories, one gets the feeling the characters actually exist - have always been there, just outside the average person's realm of \\"normal\\" - and it's only with Gaiman's introduction that we finally get to meet them.<br /><br />\\"The boy has the towering arrogance only seen in the greatest of artists and all nine-year-old boys.\\"<br /><br />That single sentence description introduces a very minor player in a story filled with much bigger personalities, and yet it's the kind of truth that gives the boy more substance than many people we see every day.<br /><br />And that's the thing Neil Gaiman does with his stories, with Neverwhere. He gives wonderful, horrible, magical substance to things normally associated with dreams and nightmares, with the almost-real, the could-be-possible, and the only-seen-by-small-children-and-dogs.<br /><br />Neverwhere is a story of good and evil, of above and below, seen and unseen, real and more real, and of a quest to find what was lost and lose what was found. It's a fairytale and a true story and the kind of book one reads again and again, just for the pleasure of the words.<br /><br />(Shrugs as if it says all that needs to be said) It's Neil Gaiman.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I started reading JRR Tolkiens books when I was 7 and I love this movie so much I watch it once a week.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I have the physical game and I love it. This is great because half of the game time with the physical copy is setting up the tiles. Here it is already done for you and you have different layout options to choose from. The AI is also really good with three difficulty settings to choose from. Fantasy Flight Games did a great job with this one.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love it.  Haven't finished the season yet but so far (6 episodes) it's great.  We couldn't wait  for season three to come to Netflix so we bought it. Pricey but better than iTunes.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The story is compelling; the sense of danger and chaos is effectively portrayed and delivers a chilling effect. Affleck's understated performance seems very realistic and allows viewers to feel more of the drama for themselves.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Awesome game, ton of throw backs to games of my youth and great music. Definitely worth a purchase for a buck.
B002TWWOHE|4.0|I find the plot of this series to be interesting and very entertaining.  It keeps you interested, although at times it does get a bit silly.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I am a cat person so having one that I can carry with me is great!  I need to learn more about how to make him react!
B001DM1VXE|2.0|This movie struck me as one in the &#34;artsy&#34; vein. I am sure there is a set of cinema critics that loved it, but for me it is all about escaping and enjoying. I had to work too hard to follow this plot and consequently missed out on the enjoyment.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|an awesome halo movie. a must have for anyone who loves the halo video games. i strongly recommend this product
B008IYR2BA|5.0|After viewing Dexter much of TV's offerings are going to have to try harder to please us. I have witnessed TV at its best
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|but I didn't like the sets and costumes and the directing.  It was just ridiculous.  I like fantasy and sci-fi and mystery, so it's not that I have to have reality.  It wasn't for me.
B005D63ICI|5.0|one Dexter is just as good as the next. I admire the long lost art of no cheap shots, really imaginative writng
B00CATSONE|1.0|This book is more of a teaser to the author's self help work than any real coverage of Nikola Tesla.  I got it free and it was scarcely worth the price of admission.  I read the entire work in less than two hours.  One third of the book is an introduction full of quotes and name drops from people such as Malcolm Gladwell or Mark Twain that had little relevance to the text.  My high school history book contained nearly as much information on Tesla as this book.  If you know absolutely nothing about Tesla and the dramatic conspiracies against him, read the wikipedia article.  It has much more about the man and his life than this book.  Tesla is a fascinating figure and I highly recommend anyone interested in our scientific heritage learn more about his life and work.
B00000IQBM|5.0|I did not purchase this for me, it was for my brother, and him still collecting cassette tapes, VHS and SNES stuff.
B008RTE08E|3.0|I will always love the Beatles and true love never dies.  But this movie is a mess!  The only thing I really liked was the song I am the Walrus and the video type play that went with it.  Im glad I have it to complete my collection but it's not very good
6305922756|5.0|I love when people mock the 80's hair bands and stuff like that, so this was definitely a movie for me.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis deserved an Oscar for the performance given in this movie.  What the movie was about was not the civil war but the politics behind getting the 13th amendment passed and making all slavery illegal.  If youre into political manervers and behind the scenes politicking, this is the movie for you
B00275EGWY|5.0|I liked how the movie was dircted. It expounded on challenges faced by the USA military men and women in battle. Nicepicture and very real!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Couldn't stop watching.  Riveting!  Am now awaiting Season 4.  The story is fabulous as is the cast.  I am totally hooked.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I love this game! Bought for my daughter who can keep up with the boys on all the apps but I am clueless!! This is very real to me since I only had the actual pinball game to play growing up. I do not do the arcade themed restaurants (Chucky Cheese, etc.). We have a great little restaurant that still has an old pinball but she dreads spending all her quarters! It is just nice to have a bit of my past incorporated into a game as well as to hear &#34;Wow Mom, you can do this game!&#34;
B006M4F67A|5.0|Easy to play and very clear on the Kindle Fire HD. No lagging or any other issues. Will buy full version
0743270754|5.0|Absolutely compelling and interesting. You will not be able to put this book down. It is long, but it needs to be in order to cover the enormous amount of material dealing with Lincoln and the men closest to him.<br />There are many books about Abraham Lincoln, but with a book like this one, there is always room for one more.<br />Very informative and riveting.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|;First few chapters are a little slow but once the story begins it's enthralling.  Very well written; good character development.
0307346617|3.0|OK STORY<br />Some of the stories were just not interesting, but others were good.  This is a strange way to tell of a war.  I think it could have been much better.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I save my 5 star ratings for things like Downton Abbey, but this series is quite good. It has some interesting characters and good acting. It's fun to see Brendan Coyle play a very different role than that of Mr. Bates in Downton, and I really enjoy Claudie Blakley who plays his wife in this series (you might remember her from the Cranford series or as Elizabeth Bennett's friend in Pride and Prejudice). If you watch much British TV period pieces, you'll recognize many of these actors. There are some really lovely outdoor scenes that one doesn't see much on TV in America.  Check it out and see what you think.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I liked all the stories I have seen so far.  Lots of good humor.  Getting hard to see where the relationship between Castel and Beckett is going.  It was lots of fun watching it develop over the series.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I get into playing and can't stop. It's  alot of fun. You shoild try it. It definitely make the time fly.
0399160450|4.0|Good story.  I enjoyed the writing.  The story never slowed down enough to lose interest.  I always wanted to read more.
0553582038|2.0|Short review:<br />Nothing happens and then there are cliffhangers.<br /><br />Longer review:<br />The first novels were a truly masterful puzzle-narrative, with great dialogue, with surprising twists upending fantasy genre conventions.  These novels were not without flaws, however.  Even the first novels had bloated descriptions of wardrobes, feasts, crests, and endless family lineages (by the third book, I groaned every time a character got dressed).  'Realism' repeatedly crosses the line into sadism in many rape scenes (yes, I'm sure child rape happened, but must it be described so gleefully?).  Many characters are ciphers, but this is easier to forgive when fully-developed and unique characters like Arya and Tyrion take center stage of most of the action.<br /><br />In \\"Crows\\" we have neither a compelling puzzle narrative nor complex characters at the center of the action.  Instead, the weaknesses of Martin's prose and writerly ticks (what were his editors thinking?) take center stage as the story splits across many viewpoints and geographies, with new characters (their wardrobes, crests, and nipple size) and kingdoms introduced.  As the story grows ever wider, it stops moving foward and progress toward resolution of the main mysteries established in the first novels goes nowhere.  As many other reviewers have noted, there is no appearance of Tyrion, Dany, or Jon.  It's hard to think of a good reason to publish a novel with most of the main characters - and most of the central story - removed, and I doubt \\"Crows\\" will convince you otherwise.  It would have been better advice at this point in the story to tighten the narrative arc and push the story forward, not let it loose across several kingdoms.  Or simply skip forward in time - there's nothing here that wouldn't have been improved by being told in a flashback.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows is hardly a feast of a novel.  It feels more like crumbs for starving fans who long to return to Westeros after five years of silence.
1612680011|5.0|I was completely blind to the ways of the world. I read this book and started 8 businesses. I'm not rich but I'm free.  God bless you for sharing your story
B00BESJYAY|1.0|I was not able to view this film. It kept slowing down, then reloading was attempted twice, then Amazon cut off altogether.<br />I was finally unable to watch it, as it never reloaded properly. In fact, I never even saw a scene, the window said amazon was having trouble, try again later or call.<br />Bp
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great.  I nave the boards to pin stuff instead of having to print things out.  It makes things totally accessible.  I like that people share things they done or found.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great show with family values.<br />Hard to find something decent on TV these days.<br />Gives us a glimpse into a better time.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is a good and funny show. We never miss a night that it is on. Hope there is a seventh season.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|This was a good book....VERY interesting and a its a good finish to the series!!!! I wish there would be more but sadly there isn't...but really good book!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Does not require any skills to play it.  One only needs to continue tapping on the screen and you're sure to hit on a pattern of three.  You also are racing against a time of one minute does not hold my interest.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|this is worth the cash after you have already got the 1st cd.  kind of keeps up the pace with Riot!, but does have some bland tracks
B001KU4P6Y|5.0|Great beats w/ a nice blend of electronic and latin vibes. Good to play in the background. Will look at their other albums also.
B00122S4KS|3.0|i'll be honest, with each cd, their songs diminish in originality.  this album seems to just mix together as one song.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I don't know, I guess I wasn't as interested in the political machinery that went on as I thought I would be. Great performance by Day-Lewis and also by Sally Field.
B0011Z3334|5.0|The first cd is well worth the cash.  there is a lot of good songs on here that the other discs seem to lack.
B002APU580|5.0|It is a great movie! great price! this movie is a master piece. that is why I like it so much.
B008B3H4VQ|1.0|LP is just a shadow of it's former self.  I liked the first 3 discs they had.  The last one was pretty good, but this is just horrendous.  don't waste your money on it.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|This is a Woody Allen movie you will want to watch more than once!! Scarlett Johansen, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz all give wonderful performances.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Haven't used it a whole lot but it seems easy to use.<br />I think I will like it and use it a lot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite game but I use the kindle and there was suppose to be an update that fixes the multiplayer because there was a bug in it. I really want it to come though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game.  It's challengeing as well as fun.<br />I would recomend to everyone that likes card games.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|My husband went to Lake Hamilton High School with Adam. He remembers Adam just as the book describes. Read this book if your looking for inspiration during the low times that life throws at you.  I have been inspired and this is simply the best book I have ever read. I will never forget Adam Brown.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Get movie just to long I let that this movie gives you both the girl side and the army side of the story and also what goes on when they Interrogate the people
B007TK77QE|4.0|having never read harry potter I wasnt sure what to expect, the book is a multi faceted story which was intriguing and appealing.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I think this show was one of the best shows on television today. I love the stars and the rolls they play, even the villeins. Some were to short lived, like Shane, I would have lov to see more of him. All and all it is a good blue-ray, I can't wait untill season 3 comes out and season 4 starts.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Started out as a fun game, however, when my Kindle Fire froze 3 times in less than 15 minutes, I deleted it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is so much fun. I have it for my kindle fire and I do nothing but play it. it is benificial because you don't need internet
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Lot of lessons that you might learn after doing lot of mistakes or after working in lot of places for years. The book motivates you and guide you how to use that motivation to produce something good.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a really informative, insightful and inspiring read to take the lessons of one great inventor and apply them to personal achievement. It can be read in a single sitting. It captures attention and inspires self improvement and urges that great accomplishments are not for the elite gifted few, but possible for any common person. I enjoyed this book very much.
B008Y73940|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but was unable to get Closed Caption on our Sony player so missed a lot of the dialogue since I have a severe hearing loss.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|At the very first of this  book, it took me a little while to into the groove of constantly going backward and forward in time. After that, I could not put this book down! I found myself wanting to read in the strangest places. While hating the violence and control, it was like a train wreck-you don't want to watch, but you can  help yourself! I will definitely read more by this author.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This was very different but very enjoyable I liked the combination of classics and pop music well worth a listen
B003VANOFY|5.0|I am absolutely happy with this product, and recommend it.  Does every thing I wanted and has liberated me from the chain.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Good change from the traditional and great new,innovative challenges. I don't like the challenges in space as those on the planet.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It serves its purpose and convenient to carry. I love my Kindle and this affords me the ability to charge it wherever and whenever.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I love this charger great for when I'm in the go and i can charge both my iPad n my iPhone! Luv it😍
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've read literally hundreds of zombie novels (some great and some not so much) and seen as many movies. This is the best telling of a zombie story I've experienced. Every once in a while I read something that I wish would be made into a movie. This was one of those stories. A few years after I read this the first time, when I heard that it was going to be made into a movie, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately for real fans of this story, Brad Pitt`s rendering of it totally ruins it. From what I understand, he not only directed it, but made changes in the story that destroyed the original version.<br />I know that movies are not true to the books they are taken from (ie, the Sum of All Fears),  but even the zombies are not like they are in the book.<br />This is what a top notch zombie book is.<br />The best. Period.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book. It is better than 50 shades of grey. Recommended to anyone who wants a good book that keeps you guessing about what is happening.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love trying to clear all the tiles.  Even though this s nothing like the real game of Mahjong, it's still fun.
076421120X|4.0|\\"Revealing Jesus\\" is an absolute treasure, filled with inspirational devotionals that are based on solid scriptural teaching and wonderfully reflect God's heart and spirit. There is one devotional for every day of the year, and each page includes a verse of scripture, the devotional, and a brief prayer to help you get started in your own prayer time with the Lord. With a devotional like this, there really is little excuse for someone to say they have no time to spend focused on God. The entries are short, and yet each contains a powerful truth that will remain on your mind throughout the day. The devotionals are well-written and I very much enjoyed reading through them. I also enjoyed the lyrics to hymns and worship songs that grace the pages of the book, finding them to be meaningful and designed to draw the reader to the feet of Jesus.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new devotional for yourself, or perhaps as a gift for a loved one for their birthday or upcoming Mother's Day, then consider giving them a copy of this devotional from worship leader Darlene Zschech. It is sure to be a blessing. I award this book a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc. Available at your favourite bookseller from Bethany House, a division of Baker Publishing Group.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|To much descriptions of things that had nothing to do with the story line. I skipped a lot of pages. Other than that the story was good.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Did not know where it was going, so it kept me engaged until the end. The Black Keys was icing on the cake.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|This book is straight to the point and pokes holes in the whole self improvement industry approach. To come to terms with our own idiosyncrasies and to be honest with ourselves is the best advice that this plain speaking and common sense book gives. A delightful read.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love Mahjong because it helps to keep my mind sharp! It is never boring. There is always a new challenge.
B00AIBZJLG|4.0|I thought the sound and picture of this DVD was very good and that made this DVD very enjoyable to watch.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's really fun! It took me a while to get to like mine craft, but now I love it!! I have an old computer so I couldn't get it on my computer, so I got it on my kindle!!!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Took my son & girlfriend to see Iron Man 3 yesterday in theaters. They both said it is their favorite Iron Man of the 3 films. I enjoyed it a lot. Yet I felt it wasn't how I had expected it to be. The film is packed with action,some humor,great special effects,ect..! But if your like me (& my son) and read and collect comics (including Iron Man). Then you may feel how I do. The villain in this Iron Man is Mandarin (or is it?). The film starts off with Stark saying how he had made a enemy without even knowing it. It. Reflects on a part of his life (New Years eve 1999). After a few minutes, the film is back to current times. As the film progresses. Tony has difficulty sleeping. And also has some occasional panic attacks. Still kinda easing over what had happened in The Avengers film. \\"Mandarin\\" taps into TV stations air waves & shows clips of war,corruption,ect..while talking about how America is bad. Tony (Iron Man) pretty quickly is approached by media, & threatens Mandarin. Evn giving Mandarin an invitation to bring the fight to him @ his house, then gives out his house address. Some choppers soon start to attack Tony (and Pepper & a another character) while they are inside Tony's house. Tony is believed to be dead. He winds up passing out in his suit, as it is going to a destination. He met a kid while breaking into a garage to repair his suit. The kid ends up helping him out. Meanwhile Rhodey (Iron Patriot/War Machine) is supposed to protect the president. As the film progresses, Tony encounters a few enemies which body heats up. Eventually Stark (Iron Man) works his way to where Mandarin is. However, his suit is recharging in the kid's garage. He encounters \\"Mandarin\\" and finds out that this man is just an actor protraying as Mandarin. Pepper get's abducted by the real Mandarin. She also is starting to have Mandarin's methods of making skin heat up, done to her. Rhodey loses his Iron Patriot suit to the real Mandarin. And Tony,Rhodey, a army of Stark's Iron Man suits (controlled by Stark) end up all being where Pepper,the president (who also was abducted) and the real Mandarin. Of course a big battle ensues & in the end justice prevails. However, it is Pepper doing some major butt-kicking at the very end! All in all good, solid film. But those that follow comic book story lines may not like the adaptation they see of Mandarin. The \\"real\\" Mandarin in this film is not even like the Mandarin from the comic storyline. The actor looks like the comic version. And the \\"real\\" one in the film does not look like him or anything. He didn't have Mandarin's rings or nothing! I was able to look past these differences and enjoy the film. Others however say it ruined the film. Also some don't like that Tony isn't in his suit nearly as much this time. And when he is, it get's ruined shortly after. Aso Rhodey doesn't do much at all in the War Machine/ Iron Patriot suit.  Some may say that if it were more true to the comic storyline, it would be predictable. That's true. But I feel it could've been more true to the comic (character-wise) and comic story line in some ways. But add other elements to make the story/plot different for those that do read the comics! Overall I'd give it a 4 or 4.5 out of 5. I collect & read comics, and still look forward to buying the Blu-ray and watching it again! Is it the best of the 3 films!?! To some yes, to others it is the worst. It all boils down to personal opinions. For me I don't feel it is the best. However, I really like all 3 so I don't know the order of best-worst for me, they all rock!suits (controlled by Stark) end up all being where Pepper,the president (who also was abducted) and the real Mandarin. Of course a big battle ensues & in the end justice prevails. However, it is Pepper doing some major butt-kicking at the very end! All in all good, solid film. But those that follow comic book story lines may not like the adaptation they see of Mandarin. The \\"real\\" Mandarin in this film is not even like the Mandarin from the comic storyline. The actor looks like the comic version. And the \\"real\\" one in the film does not look like him or anything. He didn't have Mandarin's rings or nothing!

And when he is, it get's ruined shortly after. Aso Rhodey doesn't do much at all in the War Machine/ Iron Patriot suit.  Some may say that if it were more true to the comic storyline, it would be predictable. That's true. But I feel it could've been more true to the comic (character-wise) and comic story line in some ways. But add other elements to make the story/plot different for those that do read the comics! Overall I'd give it a 4 or 4.5 out of 5. I collect & read comics, and still look forward to buying the Blu-ray and watching it again! Is it the best of the 3 films!?! To some yes, to others it is the worst. It all boils down to personal opinions. For me I don't feel it is the best. However, I really like all 3 so I don't know the order of best-worst for me, they all rock!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it again. He hooked me in with a perfectly spun story, and keep me there straight till the end. The best part was exactly what's on the cover with Percy and Jason. The end was amazing. Waiting very impatiently for the House of Hades. PLEASE HURRY UP OCTOBER!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It catched me since the beginning, I haven't finished the book, but it's very good. I recommend it, and although the books are better than movies, I can't wait to see the movie.

B000002KDS|5.0|Killer was one of the first hard rock albums I listened to back in my teens.<br />The other day, I picked up a copy of it on CD. Man! Listening to it again<br />reminded me of why it's still to this day considered a rock and roll classic!<br /><br />Tightly arranged and well written rock masterpieces put in the correct order.<br />Playability of the LP made you feel like you're watching or listening to a<br />show or a play in a sense because the tracks flow so well.<br /><br />I can't wait for a Remaster or a Classic ReIssue of it. This is a GREAT CD<br />till then. Didn't realize how much I missed it till I popped it in the player.<br /><br />This LP also I think was the beginning of what some folks called \\"theater<br />rock\\" when the live production of it had props. When some rock concerts really<br />did become shows! Alice Cooper was a pioneer in this field. This album is<br />pretty much what pushed it into the mainstream.<br /><br />A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY ROCK RECORD COLLECTION.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I think I will like the movie better. I'm kicking myself for not forcing myself to finish, but I got 3/4 of the way through it and was loath to pick it back up. This does not mean it was poorly written or lacked interest (for others). If you like news stories, documentaries and the like, this book is for you. I guess I just need a progressive story line to keep my interest and this was like a hundred mini documentaries about an apocalyptic event (zombies) and how the worlds governments and communities handled each countries outbreaks. Someone tell me I'm missing an amazing ending and I will go back and try to finish it.

B007P7UF0G|5.0|This is one of those movies that take me right back to my childhood.  Whenever it was on TV I tried to stay up to watch it (it was always a LATE movie, at least 10 PM start... =D), but always fell asleep during the opening credits.  Now I can watch it whenever I want!  LOVE  it.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|This is certainly a well done movie that addresses issues usually side-stepped. Be aware however that due to the graphic nature (Helen Hunt fully nude several times) that this movie is not for children. Congratulations to the film makers and actors for having the courage to create this film.

079073639X|2.0|There are three kinds of science fiction movies:<br />1. Smart sci-fi<br />2. Dumb sci-fi<br />3. Middling sci-fi that thinks it's a lot smarter than it is.<br /><br />\\"Sphere\\" is in the third category -- a movie that shoots high, but ultimately has the same philosophical message as a \\"Star Trek\\" episode. Its slow pace and unlikable characters might have been tolerable if it had a brilliant plot, but instead we get a slew of unanswered questions and massive plot holes -- one of which finishes off the movie.<br /><br />The US Navy has found a mysterious spacecraft buried under several yards of coral, meaning that it's been there for three hundred years. So based on a half-joking old paper by psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman), the government assembles a team -- marine biologist Dr. Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), who is also Goodman's bitter ex-girlfriend; wunderkind mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson), and astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber).<br /><br />Their mission, should they choose to accept it: make contact with whatever alien life forms are living (or dead) inside the spacecraft. Instead, the team discovers that the ship is actually a US spaceship that accidentally traveled through time. And it's carrying a massive, floating golden sphere.<br /><br />Then an alien intelligence -- referred to as \\"Jerry\\" -- begins to communicate with them through the computer. And as a typhoon on the surface keeps them from leaving the underwater station, the crew is attacked by creatures that could not exist in this world. All their worst fears are coming true.<br /><br />I have the feeling that \\"Sphere\\" wants to be an underwater sibling to \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" or \\"Solaris,\\" i.e. a slow-moving, intelligent sci-fi movie. But it's also kind of schizophrenic -- it's too frenetic and chaotic to be much like those movies, and at the same time it's too slow and tedious to ever become a convincing sci-fi-disaster-under-the-sea story like \\"The Abyss.\\"<br /><br />Yes. Despite all the fires, flooding and attacks by sea creatures, it is pretty tedious. It also has plenty of stupid moments (an astrophysicist is lecturing a MATHEMATICIAN about basic geometric forms?) and gaping plot holes. In fact, the movie ends with the mother of all head-slapping, illogical plot twists.<br /><br />\\"Sphere\\" also has a very noticeable lack of special effects. Yes, the sphere is very pretty. But there's a scene where the underwater station is attacked by a giant squid... and we never see the squid. It never registers as a REAL threat because it has no presence in the movie except as a pixellated computer image. Did they spend all the money on the floaty sphere and the fake sea-snakes?<br /><br />As for the acting, it's a mixed bag -- especially since the characters' backstories feel thin and underdeveloped. Dustin Hoffman gives the blandest non-performance you will ever see from him, the kind of acting that screams, \\"I do not want to be here.\\" Stone is actually fairly solid, and Jackson swings randomly between \\"sinister\\" and \\"normal\\" as the plot demands.<br /><br />Actually, the only character who really feels like an actual person is Schreiber as a nervous astrophysicist -- he has tics, insecurities, and he feels that he's never going to really make a mark in his field. Honestly, I would have rather had HIM as the lead instead of Hoffman.<br /><br />\\"Sphere\\" aspires to be more than it is -- a decent sci-fi premise dragged down by a pithy moral and a sludgy-slow pace. It's not horrible, but it's badly, badly flawed.Abyss.\\"<br /><br />Yes. Despite all the fires, flooding and attacks by sea creatures, it is pretty tedious.

B005H8DEMG|5.0|This movie was visually masterful and so well done that I actually understood what Prospera was on about.  And I have seen versions of the Tempist about a dozen times.
B002WY65VU|4.0|The zombie apocalypse isn't exactly fertile fodder for comedy. I mean, everybody is either dead, zombified or in danger of being eaten.<br /><br />But God bless Ruben Fleischer, he managed to wring some comedy out of a world overrun by brain-eating abominations -- despite the bleak setting, the quirky way it's presented (complete with \\"zombie rules\\") keeps it from ever becoming too grim. Also, there is a lot of splattergore, snappy dialogue, Twinkie lust and the occasional Bill Murray cameo.<br /><br />Two months ago, a strain of mad cow disease mutated into a zombie plague. Ever since his hot neighbor went zombie and tried to eat him, \\"Columbus\\" (Jesse Eisenberg) has been traveling to Ohio. But he ends up having to drive with \\"Tallahassee\\" (Woody Harrelson), a hot-headed gun-slinging zombie-killer with a deep love for Twinkies and an even greater love for killing zombies.<br /><br />Then the two men get hijacked by con artists \\"Wichita\\" (Emma Stone) and her younger sister \\"Little Rock\\" (Abigail Breslin), who are seeking \\"Pacific Playland\\" in Los Angeles... which for some reason they think is zombie-free. The little group grows closer while they take shelter in a Hollywood mansion, but are their bonds strong enough to keep them together when zombies attack?<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" is one of those rare comedies that takes a really bleak subject and makes it incredibly quirky and funny. Yes, there's a lot of violence -- the climax is basically one big zombie-sploding celebration of gore -- but the movie never loses its quirky sense of humor. Exhibit A: Tallahassee's ongoing quest for spongy cream-filled Hostess goodness.<br /><br />Oh, Fleischer does address the losses and tragedy of the zombie apocalypse -- Tallahassee has a tragic backstory, and we often see towns left in abandoned ruins except for the zombies. But he never lets it bog down the story, and instead focuses on oddball comedy (Bill Murray! Everything about Bill Murray!) and dialogue (\\"My mama always told me someday I'd be good at something. Who'd'a guessed that something'd be zombie-killing?\\").<br /><br />And the climax is utterly awesome in every way. Without revealing too much, it pretty much encapsulates everything fun about the movie.... but in concentrated form.<br /><br />And the actors are all pretty perfect -- Eisenberg effectively plays a nerdy, shy guy riddled with phobias (including clowns), who is the last person you'd expect to survive a zombie apocalypse.  And he's perfect next to the rough, tough, delightfully eccentric redneck Harrelson, who roars and blasts his way through any zombie zone -- they're a zombiepocalypse odd couple par excellence. Stone and Breslin aren't quite as much fun as their male counterparts, but the \\"twelve is the new twenty\\" brashness is pretty funny.<br /><br />Zombies are chic right now, but \\"Zombieland\\" is definitely something special -- a wild, bloody comedy that doesn't let the zombiepocalypse kill the funny.d me someday I'd be good at something.

B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I love this app, I actually think I'm addicted. It is a strategy game, you basically have to collect the most fish. there are different numbers of fish on each black of ice. when u leave the ice it sinks and you collect the fish that were on it. There are four different but equally cute penguins, you can choose which one you want to be and you can even do multiplayer. I would recommend this app to anyone, it is one of the best I have downloaded in a while.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Outstanding drama. Great acting, strong cast. Juliana Margulies shows her diversity in this role. Keeps my interest wondering what is going to happen next.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|works well on this device, but it's laggy. the news feed works for me but everything takes too ling to load In my opinion.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|Would be an ok game if it wasn't so damn glitchy. The more you play the worse it gets. Only way to stop it is to restart the device to reset the game. It gets jerky with a million mini pauses making it impossible to play. Fix the glitches and I'd give it four stars.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It works well on the Kindle Fire, but it's not very updated yet. so things like redstone etc are not in the game. it is a good version of Minecraft though, just needs some updates
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|This is a great game. Super fun, no freezing or glitches. It's educational, I've already played it twice on my kindle fire HD &amp; I just love it. More PLEASE!

B0055B7IPE|5.0|I avoided as many spoilers as I could with this movie. I missed it in theaters and only recently watched it.<br /><br />This movie is all &#34;in the feels.&#34; Good and sad. My husband and I both alternated in tearing up and laughing. It's a great mix of profound emotion and innocent humor.<br /><br />And this is yet another movie from Pixar that I would happily call a favorite. Animated movie or not, this is a great story.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|If you played football, you'll like this.<br />If you wish you could solve problems by taking the head off of your enemy, you will like this.<br />Basically, if you're a dude, I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong and maybe your girlfriend will think the dudes are hot so, BAM, you got a new show.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I read the Neil Gaiman book several years ago and loved it.<br /><br />If you liked the book, I think you'll enjoy this movie adaptation. I don't remember how accurate the movie is on all the details, but from what I remember, it rings true.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, you won't be lost on the story.<br /><br />If you enjoy fairy tales but have a sense of humor, this is a good mix. The &#34;mythology&#34; of this story is great because isn't your typical fairy tale fare.
1612680011|5.0|This book explains that the difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is their mindset!  If you're sick of your job (and who isn't?), or you want to start your own business, or you want to be rich, reading this book is a great first step.  Putting these mindsets into practice will make you rich.  I am not rich yet, but I only read the book 2 months ago. Since then, though, i've started my own corporation, assembled a team, and I am sure that I will not need my day job by the end of the year!  But I took what he said seriously and put it into practice.  As quoted in the book &#34;Learning and not doing is not to learn.  Knowing and not doing is not to know.&#34;  I now have the successful mindset, and the world is my oyster.  I wish everyone knew what I now know thanks to this book.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|this is my new favorite HOG. beautiful art work great story &amp; challenging without being frustrating. I hated for it to end &amp; played it again almost immediately. the price was a bit higher than I usually go for but I am so glad now &amp; would pay it &amp; play it again
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I love the puzzles in this game. I generally like games similar to this with a bit more story and settings in them. I completed this game in about 3 hours, so the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is for the short length. I would love to play more rooms though!

125000098X|5.0|I could hardly wait to read Vol III of the Clifton Chronicles, and I devoured it in two days.  Archer is such a skillful storyteller.  I loved the way he managed to weave into this story what happened in the first two volumes, to refresh our memory, without appearing to do so.  I also particularly admired and enjoyed the many cultural and political references he made, and I found myself nodding in recognition several times while reading, as I recognized things from my own upbringing in England in the 50s.  Surely such attention to detail is one of the marks of a great raconteur?<br /><br />I kept wondering if this was going to be the final volume in the series, but no, the last quarter or so of the book laid the groundwork for another volume in the series, and yes, it ended with a cliff-hanger!  Please Mr. Archer, don't make us wait a whole year before Vol IV is published!

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Superb performances by Naomi Watts and Tom Holland. Very compelling story with incredible photography. Some lags now and then in the script. Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts, Tom Holland , and the two young actors all seemed like a real family and you felt their anguish. Very moving story.

B0084U0IEG|4.0|I generally enjoy McEwan's novels and this is no exception.  It held my interest throughout and had some nice little twists and turns.  I'm afraid that the only downside is that my first exposure to McEwan was Atonement and I don't think he has ever risen to those heights since.  Still, Sweet Tooth is definitely worth a read.

0142418471|5.0|I have been wanting to read this novel for quite some time now and happened upon it for a really great price and I couldn't pass it up. Though I love YA novels, I usually gravitate towards those with a paranormal or dystopian slant (i.e. Hunger Games, Matched, Morganville Vampires, etc). In full disclosure, sometimes you can read a book in a different genre that seems so unique and new that you think its amazing and give it a high rating. This could well be the case for me and Will Grayson, Will Grayson. So keep that in mind as you read the rest of this review.<br /><br />I loved the idea behind the book. Two authors write a book about two different boys who share the same name. They each take control of one of the boys and the chapters alternate perspectives. About the midpoint of the novel the two boys meet for the first time and their stories intertwine for the rest of the novel.<br /><br />Ok I adored Will Grayson (written by John Green) immediately. He was self depreciating and absolutely hilarious. I could tell right away that he was uncomfortable in his own skin, like most teenagers. He really wants to get through life being unnoticed and protects his heart as carefully as possible. No relationships= no heartbreak. Making this goal very difficult is the fact that Will's best friend in the world is Tiny Cooper who is actually not tiny at all. He is a huge, homosexual football player. He is out and proud and skirts the side of flamboyant. Still he seems pretty popular and well regarding in school even if he may be bullied on occasion. Tiny changes boyfriends more frequently than most people change socks. He also introduces Will to his friend Jane, whom Will could be interested in if he would unguard his heart a little bit.<br /><br />The second wil grayson (never capitalized in the book) was a little harder to like initially. He was written by David Levithan. Now I have read books by Levithan in the past and enjoyed them quite a bit but something was off putting about this will. This wil is clinically depressed and takes medicine for it. He talks to his mom in a borderline cruel manner that I just didn't like at all. He doesn't attempt to make friends and is nasty to the one friend he has, a girl named Maura. Now honestly, Maura is annoying from the get go. She pushes and pushes and she is the type of person I wouldn't want to be friends with either. And she can't take a hint to save her life. This will grayson is only happy when he is online chatting with his internet only boyfriend Issac. He hasn't met Issac but they are soulmates and they finally set up a meeting between them. (No one at school, nor his mother know that will is gay)<br /><br />From there I won't give anything away except to say that from that point in the story the Will Grayson's meet in the most hysterical and sad way. I had more than my share of laugh aloud moments in this book and most of them take place around the time these boys meet.<br /><br />This book was funny and above all it was fast moving and entertaining. However it was also real. This is how teenagers talk; this is how teenagers think. And sometimes (unfortunately) this is how teenagers behave (in regards to some fake ID's and the cruelty some of these kids inflict upon each other). I have read that some other reviewers seem to think the last part ends too \\"High School Musical\\"-y but I don't see that aside from the fact that they put on a musical at the end of the book. This story ends pretty well, but its a realistic bittersweet conclusion that you just don't see done by Disney.g about this will. This wil is clinically depressed and takes medicine for it. He talks to his mom in a borderline cruel manner that I just didn't like at all. He doesn't attempt to make friends and is nasty to the one friend he has, a girl named Maura.

I have read that some other reviewers seem to think the last part ends too \\"High School Musical\\"-y but I don't see that aside from the fact that they put on a musical at the end of the book. This story ends pretty well, but its a realistic bittersweet conclusion that you just don't see done by Disney.

B00BT0ZS52|5.0|Unlike some of the people who reviewed this movie, I had not read the book, so it was a bit confusing to me to understand exactly what was happening as the story moved from one time period to the next. I admit I did not immediately see how it was all woven so wonderfully together, but it did hit me, and hit me hard, as I discovered what was happening with all the characters and times. I will say that I purchased this movie on Amazon Instant Video, and was so intrigued by it, and wanting to understand it so completely, that I have already watched it 3times! Every time I watch it I see something new, realize something new in the stories, find myself even more impressed with the enormity, the scope and the underlying messages presented in such a flawless flow. There absolutely is no other movie made to dat that can be compared to this. It's originality is beyond compare. The casting is wonderful, it is a visual feast as well as a captivating narrative. Glad I bought this and know I will be watching it many more times to see what other new discoveries I make. Don't let the length of this movie discourage you from watching it, there is never a dull moment! This is not a film for children due to graphic violence and some sex, this was made for adults who want to go on an amazing ride with this masterful creation, enjoy it, and definitely watch it more than once!
B000IZAHB4|5.0|Go Ape and eat a banana.  Life is not so short.  There is no safe church any where. Good Good
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This is just a good movie, no special effects, just Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogan playing beautifully off each other on their mother/son road trip. I laughed and I cried, this is just so relatable to anyone with an overbearing parent and the dynamics of that relationship. Just a good, relatable, funny and sometimes a bit heartbreaking story of two people trying to meet in the middle of a dysfunctional relationship.
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|My son and I were looking for something to watch on a Friday night It was Ok it keep our intrest.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game so much, I spend much of my time on it! However there are a few drawbacks, mainly the occasional glitch, lag and error which means lost data. Other than that, it's a spectacular game and I highly recommend it!
0307472841|3.0|I came to this book as a fan of the Kurt walolender series, and must say I was somewhat disappointed. there are times, such as the judge in China, when the tension and sense of forboding are very strong, but the large chunks of plot do not hang together as a cohesive whole for me. This book is so very long, with long segments that sometimes seem out of context, that it is a very long trek to the end, which was not entirely satisfying for me. Mankell's writing is terrific, but the structure here needed editing to keep the story from wandering down what for me were some dead end paths.
0345803485|3.0|I decided to read this book because I've heard nothing but good things about it. Well, in my opinion, it was not all that I imagined it to be. This book reminded me of the Twilight Saga just on a \\"sexier\\" level if you wanted to call it that. The main female character Anastasia was a nag. She complained about everything. I really got tired of her referring to her inner goddesses all the time. I can't even tell you how many times she's \\"flushed crimson\\". There isn't much of a plot to this story. The only reason i continued to read this book is because I am intrigued by Christian, which is the main male character in this book. He has this dark side and a mysterious past. I am trying to figure out why he acts the way he does. As I stated before, it's an OK read, but nothing that makes me want to jump for joy.
0452273331|4.0|Simpply said this is one of the greatest books ever written, there is a lot of good philosophy behind the book and I enjoyed answering the question \\"WHo is John Galt\\"
B000BGH1GE|4.0|This set is for extremely hardcore Clapton fans or collectors who need every version of the Royal Albert Hall 2005 that is offered. I, unfortunately, fall into the latter and bought this set for its kitsch factor only.<br /><br />When I put these records on the player and put the CDs in the player and put them on and listen comparatively, the CDs sound better at one tenth the price.<br /><br />Now I'm an audiophile and a musician, but even I don't know the benefits of the &#34;half speed mastering!&#34;<br /><br />In summation,  buy only if your a completist. It is no special revelation. If the price was $70 I'd say everyone go for it. But for these small fortunes, save your money for gas or 15 records at the used music and books store near you!<br /><br />  ZP
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|A Classic Baseball movie with Kevin Costner playing lead role.  You can really tell Costner's passion for baseball in this movie as he is always a great actor in them.  Shoeless Joe actor played the part to the tee - great movie.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was really good, definately a must read if you're looking for something new.  Gillian Flynn is a great author, I've read all three of her books.  I would definately reccomend them all.  Her stories are dark, but extremely entertaining and unexpected!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie depicted the American History of the Slaves.  Jamie Foxx was great in his role as Django as well was Samuel Jackson who helped him through his struggles within the system.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My infant does not want to go to sleep.  I am convinced he purposely spits out his pacifier in a last ditch attempt to wake himself up.  I tried the Wubbanub hoping it would make it harder for him to spit it out.  IT REALLY WORKS.  My infant spits out the pacifier, but it is positioned right on his chest, so he can get it back in his mouth!  It is wonderful.  Granted, it doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when he starts rocking in his swaddle, but it has made bedtime so much more easier.  This is a must for parents with infants.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This is a great game for all ages, but the pricing? Is not. Not at all. I don't know where Hasbro got the big idea of making everything so darn expensive! Every single mission that is required in the place I'm at now, requires Gems. Even in Canterlot! ( Might I add especially Canterlot! ) Honestly, I love the game! I really do! I just honestly hate the pricing!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was great to watch with my family. It was funny and really cool to see all the game character act as though the game is their day job.
B004PGO25O|5.0|A short, concise book which inspires you to do exactly what it says on the tin! Pressfield has a remarkably direct way of presenting us with the ultimate reality that all we really must do is DO THE WORK!! As a PhD student, I am all too familiar with the roller coaster ways of the creative life. One week you are cranking out the pages until they finally become a chapter, and the next you are so encapsulated by the 'fear' (or what Pressfield terms the intangible, malevolent force of 'resistance'), that your thesis almost shape shifts into a demonic monster of the most vile degree! Other weeks your procrastinating tendencies have resulted in a house that is so clean, you resort to ironing your underwear for sheer avoidance of opening that file marked 'chapter three'!!<br /><br />In short, Pressfield has produced a 'coping' manual of sorts which sieves through all of the bulls**t (excuse my French), and gets right to the core of the matter - which is you! Just as we are the instigators of our own demise, we are also the instigators of our own success - us and us alone! We can listen to external advise from dawn to dusk, but unless we put pen to paper; brush to canvas; bow to violin; detox to body or any other denomination of creative strife, we will never produce any results. A friend told me once that the best PhD is a written one, and it's as simple as that - eh, true, but easier said than done! Pressfield confirms that the creative process is difficult, but he also puts a cap on the sympathetic approach and says that one must simply commit and armour oneself with every possible tool, be it installing a coffee machine on your desk, super-glueing your posterior to the office chair, or throwing on the chainmail - Whatever it is, we need to do it and be ready to fight 'resistance' to the bitter end!<br /><br />If you feel like you are in a rut and desperately need a push towards the light - read 'Do the Work', and I promise you, even if it's slow to take off, you will do just that!<br /><br />Ps - I would definitely take Seth Godin's advice in the forward, and read the book quickly the first time, and then read it more critically the second time, taking notes if needs be. It will be a guaranteed eye-opening hour (or 2) of reading!
B0047WJ12K|4.0|The movie has a lot of twist and turns and I love trying to figure out what will happen next. This movie is watch I would watch again just to try and catch anything I may have missed the first couple times
B0058YPILY|5.0|I like shows like this because it teaches law and order of  people rather arrest ing them so I advise if you have do not let them see this show
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|For me personally, I use it to organize my thoughts, my favorite moments take from my camera, and whatever else I my need to capture for my day.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|A good time killing game. Fun for kids and adults alike. Do not need to spend money if your patient.
B003B02O14|4.0|The Partner is an interesting read, it keeps your attention and is unique spin for a mystery novel. This is not Grisham's best but it is still very good. I would recommend it!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great entertainment. Love the actors. It's a classic story we have all seen played out in the news headlines. Watch.
B004SC8XHI|5.0|I was fully happy with the product. I guess for some reason I was not fully aware it was coming from over seas. The package arrived with even a scratch. I would buy from them again without hesatation.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Lee Child and Jack Reacher series are always fun and you actually can learn a few things from the research done for the story..  Hopefully the story line will continue.
0897502027|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It is a great reading tool for people of all and a must have for any martial artist.  Bruce Lee is the true pioneer in martial arts.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A simple app, since the update you can do everything you need to on Facebook. Including changing your profile/cover pic and deleting or captioning pics. It's nothing fancy but it lets you do everything on Facebook.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this and did not want it to end. NO CURSING&#60; NO BLOOD just good old fashion family and community values<br />it's a old girl's show
B00B7ERH04|4.0|A great app for even the kindle fire HD. Which has very few good apps. But beware, I could only save 6 videos before it basically forced me to either get the real app or delete this one. Soooooooooooooooo take my word for it and buy the real deal. :-)
B008Q0AZVK|5.0|The movie was well paced, there was always some new thread/twist happening, I didn't want to stop watching it. Most surprising was the all star cast and the excellent acting performed by the women and men as well. It was so good to see Rob Pattinson outside of his twilight range, he was intense and a true match for the all star female cast. My only scripting note would be that it wasn't all that clear why all ladies fell head over heels with Rob's character, it didn't feel very well developed to me, he didn't have too many lines in that part of the movie and didn't seem to put any effort in wooing his female audience. But I guess his good looks were sufficient to have them all at his feet. May be the times haven't changed that much after all.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just read what I said in the title box. And I am pore on subway surfers so that is why I need each coin to be worth 2 coins each.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|This is a good book to get over procrastination, but not any kind of procrastination. This is a book that covers emotional blockages of doing what you must do, especially in the creative field.<br /><br />It's not really life changing, there are better materials on the topic but it serves it purpose. What I did not like about this book is how it gets all spiritual in the end. I find the power to take action, massive action a consequence of several other factors and not really due to a muse.<br /><br />However, if you are having trouble doing what you must do and you wonder why, 75% of this book will help you understand why and even if the advice is more on a philosophical level, it will also show you how to get over it.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Perhaps I fall in love too easily!  I will miss one of my favorites if Rankin retires Rebus.  I enjoy character driven mysteries and Rankin is among the very best.  I highly recommend this Rebus installment to anyone who enjoys our hero's bad boy exploits.  It doesn't matter whether you figure out the ending because Rankin's prose in itself is worth the journey.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It really is the best keyboard out there in my opinion and learns how and what you type the more that you use it
B0011ZVPK2|5.0|Simply wanted the digital version of an album I loved years ago. It's wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the Eagles.
B00CFOI2QS|4.0|Does Warner Brothers still own the US rights to this film...if so, what are they waiting for?  I rated it four stars based on the fact that we do not have a decent DVD edition in the states and any improvement is welcome!
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|I just love Buddy Guy's music. He is old blues and I hadn't heard of him three years ago. One trip to Chicago and I am hooked on his music. Anyone who likes blues, anyone who likes really talented guitar, you need this album.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I'm Starting To love this Game ! GREAT Time killer . I liked it Hopefully you will like it As well . (:
B0011Z78R6|5.0|Best Eagles album ever. You have to buy the mp3 or cd version thought or you cannot listen to it on your phone, really. I tried it with the vinyl.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A amazing game that every horse lover should try. The animation is a great plus. Although if you were able to be more involved with the control of the horse it would be awesome. All together  this is a great game.
B000003CMB|5.0|As long as you like wonderful guitar, vocals, or the Allman Brothers Band, you will love this album. If  you hate long instrumentals, though, you might want to skip it. Duane Allman's beautiful playing makes this a &#34;must buy&#34;, and Greg's voice sounds so young and fresh.
B0009V971S|1.0|Two weeks into use and the battery would no longer hold a charge properly which really let me down, I would not purchase again.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Just updating from VHS. Love this Disney movie classic!  We refer to it often in our family because we had a cat like Tramp--treats at every door he went to.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|This book almost got me thrown off the night train from Zurich to Vienna. When I laugh really hard I snort like a pig, and \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is unremittingly funny.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is cute, great to pass time and easy to play. Worth getting, i've found nothing wrong with this app so don't listen to 1 star reviews.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I knew this new phase of Rod Stewart's work since started with the first album. Buying the 4 cd's in this format, I mean, as a collection, it's exactly what I want.
0525953728|5.0|This was a great book! As a retired Navy man, I really liked feeling as if I was right with them. In my opinion, its a must read for every American! The SEALS did a great job!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Keeps u on your toes can play anytime an LOve how the background changes every so often to keep u fresh an new .. great game..think it's time for more power ups though I am maxed out except one more power up so it's gonna need to be a challenge to keep playing ..just a thought.. I enjoy playing..
B0027BOL4G|5.0|read the other reviews.  i'm sure it's all already been said.  otherwise, it was an excellent documentary.  everyone should see this movie.  it needs to be shown in school.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's hard to put it down every time you pick it up to read. I've read it twice now.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This film is one of the best I have see.  I also find, especially the last speech, the entire film appropriate today.  Oh no, we don't have slavery as in his time, but we DO have world-wide domination, discrimination, and oppression by institutions, government and cultural norms.  Therefore, I find this film is not only historic...which would then be of interest primarily to citizens of the USA....it is also very relevant to the times we are living in now.  What is desperately needed is a ''Lincoln'' today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The is the most funest game ever so get it.I  like it because it's fun and it tests your brain as in  the speed and other stuff.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This timer application is great. You can set multiple timers. It also has an alarm clock and timer. Would have gave it 5 stars if the icon in the system tray showed the time remaining actively .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I always want to download subway surfers Lon time ago.thanks to Julio I can play whenever I want. Download this app you can challenge your friends on Facebook.I love subway surfers
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this account of an amazing event. The author helps you get to know the players and what it was like to live through the air wars in WWII.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It's stupid because wen I turned it on it crashed! So take my word it's a<br />Waist of money! So I rate this 1 star.
B000LY8NXQ|5.0|This movie was movie was moving about a real thing that happened Loved it would like to see more like it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has great details in it (that is why I voted 5 *'s)  I was shocked at everything that happened. This is a page-turner! Great book and can't wait to read the next!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Wow this game is only the coolest! I love on how u can fight droids and bosses and this is very similar to temple run but with a huge upgrade! Gameloft u rock!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I finished this book a week ago and haven't been able to stop thinking about it! The emotional stakes were so high for the characters in this installment of the Selection series. Lots of action, plot twists, and fantastic character development. I continue to love the character of Prince Maxon and feel like he really is the heart and soul of the series, despite it being told from the POV of America. I was able to empathize more with America in this book. She went through some pretty harrowing experiences and matured quite a bit. Her dithering between Aspen and Maxon is still annoying, but at least she had valid reasons for turning to Aspen a couple of times in The Elite and I was glad that Maxon finally started giving some of the other Selection ladies a chance. America needed to know that she wasn't his only option!<br /><br />The last few chapters of the book were real nailbiters and I was shocked by a reveal that I didn't see coming. Things have been set up nicely for the third, and final, installment of the series. I really look forward to reading it and am just sorry that I have to wait an entire year for it to be released!
B001M0HGR2|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I teed it up before I went to IronMan 3. The series has been well done. You will enjoy all three movies.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As a kid in the 6th grade with Kennedy was killed, I was impacted at a very impressionable age. I have been fascinated with the Kennedy story since then. While this novel is entertaining it also plays the what-if game very well. King's writing is so well done, that in one section that is a bit gory, I found myself a little bit sick to my stomach so had to skip a few pages of the gore...it was that descriptive and well written! Enjoy and don't be inhibited by the length of the book. Well worth the dedication to read it!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Although it starts a bit slowy, this movie builds and lives up to the franchise's merits.It is definintely worth seeing.
1592332803|5.0|So many recipes, so little time! I love Colleen and all her works, she is an inspiration to vegans everywhere.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|i have all the series of harry potter. i enjoy the movie, there are things that you just have to keep
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the things I love most about Stephen King is his ability to draw me in to a new world and make me care about his characters. The uncut version of THE STAND is one of my favorite books, one I read over and over - and 11/22/1963 has landed on that same list for me. King's premise is interesting - what would happen if you could go back in time and stop the assassination of JFK? He doesn't dwell on life after the assassination stops, instead, the focus of this book is on the process of getting to the assassination and the challenges of changing the obdurate past.<br /><br />You'll get great detail on the story from other reviewers. Just know that if one of the reasons you read is to escape to a different world for a while, 11/22/1963 delivers.
