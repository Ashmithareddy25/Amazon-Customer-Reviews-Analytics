B007UXT6T6|2.0|My wife enjoyed this movie much more than I did. There aren't any real faults I can complain about but, to me, the strength of a movie like this is tension and suspense, but because so much of this movie is rehash and cliche, there isn't any tension or suspense.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Peter May is a very talented writer.The setting, the characters, and his way of telling a story drew me in and kept me reading.  I can't wait for the next two parts of the trilogy.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I'm relatively new to Lana Del Rey; prior to this purchase, I have only heard one or two of her songs on Pandora. This album feels slightly retro to me. It's got a smoky, moody late '50s - early '60s vibe to it that is rather nice to relax to. There are no songs that standout on this album but there are no throwaways either. I think anyone who likes talented and powerful female vocalists will enjoy this album.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is a really good book because it is superbly funny!  The reason I gave it five stars is that it is super epic lol reading material!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry about the seventeen exclamation points...
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This helps me sleep fast and deeply when I need to.<br />I usually wake up a lot during the night, with this app I stay asleep till my alarm goes off in the morning.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|We all love this movie and it's great to give as a gift.  Fun action and adventure movie to share.  I wouldn't suggest for younger kids.
1432794426|5.0|In a Nutshell:<br /><br />For fans of MJ or those who are simply curious, this book quenches much of the thirst for knowledge we all have regarding his controversial character and incredible career. Although this book is blatantly in defense of Michael Jackson, a purely positive look at his life that true fans will thoroughly enjoy, those who do not deem themselves MJ fans will still gain a truer, healthier perspective of the megastar. He is not entirely what the media portrayed him to be--in fact, the author reveals that most of what was conveyed about the star was false, and out of evil motives. MJ has both a sad and heartrending story to tell us, and the author wonderfully reveals how, despite his misfortunes, he left a powerful legacy meant to inspire us to do the same he did--Heal the World.<br /><br />There are so many books written about the mysterious man, but this is one of the first to delve into the star's psychology--although it is interpreted through the eyes of a loving fan and some may disagree with some of the interpretations, it is certainly an amazing expedition through uncharted waters. She unabashedly conveys a sense of loving adoration for MJ, which all fans can identify and resonate with the desire to spread the truth about his innocent love for the world, especially children. The many examples of his humanitarian works are beautiful, tear-jerking, and unforgettable. Many of them are from fans who met the man himself, even if for a brief moment, but were changed forever.<br /><br />On Different Interpretations and Sources:<br /><br />Because MJ was such a famous figure, everyone wanted a piece of him (well- and ill-intentioned people). And because of this fact, there's plenty of skewed and false information out there. Good sources are hard to find--the best ones are from people who knew and loved the man himself, such as family members and the security team (and friends), whom Karen references frequently throughout the book. However, sources from \\"objective\\" biographies, and websites, can be iffy, as they often disagree directly with what MJ's family and friends have said about him. These latter sources are also used in this book, and may or may not be reliable. As always, the reader should take all information with a grain of salt and decide for himself what to make of Michael Jackson, based on this source and other existing ones.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this strong defense for the king which proves his innocence, showcases his talent, and reveals the heart of a loving father.<br /><br />I also want to suggest that the reader check out Jermaine Jackson's You Are Not Alone and Moonwalk (MJ's autobiography). Interviews of the star himself help too--in order to get the perspective of all sides, and come up with one's own objective interpretation. The author of this book combines a variety of sources that help fill in MJ's puzzle--some pieces will always be missing, so have an open heart and mind with everything you read.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I PLAY THIS SO MUCH BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED IT HIS VOICE IS CHANGING AND IS VERY RASPY BUT SUCH GOOD MUSIC AS USUAL
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product made my phone sound like a  Cheap phone! Sound vibrates, sounds like tin , caller on other line can't hear well, case has like a vibration feel. Took it to the AT&T store to verify my observations, and they confirmed this was damaged. No fault of Amazon, just a garbage product! Going to just buy the defender. Would not recommend this AT ALL
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This book is a must read for all king fans. It grips you and keeps you on the edge of your seat with crazy suspense. It makes you feel what the characters are feeling. Captivating.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed season 1.  It certainly held my attention and kept me wanting to watch the next episode.  Worth watching.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good game and a challenge.  It has not been played as much as others but it is still fun.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is the best Jodi Picoult I have read, and I have read most of them.  The only time I could put it down was when I charged my Kindle.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I have not played this game yet.  My grandson played it and loved it.  I am sure I will try it out soon.
0770433782|5.0|I got this book as an early Christmas present from my fiance and I was blown away! The book is gorgeously made and includes photos, tips and how-to's from some of the most fabulous weddings I've ever seen. I am a huge fan of SMP's blog so I just had to have this book and it didn't disappoint. Makes a great gift for all those daydreaming brides out there -- highly recommended!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Awesome. This is the logical next step in the progression of the band Muse. The first 30 seconds of the first track will let you know that they still have the ability to rock with the best of them, while tracks like &#34;Explorers&#34; show you they have mastered the ballads as well. 5 stars!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game , love that you can take Bingo Blitz with you! Works well occasionally when the internet is being used by a lot of people it will hang, but not that that doesn't happen with other apps.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The apps news feed will not let you scroll at all. The rest of the app is fine. Please fix asap
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The clock does what its suppose to do,  it wakes me daily. I'm satisfied so I rate it at four stars
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This movie was exactly what I was hoping for it to be.<br />We loved it!<br />I did during the movie many times think about the Colorado movie shooting victims.<br />And wished The Batman could have really been there to save them.<br />Excellent movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is Great, intense, nerve wracking!  I Love it!  It keeps you on your toes wanting to watch the next one.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|it's so good my brain movie one of have the best movie i love it number one in my book
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|i really love this album. i got it during the $1.99 sale. every single song is just perfect. Ellie has a beautiful voice
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Easy to use. Makes tweeting easier. I just wish it refreshed tweets faster instead of remaining on the same tweets.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I have not yet finished this book.  That is because it is very difficult to get through.  The first book moved easily.!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|The kids loved it, the adults loved it and it gives pleasure non-end what an absolute pleasure for the whole family
B0037KMHRY|3.0|Very good but you have to like techno, luckily I do. My daught likes some but not all of it but that's ok. I like it.
1471101223|5.0|It was absolutely worth the money and the wait. He has been my hero for 15 years and it was beautiful to read a piece of struggle and the facade that a person puts on to appease people. It was an emotional roller-coaster and as the audience, I felt I got the front seat. It was brilliant
B0029O08WA|5.0|I enjoy this album. It's got great songs that mellow you out after an irritating long day. It's also good for those times when you don't know what you want to hear and jusy need decent stuff to play. It's a favorite of mine.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|BEWARE! Don't use this app! On my HTC Sensation 4G running ICS no pictures or 'share' button! !<br /><br />I used to use this app but it got too unstable day to day. So I started using Facebook thru the internet, which works great!! I thought I'd try it again so I enabled it to find NO PICTURES or SHARE BUTTONS!!!<br /><br />BACK TO THE INTERNET BECAUSE THIS APP SUCKS BIG TIME!!!!!!!! WISH I COULD GIVE NO STARS, WHY? BECAUSE THIS APP SUCKS SOUR LEMONS!!!!!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I have three twilight soundtracks. This is the best one. Even non'twilight fans like the music on here. It's good from start to finish and I play it often.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|If you are a fan of magic and action, this is a great movie. I am happy with it. My daughter had her friends over to see it.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Love this movie and couldn't get better than on Blu-ray! I'm so excited! This is going in my Christmas movie collection.
B008602KQI|4.0|Haven't read the books, but from what my wife tells me they did a great job building on the book's foundation to create the first movie. Looking forward to the sequels.
B004HV54TU|4.0|I purchased this mouse after my doctor's office staff recommended it to me.  Perfect for computer-heavy jobs.  Beacuse it is unlike any standard mouse, it takes some time to become adjusted to it.  Ideal for everyday use.  Price is a little high.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this kind of Music.<br />Lindsy is the one how bring Violinmusic in my Heart.<br /><br />Its so pity, you can't buy or hearher Music in Germany
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Had difficulty in suspending my disbelief on this one.  Batman basically got his ass kicked for two l-o-n-g hours and somehow wins out in the end.  Good effects though and the Bat toys were cool
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I found this book absolutely fascinating. Having already read books such at the Introvert Advantage, I thought I had the subject pretty well covered. However, this book gave me new insights into introversion. Particularly the chapters on sensitivity, playing an extroverted role for something you consider important and adjusting for introverted children were most interesting.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed all of the real world stories and examples the author gave, which turned a potentially dry text into something that kept me turning the pages.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|I thought this film pictured the most realistic portrayal of an accidental death scene I've ever seen. From there, it went on to show how this death had such a deep psychological effect on so many people, especially the teenage girl who was partially responsible for it. Anna Paquin does an outstanding job as Lisa, the girl who seems grounded and in control until the accident when everything takes a turn for the worse due to her guilt and realization of how fragile life is. Well worth seeing.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas.  I signed up for the text messaging that notifies the consumer when the package will arrive and also when the package has been dropped off.  This is much more convenient then an email.  My son loved the CD and I loved the convenience of shopping on line.
B001N63I72|5.0|Roy Hargrove's Quintet put together an awesome set of tunes on this album. All the arrangements and compositions are unbelievably tight (not what the kids say, but actually, musically tight, meaning clean), but don't sound over polished, a feature we battle with growing music snobbery. This album puts a smile on your face and keeps your feet from standing still.

B005OUHOLY|4.0|As a musician, it is sometimes hard to find your focus when practicing. Kenny's book has phenomenal tips on how to truly understand and be a part of your music, from etudes to solos and in between. If you are someone struggling to find a center to your day to day work, needing how to set up, discover, or reach your desired result, read this book. There isn't a challenging musical vocabulary used in this book, so it is approachable for whatever the level you may be at.<br /><br />There are also two DVD's, one with the same title, with a brief overview of the text in a clinic, and the other called &#34;Living Effortless Mastery,&#34; which contains two master classes he gave at NYU in 2005, a &#34;Free Jazz&#34; clinic at an IAJE (International Association of Jazz Educators) clinic, and two performances: one at the Blue Note, and the other with the Brussels Jazz Orchestra. The latter has a great deal more information and application.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|Probably one of the most anticipated releases with all knowing this would be Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale's last go with the Batman series. Being a fan of the 1989 movie with Keaton and watching the next 3 get cluttered with too many plots/sub-plots/villains and special effects sadly, Dark Knight Rises is just cluttered with artsy/fartsy crap. What made the 1989 Batman film great was it was a story one could follow. Batman=good guy / Joker=bad guy! We see how the Joker comes to be and, while Batman already is the story goes through to show how The Joker when young, killed Brice Wayne's parents thus giving genesis to Wayne's destiny to become Batman. A simple story with just the right amount of cast and effects to support and tell it.<br /><br />After the 1989 film grew to silly with shift in directors and stars I appreciated the first of this series --- though the whole going off for to the far East for ninja training and all could have been shortened in my opinion --- because it went back to that dark look and basics. The Dark Knight had moments of excess I could do without and, unlike the rest of the planet, I didn't care for the portrayal of The Joker as some dirty Manson-like thing in make-up. I preferred Nicholson's portrayal as a more classy villain yet just as psychotic and ruthless.<br /><br />Like some have mentioned the whole Robin deal was bad. Plus, the whole deal of having Bruce/Batman incapacitated only to retire, with Batman believed to be a murderer throughout was also bad. I would've preferred Batman had risen, had experimental surgery, whatever to be 100% whole and, at the end, to have stood atop a building in silhouette of the Bat Signal having the movie end with Batman's reputation and strength intact to fight on.<br /><br />No doubt another actor/director will come along and regurgitate the series again with the rampant lack of imagination in Hollywood these days. We have another rebirth of Spiderman, why? they did 2 Hulk's less than 4 years apart...again why? I wish (1) the Hollywood morons would know when to quit beating a dead horse and (2) for the same morons to understand less is more, explosions and special effects are to go with the telling of the story not make up for LACK of one!<br /><br />As Stallone, vocally and publicly disappointed with Rocky V did by basically doing Rocky VI....to right the wrong and allow the franchise a proper conclusion I feel Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale almost OWE THE PUBLIC that added many millions to their bank accounts a 4th. One in which The Joker returns and a repaired, 100% Batman returns.....as would his alter Bruce Wayne from the dead. They could include Robin or not. Stop yanking around with so much ambiguity and work within the confines of simple bad guy against good guy and plausible reason without mystic nonsense. Just straight across pounding violence, return to power both of Batman, Bruce and Wayne Enterprises and a conclusion befitting the series.rs apart...again why?

B006O3MU96|2.0|Daughter picked this one because it was special of the day.  I didn't like it at all. Not my type of game at all.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|i used to love this game as a kid. great faotd! finally Amazon is giving away apps that adults can play again. tired of the 2-6 yr old apps :)
B005CA4SQK|5.0|a very good buy for my collection and a very good price on black friday, fully recommended product for collectors
B005LAIGJQ|4.0|Not Eddie Murphy's best work but it still kept your attention and made you laugh, so it has potential. His assistant was hilarious though.
B005LAII12|5.0|I could hardly wait to receive my DVD and I have not laughed this hard and loud in a very long time.....worth watching more than once to pick up little things you miss the first time around.
B0035FQ1UU|3.0|It was an okay movie with decent acting. The premise just got more and more unbelievable as it went along. Probably worth a watch though for $2.99.
B0015DROBO|2.0|so hard to follow, I get lost trying to keep up with the characters. I'm going to have to see the movie to understand
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved this book but I wish it had ended a little differently because it is a definite cliffhanger I need the next book!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|she is such a talent and this disc shows how down to earth she is.  Love listening to her and watching her
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A funny great movie, behind a music following.  Great family fun surrounded by friends and family.  Get ready to laugh!!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|very interesting on how special forces lives and thinks. shows how and why they are special, even putting up with politicians
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great, easy reading. I really enjoyed it and read the three books in less than a week and was left wanting for more.
B0076DELIG|5.0|When one think Connelly's books could not get better, they do. The suspend carries you from beginning to end.<br />Well researched and outstanding reading. Highly recommended.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Everything that makes blu-ray great is there (picture and sound).  The movie is also very good, but was missing something 'just shy' of making it great.  I had already seen it in theaters, so it was obviously good enough to be worth buying and seeing again.  :-)
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book presents a very good case for a paradigm shift regarding the concept of talent. While the information is precise, the narrative manages to capture the readers attention and gives the feeling of a really fluent conversation with an expert on the subject.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend this book to teachers, students in general, musicians, writers, sports players and coaches and basically everyone that is interested in understanding what is that misterious force we call talent and how can we better gain understanding of  the development of world-class performance.  Very inspiring.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Great show!<br /><br />It's not just about the Zombies.  The story is great.  If you're afraid of Zombies, give it a chance, anyway.
B006O6F932|5.0|Our granddaughter had been talking about this so we purchased it for<br />Christmas. She loved it! Easy to set up
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Season 2 of the best TV show since LOST.<br /><br />More of a great thing.  Looks and sounds great.  Even if you don't like Zombies, give it a shot.  It's worth it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Ok. Im gonna say this first. I watch this show differently than others. Each episode can stand on its own. I jump back and forth between seasons .....if you are focused (doesnt mean stupidity) enough you can do that.  But others enjoy it how they do. And that is fine. But please let others enjoy it in their way.  (I mean I enjoy it by watching different episodes from different seasons....I personally watch the finale of each season I get first. Because I love the huge main kill he does every season.  In my opinion each episode can stand on its own. )  Ok. That point being made.....this show is just brillant. I am a fan of psycho shows and books.... Dexter is a new breed of psychopath.....his kills(I mean actual targeted victims,not his covering his ass kills) are just amazing. His ritual is just complex and and always worth the wait. His ability to mask it all is just neat.  I love how when he wants a killer.....if homocide is also following that case....he ll throw their sent off....then they are all his.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|You have to admit that these headphones aren't going to win any beauty contest, but are you really buying headphones for their good looks are you looking for something that delivers  great sound across all music types?  Okay, okay, I agree that you should be able to have a bit of cool good looking phones and still sound great....  but if you pass these by just because you don't think they look groovy, then you're going to miss a fantastic set of headphones.  These cans are comfortable, durable and deliver a great sound package.  They will light up your ears and will have you tapping your foot to the music, no matter what kind of music you like.  I ran hip-hop, rap, electronic, classical, dance, trance, rock, Irish fiddles, etc. across these things and they handled everything.  I couldn't believe all of the little sounds that these pick up from the music.  You can hear every little thing that was on every soundtrack.  And all of these for less than $70.00?  These are a fantastic buy at this price and if you pass them by then you are the loser.  They are pretty good right out of the box, but after several hours of breaking them in, they get even better.  Get these!  You won't regret it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie! Beautifully filmed. Good storyline. Believable characters. Loved that the main characters were older and still learning and expanding their lives.
B008M62KJI|4.0|This title is not a \\"live\\" CD, but a \\"studio\\" CD with a \\"live feel\\" surrounding it. Interesting material, comprising new versions of some old favourites and a couple of remixes too. For fans, it is a must. I would like it to be longer, with more songs, but it's Ok the way it is.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|it is soooo fun. I love this app. I play it like all the time. best game ever. but in the last level it is soo hard I cannot pass it.

B000J0NIIW|1.0|This was supposed to be all that and a slice of cheese, and it turned out to be a worthless piece of junk. For picking up light dust, it may be okay, but for everyday cleaning, it just won't hold up.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|We watched it several times the weekend it was rented.  Great movie...I'm adding it to my &#34;Must Watch for Christmas&#34; movie list.
B00884GR0W|1.0|too many glitches! I drowned on land, my house was invaded, if I got the CHANCE to build one! go get minecraft pe! it's more worth the money and NOT GLITCHY!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a great book for people who love science fiction. It is too scientific for mw, and at points hard to grasp. Great book.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I received this set as a Christmas gift and it is awesome!! It was purchased from FYE in the mall and after playing nearly all of it, I see no flaws. I made sure I hit all the problem records first to make sure they played good. My needle skipped one time on the first track of Please please me \\"I saw her standing there\\" and I was a little worried, but after that it was perfect. The book is sweeeet and album covers and box are pristine. Not sure if FYE inventory and Amazon inventory come from the same place but I am more than happy with the box I received.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|my brother loved this set, it is what he requested for a gift.  I bought the set new and none of the discs have skipped, so far. Best price is on Amazon, by far.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That a book makes me both laugh out loud and cry my eyeballs out over the space of a couple hundred pages.  This book did just that, on more occasions than one.  It hurt to read sometimes, but what good book doesn't?  I love John Green's work, so I had high expectations for this book.<br />It didn't disappoint.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I have it synced up to my phone and it has been really useful. The notebooks feature is great.

B000G1ALRK|5.0|I am now a pretty big fan of Eric Church. I first heard him when his single &#34;Love your love the most&#34; came out. I wasn't a huge fan of that particular song, but a friend had the  &#34;Carolina&#34; album and I fell in love with it. It is great music, I went on to get the &#34;Cheif&#34; album which in my opinion is excellent and damn near flawless, despite my dislike of the song &#34;Homeboy&#34; but the album &#34;Sinners Like Me&#34;, in my opinion is probably my favorite album of his. I love every track and love his style of music. I would reccomend this to anyone who loves country, and also anyone that loves rock... it mixes both very well. As a whole I feel his style of music has a wonderful mix of country/rock/blues-y riffs and it is just something that speaks to the &#34;average&#34; joe/jane ;)<br />Buy this and I don't think you will be disappointed, I would buy it again and again!!
B001J3U22S|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. As a fan of the original Dune series, I like that the books written by his son fill in background information. I would recommend this book to any sci-fi fan.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good read. The story twisted and turned. KEPT ME GUESSing. GREY IS VERY COMPLICATED. I would recommend for ladies 18 and up only
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The story is exciting but the writing is redundant and often irritating. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped, and the plot twists are relatively predictable. Very clearly written for a young audience despite the violence.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|An interesting concept and plenty of things to think about -- young life and choices. It made me think how easily life changes. Things you didn't even &#34;direct&#34;.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Enough with the ads!!!  Ads Ads ADS, you have put ADS on everyting.  If this was on my computer I would run my virus scaner to remove them or format the Hard Drive! Is this now a legal way of spying? Or are you sending virus?
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Good movie lots of violence. Not really suitable for children under about 17 or 18.  Your download was really fast,  we didn't wait long at all.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A nice read although this is one of the first times I have ever figured out a plot. Got the book on my new Kindle, given to me by my kids for Christmas. I stayed with the story just to see it play out.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|It plugged right in and worked fine without any glitches or hesitation.  It is a very simple device.  I have a new Imac mountain lion with an old disk for backup time machine.  For backup the old disk is fine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How do you write a proper review for a book that simply blows your mind?<br /><br />Hopeless is fantastic!<br /><br />It made me swoon.<br />It made me cry.<br />It made me laugh.<br />It made me scream.<br />It left me speechless.<br /><br />Usually, I can figure the plot out, but I had no idea! When my jaw dropped, it dropped hard! Always the sign of an excellent book.<br /><br />Also, best first kiss EVER. If I could go back in time and redo my first kiss, I'd want it to be exactly like the one described in Hopeless.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is an author genius. Seriously.<br /><br />Read. This. Book.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|One of the best I have ever heard.  Unfortunately I just discovered Evanescence more than a decade after they began their work.  Best songs: Lithium, The Only One, Snow White Queen.  Others very good too.<br /><br />Evanescence is now my favorite.  Unfortunately their early CDs are not available unless you get luck and $400 on ebay.  I am trying to get them all.
0143143492|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this CD. Tolle's delivery is relaxed and well-paced. The content is enlightening. I especially liked Tolle's account of his own history and how he came to his spiritual awakening. Listening to the book on CD certainly made the daily commute less stressful.
B000089RVX|5.0|The best debut I ever heard.  I literally almost fell out of my bed.  Fantastic songs keep pouring out.  And I don't even like heavy metal.  Never heard anything like it.  Unfortunately I did not listen until a decade after it was released.  Lost a big part of my life.  I am now trying to get everything they did.
B0058YPL66|5.0|First season of one of the best primetime shows in a long time - such inventive stories and great twists on the classics
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido is extremely competent, mainstream, head on.  Not freaky or holding back at any time.  So good that she makes it look too easy so does not get credit she deserves.  Also maybe the best looking so people assume she cannot be such a good singer.  I think she wrote it all too.  Her Brixton concert with some of these songs is one of the best live concerts of all time.  DVD or youtube.  I will get anything she does.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great story... My child's favorite movie that can't be stopped... Love all Dr. Suess' books and enjoy reading them to my children!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|wow this game is so addictive and it is surprizing that it should be but I has me consuming many hours!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app for making list.  Then when I go out to run my errands, I just turn on my kindle and make sure I got everything done!  Great app.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It has taken me a while to read this book but I am so glad I did.  Some parts of the book were very heavy and I forgot what most of the acronyms meant but this was worth the wait.  It was written very well and was quite comical in some areas.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the truth of what really happened and not the media's version of events.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a plus for me . I needed a calculator for my Kindle Fire and now I have on that works for me and it is free.
B004LWZW24|5.0|This movie has many elements combined. It has possession, other worlds, classic scares, haunted houses, and more. The music and lighting and especially the opening and closing credits are a genuine homage to the classic horror films of the 1960s. There is creativity with the villans and the characters. They actually bothered to focus on the character so you care about what happens to them. An original. Must see.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|100% satisfied except for the temperary loss of my tv to my little girl lol she cant stop watching the blu ray. gonna buy another to leave at my moms for her to watch there
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Very satisfied with the product, unfortunately belt is basic and can damage future, but beyond that I like. thanks for everything
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Some are alright, and some are great ones. Wish the really good games were longer. This one is engrossing and scary. ;)
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The quality of Susan's voice is beyond beautiful.  These songs ring with the heartfelt emotions Susan puts into her songs.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app gives me all I need in a battery monitor. u<br />nlike other monitors, it doesn&acute;t drain the battery.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is a fun, safe, and excellent for kids. Some of the levels are a little challenging but that's what makes it fun! There are rarely any advertisement things that get in your way. Overall the game is great!
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|This book was Amazing and it had a lot of details in it.<br /><br />I choose this book because it looked really interesting and I read the whole series
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read recommended for all who like a good read. such a good ending to the book.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Got a new Kindle Fire HD and FB app will not work properly. It keeps force closing when I select pictures to view, and it will not show all of the news feed. Annoyed....
B000077VOY|5.0|Stingray was one Gerry Anderson series that I never caught in its original airings. Then, years ago, it played regularly on cable and I regretted having missed it during the first go round. For me, the Anderson marionette productions had an arc of quality overall. The early outings -- Supercar and Fireball XL5 were technically crude but had adequate stories and character interactions. The later examples -- Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, for example -- were technically excellent but were deficient in character development. Stingray seems to have sat at the apex of that curve, boasting an excellent puppet cast, nuanced plots, and a high degree of technical expertise. Overall, I think it's the best of all the Anderson shows -- even or especially counting the ones with real people. If you haven't entered this surreal universe, this is the best place to start in terms of balance quality. And in the meantime, Stand By For Action!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great fun and a great gameplay if you can't get into this game you don't deserve to have a tablet or other device cuz this game rocks
B008C20TDG|4.0|Full of great information, the website is great. Our family eats somewhat clean and this book was a great push to go all in, no reason not too.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|It was an ok book but, wasn't to my satisfaction. My opinion is the first books of the series are the ones that I enjoy the most. I have read the entire collection and overall I think that many people enjoy the humorous characters and unexpected twists.
0807014273|5.0|This is one of the best books on psychology available! It is amazing to read what Viktor Frankl<br />went through and what he learned from it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK TO START WITH ON MY FIRST E READER, CHECK IT OUT MAYBE YOU'LL LIKE IT TO
B00AH8U4OW|4.0|I think this is an interesting show with very wild and sometimes funny storyline. I finally get the understanding of the title in this season. In my mind, it comes from the process of how a young couple feels California has made their lives more complicated and somewhat broken. I did not watch any of the series in real time I purchased all of it through Amazon and had selected due to popularity, so was able to watch a season in a sitting. It was sometimes unnecessarily very sexual with a lot of nudity. Sometimes the nudity is good, and sometimes seemed placed just to have the nudity. This season in particular the main charter played by David Duchovny starts to show more of his maturity and be more true to his values with an interesting twist at the end. I wonder if it will be continued next season.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|it was a great help!!!!!!      At first I was like “what I‘m I going to do I have no idea what this word means!“,but then it finally hit my “u have a dictionary on your kindle!!!!!“  : )
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Very enjoyable rendition of the well known story. Scrooges' voice reminds me of Alastair Sim who was wonderful in a b/w version from many years ago. Marleys' ghost might frighten the little ones or those children who do not like scary stuff.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game... wished you could get more points and have the to skip games in a group that are wat yo hard to achieve so you could get the extra coins
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|It is adobe reader, it works.  That is really all there is to say.  The three star rating is just because...well it is adobe reader no more no less, it works fine.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love doing puzzles everywhere I go. This app is great and very entertaining!<br />They have puzzles over everything for free!
B005HSL626|1.0|I never could get this thing to work.  May be a great app, but I will never know.  Just won't work.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Well the book didn't exactly fit the cover but other than that ideas great! As always Jeff Kinney has done it again
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is spider solitaire, and it works.  and I need thirteen more words to make this a proper review.  Hmmm
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Did No Open on my Kindle device. Purchased App on line. Althought my kindle kept telling me I had alredy purchused the app, I could not open the app. Everytime I tried to repurchase the app I was told I already had it on the kindle. It was not listed in my app library on my kindle. It was however listed on my amazon account, under manage kindle.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a fun game.  It is not so difficult as to be annoying but challenging enough to hold my interest.  Fun way to pass the time, I play it with my daughter.
037575251X|5.0|I got this version for my daughter, who has to annotate her reading for school (and thus needs to write in a book).  I was looking for one that was relatively inexpensive and got this one.  I am very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />The books are classic Jack London - Call of the Wild documenting the transformation of a tame dog into a wild one, and White Fang moving the opposite direction.  These were some of my most loved books as a teenager and I still have almost all the detail in my head.  Interested in adventure in the wilderness?  These are highly recommended.
0425263916|3.0|Not as hot and exciting as I thought it would be. A little stilted and incredible for New York City setting.
0062127241|3.0|The Who were the greatest rock band ever.  I saw them first at Woodstock, twice in Boston the following year, and many times since.<br />Pete has been their creative master.  But from his memoir, it seems that Pete does not care much about rock music.  Mostly, it seems, he cares about himself, the great-artist-of-whatever-genre.  For some reason he even destroyed the tapes of those glorious 1969 shows in Boston.<br />What was spectacular about the great Who albums (Tommy, Live at Leeds, Who's Next)was the sound--not the lyrics.  In fact, the instrumental breaks were some of the greatest highights.<br />This memoir does not explain why Pete was so determined, after Who's Next, to take the Who in another musical direction.  One can see that the stresses of touring with them were severe, but without rock, what was the point?  And later, without Keith, even more so what was the point?  Did he just get bored?<br />He describes his solo career inaccurately: his terrific first solo album, Who Came First, is not mentioned.  Meher Baba obviously inspired this album, but how he influenced, or failed to influence, any of Pete's life choices is left unclear.<br />Pete's family life and amorous adventures are bewildering.  On the one hand, there is too much sordid information.  On the other, it is very difficult to discern what feelings he actually had for the people involved.  That is also true of his bandmates, unfortunately.  While emotions are often expressed, they are frequently wildly out of synch with the behaviors Pete reports.<br />Perhaps this is to be expected of one who confessedly cannot figure out \\"Who I Am.\\"
0425263908|4.0|It was a good read. Looks good. price was right for me.  Arrived in good condition would recommend, not as good as Fifty Shades.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have only read the first book of the trilogy, but it was absolutely amazing.  I can't wait to read the next two books in the series.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|Love this movie, every time I watch it I see something I didn't see before.  Gives you an insight into the sacrifice and dedication it takes for a woman to make the choice to be a Nun.
B0015KO52S|5.0|This bad boy rocks so hard from beginning to end. An incredible album. Jack White needs to reform this group and record some new music with them, because it is very hard to come close to touching this band. Incredible album.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Will not go past the start screen on nabi 2 kids tablet.  Icons move when you touch them but can not  play game.  Too bad.
B005LAII80|4.0|I have to admit, when I heard they were re-doing Judge Dredd I was not thrilled. The Stallone version, cheeseball as it was, carried a lot of weight and honestly I didn't see where there was room for any sort of improvement given the source material.  I'm not knocking the Dredd comics, I just did't expect anyone to have the will to translate them in any way faithfully to the big screen.  Man, was I wrong. This film is dark, violent, gory, and unrelenting. It has not real morally redeeming moments. It is... almost perfect. Dredd, this Dredd, is a bad ass for the ages. Kudos to Alex Garland for a solid script.  And kudos to Karl Urban for throwing himself into a role that no one is every going to recognize him for (literally, he's a frown with a helmet for the entire movie).<br /><br />The other surprise for me was the cinematography. This movie is visually stunning in a way you just don't expect from a action movie like this.  The visuals are balanced with a terrific sound track as well. The movie really draws you into the world the filmmakers were trying to create.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe my initial doubts going in are clouding my judgement, but this was a stand out movie for me for 2012 and I can't wait to see it again on blu-ray.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|For theprice, this was a great buy.  It's lightweight and has a rubberized band to keep your Kindle cover closed.  The case fits snugly.  The one thing I don't like it that it requires a hard surface for the stand function to work.  So if you're reading in bed and want to use the stand, you have to set it on another book or hard surface.  Not the best for a reader.
B005LAII3U|2.0|This refresh of the original \\"Total Recall\\" outdoes its predecessor in special effects and overall appearance but fails to compete in character, story, humor and memorable dialogue lines (\\"I've got five kids to feed\\"). It starts out with a lot of promise in the first quarter of the picture and then spirals downward which is a shame as it started with some potential. It's a dry husk of a movie lacking soul once you get past the special effects.<br /><br />Tale follows a time in which the Earth has polluted itself from warfare in the latter 21st century with England and Australia being the only suitable territories left for human beings. Enter the main character played by Colin Farrel who is a blue collar worker who discovers his entire brain has been reprogrammed and that's a secret agent for the \\"good guys\\".<br /><br />Also starring Jessica Biel, Kate Beckinsale and Bryan Cranston.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $125M and it made over at $198M the Box Office.<br />Rotten Tomatoes gave it roughly 30% positive.<br /><br />Based on a 1966 short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" by Philip K. Dick<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of December 2012.
B000J233SK|5.0|...is probably the best way to call this Morrocan-influenced album. McKennitt actually received much inspiration on her travels while writing this album, and her powerful and talented voice gives the overall feeling of a mellow ride through the desert sands at night. This album is great for meditation, helping one to go to sleep, or just enhancing a time of calm and centering.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|This CGI animated tale of a boy and others traveling up to see Santa Claus at the North Pole was hit or miss in story plotting though my little nephews and nieces enjoyed it well enough and I suppose that's good since they were the intended audience.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hot chocolate dance scene the most with runner up being the kids on the big tree at the North Pole.<br /><br />Notable voices by Tom Hanks and 80s Eddie Deezen. I'd know the latter voice almost anywhere.<br /><br />Based on a novel of a similar title by Chris Van Allsburg.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY/CGI: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus (higher for kids); WHEN WATCHED: end of December 2012 (streamed).
B0029LHW68|5.0|&#34;This is War&#34; shows a lot of the musical diversity that 30 Seconds From Mars has become known for, from the thought-provoking &#34;Hurricane&#34; to the anthem for those who are more than unusual, &#34;Kings and Queens&#34;. Just goes to show, 30 Seconds rocks again!
B004XVN1T4|3.0|If you want a book that lets you escape every day stresses for a day or so, this book works very well.  Clear cut characters and a clever plot keep your interest even though the people lack depth and plot is somewhat preposterous.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I have been trying to find a game like this for a long time! It is great on my Kindle! If you play, wear headphones! It is so scary when he wispers in your ear and when the screen fuzzes up. It scared the crap out of me! I loved it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|so happy to have app for kindle fire.  it runs great.  now I can play bongo blitz where ever I am
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I watch the movie and it was cute. But this gift is for a friend of mine. Since she gave me a gift for me and my family.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|The scripts are so much fun - good tension, plenty of surprises and clever humor.  The whole cast works together so well to make for great stories.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was EXCELLENT!  It was the last book of the year for our book club.  And, it turned out to be the highest rated book for the year.  Everyone loved it.  I've also read Sharp Objects.  If you like that book, you will like this one even more!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|As always the IMF series continues at a high level, Tom Cruise doing a superb job.along with the new start of the Bourne series (Legacy).
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun matching/adventure game. The levels get increasingly harder as you go. Love the music and sound effects! I love that this app was free as well.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have read in a while.  As the story weaves between past and present, I couldn't put it down.  The Language of Flowers doesn't leave you anytime soon.  This story is one of loss, love, heartbreak and the promise of a future. It tells the story of a child making her way through the foster care system, growing up angry and detached, the lessons learned through the flowers brings this story full circle.  You will never think of flowers the same.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|The melodies in this exceptional album transcend time and generations. I never get tired of listening to it. It strikes a not with the free spirit that lives within us all.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and the recepient was very excited since she also has tickets to see them perform soon.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Always guessing what's going to happen next, hard to put down. Highly recommended. This was my first Stephen King book, I am now a fan.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|In my opinion, this is a step up from their debut album. That's not to say the debut was bad, because it was also very good. It is one of those albums that get better the more you listen to it. Not much else to say, it's one of the best of the year.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was amazing and so inspirational. I couldn't stop reading it. I finished it in less then 24 hours!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This was a hit for a gift. When opened the recipient was very happy to have recieved this CD it will be enjoyed for a long time.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of the best Nicholas Sparks books I have read... I love how he introduced the story and then went back to follow the characters and give the back story. It's an easy quick read!
B004YOEFG8|5.0|fabulous!!!!I really liked it and the effects were astonishing. I highly recommend it for all ages. You will never look at the stars the same way!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|came quickly!  great black friday price!  cute story! My 2 and 3 year olds can sit and watch this all the way though, and dad and I like to watch this one with them!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I read all of the wimpy kids books.  I think it's a great addition to their series. Totally top on the buying list.
B0072OFM28|5.0|THis is the 3rd series.  Next one starting in January.  So bloody and etc but cant wait to watch it over and over again.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|There was supposed to be ads but I didn't encounter a single one so figure out why because the only thing I'm seeing is those things before and after the worlds so yeah.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Shouldn't have watched the pilot...now I have to get the whole series....My friends and family warned me about this series...it is very well done and addictive.
B007PJFIU6|4.0|We got this board game for my dd (age 8)for Christmas.  We were on the lookout for a game that she could play with her sisters who are between the ages of 10 and 14 (as well as us adults).  After playing this tonight with not only our immediate family, but some uncles and grandparents, I definitely give this game a thumbs up.  It kept EVERYONE entertained.  We all commented on the artwork of the cards.  Yes, some are a little dark (think in the same vein as Coraline or Nightmare Before Christmas), but not all of them.  I  liked that the artwork was quite unusual and will make your kiddos THINK.  They really aren't your average pictures.  As a teacher, I could see using some of these cards as writing prompts.<br /><br />My one concern is that if you play this game a lot, the pictures won't be as exciting and might even get boring.  I am not sure if you can get more cards. It is something that I think the manufacturer should consider if they have not already.<br /><br />Overall, my WHOLE family enjoyed this game and it is one of those games that will definitely be played by all of us for a long time to come.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good to pass a few minutes. Anyone and everyone can play it but it can get a little boring after a while
B0039UTDA6|5.0|I like it and recommend it. Everyone that narrates, does it in there own way. I wouldn't compare Oprah to the original narrator. I've always enjoyed National Geo. This was a Christmas present and it was a hit in my family.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful<br />Written excellently and could now agree more with the fact that these books are exquisite, they are truly amazing
B006YM9JSW|5.0|This is the time to purchase one of these magnificent beasts. More power than you'll know what to do with. Just don't forget to buy your self a fan, heatsink, or liquid cooler as this bad boy comes alone. I would recommend a nice liquid cooling system, but that's just me.<br />You won't be sorry, this is the most bang for your buck processor on the market right now. Also, ignore the 3 star ratings on this one, they didn't do their homework.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|My mom got me hooked on this show so I got this CD for her for Christmas. Soon after I listened I fell in love with it. The only downside is they don't have the song fade into you even though it says it has it on there. Must have took it off at the last minute.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|If you like red remover, you will LOVE this game. It is easy, simple, and fun for all ages. I love it! :)
B003L77G06|5.0|This show is too funny.  We crack up at all the episodes every time we watch them.  Great price on Black Friday too.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app works and gives you everything you need to know, but I prefer The Weather Channel app over this one... just my personal opinion.  I just think this app is too cluttered/busy... that's all.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is too funny.  We crack up at all the episodes every time we watch them.  Whole family loves it.  Great price on Black Friday too.
B004UID2LC|5.0|If you YouTube, you need this app.  It works great and I never have a problem with it!  Thanks for an easy solution to YouTube'ing on the Kindle Fire!
B008FPOIT6|1.0|This book is just a trite ramble, resulting in a lack of any sort of real ability to engage the reader with the characters. The use of \\"tech\\" is of such a rudimentary level, it's embarrassing.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I was using mobile updates for my Twitter updates, until I found this app.  I am so glad I found this app!  It is so easy to use and keeps you current!  I haven't had any issues with it and it has simplified my Twitter-life!
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I am so amazed at how this book reveals the reality of our body's health and how progressively we have poisoned it by being very ignorant about what we feed ourselves. Because of this revelation, I have changed the way I see this generation of junk and garbage. I will make changes in the way I take care of my health and my family's health. I will also educate my family on the ways to stay away from high medical bills just by simply eating the natural foods.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I liked this movie ;it was great :-)<br />I found to be very enjoyable....<br />I hope that you will enjoy it also.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game was AWESOME forme and my family all of us have this game either on our tablet or phone this game is also very creative and fun for every age :)
B004INNRFK|5.0|Awesome video with some of the best singers in the business! If you enjoy great singing and excellent backup orchestra, you will love this video.<br />Best played on a good sound system with sub-woofer!
0321704452|5.0|Reynolds does a wonderful job explaining with simple concepts many of the ways you can improve your presentation skills.  Even if you only apply a few of the many, many recommendations your impact as a presenter will definitely improve and leave a mark on your audience.  Highly recommended!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I think this book is good for kids  because of the normal things we have in life. It is also good for kids because of the humor and vocabulary.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Very disappointed.  Did not like Tommy Lee Jones' character.  Like him as grumpy but not as a jerk.  And no where near as funny as expected
B006O6F932|3.0|The minute my daughter saw the Monster High School playset a few months ago, she was in love with it. She's loved the Monster High dolls for a while, and this year things really picked up. I wasn't too sure about it based on the pictures and the original price, but I knew I was going to get it for her as one of her big Chr...I mean...holiday presents this year. Sure enough, it was a hit, and she completely ignored a few other toys, playing with the school for most of the day. All in all, this is a pretty cool doll house-esque playset, though I'd recommend finding it for as cheap as possible due to how flimsy it is as a whole.<br /><br />First I want to let you know that the box for this toy even states that the product within may look different from how it looks in the picture. While not completely different, there are several things I noticed once I started putting things together. The clock appears to have a basic dark frame, but it really has two pegs on each side and they stick out like a sore thumb. The basketball hoop's net is also completely black, not white as it appears on the box. These little problems aren't anything major, and they clearly say that there are some differences right there on the box, but I'm wondering if that was printed on there right as soon as these started to get shipped, or if complaints came in and they put the text on there a few waves later.<br /><br />Putting the playset together isn't hard, just a little time consuming with all the small pieces. It shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes. Be VERY careful when inserting the sections, as the walls of this toy are super thin. At the same time, be even more careful when walking around the school if it's opened up. One wrong step and this thing's toast. Even the little piece that more or less holds everything together (a very smell hand) doesn't feel like it's going to resist much pressure. It would've been nice if the construction was more sturdy and pieces snapped in place, like many other playsets do. In fact, there isn't much here that snaps together. A big problem I have with the product is the DJ booth. The speakers/mixing piece does not snap in place. On paper, this might not sound like much of a problem, but take a look at the product images above. The only thing keeping it from falling over is the very short rail in front of it. Brush past the speakers, it falls. Barely tap the playset walls, it falls. Think about it falling, it falls. This is the single most frustrating part of the whole playset in my eyes, because all it needs is a peg. At least it makes me laugh- when you turn this piece around, it serves as a trophy case but the sticker was applied upside down. Nice going. Also be sure to look at the image of the outside of the school, showing the gargoyles. Notice how only one of them is holding a book? Both gargoyles have books to hold, and oddly enough, the same one that isn't holding one has a lot of trouble keeping its grip. Why not just cast the gargoyles and books as one piece?<br /><br />Some have said that the instructions should have covered every aspect of the playset. I guess that's true to some extent, but if you're having trouble putting together the cafeteria table, I don't know what to tell you.<br /><br />So was there anything I did like? Of course! When constructed and you have all the accessories in place, the school looks great. Not as great as it should have been, but it's still pretty dang cool. The tables and desks fit the dolls perfectly and it's nice that the outside of the building has a basketball hoop, to add a little more imagination to playtime. I liked the web pieces with the little pink pumpkins that dangle from them and we don't have any trouble with these falling off. I was surprised that it came with as many accessories as it did. I guess I'm just used to things like this not coming with much. A nice bonus was the sheet of stickers for kids to put wherever they want. The instructions don't show where they go, so it's up to the user! And as I mentioned earlier, this was the big winner of all my daughter's presents she got this year. I loved seeing her have so much fun with everything [when the speakers weren't falling over].<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend paying the MSRP for this playset at all. It was nearly half price for the last couple of weeks at most major stores, and that's a much better price. For something so flimsy, lacking any sound or action features, I'm surprised that this was going for as much as it was when it first came out. Look for a deal, or just hold off until it eventually goes on clearance. You can get lots of other smaller playsets and cool dolls in the meantime.
B009FOBZL0|5.0|The Wallflowers have produced a new album that is quite reminiscent of the 2000 release, Breach.  The songwriting is stronger than ever and the musical boundaries have moved past acoustic guitars and typical pop music chord progressions.  Reboot the Mission is a track boldly pushing this envelope and does not disappoint in the least.  Constellation Blues runs the gamut of (Bob)Dylan-esque lyricism that has become Jakob's own signature outside of his father's shadow.  If this album is any indication, The Wallflowers upcoming tour with Eric Clapton will leave the patrons of sold-out venues wondering why this band has been silent (from radio airplay) for so long.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great<br />game I had fun hbu it was fun woo much fun you should download it if you like puzzles
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works as it suppose to work.  I use it to kill time waiting on appointments or just relaxing.  It is a great app.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Have not even used this product, if you can call it a product as it is an App for a tablet which we have not figured out how to operate.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I thought the film explored the problems that development in a marriage very insightful way.  The acting was suburb.  The story was well crafted.  I think it is an evening well spent watching this film and especially married couples.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|Fans of the Sega classic Outrun will find a lot to love here. The game is a  faithful homage to the classic coin-op racers from the 80's. Excellent free app of the day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this in two days!!!! Need I say more?! I am anxiously awaiting reading book thee and then, of course, the movies!
B002TLSSXO|3.0|the handles are not heat save. if you leave it inside cookware on the stove top it will melt. other than that it is ok.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|This is a bad bad movie.Could be a candidate for worst of the year.I think the final scene says it all when ms. Hood stabs the the big bad wolf with the severed hand of Mr. OLdman.good luck trying that one next time you meet a big bad wolf.This was red,s plan by the way and yes she is a blonde.<br />Big bad waste of time.yechhhhh.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased with the christmas morning reaction on this one. My girlfriends son (13) is a HUGE minecraft fan, he said &#34;OH MY GOD! Where did you find this? I have NEVER even SEEN these anywhere?&#34; Score geekpoints for me! It turned out to be a pretty good way to help he and I bond a little through our shared nerdity =)
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Impressive region free edition for a timeless classic. The restoration feels great (specially  the video. Audio is fine). Worth the price.
0446572993|5.0|I was left in suspense until the last chapter of this book.  The author is a great writer and one of my favorites.
B0009P7EK0|5.0|Got here on time, good replica of a calf, packaging was appropriate, came in good shape and my grandhild loved it.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Only chose that rating because it was a duplicate gift and I'm not sure how to return it. So now I'm stuck with it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was so well written, and so well-researched, it was amazing.  Even better than the first which was great too!  I loved it and the only downside is waiting for the third book in the series to come out.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Such an inspiring story.  I was a little disappointed with the ending.  I would have liked to know more about her life once she got off the trail and what happened to some of the other people she met.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|I have two sons. One totally made fun of this toy when he saw a commercial. He thought it was the stupidest thing ever. He didn't know that Angry Birds Star Wars was wrapped up under the tree for his little brother. I was a bit worried, but on Christmas morning little brother was excited to open this up, and he played with it later that day and considers it awesome. He also has the first version, but enjoys the space version as well, especially the pig in the helmet that cracks open when it falls. It's not going to change the world, it won't last generations and it won't be brought out on family game nights. I would not consider it worth the $20+ MSRP. But if you have an avid Angry Birds fan, it's a good buy on clearance or lightning special.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book easily grabs your attention right from the beginning and is almost impossible to put down. The story of this young boy's first year of high school is one that is truly interesting. If you have a place in your heart for people that seem to be damaged from the start then this is a great book for you.
B00004XMV6|3.0|Maybe it's just me but I feel 9 1/2 weeks has just not stood the test of time. I bought it, watched it & nothing. Just disappointed as I remembered so much more or maybe imagined as it had been decades since it came out?
B00A81MV3U|5.0|A story about a guy struggling with the different parts of himself, and how instead of being ashamed of some parts of himself he's learning to embrace himself, quirks and all,  through series of awkward situations with family and friends. A must see!
0767812387|5.0|Chayanne is one hunk of a man & helped make this movie a 5 star. As much as I can enjoy a sweet romance I must admit this is the first time I have given one a 5 star rating and worth it too.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Our son was extremely surprised to get this set for Christmas!  He has been wanting it and it has not been available in any stores we have tried online or near where we live.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Nothing can really be said about Walking Dead 3...<br /><br />It's simply the best season so far and it can only get better.<br />The drama, the action, the raw intensity. It's amazing.
1401238580|1.0|I thought this was the book that the movie was based on - sadly, it's a cartoon book and a mask.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire and gives good information.  The radar shows good detail and I like being able to see multiple locations.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I picked up The Hunger Games because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, and was pleasantly surprised. I expected another Twilight phenomenon -- an empty, Mary Sue character coupled with a creepily overbearing man -- but it was so much more than that.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone for its entertainment and the questions it raises about what it means to be a strong female character. Katniss is strong without sacrificing her emotions, tough while still able to be pretty, and is a refreshingly likable role model.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Seller shipped within 48 hours.  However, seller would not give any discount for multiple DVD purchases. You do not save any money the more DVDs you buy from this seller.  The DVD is listed as used yet worked as if brand new.<br /><br />The DVD itself is EXCELLENT.  We haven't seen this movie in a few years, however it was like watching it for the first time since it contained extra scenes in the movie that must have been deleted on the DVD from many years ago.  It is worth getting the deluxe edition.  There are 2 discs, one with extras, including interviews with the actors.
B004LQEYAG|3.0|The product came on time and was exactly what I was expecting.  Haven't watched it yet but am looking forward to it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|this was a great product.the story line is new and fresh. i enjoyed it very much.it was a great purchase.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This is an amazing book! I usually do not read a book in a few days but this one I cannot put down. I love the characters in it. It is written from the point of view of the two main characters.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|On 12-25-2012 I got a new kindle fire and I got this app. The next morning I finished the game.<br /><br />Could have some more things in the game like<br /><br />-levels you can unlock for going a distances<br />- enemy's<br />- more vehicles would be cool<br /><br />Besides that I love this game!!!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I listened to this at work today...there are some hits on the two cd's and some songs I've never heard before.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This was a really good action movie but the plot was a bit difficult to follow.  The story runs parallel to the other Bourne movies.  Good movie the first time but it's not a repeat-watch for me.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|MUY BUENA COMPILACIÒN DE LOS ÈXITOS DE KELLY, ES UN PLACER ESCUCHAR SUS CANCIONES, TANTO LAS MOVIDAS COMO LAS LENTAS.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless started as your typical story girl meets bad boy, girl tries to avoid bad boy, girls falls for bad boy, And it was a fun read that far, but intricate within the story there are layers and hints of what is to come and what a ride it was.<br />Colleen Hoover proves time and time again what a wonderful writer she is, this story that rips your heart for Sky and Holder is a beautiful story about the heartache of this young girl  and boy, how to overcome your past, and those who fail you with the most amazing gift of all Love a well deserved passionate consuming love.<br /><br />“I’ve lost a lot in my long life.<br />Yes, I’ve seen pain and I’ve seen strife.<br />But I’ll never give up; I’ll never let go.<br />Because I’ll always have my ray of hope.”<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY LIVE IT!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game in the car on my phone to keep me from nagging my husband about his driving!!!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I enjoyed his because a dictionary is always needed and comes in handy. Also I was excited about this book because I love to write and I am constantly looking up words, not only when writing either also when reading!!!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Great! Just good information always wanted this movie (to own).also grew up on every new year to watch with the whole family then celebrate the<br />New Year after at midnight.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful, heartbreaking tale of endurance of life and faith by a young boy unexpectedly stranded alone in the Pacific ocean.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a fun game. I have enjoyed it so far. The music is peaceful and relaxing. Worth the dollar spent.
B00AMS38YU|4.0|good and fresh story.action all through without murders everwhere.even the acting was good.the bad guy was crazy,nutty and  played his part good. the movie made me miss my biking days.
B005LFQRTC|3.0|My husband opened this yesterday as this was all he wanted for Christmas and cd 1.5 is all scratched up!  Unfortunately when I rec'd and opened it a couple of weeks ago I threw out the packaging as I re-wrapped in Christmas paper.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book is so good I was not able to put it down. I read it over the course of one weekend. That is not normally my reading pattern and I recommend it to anyone interested in human behavior.
B00007KWHP|1.0|My husband opened yesterday morning for Christmas and most of the tracks skip!  Very disappointed.  I had rewrapped in Christmas paper after receiving several days ago so did not keep the original package or I would return.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|If you like Malcolm Gladwell's &#34;Outliers&#34; and Richard H. Thaler's &#34;Nudge&#34; you will love The Power of Habit. Charles Duhigg relates real work situations to which inventive minds have used our weakness of habit to their benefit. His book will help you better understand the advertising that hits us head on every day. It will also not surprise you that big business understands our habits better than we do ourselves. This is another favorite book that I think you will read over the course of a few days. Enjoy!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This is very sturdy but my 10 year old would have liked it in other colors like teal.  Other than that she loves it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An easy read and quite entertaining. Looking forward to reading the other two books in the series and seeing the characters develop as electronic as changes with the capital`s rules.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was definitely a good read. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed with the last 20% of the book. However, the other 80% is well done and quite unique.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Loved the Movie, saw it about 3-4 times and now I have the DVD to view whenever I feel like visiting Paris again<br />and putting a big smile on my face with ALL of the magnificent actors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you could have all the stuff on pe that's on Pc and x box you would olny have like 7 apps so like it how it is
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I saw bad reviews for this movie, and those reviews made me want to see &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; because they were along the lines of, &#34;It's too slow, too much character development.&#34; And that's exactly what I want in a movie like this! Jeremy Renner is excellent as the lead character, and ably supported by the wonderful Rachel Weisz. Then you throw Ed Norton in the mix and you have a riveting and intriguing action/spy/thriller that raises a lot of question about boundaries, both political and philosophical, and leaves you longing for more.<br /><br />It's very much a Bourne movie, but with better camera work (yes, the last two Matt Damon ones left me a little nauseous from the &#34;realistic&#34; camera shake). Thoroughly recommended, and waiting for the follow-up.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I like the story so far. graphics are great. hoping the mini games are challenging enough to keep me interested
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The writing is still fresh and she has maintained a strong loyalty to her husband.  The show still, as least for me, transcends the typical soap opera feel.  I wish there were more legal issues as opposed to typical courtroom drama.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love being able to contact friends and loved ones when I'm on the road and don't have my laptop.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|She is a remarkable character. A true (character) hero. She has a lot to manage in her life and, despite the pain,she does not delay any difficult decisions.
B005R32L66|2.0|This Skype wasn't made for Kindle so it didn't work as well as I liked so I think found their app made just for Kindle and I'm happier.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I agree with most people,  I've been waiting forever for this to come out, and gee by golly its very good.
B005HSL626|2.0|I don't really care for it. I like games, but not this slinging a knife at fruit. I can't afford to buy games and the free ones are either too childlike or gory.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|The third in the series was not quite as funny as the first two but still worth seeing. I enjoyed it just almost as well though!
B009SQQRH2|5.0|This is an excellent Christmas Movie for Parents and kids.  The kids are enthralled by the action and it is very witty for the adults.  Couldn't recommend it more.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Great memory:  Plug it in, and it works.<br />Bad memory: plug it in, it doesn't.<br /><br />This memory was plugged in, and it works. So it gets 5 stars.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|This was a holiday sale for 1.99 plus I had a one dollar mp3 voucher and was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy the whole album with only one or two songs that were good but not great.
B008Y7J1Y2|5.0|Just a good heartwarming love story. I like Jack Black in a more serious role. It made me laugh and want to swap houses with someone for my own holiday :)
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Perfect Christmas gift as requested by Sons of Anarchy collector.  Will order next couple of seasons as requested by person receiving gift.
B00479SVBU|5.0|The transmission is very clear and hardly any interference. the insstruction or operation may take a little getting used to because there are a lot of functions and so little buttons.
B009POHHRG|4.0|Purchased this book on the kindle and found the art to look fantastic.  The illustrations were clear and the colors really popped.  The story itself was short but entertaining as the story explores the sanity and origins of the Joker. Well paced and dramatic, The Killing Joke is a must read for any comic fan, especially if they are fans of the Batman books.
B000SW4DXK|4.0|I loved the original and this one is close second! The people in this do a great job of honoring the original.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|They just don't make movies like this one anymore. Great family fun movie for all to watch.<br />A brilliance performance!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Easy Read not for teens<br />A little twist for you to enjoy at the end. GOOD ENDING to the story.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This is a pretty typical action movie, nothing revolutionary here.  But if you liked the original movie and you like sci-fi this will satisfy your craving.  The only scene that really disappointed me was the remake of the scene were Houser is trying to get through a security checkpoint with a disguise and then the disguise fails; the original scene was so much more impactful.
B000024FL8|5.0|Bolt Thrower have never let down in my opinion.  I'd say this disc is 2cd only to Warmaster.  I think it's kind of a blend of Warmaster brutality and The IVth Crusade melody.  I can't really say much more about it, listen to it and judge for yourself.
0452289963|2.0|I have an open mind but I thought this book was too simplistic, redundant and terribly unmoving.  I wish he included a section of the book that didn't suck.
B000000OU0|5.0|we bought this to replace our other CD  of this album .. that one had several songs that skipped .. not good anymore.  this is one of our very favorite albums and we're glad we have a good copy of it again.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|exactly what i wanted, new, great description. was a gift and the person who received it hasn't had any problems. i'd buy from this seller again.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|a delight from start to finish (even icky cee lo green sounds good) .. happy to add it to my Xmas CDs collection.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|A wonderful read that had me hooked from the first chapter.  It had me wondering what Asha would do and whether or not she would be reunited with her birthmother and the pangs they all shared.  Heartwrenching at times, unearthing unthinkable realities about humanity.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|What can I say?  Once again TC has exceeded expectations, at least mine.  The Jack Ryan epic continues to roll, with style and class to spare!  I do have one suggestion (he typed chuckling)  maybe add a few blank pages in the middle to remind us to take a break!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app is perfectfor on the go plus I love the weather channel and it works great on my new Kindle Fire
1423140605|5.0|Great! Fantastic. In really great condition and the book was just awesome. Anyone who loves adventure and Greek mythology needs to read this. It's the third in the series though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider solitaire is terrific no matter where you play it or what you play it on.  Thanks much for making it available on my new Kindle Fire HD.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I bought this item as a gift for my son.  He was able to set up and begin using it within minutes.  He loves it and has already begun converting his vinals.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Always wanted to play the piano....and now here is my chance!  It's fun and addicting!  Love the audience...they cheer regardless of how bad or good I played.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Good action + suspense added to a good script... A peak to a reality / conspiracy or just fiction? Either way good to watch
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this being a new character. It's definitely leading to be a possible second with this character. I liked the movie overall.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|This simple download is easy to use no effort on the user easy to follow instructions if you want more advanced coverage and Avast quality to boot.  What more could you ask for?  love it!
B004EPZ08Y|2.0|Box indicates this is a rental movie, but I don't see where the description says that any where.  It has a big white area with RENTAL stamped on it.
0345803493|3.0|Half way through I am tired of it.  Too much of the same stuff! I am not sure I will buy the 3rd book.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Sorry, but I found this movie to be slow and boring. Bane was just flat out boring and seemed to lack any acting skill at all. Glad I only wasted $1.99 to stream it on my Tivo. Even that was probably too much.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Rented this movie and really enjoyed it.  Bought this for my dad for Christmas and he was very excited to see it.  Was a great deal when I bought it and came before expected.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It's a great product, im happy with it's good quality and excellent condition i recomended it good choice<br />thanks a lot
B00866JL96|4.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law as a gift.  Was able to get it for a great price but took way too long to be shipped.  Arrived shortly after being shipped but took quite some time to be sent out.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book:) Its  the most awesomeness and romantic yet true story of some of people's lives.<br />! !
B008XBASVY|5.0|I fell in love with this book instantly! I had my eyes glued for a couple of days honestly. Chris Colfer is hilarious and fantastic.
0312330537|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much because our family lived in India for many years and so it all rang true.  However, I hated the part of the book where Shantaram goes off to Afghanistan.  It was just over the top and I, quite frankly, am tired of the early days of the Taliban and anything written about it.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Can anyone tell me how to get the door open on level 5? I am throwing the rocks at the ttargets but can't open the door and it is driving me mental.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This DVD was exactly what I was looking for as a gift. The recipients don't have a good internet connection throughout a good portion of the year, so they can watch this show without it.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|I can see how this would be a good game for kids ( with small fingers, I should add) However, if you are a real pianist, like me, chances are, this game will drive you nuts.<br />For children who are wishing to become piano players, this may a good game for practicing notes, but it should NOT be used as a sole teaching method
B0053O89WY|5.0|This DVD was exactly what I was looking for as a gift. The recipients don't have a good internet connection throughout a good portion of the year, so they can watch this show without it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This was my first book on My Kindle Fire that I got yesterday, and now, I loved Charles Dickens. I always knew the story but I never really read the book. It was great.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This DVD was exactly what I was looking for as a gift. The recipients don't have a good internet connection throughout a good portion of the year, so they can watch this show without it.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|This book was the best book I have ever read and I read it to my grandpa winkle  every year for Christmas because he used to read it to my mom every year so I am trying to carry on the tradition.
B004OXCL5Q|1.0|I never got to view this movie as it turns out to be an import that only plays in a particular region 2 and as I found out, the United States and Canada are Region 1.  Otherwise you have to have an all regions player.  There was no way of knowing this and I don't use Amazon.com all that often.  Thanks to a customer service rep in South Africa I was educated to a degree about electronics, dvd and blu-ray disc and television - this country vs others.  I now know how to double check if I ever order again.  My issue now is getting my money back from the third party vendor who does not provide postage paid returns on a faulty or mis-sent item.  I now have Amazon.com trying to broker my refund.  Amazon.com personnel did help find El Cid dvd that plays on Region 1 players and I have had to pay double the cost of the blu-ray, but I have done so because this is a classic movie and I saw it for the first time in original release 50 yrs ago and the last time I saw it was 40 years ago.  I am hopeful that the cost will be worth it and I will have no more issues other than trying to get my money back from Import CDs in Irvine, CA.  Now wouldn't you think that when you are in the U.S. ordering for a U.S. address from a company with a U.S. address, somebody would alert you to the issue?  I have to rate this item in order for the review to show up.  Under the circumstances it deserves no stars but I have to give it one to post this.  The movie itself should be grand so I am rating the vendor Import CDs in Irvine, CA.
B007M45PMU|3.0|An unexpected, well-written, well-done first album. They definitely got my attention, curious to see what's next from this new group.

0307887448|5.0|Reading Ready Player One was probably the most pure fun I had reading any book this year. I literally did not want it to end.<br /><br />I am a member of the Atari generation. I grew up spending much of my time playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, haunting mall arcades mastering games like Joust, Tempest and Pac Man, and learning how to program on my 16K TRS-80 and Apple IIe while sneaking sessions on Zork, Aklabeth, Adventure and their various iterations for hours on end. Ernest Cline goes to the near future in Ready Player One to revisit video gaming's near past of the early 1980's, and it is so refreshing to find someone who gives these sources the respect they deserve. When I was reading Ready Player One I often had to explain to others what the huge smile on my face was all about.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a quest. In the year 2044 the world is a mess economically and many, if not most, spend their time in the Oasis, a massive multiplayer online simulation game much like World of Warcraft, only much larger. Wade, the main character in the story, is an extremely poor boy who lives with relatives in \\"The Stacks,\\" a trailer park in Oklahoma City where mobile homes are stacked several high in order to save space. A garbage dump/auto graveyard surrounds the Stacks, and over time Wade manages to piece together working laptops from leftover parts and he is able to connect to The Oasis using an old car battery for power and a pirated Wi-Fi connection while hidden in an old conversion van. Wade attends school in the Oasis and uses his spare time boning up on the obscure 1980's cultural references that Oasis' creator James Halliday grew up with. Halliday reminds me a bit of a Bill Gates/Steve Jobs character.<br /><br />When Halliday dies, he leaves a will stating that his fortune will go to the one who can solve the obscure riddles he left throughout the Oasis, find the three keys, and use them to get through the matching portals. The riddles are affectionately referred to as Halliday's Easter Eggs, and the ones searching for them are called Gunters (short for egg hunters).

0679746048|5.0|Girl, Interrupted is a short, nonlinear account of Susanna Kaysen's 18 month stay in the mid-1960's in McLean Hospital, a psychiatric institution, after she was diagnosed with having borderline personality disorder. She tells her story in deceptively simple short diary-like entries that describe the experience from the point of view of someone who was actually there, on the outside looking in at what we term \\"sanity\\" (or on the inside looking out, depending on your point of view). The text is introduced by and is subsequently interspersed with actual pages from her medical records documenting her stay. These outside observations lend an important third person perspective to the narrative.<br /><br />The book is honest throughout and even darkly funny in parts. It reads quickly, but raises a host of interesting questions that linger long afterwards. For example, to what degree is \\"sanity\\" related to \\"conformity\\" in society? It seems that Kaysen's diagnosis could be applied to many different types of nonconformist behavior. If certain nonconformist behaviors are exhibited on the \\"outside\\" they are generally tolerated, but once a person is labeled as \\"mentally ill\\" many of these same behaviors are seen as dangerous or threatening. Often one's view is determined by perspective.<br /><br />In a way it is unsettling to think about how a certain set of social conventions in one society is used to judge one's \\"sanity\\" or \\"insanity,\\" while conventions in another country or time would judge one very differently. At times Kaysen is absolutely convinced that she is right about the \\"reality\\" of something when she clearly is not (i.e. she becomes terrified at one point that her bones are missing and requires an X-Ray to convince her otherwise). \\"Reality\\" is a very different thing for Kaysen based upon her mindset at the moment. Where does the line lie between sanity and insanity, or between reality and fantasy?<br /><br />Kaysen also makes the interesting distinction between treatment of the brain (using drugs) vs. treatment of the mind (therapy). To what degree is a certain \\"mental illness\\" a chemical imbalance in the brain treatable by drugs, and to what degree is it behavioral and thus treatable by therapy? To what degree is it both or even neither?<br /><br />The hospital allows the patients freedom from everyday responsibility, but takes away many freedoms of the outside world while doing so. To what degree is McLean a refuge, and to what degree is it a prison? To what degree do Kaysen's engagement and subsequent leaving of the hospital essentially force her to swap out one set of freedoms and restrictions for another?<br /><br />Although short, Girl, Interrupted makes one think, and that is always a good thing. It challenges the reader to question basic preconceptions of sanity, insanity, conformity, freedom, reality, and the meaning of \\"normal.\\" This is a very interesting read that I would recommend to anyone interested in mental illness and the nature of \\"normal.\\"tment of the brain (using drugs) vs. treatment of the mind (therapy).

B00338QENI|4.0|I happen to work in medical research & the Informed Consent is imperative for all of our studies. However, consenting someone is a massive undertaking. I would think that since tissues and/or blood samples fall into a different category with the FDA taking samples of any kind probably would never harm a donor. Hence no regulation.

B009A9BEHU|4.0|An excellent souvenir of the concert experience.  I was at first surprised that the songs are divided by documentary segments, but eventually got used to it.  There are two songs in the special features that could have been put into the main concert film.  Bottom line--a must-buy if you enjoyed the concert as much as I did.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I need to start by saying I love these authors and love the character of Agent Pendergast. Each book has enabled us to delve further and further into his character development. This novel was no exception. It was riveting and there were moments I had to put the book down because I was so overcome with some of the scenarios that had happened.<br /><br />The best moments in the book, by far, were the ones with Agent Pendergast. They were fast moving and compelling and so intriguing. He's the true epitome of a superhero, yet he is vulnerable as well.<br /><br />I won't give away any endings, but I will say, I was very worried at one point about some of the developments, but I ended up loving the way the authors weaved all the pieces together. Very well done!

B009MCRHH6|1.0|Lots of hype over this very e expensive game. Don't sees why this is any better than a .99 game. Mist if all, we really miss having a tutorial video to understand what the goal is and how to play. No instructions at all either. So can't tell you about the game cuz it's like playing it blind. No were not stupid. Google send to show bridge building like many other apps but the deva don't make it clear how that done so we're just trying to get the triangle vs the 4 sided. So basically finishing levels on luck cuz don't know how to do what we want. Now red things appeae re and tap all over screen to figure out what to do and nothing happens. Maybe if dev shows me how to play with a smartly done tutorial.. Otherwise other apps have similar concepts so don't get what's so special here except the large file size and price.. In app world, $5 is like $1000 when most apps are .99-1.99 even for the highest rated and now and then you see 2.99-3.99

B00AH34AUQ|3.0|Let me just start by saying that I haven't given this another proper listening to to make a good, in-depth review, but this is just my first impression. I thought Uno! was a great album, Dos! was even better, so naturally I had high expectations for Tre!, but they just weren't quite met. I feel like the band just kinda ran out of ideas by the time they started recording for this album. I can't complain too much though, releasing 3 brand new albums over the course of just 4 months was a very ambitious project, and I applaud them for taking on such a daunting task.<br /><br />tl;dr version: Not their best album, but I give them A for effort.
B003K16P50|1.0|I found this to be a very strange book in the style it was written.  Wasn't able to get more than about 1/4 of the way into it before I realized my time is too valuable to read bad books.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Worst book with Clancy's name on cover I've read & I can't give it any stars. Bet Clancy's writing parrtner did the actual writing & I susprct the plotting as well. The 'parrtner' obviously isn't familiar with Clancy's original Ryan books. If he was there wouldn't be the mistake of Jack Jr.<br />musing about his brothers & sisters. Jack Jr had no brothers.- only an older sister & a younger one. it's obviou Clancy didn't read the manuscript or mistakes like that would'n't have gotten into print. Likewise thus 'writing partner' doesn't have the intriguing style the original Clancy books had. Although it's obvious the man's a techie & he tries to dazel with that, he's no novelist& I'll take great care not to read anything by him again. I coild barely get through the book & in the end simply scaned through it, hopping it would get better, but it never did. bottom line, a very weak & unbelievable plot & a lackluster ending. Save your money!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I learned to love DeMille after reading The Lion's Game (which I read three times over the years).  I couldn't wait to read The Panther. Actually paid almost $13.00 on Kindle.  The most expensive book I've purchased this way.<br /><br />Very disappointing.  Continual descriptions of Yemen, the history, the politics, the people, the weaponry, the sects, the land, and on and on and on. Very little character description or development. Except for a few pages in the beginning, almost nothing on the Panther, his motivations or his background.<br /><br />And as much as I laughed at John Corey's quips in \\"The Lion's Game\\", I simply got irritated at his continual snarky (both mental and spoken) comments on every sentence spoken.  If I had to work with him, I would walk out in disgust at his inability to take anything seriously. Sorry, but it is just boring.<br /><br />If you are looking for a lesson on \\"Everything-You-Ever-Wanted-To-Know-About-Yemen\\", this is the book for you.  If however, you are looking for an actual story, better move on....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I'm only on page 266 out of 629, but I'm doing this review now because I'm not sure I'm going to be able to finish the book.  I read very fast and almost always finish books, but unless there is a big change real soon, this is close to the end.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked the moment I started reading it! This book made me cry, laugh, and smile. Can't wait to reread.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel is absolutely amazing! After reading Colleen Hoover's Slammed series, I knew she was a great writer but this novel sent her into greatness!!!! I fell in love with the characters so easily. The story had really great flow...even the flashbacks were necessary and well placed. I will admit when I realized the chapters were dates, I was nervous I wouldn't be able to keep up. As soon as I got halfway through the book, I realized it wasn't going to be a problem! For those of you ready to take a heartbreaking adventure that will not only entertain you but also feel, at great depths, the characters emotions then don't was to buy this novel. You will not regret a single page, what you might regret is that it eventually ends!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game. I played it on the computer but now I can take it with me. It works great on my Kindle Fire; I haven't had any problems with it. It's a cute game. 5/5 :)
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|If you are from or live in or near Boston you will get this movie.  Do watch the unrated version, and listen carefully to the dialog, Too Funny.  My wife is from Boston she never laughed as much.  Its fun to know the places where this movie is shot. Good job Mark Wahlberg and Ted.  Classic story line,  boy meets bear, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy loses bear, boy gets girl back boy gets bear back. For all from other parts of the country, enjoy it its great, it is just laugh out loud funny. Just think of the area you live in and the local charm and you will also get this movie and LOL.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I chose this rating because the movie was great, but not excellent.<br />What I disliked about this movie, was the fact that it lacked substance, and a real element of suspense.<br />I would recommend this movie to action seekers.

B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I came into this after having read a review that panned the movie.  I am a big fan of the movies but have never played the game.  I went onto read a review from someone that truly loves both the movies and the games, they loved it.  I thought it was fun, interesting and an excellent set up for the next installment in the series.  i will buy this one as I have the others.  The story line is a bit hit or miss but if you relax the movie does come to you eventually.  If you accept the premise of where they are you will not get lost or have any real confusion of why you are seeing characters from the past in the present.  Nice to see old friends (still love Michelle Rodriguez).<br /><br />If you are a fan of the movies it may put you off some, if you are a fan of the game you will understand.  If you are fan of both I think you will very much enjoy it!  Well worth the rental and looking forward to the next one!!!

I use parts of it throughout my Renaissance unit in Visual Art class that includes information about what life may have been like in the 16th century.  This includes the costuming and the culture.  Not to mention the supporting character of Leonardo da Vinci and young Gustav.<br /><br />My students can relate to this interpretation of historical information through a story they are well familiar with, Cinderella.<br />They love it, too.

B0086700CM|5.0|I originally got this game for a 3 and 5 year old to play and it has become my main game to play! Challenging and fun. Make sure you watch the time while playing because you won't realize how fast time flies!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this game is not much different than any of the other Angry Birds games in that you will be hooked. 'Just one more level, i can do it', you'll be saying, then an hour later, you're still going.  sometimes theonly thing that stops you is a low battery.<br />Now the game itself is neat in that you have all the Star Wars characters and special abilities associated with them,  be it lightsabers, blasters, tractorbeams, or force push. also very funny in the execution of merger of characters; stormtrooper pigs are funny, Darth Piggy is downright hilarious!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I got this game for my phone after playing it on the pc, and it is a lot of fun on both platforms.  One complaint I have, though, is that a smartphone screen is just a bit too small for this game.  My fingers tend to block my view of the game, and it can be hard to select and place the goo balls with any precision.  I would definitely recommend this on a tablet or pc, though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is incredible. One of the best books I have read in a while!!! The characters have so much depth and there are so many twists and turns. The story unfolds perfectly!!! Amazing!!!

034580404X|4.0|I really like this series.  The first book seemed to have more sex than plot, but the other two make up for it.  It isn't just all sex, there is story there as well and that is what I like about it.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|My wife and I enjoy watching the show, but we frequently find ourselves &#34;yeah, righting&#34; the storyline. I'm happy to be credulous for the sake of a good story, mind you, but this show purports to be so realistic that I hold it to a higher standard. Claire Danes is wonderful, but Damian Lewis is wooden and one-dimensional. Ultimately I think it is worth watching if you like that sort of thing, but that the Emmy folks should look elsewhere for their greatest television programming list.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Is the best game and I love it so much I will get the computer version. It's  awesome!!!! I am the best at it.
B0086DBE62|3.0|Cute movie, and interesting twist for this story. Glad to have the option to view at home. Family movie for all ages
B00008BXJJ|5.0|I don't generally look to live albums as the best representation of a band, but this is an exception to that idea. AC/DC gets it done like few bands can these days. They have a great blend of classic rock and modern rock sounds. If you are looking for the definitive AC/DC collection, you can't go wrong here.

B0079J28NW|5.0|Until I ordered this product, I had only seen bits and pieces of Yellow Submarine. Seeing the whole feature is a fantastic experience for anyone -- young, old, music fans, animation fans, fans of having fun, fans of pretty colors, and of course, Beatles fans. It is a visually spectacular tale filled with wonder, music and love. Viewing this now from an adult perspective, a few things are clear:<br /><br />  * This is truly a seminal work of animation. Even if not Beatles fans (why not?), this is a must-have for cinemaphiles and animation-philes. You can see how it influenced Terry Gilliam (Monty Python) among many others.<br />  * This is classic story-telling. A bit of Wizard of Oz, a dash of Tolkien, some quasi-vaudevillian comedy and FAB music.<br />  * The Beatles stay true to a couple of Beatle-y themes: 1) Self-reference - can you spot all the references to their songs in the script? 2) Love is all you need.<br />  * Apple really did put out some creative products before it destroyed the Beatles.<br />  * If you ever want to explain to someone what &#34;psychedelia&#34; means, have them watch Yellow Submarine.<br /><br />I read lots of reviews on here before buying this remastered product. I had no issues with the sound volume (loud, which is how I like it - and controllable by the listener anyway) or the visuals. Most colorful thing anyone will ever see. The accompanying booklet and cels are a nice bonus. Nothing not to like here.<br /><br />If you don't own this piece of history, you are a Nowhere Man. Or worse, maybe even a Blue Meanie.

We will probably watch it a couple of times and then just have it in our collection or pass it on to a younger friend to enjoy.

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|We were surprised at how well the production of this movie turned out.  You can tell that Kristen Stewart's acting abilities have grown and matured in this movie beyond the Twilight saga.  Overall the storyline was good and I would recommend it to others.  I like this multi-pack because for a few dollars more you get a copy of the movie compatible for every device that you might want to watch it on.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was easily the best book I have read in years. Green 's selective choice of poetry  made me literally speechless. The plot left me begging for more, and I am not ashamed to say that I cried several times throughout. Cliche perfection.

B009POCG0Y|2.0|This movie was like a Quinton Tarintino film; BAD, BAD, BAD!  I'm really surprised that Mathew McConaughey even considered being in it.  It was typical of Gina Gershon, however. I'm sorry I paid the $$$$$ to buy it.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is ugly, heartbreaking, and yet beautiful at the same time. I wish I could say more without spoiling the major key plot of the story but I can't. All I can say is that I love Holder and Sky. I cried, I laughed, was enraged, disgusted, it's amazing how many emotions Colleen Hoover could incite in me.<br /><br />Read this book!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book caught me off guard.  I had no idea it was all about bondage.  Certainly very different from anything I've ever read.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Its sooooo good I cannot stop spending money on this app!!!every time I need to do a price check,this is my guide.And I NEVER FIND BETTER PRICES THAN ON AMAZON!!!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|similiar to other match and explode games, keeps your attention trying to get to the next world. An engrossing play
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Great to finally hear from Van Morrison again and i do love this cd. Especially like the &#34;Close Enough for Jazz' cut.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This is one of the best series there is, traps you from the beginning to the end, I would definitely recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading the book. It was a real page turner! However the vet receptive language made it really redundant.
B0055SWM08|1.0|ok in my opinion its not the best just saying plus the name at first i thought it was some bible thing
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I bought this game and it took my money but wont download. I now must add morewords that have nothing to do with the game. banana pickle hi alex
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great story, excellent acting, good direction, produced by Clint Eastwood, who never makes bad pictures.  A movie that is well worth watching.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The first season special edition, is so incredible! The bonus, all features, behind the scenes, makeups,  I just loved all content!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This is such a heartwarming story. The plot is relatable to anyone in a long term relationship. There were a few tear jerking moments for me but I loved this movie. Jones and Streep play their characters to a tee!
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I could not get into the first half of this story.  For me the story did not even start to become interesting until the 50 percent mark.  It turned out to be very good.  The ending was wonderful.  I have read a few books by Courtney Milan and never remember not enjoying a story.  Read at your own risk. I can not recommend this book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a army infantryman that did 2 deployments to Afghanistan and 1 to Iraq. I appreciate everything that our soldiers do and did for us as a country. I know the sacrifice it takes  and I am grateful for the elite that do the things we don't know. Thank you to all soldiers that continue to serve.
B007V65R54|5.0|Great book on predictions. The author presents example as diverse as baseball, elections, weather, financial crisis and terrorism to discuss how probability and statistics play an important role in our world.<br /><br /> We learn why is it so difficult to predict anything exactly: we would have to solve very complicated equations very quickly. Instead, scientists combine empirical observations with statistical techniques, in particular Bayes's Theorem, to create helpful scenarios.<br /><br />The central point is analyzing why some predictions are right and some are wrong. In short, the theory behind various subjects can be very complex, and it can be really hard to interpret the data correctly.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone interest in science, statistics and predictions.
0547848412|5.0|It took me some time to get enticed but after the first quarter, it became really interesting. What I found most fascinating is how it grips the reader despite being predominantly a narrative with very little dialogue in the very limited geography of a small boat, where the protagonist finds himself stranded after his ship capsizes. Personally I am among those who likes to read stories written in first person, so I really appreciate what Martel has done in writing the novel from Pi's perspective. It is a remarkable tale of loss and survival written on a stationary of philosophy and religion. Interpretations will vary, depending on whether one reads it as a believer, a nonbeliever or an agnostic, however the enjoyment it provides will surely be universal.<br />One of my favorite lines: \\" To be a castaway is to be a point perpetually at the center of a circle.  However much things may appear to change- the sea may shift from whisper to rage, the sky might go from fresh blue to blinding white to darkest black- the geometry never changes. Your gaze is always a radius.  The circumference is ever great.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|For me ( kindle fire ) there are no gliches exept for, Its so fun and addictive. I'd give a five stars!!!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|\\"Death to Ming!\\"  Ted  will most likely make it on my classic comedy movie list.. Vulgar? Hilariously. All the fun of Family Guy and then some.<br />\\"King of the impossible!\\"
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Not as good at the second one - character development was lacking - seemd disjointed. Still a good flix to watch
B00APUYWYA|3.0|There were some interesting threads in the story.  However to many unresolved issues like her roommate etc.  The singing and arrangements were fun.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|We all know the story of A Christmas Carol. We've seen the movie every year for years, but do we really know the story. For my part it was a joy to read Dickens own words because every film is a slightly different version of the book. After reading his words I feel I finally know the story. I recommend it to everyone.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I think the producers and cast do a very good job staying on the edge that the first season started. A few things that require a leap of credibility but overall, very well done. I would really like to see this show as done by HBO or another cable producer. A scary tale told well.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|I love Meg Ryan.  She is such a great actress.<br />This was a fun movie to watch.  Very entertaining.<br />Definitely worth the watch.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It's basic, but it's what I needed to feel good about taking my Kindle places. Now I use my Kindle pretty much everywhere. Now if Amazon would make the OS a little more versatile, I'd be completely stoked. Excellent case for the price.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Beautiful! Just remember, these actors sang live while filming the movie, so the singing is not perfect, but it conveys a lot more emotion.  Eddie Redmayne, who pays Marius, sounds pretty close to perfect though.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Fun for kids and adults alike, entertaining for those times the littles ones are &#34;bored&#34;.  I would recommend this app.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|It's utterly useless.  In Excel, the keypad won't come up so you can't input numbers, and in Word, if you try to save somehing, you can't access it.  It disappears into a black hole.  I opened a Drop Box account and can't save it there either because it's not a recognized application.  This app is totally worthless.  Had I spent $15 for it I would be really pissed.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Finished this classic tale again. Definitely a classic and one of my favorites. Worth every minute of time spent reading it.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Best episodes from the beginning.  Work great on my Kindle Fire!  Ordered and downloaded immediately.  Can watch anytime now over and over.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is a good app. I like it. its very helpful. many useful modules. and the word games are interesting
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book got very predictable as it progressed. It was enjoyable and entertaining! I would recommend this to others to read.
B000T433CO|5.0|Just an easy movie to watch.  I do so enjoy viewing a bit of Jude Law :) Makes you believe in chance.
B007GFDVEE|4.0|I bought this set for my 5 yr old for Christmas.  He loves it!  The set includes a motorcylce and Capitan America.  It also includes two bad guys with some sort of flying thing and other equipment for them.  It is a great set for the money.  The only reason it isn't 5 star is I think Legos need to have some sets more appropriate for 5 and 6 yr olds, as in more complicated than the Duplo line buy not as complicated to put together as these.
B003EEMIV8|4.0|The back of the truck went down very hard when lifted up to put garbage in it. It seemed to need oil.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Very funny movie.  A little outside of Sandra Bullock's norm, but she did a great job. Would watch it again.  Relatively clean except for some language.
B000VBIGD6|1.0|Very poor quality.  It looks like someone filmed this while in a movie theater. I purchased this movie years ago but gave it away and thought this was the same copy but it wasn't.  Don't order this one.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|To me this movie is funny and has good action and a great love story different in its own way
1451613512|4.0|Lots of really interesting bits of information I never heard before. If only I knew this, I could have been a doubter earlier.  A great read.
B004WR125O|4.0|Carefully consider whether or not you'll derive any real benefit from this unit before you buy it.<br /><br />I'll admit up front that this was an impulse buy for me, because I wanted to have a &#34;complete&#34; installation.<br /><br />While I don't really regret it (hey, I learned something, right?), my TX-NR809 receiver lives three feet away from my media server- under the largest display in my house. My network is all wireless at this point, with the exception of a printer.<br /><br />This part works- but I now have a wireless transceiver that I'll probably end up using with another network appliance.<br /><br />The server is far more versatile and can access all the internet sources the receiver was built to access directly- and it's usually on anyway, so it's not like I'm going to be using any less power.<br /><br />A media PC generally uses HDMI via a video card to talk to a switching device anyway- in this case, the TX-NR809.<br />HDMI actually uses PCM for audio, at a pretty high bit rate- so it's not like you're losing anything, especially with a signal source like internet radio.<br /><br />There's simply no advantage to having this unit stream audio through my router when my server is already physically connected to the receiver- so it's currently sitting in a drawer, and I'm still listening to SiriusXM- via my server.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Very pleased with both MIB 1 and also with MIB 2, I naturally came into this movie with great expectations. Yet after watching it, it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. Much too much was attempted in the way of special effects, and it felt like the producers were trying to make up for a poor script with overdone scene elements like alien chefs etc. I'm glad I didn't waste good money watching it at a theater.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I love this! The 8 new songs are fantastic! And I love how they put the 3 discs into a box set like a collector's edition. THAT'S SO COOL! Even though \\"Va Va Voom\\" is on it, that track is still pretty new it only came out not too long ago so I consider it as \\"still new.\\"  I love this CD Box Set and the bonus 90-minute DVD with Exclusive Footage was good with footage of her \\"Pink Friday\\" perfume photo-shoot, footage of her video shoots, footage from her \\"Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour\\" etc. So anyway WAY TO GO NICKI! YOU NEVER FAIL!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this because you can always do better and the game doesn't end. I played so much my battery died. If I had to rate this on a scale from 1 to10 I would say 11 no matter if u are chilling at home or looking for something to do u will love this app

B00APUQRPC|3.0|Certainly not a potential award winner, but fun to watch. Clint Eastwood plays himself and Amy Adams is enjoyable. Worth watching.
B002M87V0A|3.0|The movie was great, as expected, and the music tremendous.  Had difficulty in that we could not get the full TV screen view, so it was really no better than watching it on a pc.  Also, in the middle of the movie, the sound stopped coming through the TV and only came through the laptop speakers.  I don't think that I would try another movie again, will just have to rent through red box or some other way of using the actual DVD.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|What a waste of such a good cast. So much more could have been done with the topic and the great lead actors.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app, its well worth the money.  It works well and it tells you quickly where your battery stands.  To me, its a must-have.
B005LAII12|1.0|Didn't even finish watching it.  Just plain awful.  No humor, no story, no acting.  Get a magazine and go in the bathroom with it and you'll have more fun.  Would have given it zero stars if that had been an option... no on second thought - 3 stars.
B00457X8BC|5.0|Having read most of the Wallender mysteries out of order, I finally learn how and when Wallender meets his love, Baiba. I enjoy the Wallender mysteries because Mankel's character is an everyman. He plods along, going down blind alleys, having to regroup, and rethink. He eats poorly, drinks too much, and doesn't take care of himself as he should. He's a dutiful son, divorced, with a teenage daughter that he loves, but barely knows. Who couldn't identify with a poor schmuck like that?
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Loved the lego build-a-watch.  My grandson loved it.<br />I came in 2 days and the price was right.<br />Thanks,  Cindy from Wisc
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I saw the movie in the theaters about 5 times and loved it.  although the story line is rather bloody I think the director was good at drawing the line so it wasn't too bad.  the only problem was that I couldn't down load it to my PC so I had to watch it on line.
0060974176|4.0|This is a book that if you are beginning lean or have been involved with it you should have under your belt. It began the whole lean discussion.Some others helped me more but this really gave the history & where it all started. Look to Gemba for answer any question you have after reading this.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|It was free and it's still a waste of $$. Uninstalled. 29 word minimum. No. Good. Boring. Waste<br /><br /> This app market blows.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I am absolutely a fan so I am biased but it has been great having the episodes automatically show up.
B004J3QACQ|5.0|about 10 of these cd,s were so so but worth getting for the other 15 especially Muddy Waters, johnny winter, SRV etc. Only gripe unreadable covers not in English
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|The Sessions is an extraordinary little indie film based on an even more extraordinary true story.  In 1988, Mark O'Brien, a thirty-eight year old poet, journalist and advocate for the disabled living in Berkeley, California, decided to lose his virginity.  This may not sound very extraordinary unless you know that O'Brien, severely afflicted by polio as a child, had spent most of his life in an iron lung and was unable to move any part of his body below the neck.<br /><br />O'Brien's decision was prompted as a result of research he was doing for an article on the sex lives of disabled people.  After interviewing a number of disabled people, and seeing how many of them were in fact enjoying an active and rewarding sex life in spite of their disabilities, O'Brien began to consider his own sex life, or rather, his complete lack of one, and how he might go about changing that.  The issue was further complicated for O'Brien by the fact that he was a devout Catholic and what he was contemplating - sex outside of marriage - was a moral issue as well as a physical one.  So in addition to consulting a sex therapist for help with his physical challenges, he also consulted with his local priest for what was for him a moral challenge as well.<br /><br />It is important to understand the exact nature of O'Brien's situation.  He was not paralyzed, at least not neurologically.  Polio afflicts the muscles, leaving them weak and atrophied, but not the nerves, and so although he couldn't move, O'Brien could still feel and his 'equipment' still worked, albeit in moments that were more embarrassing than anything that could be considered pleasurable, given that the only people ever touching him or seeing him naked were doctors, nurses and attendants. And he could survive outside of the iron lung for a few hours at a time, though he had to be kept on a gurney which let him lie prone.  But this made it possible for him to do things like attend university where he ultimately earned his degrees in English and journalism (and later to have his sessions with the sex therapist). Ultimately though he always had to be put back into the iron lung as his own lungs were only strong enough to function on their own for those few hours.<br /><br />The story of O'Brien's quest for non-virginity is brought vividly to life in first-class performances carried out by a marvelous cast.  John Hawkes (best known for his Oscar-nominated supporting performance in 2010's Winter's Bone) does an outstanding job as Mark O'Brien, rising to the challenge not only of portraying a man solely through the use of his head and face but also finding O'Brien's voice, bringing out his combination of intelligence and humor along with his anxieties and vulnerabilities, both physical and emotional.  Helen Hunt (best known for her Oscar-winning performance in 1997's As Good As It Gets) is equally outstanding as Cheryl Cohen Greene, the sex therapist who works with O'Brien to help him achieve his goal of becoming a fully realized sexual person, bringing out Greene's own struggle between her commitment to always maintaining a professional distance with her clients and her inability to not be moved by O'Brien's mix of raw vulnerability and nervous courage.  And his ability to find humor in spite of his situation.  \\"I have to believe in God,\\" O'Brien says at one point.  \\"I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this.\\"<br /><br />The supporting cast is also quite excellent.  William H. Macy does a nice turn as Father Brendan, the priest O'Brien turns to for guidance with his dilemma.  In what could easily have been a mere comic clich&eacute; role, Macy instead delivers a nuanced performance as a man who seriously weighs the church's position against the sheer humanity of the situation he's been presented with and then goes with his basic humanity, telling O'Brien \\"I have a feeling that God is going to give you a free pass on this one.  Go for it.\\"  Macy does bring a gentle humor to the situation, showing Brendan's awkward discomfort at advising someone with such an unusual problem, but gives it a solid grounding by showing Brendan's commitment to giving the best spiritual guidance he can, even if he does feel completely out of his depth.  Moon Bloodgood delivers a quietly funny performance as Vera, the supportive attendant who accompanies O'Brien on his interviews for his article and to his sessions with Greene, doing her best to be stoically professional even as her highly expressive face reveals her inner reactions to the things she sees and hears in the course of her duties.  And Jennifer Kumiyama is quite engaging as Carmen, a wheelchair-bound woman with Arthrogryposis who's cheerfully chatty about her sex life when O'Brien interviews her for his article and who ends up letting O'Brien and Greene use her apartment for their initial sessions.<br /><br />As both director and screenwriter, Ben Lewin brings a special insight and sensitivity to the film, being someone who was afflicted with polio himself as a child and who must use arm braces to move about.  In addition to drawing on his own experiences while writing the screenplay, Lewin worked closely with Susan Fernback, O'Brien's partner of several years, and with Greene, wanting the script to be as faithful to O'Brien the man as humanly possible.  The music score by Marco Beltrami is appropriately subtle, present in the background and discretely adding to the tone or feel of a scene but never threatening to distract from or overwhelm what's happening on the screen.  In some movies the director depends on the score to tell you what you're supposed to be feeling, but The Sessions has no such need.<br /><br />But it's Hawkes and Hunt who carry the heart of the movie and they do it marvelously well.  Hawkes' challenge is first to portray O'Brien's extreme limitations and vulnerability, and then, having done that, to get you to see beyond those things to the man O'Brien really was.  Not without some cost though.  One of the things Hawkes did was to lie on a soccer ball-sized foam rubber sphere during filming to simulate O'Brien's curvature of the spine.  However effective the results were visually, the constant pressure against Hawkes' spine resulted in him developing back problems.  Hunt's challenge was similar in that her role required her to spend a lot of her screen time naked, playing a woman who was both comfortable and professional at being naked and in a sexual situation with her clients, and then to slowly reveal Greene's growing discomfort with the fact that in spite of her professionalism she cannot be completely dispassionate about O'Brien, that there is something about him that is connecting with her and making her feel for him.  It's a tribute to the chemistry that develops between these two fine actors that the sexual aspect of their situation ultimately becomes secondary to the emotional and human connection that's being made.<br /><br />In 1997, O'Brien was the subject of a short film by Jessica Yu, Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject.  In it, he makes the statement \\"The two mythologies about disabled people break down to:  one, we can't do anything, or two, we can do everything.  But the truth is, we're just human.\\"  That, more than anything else, sums up what The Sessions is all about.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.g a gentle humor to the situation, showing Brendan's awkward discomfort at advising someone with such an unusual problem, but gives it a solid grounding by showing Brendan's commitment to giving the best spiritual guidance he can, even if he does feel completely out of his depth.

B000QUUD60|5.0|Great video performances by the king of rock and roll himself. Great gift for any Elvis fan who enjoys listening to and watching the greatest entertainer who ever graced the stage.
B000YHG72E|3.0|Sorry, just not a Will Ferrill fan... story is kinda cute, though. Bob Newhart was great, that helped quite a bit.
B007EE564U|5.0|Classic Mitch Rapp!<br />A little slow to get to top speed, but sureenough the action kicks in ... a non-stop page turner, as always from Flynn.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable!
B004EKCNMA|4.0|One of my favorite roles for Carey, added a nice presence to this old story. Loved the camera prespective, well done!
B0002G2B2M|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, I highly recommend to any and everyone. I could watch this over and over again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|All is good! same as above, I just like having some thing to do when I'm not busy.  Love it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I got my Kindle for Christmas last year and this was the first book that I downloaded to see if it worked.  I thoroughly enjoyed this tale and would recommend this to anyone looking for a heart warming story and a good laugh.  Helps even more if you have been to Ireland.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a book I could not put down.  As good as Fifty shades.  Would recommend to any one who read Fifty Shades
0156907399|5.0|Love her books!  This was a very enjoyable book.  I highly recommend it.  A good book to curl up with and lose yourself in.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|Works pretty good once we got it figured out. A screwdriver required for batteries. Only 4 cartridges included. You can buy the rest separately. Four was enough for now. Other than that the price was high for a plastic gun with cheap foam bullets but it wasn't my call.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought it was a nice afternoon read.  The story had some funny scenes in it and the pace was good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved the book far more than the movie. Very well written with good details. Looking forward to the next book.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book has amazingly rich, and descriptive language. It keeps you sucked in from the first letter to the last period.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is well worth the money! It's pretty amazing that you get two versions of each movie on Blu-Rays in a nice box and book.
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is fun, but frequently the control scheme makes it impossible to avoid the obstacles that come immediately after a jump or slide.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I was a huge fan of her first album that came out a while ago. This record is a nice progression forward. It's produced beautifully and the songs are amazing.
B000FZETIO|5.0|Excellent movie have always enjoyed watching it. Just wish they could make them like this again but it is what is.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I was a little tired of hearing their music every day but this new batch of songs are all amazing! I'm very happy with the new growth as musicians and song-writers.
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|One would think the music companies would run out of ways to hit us up for more Rush money. 2112 is an album masterpiece by Rush that has withstood the test of time. It is a work with its own signature of greatness. Hearing the title cut in 5.1 adds to the experience all over again. Follow it with the variety of five other songs such as A Passage To Bangkok, or Lessons, and those songs are again enjoyed in their new audio dimensions. The comic book artwork adds further definition to what the songs are about. Kudos to the artist for helping to bring these classics to higher life. I'm not sure that a blu-ray disc would add any further value to comic book images or 5.1 sound over a DVD. The additional live tracks, though we've heard them many times before, are an additional set of goodies for the Rush collector. I would have liked to hear a live cut of something previously unreleased, such as Twilight Zone, but I'll take what I can get.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|It's a pretty good batch of new songs. I didn't have high expectations for this honestly and I'm happy to say I was surprised by it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book. I have the whole series now that I got the book. Really good book here in my hands
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Some of his other books were better but still I thought it was ok and I hope he makes another book
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|WTF? What happened? I have all the other Resident Evils and enjoyed them but this one is not worth watching...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bought this book because everyone else was reading it· The  book was a fun read just as I thought.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Short one this time... I was done in two evenings, and wished it were 1,000 pages! Been reading Clancy forever.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Gotta love Clint Eastwood the ultimate grumpy old man. Good story somewhat predictable. Good family friendly entertainment with a bit of a twist and a happy ever after.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Savages has great ensemble of talented actors as well as an engaging plot.  Though we preferred the first ending, though the true ending is unexpected.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Too long, too much touchy-feely, weak plot, and corny humor. Multiple adult beverages would help. They should have stopped after the first one.
B00A62UR96|3.0|i watch the movie every year,it is about a boy who is starting to not believe in santa anymore ,when this one magical night,this train rolls up called the polar express and stops outside his house and takes him on a journey to the north pole,along the way he makes friends and learns something also.
B00178I1PU|1.0|The wood broke within 5 minutes of use. So disappointed! It didn't take much to break. I would not recommend this product.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Very poignant account of how lives of different backgrounds intertwine and affect for good, bad, and produce the minutia we call existence.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Received this case in black as a Christmas present and I love it already. It's super light unlike previous cases I've owned and seems pretty sturdy. I love the \\"smart cover\\" like piece that keeps dust off Kindle screen. Some people we're complaining about the strap being glued and I have no issue with that. The strap is extremely useful and it doesn't bother me how its attached to the rest of the case. The strap doesn't seem like it will fall of anytime woo. So I don't get the big deal about it being glued. Anyway its comfortable to hold on to and seems protective. Arrived on time and stays put when in stand mode. My only complaint is when I opened it (still in the box it shipped in)  the case had these weird marks all over it. They have worn off now and weren't that much of a problem. Overall I reccomend this case.
1616614609|5.0|I found this reimagining of a classic CCG an elegant experience. While keeping the asymmetrical nature of the original Netrunner intact FFG has added both limitations (in the form of influence points and card copy limits) and expanded upon the original premise. Subdividing the Corp and Runner sides into 4 Corps and 3 Runners allows a greater degree of identity to the different deck archetypes one can build. I am eagerly awaiting the upcoming Data Pack expansions so as to begin to get a feel for how the environment changes in an LCG versus a CCG.<br />My only negative point at this early juncture in the large number of different tokens and counters this version requires.  Thankfully a free iPhone/ iPad app exists that removes alot of the clutter.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My aunt and I have been watching Columbo for a long time and we just love it. So if you are into this type of crime fighting watch it on ME-TV. Then buy it for yourself or someone you love.
B008XBASVY|5.0|This was an amazing story. I laughed so hard at the main characters witty personality. I can't wait to see the movie!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Amazing story, I loved the musical version of this and just had to read the written version. I really enjoyed getting the whole back story of the characters.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A good read..  A little confusing at times with the time changes in the chapters but a good twist at the end.  I love a good surprise ending.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Enjoyed this film. Its a must see! Nothing like a movie that can make you laugh so hard you cry!
B009E3EXMU|3.0|I'm disappointed because the CD's sound really bad on my car CD player, which usually sounds good.  And when I watch the concert on my computer, it also sounds bad, even if I use my speakers.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Wow, intense action. Breaking bad just keeps getting better. Alway a crazy twist in the plot, never know what to expect.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I downloaded the first episode or two on itunes and had some trouble, so decided to order the whole season.  Now I've watched it twice and I love it.  Can't wait for Season 2.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great movie. Makes build up story for Advengers. Has a lot of action and adventure. Great movie for little kids.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is wonderful entertainment. If you love dogs and wonder wheter they preceive human events as we do, this fictional account based on this premise is for you. A great read from start to finish!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book, it's characters and scene settings are captivating....I could not put this read down.  &#34;Gone Girl&#34;  is a must read.
B007SSDS24|2.0|Been done before, then again what has'nt, new what was going to happen before it did. It would be worth watching at 1.99
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I bought this for my son for the Kindle we got him for Xmas. What a load of crap. $3.00 for two levels than 1.99 for more. THAT IS NOT A PREMIUM APP. I want my money back and thanks for ruining my kid's first experience on the Kindle - remember 9 year olds understand the value of money too!
B005PV81MS|5.0|If you liked Shaun of the Dead or just a fan of the English accent.<br />This is a must watch.
1451695195|1.0|NDE's are an interesting topic; if heaven, or hell for that matter, exist how do you prove it? And if it doesn't how do you prove a negative? A serious unbiased study of NDEs could shed a lot of light on the after life if not heaven and /or hell.  Unfortunately DR Alexander's NDE is of no help in those areas. While similar in some respects to other NDE accounts, a feeling of of overwhelming love, traveling though tunnels, and a feeling that one  is in the presence of God, Dr Alexander's account has none of the hard to explain connections to earthly surroundings.  He had no recall while in a coma/dead of conversations that people around his body were having. no descriptions, from a first hand prespective, of what loved ones were doing while he was in a coma dying. That type of event is fairly common in other NDE stories and present the most difficult to refute evidence of an after life.<br />  About half of \\"proof of Heven\\" deals with his illness, his family and his resume'.  The fourty percent or so of the book that actualy deals with the NDE ( 10 % is mostly fluff, a  reading list and silly  theory) reads like a something Sherliy Mclain would write while smoking drugs.  It consisted of him traviling around on the wings of a massive butterfly over some garden of eden type paradise or burrowing through some \\"Dirty jello like mud\\", apparently \\"hell lite\\" , no fire, no brimestone, no nashing of teeth,  just an un easy feeling that was as easy to escape as thinking about the beam of light that would take him out of the jello.  Reading his description of the after life I couldn't help but wonder if NDE's (or at least his NDE) are realy nothing more than a panicking brain fearing death and suffering from hypoxia, randomly firing of nuerons, creating the ultimate hallucination. If that was all that was wrong with this book I might have giving the book 3 stars, but what disturbed me was the whole \\"new ageness\\" of the book. Sections of the after life are referred to as \\"thecore\\" \\"the eath worms eye view\\"  \\"the well\\" and so forth. God is called om (Om is a new age/eastern diety whose name is often chanted in meditation and yoga)<br />In short this book offers no real proof of heaven and is filled with new age physco babble not worth the time, money or effort.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|It was a good sequel. I would definitely recommend that others purchase this movie and the one that came before it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|What a crap app. Free means u have xomercial flashing in. Your face all the time. Silly waste of my time. Very dissapointed
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|This was one of the gifts my grandson was so excited about.. Grammie and Papa were big hits over these.<br />.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|we watched the first and second season and loved them!! had to get them so we can watch again and again!! can't wait for the third season to finish so we can buy it too!! great show!!
B004HXIZVC|2.0|I've had Soundcloud on my Kindle Fire for a few years, but just recently there was an upgrade aavailable for the app, so I upgraded. I sure wish I hadn't because now I can't access (my likes) which was the primary function on this app to me. The (my likes or my favorites)  acts as a sort of library, which now I can't access. I wish I had never upgraded. So to Kindle Fire users,  upgrade at your own risk.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love Ken Follett`s books and this one did not disappoint! I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Well acted but not what I was hoping for in a comedy.  It was sort of depressing actually, I would not recommend this movie.
B007PFD90G|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is something  we should all think about -the need to stand up for what irrational and tolerant, and accept some risk and some responsibility for the way went to live.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Love this album.  Almost every track is listenable, with 3-4 signature &#34;power&#34; tracks.  If only they weren't touring in Europe all the time ...
B007ZTN07O|1.0|u don't buy this app it work once and after that just appear error or doesn't even open stupid app
B005LAIH4A|5.0|great movie my 3 year year old loves it! It is funny and we enjoy watching it as a family.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was a real eye opener and helped me see the never-ending struggle that some people are forced to endure in this world. I recommend this book if you're struggling right now. I don't know whether or not this book will help you in terms of coping with struggles or if it will open your eyes to really step into someone else's shoes as it did me. Nevertheless, this was a well-written and, I believe to be, inspirational book. The main character is utterly wonderful and I instantaneously related to her as a person of quick wit and a realist approached outlook on life.
B006P8HLSA|4.0|Alice in Chains was one of my favorite grundge bands in the early 90s.  The diversity of this album shows how they weren't your typical formulaic grundge band.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Other than the fact that Channing Tatum can truly dance well, this movie was beyond a stinker. Mathew M. just creeped me out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely outstanding! I don't remember the last time I sat down with a really good book, but The Fault in Our Stars was the first great book I've read in years! I recommend this book to anyone even considering reading it. It's a very moving and heartfelt story. By the end of the book,which I finished in a day, I felt so connected to the characters I was crying! Again, definitely one of my favorites.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Since Alien is one of my all-time favorite Sci Fi movies, I really was excited to watch this one. I was so disappointed. It was slow and the story was just confusing.
0143116371|5.0|Muy buen libro.<br />Fotografías de gran calidad.<br />El tamaño del libro es el adecuado para llevarlo a cualquier lado.<br />Especial para ojear todos los días.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought the story was compelling.  The auther did a great job on this book.  Definitely a page turner.  Will read more by this author.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Si viste Star Wars por primera vez en el cine, y luego lo has viston en VHS y en DVD, no puedes dejar de tener la saga complata el Blu-Ray.<br />Si estas en la buscas de extras y cosas anexas a la película, esto no es lo que estas buscando, acá sólo tienes las películas y nada más.<br />Justo lo que yo estaba buscando.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A fun read. Everything I expected it to be. Can't wait to read the next one! And the next one.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Ver esta trilogía en Blu-Ray es impresionante.<br />El nivel de detalle se aprecia mucho más.<br />Si está buscando extras, esto no le va gustar. Solo viene la película.
B002JODUI4|5.0|The only song on this record that isn't amazing is &#34;Word Problems&#34;, and even that track is growing on me. Also, &#34;Strobe&#34; is worth all 10 or so minutes.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Si viste Star Wars por primera vez en el cine, y luego lo has viston en VHS y en DVD, no puedes dejar de tener la saga complata el Blu-Ray.<br />Si estas en la buscas de extras y cosas anexas a la película, esto no es lo que estas buscando, acá sólo tienes las películas y nada más.<br />Justo lo que yo estaba buscando.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|Simply a tour-de-force that many internet DJ's stream to this day. I highly recommend it for dance music fans everywhere.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read other books by Kate Morton and loved all of them.  With Secret Keeper I hated to see it end but could not put it down.  It combines mystery and family dynamics.  As I read I kept guessing the end but never came close to the surprise ending.  Book clubs will have plenty to discuss
1449415881|5.0|Essential for every Dilbert fan of all ages. This calendar is hilarious and has all new comics from Scott Adams.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|My son is happy with this watch, it's lightweight and easy to design and wear.  I feel it is slightly tricky to separate the pieces (easy to snap them together, just not easy to get them apart), and the other thing I noticed is that it's listed as having a Lego soccer ball in the package with the mini figure, but ours didn't come with one.<br />For the price, I think it's a great gift.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We love this movie! An entertaining watch with a good environmental message. Now if only I could find some Truffula Trees!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love the app on my Kindle.  Loved it on my Galaxy S3 until it started freezing up and has now completely quit responding.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I am not typically a fan of zombie stories or books. This one caught my eye. At times the story is gruesome, but told in a way that is more realistic - if zombies were to appear. This story is from the point of view where the author is someone who witnessed this event and chronicled it throughout. Very interesting.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Loved the continuation of Harry Hole's adventures, misfortunes and relationships and cannot wait for his next novel.<br />Also liked the complexity of the plot and the continuing character development over the course of this series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should make this be today's free app because it would bring happy reviews and happy device bring in more buyers for later games.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I didn't like it. Musical with no plot. All over the joint and made no real sense. Dumb.  Waste of money.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I've never read a book quite like this, but I found myself getting quite absorbed in it. It's very quirky, as are the characters in it, but it was a fascinating read.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|So great to hear Enigmas again..This is excellent! A different sound for them. I use this for beautiful background music in my Pilates Studio.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|this game is quite a  challenge but really fun and keeps you on your toes. . It works real good on my Kinde Fire.
B001EN71CW|5.0|What can I say. A great series that had a short life span thanks to FOX. Seems like a lot of show series die on FOX before they had a chance to be excellent. It didn't help that FOX moved the show time around so much that you didn't know when it was on. I could see where the show was really picking up with character development and story line. Things were coming together until they got the FOX axe. I did like how they wrapped it up with the Serenity movie.<br /><br />Anyone who is a sci-fi fan can really get into it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This purchase was a Christmas gift.  The recipient was very excited to receive this movie.  He and his family are big Walking Dead fans.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|One of the greatest albums from Rihanna. No bad song is on the CD and the implementation of dubstep tunes on some songs are just great.
B004R63MWQ|4.0|This movie wasn't on netflix, so I decided to rent it on here; the streaming of it went very well (picture quality was good also).  As for the movie I'm not going to review it in detail, but it is a solid, well executed action/sci-fi movie from beginning to climax through the end.
034580404X|5.0|This was a great gift as this product was offered at a reason price. The series was worth the price.
B002VX3RCW|4.0|My son got this as a gift and likes it so far. We have only had it a few days but it keeps holding his attention. I asked for this one because we have been using the captain on his play mat for a while but wanted one to hold in his hands instead of dangle. Only issue with it is the squeaker is hard to squeeze so he won't be able to use it till he is much older. I did find it funny that amazon has a warning on this toy for 3+ years old though.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|This was unexpectedly good and satisfying. It was more about the people than the machines, but it was unique enough to be a different kind of &#34;aliens invade the Earth&#34; movie. I liked the characters, the action, and the gorgeous look off the film.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|this is frustrating and fun at the same time. I love this game and games like this. it makes you think outside the box. I would recommend --if you like a challenge.  more games and more floors please!!!
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Where the first season ends with bang and strings out clever plot twists and smart developments for the characters to continue in this season, season two is just more of that and then they put you in cement shoes and drop you off the boardwalk.  The second season expands and adds to what made the first season amazing and makes this season, and show, so much better.  Characters develop in shocking ways, the story socks you from unexpected angles that will leave you jumping to your feet in disbelief.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I was so bored by the &#34;story&#34; but was entertained by the dancers........They are definitely eye candy and the only reason to see this movie. Glad I got it on a good sale......
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The season drops you into a new location, new story, familiar actors playing entirely different characters.  The scares are still a mix of quick shocks and slower, more psychological hits that linger.  It's got everything that made the first season a success and more.  It starts a little quirky, though, a little more supernatural than I prefer, but as the story elements come together around the characters the first few episodes gather explanations from later episodes - the intrigue hits you and you can't stop watching despite it's ugly, terrifying nature.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|My brother gave this to me for Christmas because it's been my favorite movie since I was 7.  We all sat around the TV to watch it, and... THE MOVIE IS INCOMPLETE. I realize that \\"When Love Is Gone\\" was not in the original theatrical release, but it is how most people have seen the film for the last 20 years. Couldn't they have at least given people the option to watch it in widescreen? If they didn't keep a copy of that scene in widescreen, they could have made that one scene P&S. I can honestly say that it put me in a bad mood all day.  Thanks a bunch!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|One of the best seasons to date.  Don't know how many more seasons are planned, but it certainly has me begging for more.  It's got more surreal scenes than the previous seasons that give us a glimpse into Draper's psyche.  Don't wait for Netflix, dig in now!
B0085A9J18|5.0|Some people may say the action is not very real, which is true, but that didn't make it any less fun. Excellent Action.  WATCH IT NOW!
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|HD makes it that much better.  You know this movie.  Yes, it's still scary.  Yes, it's totally worth the high def release.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Since movies nowadays are reduced to endless chases, gun and fist fights and explosions, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that this was more of the same.  To call this reboot tedious would be an understatement.  An utter and complete waste of time...well, there was Kate Beckinsale...so maybe not a Total Waste.  Close though
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I am 27 and watched this with my three daughters (6 ,3, 1) and we all loved it, I think I enjoyed it more then they did.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|This is an excellent CD. My daughter and I always watch Austin and Ally so we already knew most of the songs on it and could sing along as soon as it started to play. We love it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Well, this is your pretty basic, run of the mill calculator.  I haven't had many problems with it, yet.  My only concerns are that after downloading my kindle slowed down a little, it uses a lot of memory for such a basic application, and well advertising, but that's to be expected from a free app.  I still can't really figure out why it's such a large app for such a small function.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Wonderful mystery thriller.  Child at his best. He  has Jack Reacher developef as a character better with each story plot.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I love the method of pre-sales, I love the value  realized, I loved the series and the movie, but most of all I love Amazon.  I'm a Prime member and have never been happier with a membership due to accuracy in advertising, savings over local purchases, and excellent shipping policies.  Unless Obama finds a way to dork up this good thing as well, I'll be a happy member for quite some time based on history and service.<br />MT
B009MCRHH6|3.0|Would love to play the game but recent issue with amzn app store, downloads game but when permissions come up and give you the option to install or cancel, I can only click cancel, even in landscape. Very frustrating amazon please fix this isn't the first app to give this problem!
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|What can I say.... it's \\" Buddy Guy \\"..... He has played with Hendrix, Clapton, B.B.King and that list goes on & on & on...... I'm a Guitarist Myself and when it come's to Blue's or Rock~N~Blue's there is NO ONE Better !!!!!!
0143119680|5.0|An unbeatable combination of great characters - witches, demons and vampires, character development, mysterious plot, action and adventure. Complete fun yet mindfully engaging.
B000L22WTO|3.0|If You happen to be a Gavid Gilmour or Pink Floyd \\" Nut \\" like Me then this is a must for You colection. If not, DON't waste Your Cash. There is only 3 song's on it and 2 of them are Arnold Layne. That's about all I can say about this one.....
B00181JGI2|1.0|We should not have to pay for this as we were never able to download it.  I think we watched a few minutes by spending half an hour trying to get it going.  Very poor service.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|This book contains the study results of several years and numerous interviews of individuals pertaining to how they became millionaires and their past and present life styles. The book is very revealing and yet the formula for becoming a millionaire is nothing new. It is just that these folks were very dedicated to a conservative life style. They do not spend more than they make, they save a certain percent of their earnings, they don't live in fancy houses, drive fancy cars or wear fancy clothing. They are very hard workers and incorporate all of the practical advice we have heard all of our lives. This book is easy to read but powerful in it's contents.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I have this app for my android phone (photon 4g) and it's great. Was excited to see it was available for my new Kindle Fire HD. After installing I tried to take a couple pictures but no matter what settings you mess with it always has the image upside down. Who EVER takes upside down pictures? You can still upload pictures into the app and edit them, and that works pretty well, but I have to say this is a very annoying slip up by the developers. Fix this issue, I'll fix my rating.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Plain and simple, this is 50 shades with a few differences. If you liked grey, than you will like this set as well. Very good read. I stopped a few times and giggled at some of the similarities, but was an incredible read none the less. I am counting the days for the conclusion.
B00914JWSW|4.0|Perhaps the best female vocalist of all time, Barbra Streisand reminds us why she is the top selling female singer in history. Her vocals on these 'vault' recordings is pristine, pure, emotional, 'like buttah.'
B00846REIS|5.0|Plain and simple, its a great read. Simple twists from grey, but very good none the less. I am waiting to finish the series.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|My grandson is a LEGO lover!  When he opened this he yelled, &#34;THIS IS JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!  And he already has more LEGOS than I can ever think he will possibly ever use!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This film is much like &#34;Life Aquatic&#34; but without the Tiger Shark, or whatever it is, if it really exists.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very entertaining and especially love that the actual va's were used. Glad this was published and for free too! Yay
B007IXWL2C|2.0|These books are like a train wreck!  I feel like a fool having spent time reading them, but wondered what all the hype was about.  I have to question the women who &#34;loved it&#34;. I would say.,..get a life.  PS..There is not enough time in a day to do what they do.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Grandson loved it
B007704HO6|5.0|I loved this book.  The kitty on the cover lookes like my cat.  It made me very emotional too.  I couldn't put it down.
0446554995|5.0|As always, Preston & Child come through again with the exciting &#34;end book&#34; for the Helen trilogy.  If you haven't read these authors, do so.  You'll love them!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was one of my favorite books of all time.  I have recomended this book many times.  Being from the Northwest, I had a fun connection too.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|The Figure itself is astounding, quality of the pieces, the paint - everything about the figure is superb! If you're on the fence about this one; how about you come join me on this side of the yard, this figure is legit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After wondering about this book all summer, I bought it as a Christmas gift for my self. I started it reading on Christmas Eve. Christmas day around 10:00pm I was at Part 2 and I couldn't stop after that. I put my kids to sleep and I was up till 1:30am finishing the book and after that horrible ending I couldn't fall asleep. Ms. Flynn ruined my day off with my kids for me...<br /><br />I agree almost every thing people said in the 4 and 5 star reviews but I also agree the 1 stars. Flynn is brilliant. She is a great writer. I wish I had her talent. Great character development, intriguing plot, well-thought, well-written dialogues, good research. (It really shows how much she studied police investigations, ( a lot of CSI), Midwest life, mind of a psychopath) but then comes that horrible ending...<br /><br />After a wonderful thrill ride of 414 pages, comes page 415 and it is awful, terrible, disgusting... a lot of things all at once. Ending ruins the book.<br /><br />May be she wants to write a sequel but again this ending does not fit the book. It puts a big ugly hole into her well thought plot and great writing. Because the ending makes everything she wrote before page 415 unbelievable, if it was this easy to fool us... why ... why ... If I fill in the blanks, it would contain spoilers...<br /><br />So here is my 2 cents after sacrificing my precious sleep to finish this book:<br /><br />I would definitely suggest thriller lovers to read this book. It is one of the best books I've read this year ( and I read quite a few), but may be read up to page 397. Stop there and wait for Gone Girl 2 for the ending to make sense.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Not bad but after a while it gets boring; don't recommend it as highly as the other games that I have purchased.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Play online too and this is just a game I enjoy.  Different than online.  I take it to appointments to keep me busy while waiting or play at home.  Good game....harder than online.
B002R27J1W|5.0|Loved this movie when it was first released, I was just a little girl and it absolutely scared me to death.  Will be watching in the company of our grandchildren.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was not that bad I think you should read it you can also use the same thing with the same thing
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Read this for a book group, had no expectations, but it turned out to be a fascinating story, despite a few minor flaws.  I would definitely read her next book and recommend this to friends.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book so much! I would recommend this book to other kids that like the other Diary Of a Wimpy kid.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It's fun and challenges you to really think about how to solve it. The beginning level would be good for children while the upper levels are treatable teens/adults. The app runs great. I've had no issues with it. I give Flow Free five stars :)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is one of my favorite I have read them all more than once and this one is close to the best it is a must read even if you don't read a lot like me
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Booooooooo..Gavin hahaha Shabbat hahaha bananas Jamaica's marksmanship the husband of year again and the timeout husband of a half hour ago by a single person who
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book please make more diary of a wimpy kid books<br />Thanks,<br />Kallie :) once I got to the end I was sad cause it was over
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very detailed<br /> Lot's of dialogue<br />Good plot<br />Interesting characters and good character descriptions. Confusing at times but very good book
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think everyone who are 8-15 will like this book I loved this book. My whole family likes this book but you should start from the beginning of the series
B00992CF6W|5.0|I actually like this version. The point you take it on the go is awesome! And for the controls they are okay. But I hate the fact that you have to hold it down to dig/mine.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|There’s so few essential “Best of…” albums, but “Legend” is absolutely an exception to that rule. Everyone should have these songs in their collections. From there, one can learn about Bob Marley by getting the amazing “Natty Dread,” but “Legend” is pretty much a party in a dozen tracks.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book I enjoyed reading it I'm looking forward for the next book to come out so I can read it
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Provides insight into the forces that drove Steve Jobs to greatness. It details how Apple was able to become an industry leader under his direction. His manipulation of Apple employees and and leaders of other companies is fascinating. It also shows his softer side that he managed to keep out of the public eye. Highly recommended.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I wasn't really interested in this movie but my daughter persuaded me to watch it. Glad I did. I'm not much into Super Heros - I kind of liked the first Iron Man but wasn't bowled over by it. Never saw Thor or Captain America and the part of one of the Hulk movies I saw was just terrible.<br /><br />This was really fun however. Not too over-the-top and full of great humor.<br /><br />My only complaint was the streaming download from Amazon was really bad. It was odd too because I had plenty of buffer apparently but I had lots of pixelization and freezes that really detracted from the movie. I found out later that Amazon was having difficulty with their cloud service in general. That has nothing to do with the movie of course so I won't detract from my rating for that.<br /><br />Recommended.
1601253788|4.0|There be monsters in this book.  If you don't need monsters for any reason, don't but this.<br />However, if you are playing a Pathfinder campaign, then yes, you should buy this.<br />Or get the PDFs.<br />Whatever you do, don't turn to page 132.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Good show been watching it a long time And we own all the seasons. The show and the actor really do a good job.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|My 6 year old Granddaughter loved it, but I got frustrated quickly, not the games fault, just mine.  It reminds me of some older console games from my youth.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|There are reviews of this book that talk about how boring it is.  I have to disagree.  I think McEwan writes compelling characters.  They aren't vampires, but they are very human and I can related to them quite easily.  I think that's why I like them and also dislike them based on what chapter or section I'm reading.  Just like in real life.  You don't like your firends or family all the time, so why expect a character in a book to be loveable at all times.<br /><br />The book is about spies, ostensibly, but it's really about human nature, and the resiliance of love.  I highly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B009738XXM|4.0|It's fun, light pop music. Don't try to compare it to the long ballads of the past, or the nuances of the various other styles, or try to dig deep for alternative meanings - take it for what it is, simple popular music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this TV series! This show should have been nominated for an Emmy. Definitely pulls you in. I'm looking forward to future seasons.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is one of my favorite games.  I love the graphics and I've never had a problem with it. It works great on the Kindle Fire.
B008G59IKO|4.0|This isn't a bad CD, by no stretch of the imagination.  It is 9/10s as good as Uno, but just not quite there.  Overall, good songs that are well done.  I have the set - which, by the way, is a really good series.  I do recommend getting them.
0756688701|5.0|This was a gift for my 46 year-old brother who has always enjoyed pixar movies and also is a diecast car collector.  He called the day after Christmas and told me how much he has enjoyed reading it.  He is hard to buy for and this was a great gift for him!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I would love to see him in concert.  He has a voice that is truly distinctive and his delivery is top notch.  I have just about all of his stuff, and am trying to fill his back catalog.  It is interesting to listen to his earlier works and then move through the years (really decades, but why quibble?) and listen to that voice.  He is just amazing.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I gave this digital download version to my nieces.  The 13 year old loves the entire album and the 18 year old enjoys a few of the songs too.  The older niece said that she feels Red is more like what other pop gals are putting out right now, so she wasn't as impressed.  Everyone in the house was either singing along to or getting a kick out of the Never Getting Back Together song.<br /><br />I LOVE that Amazon offers the possibility to buy downloads to GIVE to others.  To me it seems a great way to share music legally - I buy it to give to you.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash.  Let's face it - if you just went by appearances, you would not be impressed.  However, once he starts playing - wow.  The vocals are good - but you buy this for the guitar work.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works as expected and helps me kill time when I'm in between photography sessions. I would definitely recommend the app. Plus it's free
B009X00E18|3.0|I had a Marware case for my original kindle fire, and it was extremely durable and did a great job of protecting the unit.  This folio appears to offer equal protection to the new, larger kindle 8.9 HD.<br /><br />The case is a smooth black plastic, but not too smooth so the unit slips from your hand, even when wet (I tested that specifically).  This is not as stylish as my old leather case, but it does do the job, does provide access to all ports necessary, and does stand the unit up if needed.<br /><br />My biggest concern is the cost ($44 or so).  I paid around ten dollars for a case that is almost as \\"nice\\", but does provide the same features and appears to provide the same level of protection.<br /><br />Marware appears to be the cadillac of covers, but there are some chevy's out there that work almost as well for a whole lot less.
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|My attention was held for the beginning chapters. I kept on reading hoping there would be more of romance and some physical interaction between the 2 main characters. I liked the Hero but found the heroine just a bit tiresome and cold. I was hoping the big secret would come out, was she a celebrated chess player in her younger years when she was dressed as a boy? I even reached the part where she sold the Hero out. I would've kept going but I had to put down the book as I had work the next day. The next day, I ended up reading 2 other books I had borrowed from the library. I had lost interest in Minerva's story. I thought the Hero deserved someone better than someone who kept on showing him how much smarter she was. I think it was pretty low of Minerva to expose the hero. I found the story boring, I think most of what I was reading were the thoughts of the character. Pity, I can't ask for a refund.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|it is a beautiful movie like it peoples should see it. nanny mcphee is a good movie that it buy
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|2nd season even better than the first. AHS Asylum is awesome!! Highly highly recommend! So scary and never trust the seemingly normal person in an asylum!!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|While the film was somewhat enjoyable, they really blew it by changing the script so much.  Instead of Mars and control of oxygen, we have earth partially destroyed through chemical warfare with workers traveling between Great Britain and Australia through the center of the earth in just 17 minutes.  Passing through the earth's core made for some interesting gravity shifting effects in the film which played a role in combat.  Overall, I was dissatisfied with the story line.  I also was disappointed with a PG-13 rating allowing for a brief nude view of a triple breasted woman.  My teenage daughters groaned and yelled at me for allowing that to slip through to their viewing displeasure.  They expect me to protect them from stuff like that, but how could I know that PG-13 now allows full frontal nudity of women's breasts like that?  PG-13 use to be safe in that regard.  And why was it even in there?  In the original, which was rated R, they had the issue of mutations and the triple breasted woman was one of many mutated people in the film.  In this version, nothing was developed about mutations and it was completely out of place for the new story.  In the end, this film is nothing more than a rehash of an interesting science fiction film of the past, but changed significantly for the worse without adding anything better than what the original had.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|A very good adaption. Jim Carrey did a marvelous job. I loved all the ghosts. kind of scary for kids.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|Pros: It's bright and colourful so the Dudeling likes it.<br /><br />Cons: Insultingly bad for the price. The kind of bad that will turn him off to taking pictures. $35 for a lens that's envious of a Cracker Jacks prize? $35 for 25MB of storage? Is this 1993? Of course the picture quality is as miserable as you'd expect. Responsiveness is pathetically slow, so capturing any type of image seen on the viewscreen is impossible. No, I don't expect him to be a little photographer, but it would be worth it if the one out of a hundred pics that were reasonably framed, lighted, etc. were worth looking at quality-wise.<br /><br />It's $35 for the Lego name and some bright colours. You're also paying for a big insult to your child--one of those things where they figure it's for kids so screw quality. I guess Lego figured they'd be the ones to teach him his Christmas Story/Decoder Ring or his Inherit the Wind/Golden Dancer lesson.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. It's however unfortunate she is getting away from country music though. She is growing up and adjusting her style to her audience not as many \\"my ex boyfriend sucks\\" songs.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|i like it because the game is easy and fun i hope every body likes it too ok im done
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is addictive. so awesome. who ever made this game should get an awesome game award. I'm only 13 and I cant stop playing this game for a second it make me want to keep playing.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for someone, was hoping that the head looked realistic. Once out of the box it looked great, nice and realist looking, put the screwdriver in the eye and it opens and take it out and it's locked very cool feature. Very happy with my purchase.
B000006OS2|2.0|I purchased this DVD for my father for Christmas and am very disappointed in the video quality.  There are lines all throughout and the picture quality is grainy.  It reminds me of the old 8mm movies that we watched in school.  Try another option for this classic movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|My eight year old loves this game. She like slicing the fruit and the speed of the game kind her entertained for hours.
B001CB4SRW|4.0|I like the case, but the belt strap seams a little flimsy for everyday use. Extra words to fill space for review. Extra words to fill space for review.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|elegi darle 5 estrellas porque todo salió como lo calcularon, llegó en el tiempo acordado, el precio excelente y el producto es excelente
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I recently purchased E.T.- The Extra Terrestrial, The 20th Anniversary edition. I am so glad I got the box set, no only does it include the 2002 edition; but the original 1982 version as well. This is one of my favorite Steven Spielberg movies ever. The box set not only includes both movies; but the reunion of the main cast members, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, and an interview with Steven Spielberg. It also includes various artwork/sketches, an interview/performance by John Williams and several more hours of bonus features. Yes, if you order the box set, it can be a little pricey; but it is worth it. They have discontinued the 20th Anniversary edition and replaced it with the 30th Anniversary edition; which came out in October 2012. I believe the 20th Anniversary is the only edition you can get both movies plus all the extras. I noticed the box set is still available through Amazon new/used and will still be until sold out. I must inform you that the 2002  version of E.T. is done with CGI effects. I have to admit I am not a fan of CGI; because it seems to cheapen a film. In this film the CGI is nothing like you see in some movies were you can tell it's fake. I was impressed by the was E.T. was done, Spielberg is a genius. The 2002 version was done properly and it was very impressive to the viewer. There are other tweaks in the 2002 version, deleted scenes were added; and unlike the 1982 version the guns used by the Agents were replaced by two-way radios.<br /><br />I don't blame Spielberg for this minor  alteration, by replacing the guns with two-way radios. It seems like this Country is getting more violent; and the last thing children need to see is more violence/images. This is an excellent film not only for children;  but for everyone. I never get tired of watching this masterpiece. E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial is a very emotional and heartwarming tale that will leave you with a great feeling inside.<br />THX,<br />Kristina L. CocKayne
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Me favorite thing to do is watch this film between Halloween and Christmas. I had the older release so I upgraded to blue ray and would not go back I loved it! Plus it has my favorite short &#34;Vincent&#34; on it!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I finished the 50 shades of grey and the sequels so fast and was craving something else to read. The crossfire novels fit the bill. If you liked 50 shades and don't mind slight similarities in the novels, you'll like the crossfire series.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Loving this app!  Took one look at the channel graph and knew I needed to move my network(s) to a different channel.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Talk about an awesome gift. Already played through (full price) on my Linux box. Will play it through again. Awesome game worth $5.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have no idea what exactly was my attraction to this series, but I loved each one of them. Couldn't wait to get to the next one and was sad when it was all over. Not my type of read usually, but I found the stories very fun and intertaining !!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was one of the best movies we have rented in quite awhile.<br />We were happy to have rented this and will do so again
B001UV4XHY|5.0|My kids love Harry Potter and this and Part 2 finish of our collection. The videos were a great price allowing me to give the kids more for Christmas!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A wonderful series to watch. Great for classroom use as a resource and extremely colorful to watch over and over again.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My kids love Harry Potter and this and Part 2 finish of our collection. The videos were a great price allowing me to give the kids more for Christmas!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Exactly what I expected. Love the music. Phillip Phillips is a great singer.  I just let the cd keep replaying over and over.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|All these years late, Toy Story is just a great story.  I enjoyed it before I had kids and just enjoyed it again with my kids.  It is the kind of story that bears multiple tellings, multiple viewings, and does not depend on its special effects to hold interest, which is probably the best compliment I could give it.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie is very touching. It's sweet without being too saccharine. There's some dark subject matter but at heart, it really is a feel-good movie.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I gave this to my hubby as a stocking stuffer and it's great.  MJ at his prime!  Love every minute of it!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The production quality alone is a good enough reason to watch this show. The acting is impeccable. The storylines are compelling. I wish there were more than two seasons.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I'm a sucker for the fake/found footage genre, so Cloverfield was right up my alley.  A movie of this type rises and falls with the believability of its performances and dialogue.  For the most part, Cloverfield gets these right.  There are some plot gaps and predictable but well-executed horror scenes.  The FX are impeccable and shocking when the movie's budget is taken into consideration.  Many far more expensive movies produce much less convincing visuals.  The extras are great fun, lots of great behind the scenes stuff that shows just how much of the movie (a lot!) was not on location but on a sound stage.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I didn't grow up with the muppets, so I have no nostalgic feelings to cloud by review. This was the cutest movie of 2011. There's stuff for kids and adults to enjoy.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book even though I had already seen the story on a TV program (I Survived).  Well-written.
B001TJV0L4|5.0|This is one of the few instances where the movie was better than the book. I love every minute of it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Watched it several times. It is exciting and very different than other kids moves. It was not as predictible as the most comon kids movies.
B00000DWE2|5.0|This is a classic, brilliant album. I'm more drawn to the movie version (I know I'm not going to make many friends with that opinion), but the original album is just brilliant.
0810989956|5.0|Received it Christmas morning, had it read by time we went to beck. Also worked on a lego project, that remained unfinished until following day. He said it had one really good funny part. If this is what he likes to read, I will get ti for him.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is a great album. A must-have for any Beatles fan. Even the cover art is top notch. The Beatles are great.
1419705849|5.0|I agree with the teachers at the local school. Wish he would read something more challenging, but if this is what gets him to read, I love it!
B005LAII3U|5.0|I really love the origanial movie with Arnold, So I could'nt wait to see the remake & it was just as good if not better!
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|It is pretty cool. It is made out of the same material that they make the piece together play mats for children out of. I will write back when she has had more time with it and let you know how it is holding up.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|I saw it on cable so I just had to own it! And I just love the unrated version.<br />I laughed the whole time I was watching it!
B0058VW36U|3.0|This app is great fun and would get five stars if it weren't for the annoying pestering to buy stuff. My 4 year old always end up clicking on the offers. I find it unethical to direct the click-through purchase to the Amazon website, knowing the Kindle store probably has parental controls on. This behavior is expected on free apps, but not on paid apps.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Very entertaining and well done for this genre.  No surprises, but the effects were good and Theron is always great.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Love this movie and glad to have rented it through Amazon Prime since we miss seeing it at the movies due to a storm and power outage. Will purchase soon.
B005LAII0I|3.0|But a little bit to cuddly and contemporary for my taste.<br />It is a re-telling of the classic Snow White fairytale, but updated.  Sometimes and in some ways this is not a bad thing, and at times it works in this movie.  Overall I hate to say it, but the movie tries to hard and in the end is just kind of forgettable.  Although if you have children between 6 and say 14 it may not be.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This protector fits the 7\\" Kindle Fire very well and has an extra pocket for holding misc. notes too.  Very thick, so I'm not afraid to let the kids carry the tablet around or play with it.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|That is the kindest thing I can say about this book.<br /><br />It is not what I expected in a book by these two authors.
B009A9BEHU|4.0|Don't listen to all of the people who don't like this DVD, if you want better picture quality, get the Blu-Ray version! These discs are entertaining from start to finish. Coldplay's production gives clips of their best performances around the world. Boy can they put on a show! Audio quality is spectacular, and the band performs live impeccably. The DVD's spoken word sections give a nice glimpse into the character and personalities of the band members, providing a new perspective for enjoying their beautiful music. My only wish was that they had included two other songs from the Mylo Xyloto album, \\"Don't Let it Break Your Heart,\\" and \\"Up With the Birds.\\" I don't know if they left those out for the DVD or just never performed them on tour, but they're both awesome songs. Mylo Xyloto was my Christmas present last year, and I asked for the Tour DVD this year, both were my favorite gifts by far. I strongly recommend it for any Coldplay/Rock Concert fans. I hope you love it as much as I do!
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|This is the best show on TV (or Amazon Instant Video for that matter).  Season three really increases the gore factor, and the suspense.  Who's the biggest threat to the surviving groups: the walkers, or the living?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was infatuated with the characters in this book. Couldn't possibly stop reading it, except to finally sleep. How could you possibly not look at your life and your relationships more admirably after reading it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is a fun way to spend the waiting time in the doctors waiting room.  However, if you wish to save a puzzle there is no way....also, I can't get any new puzzles to load.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|One of the BEST books I have read in along time.  I could not put this book down and read it in a day.
1401234542|5.0|Title: Green Lantern Volume 1: Sinestro (HC)<br />Publisher: DC<br />Writer: Geoff Johns<br />Artists: Doug Mahnke (pencils), Christian Alamy, Keith Champagne, Mark Irwin, Tom Nguyen (inks), David Baron, Alex Sinclaire, Mike Choi, Tony Avina (colors), Ivan Reis, Joe Prado, Rod Reis, Greg Capullo, David Finch, Ethan Van Scriver, Francis Manapul, Mike Choi (covers)<br />Collects: Green Lantern #1-6<br />Price: $22.99<br /><br />After the events of the book [[ASIN:1401235387 War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath]], Hal Jordan remains on Earth, sans ring, which was stripped from him by the Guardians due to his continual disobedience. Sinestro - founder of the yellow, fear-based Sinestro Corps - has been made a Green Lantern, again. How is that possible? What is going on in the minds of the Guardians? What's going to happen to Hal, now? All of those questions, and more, and answered by this book.<br /><br />Blessedly, the characters and continuity of the Green Lantern corner of the DC universe were relatively untouched compared to the sweeping changes the whole \\"New 52\\" re-launch brought to so many other DC titles. The ([[ASIN:0857688049 Sinestro Corps War (Green Lantern)]]) still happened. The War of the Light still happened. The ([[ASIN:1401229530 Blackest Night]]) happened. The [[ASIN:1401234526 Green Lantern: War of the Green Lanterns (Green Lantern (Graphic Novels))]] happened. No need to guess what has come before. All of the main continuity threads and hallmarks of the series remain intact, so regular fans will not be disturbed in their reading continuity. Still, this book was a real divergence from what fans are used to seeing in the GL books. Why? Sinestro is back in a big way, and he's not the same character he used to be.<br /><br />No one is used to Hal Jordan playing second fiddle to Sinestro, yet that's exactly what readers are in for when they read this book. Sinestro has been elevated in the Corps, while Hal has been demoted. Without a power ring, Hal is drifting - searching for direction. Along comes Sinestro and recruits him for a secret mission. He imparts a new ring to Jordan, yet this is one he creates by his own power and one that he can de-power at will. It's quite unusual to see Hal on Sinestro's leash, forced to do his bidding, but he wants that power back more than anything else, and he's willing to be Sinestro's lap dog until he finds a way to receive it back in full.<br /><br />Like I said - a great read and an interesting turn of events. Johns spins a good yarn, here, and I'm excited to see what he does next in the book. Johns is really hit-or-miss for me, but for this particular book he knocks it out of the park.<br /><br />As for the art? What do you expect? The GL books have been the best-looking DC books on the shelves for years, now, and this book keeps the standard held high. Mahnke's pencils are a great as ever, and the inks and colors team really brings it all to life in full-color, widescreen, digital glory. Absolutely great artwork!<br /><br />Another great GL book in a long line of great GL books! If you haven't been reading these books, you've been missing out on some great sci-fi epics!<br /><br />Writing: 9/10<br />Artwork: 9/10<br />Cool Factor: 10/10<br />Value: 8/10<br /><br />Overall: 9/10rifting - searching for direction.

B006O6F932|5.0|GRACIAS,
0547884591|5.0|It's not just about cooking.  It's about learning anything new efficiently.  Edgy and brilliant.  Tim writes in a way that enables us to jump around this book to learn about what we want.  A reference book in many ways...
B009SQRL4U|5.0|A good inter-generational twist on an old story and and a wonderful cast.  Bill Nighy is a wonderfully curmudgeonly Grand Santa, and watch out for Michael Palin.
0811874192|5.0|I've already purchased a second book because I was so pleased with the first. The quality is great -- even better than the pictures. Both books have been given as gifts, and the recipients have really enjoyed them. I'm tempted to get another for myself to keep on my coffee table.
B0083DJWGO|2.0|This book suffers from the narrow-minded view of someone who is still in teenage rebellion against authority. He has one good idea: many institutions and practices in society are fragile, and cannot withstand rare, but possible, events.<br />He takes this viewpoint too far, however, when he judges everything in sight by this one, single, narrow criterion.<br /><br />The author seems to be a jaded, uninspired professor passed over for promotion. His reaction is to discredit everything modern. This is a one-idea book that keeps getting repeated over and over. The entire set of ideas (one) could be explained in a book one-fifth as long. This book is simplistic, inaccurate and fraudulent.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. People impressed by this book have never learned to think analytically.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being A Wallflower was a beautiful story, and i look foward to reading more of Stephen Chbosky's work.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of the top 3 series of all time. TOP CAST. To follow the 101st Airborne Division was a great thrill.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Literally nothing to add, not anything you even could say can make someone read something.. just read it. You just should. Still in tears. It's worth every penny I spent.. undoubtedly.
B00846REIS|4.0|I would probably like this book better if I hadn't read 50 Shades of Gray first.  The book is well written, but the characters just don't live up to 50.  I would still say it is worth reading
B001H1SVO8|5.0|If I was talking about this movie I would say it's excellent, but I'm not... I always wondered how soap was made
0061537969|5.0|I thought this book sounded cheesy before I started reading it. However, I LOVED it. It's entertaining, and heartwarming in all the right ways. A must read for anyone who's ever had, or wanted a dog.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Who's the best mom in the world. I am. The only problem I had with this video is a section when Harry was in his underwear, boxer breifs. There's also another few sections where their shirts were off that may be inappropriate for young girls.
B005KELW26|3.0|Received this for Chrismtas with my new Kindle Fire HD, however, this cover is very nice, but does not fit the HD model.  It's just too small.  Will have to be returned.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|First time buy of &#34;Dub Step&#34; music!  I got this for a friend, who used to be a DJ, but never heard of Skrillex! I bought 2 of Skrillex's CD's for him for Christmas & he loves them! The price was very affordable!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is the first app that I downloaded for the Kindle that I got for Christmas. I played it so long that I ran down my Kindle' s battery the very first day. It's a great puzzle game!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Every song is a classic. One of the best albums of all time in my opinion. You can't go wrong
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Meh... Wasn't really all that great, too cheesy, could have better acting. Tom Cruise as decent, but he didn't have much of a roll to play.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|I love Tourist History and I think I love Beacon just as much. Handshake is one of their best songs. I like most every song on this album just as I did with Tourist History.
B003YV0A02|4.0|Its Die Hard. 100% of the movie. Thats about all. The movie skipped twice on me briefly... I had full internet connection... but not sure if it was me or the service. Anyway, its Die Hard... The greatest xmas movie of all time....
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app is a great addition to my Kindle Fire HD. The Magazine loads quickly, and has many good, up todate articles.The only improvement that would help, is to be able to download an article into my tablet so as when I'm not connected, I would be able to access it.<br />They do have access to a cloud based service, but again, you have to be connected.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|I love the 3 new songs and the remix of the hits especially Duck and run they still rock !!
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Great movie. One of the best ice age movies to date, but I must admit the series is getting a bit long in the teeth.... HD looked good up close...phenomenal!..lol
0545265355|5.0|My boy started read it right away. I was in excellent condition. i hope to look for moe books in the furture.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this months ago.  That version had some very challenging levels.  However, it suggested I add another set of games which I did.  That &#34;upgrade&#34; caused the first set to disappear.  Now I am left with only one semi-challenging set of 10 by 10 grids.  I have hunted high and low for access to the more difficult levels to no avail.  But it IS a fun game.
B009K916ZK|4.0|I like this product. It allows me to use my Sony flat screen monitor (vintage 2003) with my<br />new Mac mini easily.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Fun, creative series with plenty of unexpected twists and turns.  Robert Carlisle as Rumpelstiltskin (aka Mr. Gold) is nothing short of brilliant.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Very intense and action filled....a great cast of old movie veterans. If you like action this movie is for you, with a followup to Expendables 2.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not sure he was a good leading in this leading role...the plot was good, and special effects also ok movie
B005LAII12|1.0|I heard this Movie was Hilarious. Next to the Dictator it was the worst comedy I ever saw. Service was quiuck and product arrived undamaged.
B00511PTWM|5.0|This piece is a must for drivers who attach many gadgets to car like me. This works fine for my GPS power cord and FM transmitter all the time together..
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Note:  my assigned rating of the OST is strictly based on it being a stand-alone product.  Now, as for my feelings towards it, especially when placed in context of being a fan, then please continue reading.<br /><br />Before I can go into the OST, I do need to comment on the film....<br /><br />The film, especially for the musical genre, is extraordinary.  The added depth and range of emotions, as was possible thanks to the now well-documented way the music was created (and I won't go into details here), plus what's only possible in the medium of film, felt so true and honest from beginning to end.  The film, with all of the parts together, is a wonderful testament, and hopefully an award-winning addition, to the Les Miz legacy.<br /><br />Now, as for the OST:  it's so-so.  At the special price Amazon.com is currently offering it, I couldn't resist making a purchase (besides which, there were several tracks, including the newly penned \\"Suddenly\\", that I wanted because of their subsequent performances on the film).  The OST is what it is.  When placed in context of the film, it's an okay product.  My biggest issue was the it could have provided for more highlights as several signature pieces are missing (\\"Do You Hear The People Sing\\" and \\"Who Am I\\" come to mind), or seemingly cut just a touch short (\\"At the End of the Day\\").  When placed next to the Original London Cast, Original Broadway Cast, Symphonic (the most comprehensive of all the recordings), and 10th Anniversary \\"Dream Cast\\" Concert (the best of the recordings), it will, for the most part, pale in comparison to these gold-standards.<br /><br />In the end, the decision to purchase the OST, or not, is up to you.  For most die-heart fans of the musical and now the film (as it was just released in US theaters yesterday), we'll end up adding it to our collection of recordings regardless of price-point.  As for the rest, it's up to what you're looking for.  For the experience that eventual made the film a reality, you're better suited for the stage/concert recordings.  If you are only in for the film, then the OST will be fine.  Personally, once hooked to Les Miz, you'll want them all....
B005WUHAX8|5.0|So far this case has more than exceeded my expectations. Make sure to clean your phone well so the case can attach to it properly. The shipping was excellent I received the phone before it was expected. Great experience!
B001F12J48|1.0|IT IS NOT REAL 3D. THOSE CRAPPY GLASSES DONT WORK AND IT IS NOT FORMATTED TO PLAY ON 3D TV'S. WHICH  HAVE.. I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED.
0743270754|4.0|Thorough look at Lincoln's rise to the presidencey.  Lots of details and great sourcing of information to paint a well rounded picture of his presidency.  I enjoyed and you will too.
B006O6F932|5.0|My grand daughter is thrilled with this playset.  She can use her own imagination and not rely on battery powered toys or videos for enjoyment.  I believe she will have many hours of fun playing with this set.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Bad plot. Bad writing.  Great cast .  Great action.  Great, thoughtless fun on a Sunday.  Over the top in every way.(Pun intended.).  Enjoy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|this is probably my most important tool on my computer, and so glad i can use it no matter where I am
B00AMBH70S|3.0|If your a fan of Bourne, then this movie is for you.  Renner does a good job playing the hero.  I didn't care for the ending, but solid action throughout.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like to use it, but i wish it would put notes in order either by date or importance.<br />I have recommended this product to other friends
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Just ok. All the funniest parts wee on the previews.  It was too long for a comedy in my opinion.  I like it, but I'm not in hurry to watch it again.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This movie is great, but we are a fan of all the MIB's..Josh Brolin is awesome and does a great impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones...its perfect! I love the tie ins and just a fun film!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Strong finish to a trilogy.  Tied up loose plot lines and brought the storyline full circle.  Nice twists and a proper ending.  Enjoy.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper is a fun and enjoyable Halloween movie for adults and kids alike. I have loved it since it came out, and my kids love it now.
0525953728|3.0|Decent first hand account of the Bin Laden raid.  Quick read at only 300+ pages, and interesting details throughout the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! Easy to use and read. Lets me know if I need to stay in bed or if it is safe to get up and go outside.
B005XLN97M|3.0|Gave to our 6 year old for Christmas.  She has fun playing with it, but the quality is not the greatest.  Every time she tries to open barbie's fridge, the door pops off.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Please fix this app sucks can only see a few posts and that's it. Can't download pics or anything boo to this app.

B005LAIHSG|4.0|Good Movie,  Great cinama  photogerphy ,  Kristen Stewart is  no acadamy award winner  but  does  a fine job  in this  movie
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I just couldn't get into this book, a little too cheesy for<br /><br /> my taste. It was on the predictable side, maybe would be better in a movie.
B0016OVEYA|5.0|This was an action packed movie. It is a great escapism film that keeps you alternatively laughing and on the edge of your seat. Not for the feint of heart though.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love author Michael Connelly; I confess.  So, I'm not as subjective a reviewer as one might wish.  I especially like the Harry Bosch series and how Connelly has managed to move around in time and also show us different aspects of the many layers of Harry's  background and experiences in each new novel.<br />I await the next Connelly novel.  Hope it's soon.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Great movie actions scenes are authentic This vesion of the hulk is better than any previous version and the black widow never looked sexier
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This is a great collection of Bruno Mars' music. I love all the songs except one. I recommend this product
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I had already read this book but wanted to have it on my kindle.  I love this book, it is a must have!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Classic! Harry Bosch just gets better and better with age..  The story unfolds as smooth and cleaverly as Michael Conelley intended.
B004478GNI|5.0|This is was a good gift for even a big kid.  My Husband was tired of all the girls toys he has to play with since we have two daughters. He spent and hour playing with this.
0143118420|5.0|Love the book. Way better than the movie. I wish that the publisher kept the original cover (not the movie themed cover). A must read for all women who have ever had a moment of &#34;where is my life going?&#34; Or &#34;what do have to show for the life I'm leading?&#34;
0767836324|5.0|This is a must buy! My brother use to watch this over and over with us older kids and my aunt.  So we bought it for our kids.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|i am a big fan of the halo games and even though this is movie number 4 it was still the first one iv seen and i was not impressed at all.for a movie that was based off a action game like halo there was very little action and the movie seemed to move along at a snails pace.i would not recommend buying this movie on disc or here on amazon nor would i recommend renting it in any kind of way either
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and  the movie it was very well written and thought through i thought it was great
B005J29HD0|3.0|there is so much extra stuff that comes with this double album that the packaging is very tight which caused warping in the records.  the records still play and sound fine and everything else that comes with the album is great.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This latest Reacher novel did not live up to past standards established by previous Reacher novels, or my expectations. The elaborate descriptions of the inside of the concrete bunker were a bit much and kind of goofy. When the plot finally unfolded it was a disappointment to me. Reacher also failed to hook up with any if the female characters. Oh yeah, there was no explanation for his busted nose, or I missed it. Was it left over from the previous book? I don't recall that either.<br />Anyway, the book was OK and I would recommend it, although not highly.
0545425115|5.0|had no intentions of reading ths book.It was picked by a member of my book club.Surprisingly, I loved it.Could not put it down  right from the strart.Loved it
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Definitely NOT a Bourne movie! Mildly entertaining.  If I had it to do over I would wait until this movie hits Netflix before watching it.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|THIS SERIES IS MY FAVORITE ! I MISSED THE FIRST SEASON AND STARTED WATCHING IT DURING THE 2ND SEASON. I WILL PURCHASE THE 2ND SEASON SOON. GOOD QUALITY DVD, AND AGAIN, I LOVE MATT BOMBER !!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. Strongly recommend for any age. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. Kept me engrossed. Excited to read the next one.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|I had not even heard of the book unroll the movie of the same name was released· I think this  book is beautiful and an instant classic for me!!
B00ACFL69C|2.0|I don't know what everyone else who rented this movie saw but I thought this movie was pretty bad. You aren't given much of a background of the characters and some of the scenes really don't make too much sense. Normally I really enjoy Matthew Mc.and he doesn't usually disappoint, but this movies is a true stinker. Save your money.
0547884591|5.0|This book is a non-fiction Odyssey, of sorts. It takes you to many places along a journey. I'm not sure anything like it has ever happened.<br /><br />This is a massive book. There is a quote within it that says that a person that begins learning how to cook is becoming a lifelong student. That is evident in the expansive scope of this book, whether it be directly about cooking or methods of learning. The book is large enough, and heavy enough, that you could beat a bear to death with it, probably. It's an impressive work, filled with every tip and trick one could possibly need.<br /><br />I will say this: If you are a vegetarian, this is NOT the book for you. Most of the skills taught probably translate to vegetarian cooking, but most of the actual dishes prepared within the scope of the book are carnivorous in nature.<br /><br />There are other slight sticking points for some people, like the 'How to butcher X animal,' \\"How to Hunt,' and the stuff on guns in general.<br /><br />I'm a carnivore, I like guns, and although I've never been hunting in my life, I do have an appreciation for the process. This to say that even what doesn't apply to me in the book doesn't offend me.<br /><br />My only 'real' criticism of the book thus far is that I wish the 'Meta Learning' section had more tips and tricks for faster learning in it. I only say this because (on the surface) it was my favorite section of the book [so far]. Anything that will help me study faster, and uptake more processes and knowledge is beneficial. That said, I won't fault for it because how much more can you add to a book that's already as big as this one, before copies of it are used in lifting competitions?<br /><br />[I'm updating my review AS I go through the book, incidentally. It's a massive tome, and not something I could get through quickly]
B00701897I|4.0|Our family enjoyed the storyline and the 3D effects of this movie. Definitely found the 3D version as an improvement in this viewing experience!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very helpful, I needed this for the submission of my two novels.  Excellent instructions, step-by-step very much appreciated.  Thanks to the author!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|You will enjoy the story and the 3D effects are awesome! Fast moving action and eye-popping 3D will have your home theater experience satisfied!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I am a Mad Men addict and thought Season 5 was the best of the series so far.  When the show is on hiatus, I watch the previous seaons as I wait patiently for the new one.  This is by far the best show on TV!!!
0810970686|5.0|Caught my son up past bedtime reading in bed. He loves the series and was ecstatic to get Book 3 The Last Straw. Great humor and illustrations!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I guess I'm not that really into prequels the original series is amazing tho but yeah this book was a little slow but it was still cool to see how everything started and how certain things got their names
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My husband asked that I only read the first book of the series (because he loved it so much) and left it up to me if I wanted to continue reading. The first night, I read the entire first book. I read the remainder in the next week! A very well written, engaging and thought provoking book. I highly recommend it!
B007V65R54|5.0|As a professional data guy, “We love to predict things – and we aren’t very good at it” struck me.  Nate Silver went on to explain in very understandable ways how we frequently bungle our predictions.  Baseball, politics, financial markets, national security, basketball, earthquakes, weather … predictions for each are dissected so we can better understand what went right and what went wrong with each prediction.  Silver’s ability to explain complex ideas using simple, understandable examples makes the book both pleasant and educational.
0439023491|5.0|The 2nd book in the hunger game is just as good as the first. Action gripping and hooking. I loved it!<br />Very unexpected . Exceeded all of my expectations. A must have!
B007M45PMU|5.0|A quirky, interesting and energetic band that is nothing quite like I heard before.  The instruments and vocals blend into something like folk music, but with more creative energy than other artists.  These songs are not really simple and they are certainly not cookie-cutter tunes.  Each song is fun and sticks in my brain asking me to play it again.  And because the songs are so fun, I keep them well-represented in my musical favorites.
0439023513|5.0|the 3rd book in the hunger games series is still as wonderful as the two before . For me i personally think it is the best .<br />Katniss and Gale reunite. A WONDERFUL finish to this series!<br />A must have!
B006RUJST6|5.0|One of e best books I've read yet, a must read. A would defiantly recommend. A great book for all ages
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is as expected. It was a wonderful sequel to the son of Neptune. The book was action- gripping and unexpected twists at the turn of every page. All in all its was just as wonderful as all his others for me , it was even better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thriller from the start with plenty of twists. It is a little different from what I. Used to reading but very good. Reminded me of my mother in some places. Just goes to show, you never really know who your marrying.
0375704027|1.0|i can usually trust readers' reviews but i felt like i was steered in the wrong direction with this book.  i thought this book was so flat.  if it were a food, it'd be communion wafers.  i can appreciate the story of young love, the coming of age, the loss of innocence but the characters are so emotionally weak, obtuse, stupid.  i really disliked this book.  this was my first haruki book.  i wish i had read another one of his books before this one.  i'd like to give him another chance but this book left a sour taste in my mouth.  correction:  it left a chalky, bland taste in my mouth.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|More realistic than fifty shades of grey,  several similarities between the 2 book. Still a great read. However waiting on the sequels has been tough,
B003L0HZ5O|5.0|I loved camino so I purchased this album when it was on sale. I also love it.... Its them !!!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|excellent special effects!!!... If the movie had a different name it would have been perfect!!!<br />I did enjoy it. Thanks
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I'm only 1/2 way thru, I'm wondering why it takes so long to build the story....I will finish out of curiosity!
B002ZG99IG|2.0|I imagine anyone over the age of 18 who likes to watch movies has seen The Roommate already. Not this film necessarily, but something very similar to it (&#34;[[ASIN:B0037QGS0A Chloe]],&#34; &#34;[[ASIN:B00004RF85 The Crush]],&#34; and &#34;[[ASIN:B00AEFXX9Q Fatal Attraction]]&#34; all come to mind). The plot is lich&eacute;d and entirely predictable (girl gets stuck with weird roommate who progressively gets more strange and more violent); the acting is decent enough, but no one steals the show. To be fair, this is more attributable to poor, unoriginal writing than any shortcomings on the actors' part. But that leads us to another problem: the casting.<br /><br />The only main character (if you can call her that) who was actually college-aged when this film came out is Aly Michalka, whose role as Tracy is relatively small and unimportant. Of the remaining characters, the only one who could pass for a college student is Rebecca, the antagonist played by Leighton Meester. Both the protagonist Sara (Minka Kelly), her ex-boyfriend (Matt Lanter), and her frat-boy boyfriend (Cam Gigandet) were much too old for this film, and it distracted me throughout to see these oldsters meander around a college campus. Moreover, I was struck by the incredibly spacious and egregiously furnished college dorm rooms they enjoyed. I know, I know. It's a movie; they have to make it look nice to entice people to watch. But come on. I have never been to the University of Los Angeles, where this film takes place (though I believe it was shot at USC), but I can't imagine it is actually home to such pristine facilities. Anyone who has been to college will laugh openly at the set. I was rolling my eyes throughout.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was surprised to see that this film did an adequate job of capturing college night life. While the frat party was slightly overblown, and Gigandet's character was way too nice to be a real frat-boy, everything else was indicative of the &#34;real thing.&#34; In one disturbingly realistic bar scene, two drooling bar-rats send drinks over to Sara and Tracy, who obligingly drain the contents and leave the viewer terrified that they have just been drugged. Thankfully, the filmmakers did not deem it necessary to further explore this situation.<br /><br />By the film's end, I found that despite its flaws I had somewhat enjoyed it. The dialogue is above-par, the writers successfully created the tension they sought (albeit through entirely unoriginal material), and the characters are all easy on the eyes. However, there is nothing memorable about The Roomate; while it is not a bad film, it just is not very exciting. Even when The Roommate does heat up, the viewer is more likely to compare it to a dozen other films that follow the same plot rather than become engrossed in it, and the ending was not only cliche but also anti-climactic. The Roommate certainly is not worthy of a second viewing. In fact, I am still struggling to determine why I deemed it worth my time in the first place. I can think of dozens of movies I should have watched instead; you should too.ealistic bar scene, two drooling bar-rats send drinks over to Sara and Tracy, who obligingly drain the contents and leave the viewer terrified that they have just been drugged. Thankfully, the filmmakers did not deem it necessary to further explore this situation.  By the film's end, I found that despite its flaws I had somewhat enjoyed it. The dialogue is above-par, the writers successfully created the tension they sought (albeit through entirely unoriginal material), and the characters are all easy on the eyes. However, there is nothing memorable about The Roomate; while it is not a bad film, it just is not very exciting.

B001USHRCK|5.0|Wonderful detail. This was purchased for a 7yo.  His first experience with Legos.  His grown-up brother had been a lego fanatic back in his day, so this was a fantastic bonding experience between the 2 of them.  Both boys at vastly different age groups love the details of this medieval village. It stays out on display year round.  Find it on a good sale, and you'll be even happier!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Saved me from purchasing a whole new power adapter, and since I had two old unused MagSafes, came in handy.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Purchased all of these for whole family.  We all love this kind of stuff.  Our age ranges are 2-60's.  The 6 and 8 yo's played with these all xmas afternoon, as did the 22yo, 40'syo, 60'syo.  I was supposed to be making xmas dinner.  These things will side-track you. (Dinner was rather late):/<br /><br />You will get frustrated  - continuously fall off - start over, and over, and over...but............... You will keep going back to it.  You have to. You're gonna let a little plastic child's toy get the better of you?!  What's really sad is when such a small child shows you just how easy it is!  That's when you grab it back and say, &#34;Let me see that thing...&#34;  It's all in good fun.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|A delicious blend of murder, mystery and mayhem wrapped nicely in Canadian geography, spiced with drama, and simmering with sexiness.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|It is the best concert C.D I ever had. My kids love it too. Put it on ALL i-pods and i-phones.
0810989956|4.0|Ordered this for my 9 year old son. He absolutely loves it! Once he's finished fillit it out, I'm going to stash it away until he gets older so both of us can re-read it and rememer how he was at that age. Removed one star because they left a lot of blank pages in the back so maybe half the book has activities and the rest is blank.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and was ecstatic when it finally came out of the vault, I even preordered a copy just to make sure I got one. A truly great movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked this book (Dictionary) because it helped me spell the words i needed help with on my test for language arts
B0012Q732O|3.0|I am not a huge fan of this movie, but bought it for a friend as a gag gift since we always joked about it.
B009M588K8|5.0|Great book, gave it as a gift, friend was very happy to get it ~ thought it would be harder to find, but Amazon had it!
B0042MEQVG|5.0|This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine and I quickly marathoned it with the other movies upon receiving it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved it, it was well written, not once did I feel bored nor felt like I had already read something like that before, I absolutely loved it and I recommend you read it if you're having doubts about it, its so worth it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I just got this game and it is addicting. I would highly recommend this game to someone who likes brainteaser games.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|One of the better hidden object games. If you like Mysteries of the Deep, you will like this game. Good story, nice pace. Got far before needing to unlock.
0679805273|5.0|Great rhymes and funny pictures. This is a classic Dr. Seuss book, which is a must to for any child's library.

B008XG1X18|5.0|It allows me to use my pintrest account on the go. I like the layout because the icons are easy to read and pictures are large enough to easily see.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|It's always nice when a band puts out a new album, especially after a decade. Not sure how to review this, except to say that, while different from their prior works, it's quite definitely and older and wiser God's Pee, and the music is still brilliant.  Two long songs and two 5-minute &#34;drones&#34;.  I just really hope I don't have to wait another decade for more,
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Gorgeous graphics and serene music. I didn't know if I would like this type of game with a storyline, but it adds a nice touch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

1401233791|5.0|This is a great reference to see what went into the movie, plus to redeem Bane as a villan, since he got clowned in &#34;Batman & Robin&#34;.<br /><br />This is a must own - wish we could have seen this Bane in the new film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is a very simple and good application to use especially when I'am out grocery shopping, I love it

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a new type of feel for the male character fighting for what he loves but isn't aware of yet
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Not the best movie I have ever seen, but fun and entertaning.  The bear is very well done.  And Mark Wahlberg is always skillful at his art!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game great graphics! Wish there would have been more game play I beat it fairly quick and price was a little high to me
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It's an amazing movie I encourage everybody to buy it. Three movie arrived as expected and in good conditions as well.
0756407125|4.0|Here we are with more of the story of Kvothe's life.  This is a very entertaining book, and I actually liked this one even more than the first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles, [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]].  The reason I liked this, the second book in the series, better was because the story finally finds Kvothe leaving the University behind for a good chunk of the book and finding adventure in several other places.  This changed up the plot quite a bit and provided some variety to the plot.  New characters were introduced in this section of the book, of which I particularly liked the part in Ademre and the Adem mercenary culture in general.  The Chandrian threat is still hanging over Kvothe, and I look forward to seeing how Rothfuss resolves this one, but until then I will enjoy all of Kvothe's adventures!  Rothfuss' writing is a delight!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|A must have in any collection. Marley music breaks all barriers. Songs to live life by. Messages for the soul. One love!
0316023744|4.0|A major undertaking bringing together accounts from all of the far flung theaters of operations to help make sense of the decisions made during and after the war that are still impacting the world.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I think this book is a work of art- a dream that keeps getting better with every turn of the page. I really hope that those hints at a sequel come true!!
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|product arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition. this was for my grandson and he was very pleased the way they were packaged and the condition they were in.
B0089XH38M|3.0|I love AVG on my desktop but on my phone it will NOT update---it goes through the whole process like it IS downloading, then at the end, it says the update did not install. Even my IT husband can't figure out why.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I use this app many times a day to free up memory by stopping background apps I don't need. I helps to keep my running quickly and smoothly.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|Would be a better toy camera for a kid if there wasn't so much shutter lag. Other than that, it works well for what it is.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I love  this book. Great read. I can  wait  to read more by this author. I enjoyed it the entire time I was reading
B003AQBYUG|5.0|It's  A L I E N.<br />  What more has to be said. The best sci fi  movie ever made period.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Any horse lover needs to own this DVD.  I have watched it endless times and still marvel at Penny Chenery's courageous tale of belief in a  horse and in her judgment.  Having seen the real Penny Chennery at Middlegburg races, I am  pleased to own a piece of horse lore and I can tell you, she is just as impressive in person, as i nthe video, where she has a brief cameo in the stands at the end of the film.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Product arrived on time and was packaged well. Bought it as a gift for my daughter and she was delighted.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Product arrived as described. Great bust for a walking dead fan. Only fits season two  in the case, doesn't fit both seasons inside.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Very good movie. Shia delivers another great performance. Supporting cast was out of this world. They \\"made\\" the movie. It was captivating from start to finish.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun and challenging. My daughter and I both play it together. We take turns. She gets a bit frustrated at times though.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I thought the pacing was slow and agonizing.  Sentences were short unintellectual grunts, not thoughts.  I just couldn't find anyway to identidy ro empathize with the main character and root forhim or be on his side.  Totally hated Jack Reacher.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|This game is fun but in order to get any extra help you have to buy it you are unable to level up without paying because you have to have more help which you must use money to buy.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This video was absolutely spectacular. The singing was phenomenal, and Fat Amy was hilarious. A little thick on the language, but that's easy enough to ignore.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can be on facebook when someone else is using the laptop, It is easy to use can use it wherever I want to
B00A757EFW|1.0|I love PAC-Man but hate this version of it. You cannot control the speed of the game at all and the levels don't change like the real game. I feel like I wasted my money on the \\"full version\\" as it doesn't seem like a full version at all. This app could be greatly improved.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I don't like the fact that the camera is only on the front. It's to hard to take pics with.  HATE IT HATE IT
B0017K8X5Q|5.0|Bought this as a replacement fan for a heat sink in a low profile case. Works great and fit without issue!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I installed this app to my Kindle Fire and all it did was crash every time I tried to find out what the weather was. I'd say stay away from this one and find another one like Weather Bug.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This took me back to the very first time I saw the Bad video. The included extras and the poster were wonderful!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. Pinky holding & star gazing...what a sweet thing.The characters are so good.I thought about this story for a while after reading it.So good.Read it- you won't regret it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have enjoyed playing the game, fun way to pass time away while working nights, the graphics are cool, does glitch some, freezes now and then. Acorns are hard to come by, and prices for expansions get expensive, unless you pay real money to purchase acorns or coins. Other than few flaws, very fun and addicting to play.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Was a little disappointed with the ending, but I guess that leaves it open for another Twilight Saga.  Hopefully a book 5!  Otherwise loved it.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|If you value your privacy don't download this.  It's a data miner.  Full access to your internet, phone, text messages, contacts......sorry loser developer.
B008OJ291W|5.0|I've heard a lot of bands remake and recreate a lot of albums and songs in my time, but never yet before have any of them dared to reconstruct almost note-for-note homages to the originals in a way that makes them both so absolutely and uncannily THE SONGS themselves, and, yet, alive and breathing separate beings.<br /><br />The first and most emotional and overwhelming impression is that the songs are indeed magical, as their early versions were indeed as well all those years ago.  (Has it been over 3 decades?!)  Magical.  The sound is, as it ever was, lush and enveloping, and lyrical and melodic, and both complex as well as simply accessible.  And then you realize the first hint of the difference in your ear:  every note, EVERY note, and every sound, EVERY sound, has its own space in the mix in a way that the originals, precise and so-close-to-perfect as they were, never quite achieved, though you never realized it until this very moment.  And, remarkably, the precision and perfection of the remade songs is not sterile in the least.  The sound is still warm, and full.  It's remarkable.  The harmonies are MORE without being any different, note for note.  The entwined lines amidst the orchestration are MORE without being any different, note for note.  Strange magic, indeed.<br /><br />It's a remarkable record.  It's not something new at all, and, perhaps, for that, it will be dismissed by some as unnecessary.  who can argue against that.  The originals were what they were, and stand second to no version, however new and even however &#34;improved&#34;.  (My jet black '70 Chevy Malibu couldn't keep up with my jet black '02 Passat, but I'd still trade for it back in a heartbeat if I could).  But if you loved those songs, you'll hear them again in a completely new way, and for that alone, anyone who loved this music ought to find a way to hear these new versions on a good stereo, and see if it doesn't move them the way they have moved me.  (I cannot wait to pop this disc into my car system!)
B009MCRHH6|3.0|It really pisses me off how all the little stupid blobs crowd around the EXACT spot where I'm trying to focus and pick out and individual corner while the rest of the little s*** heads keep getting in the way. It makes the game so frustrating because I have to keep restarting it, I might just quit.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|Installed it in my Viewsonic G-Tab with HC but it did not work.  As such, I had no choice bu to uninstall it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read the books after i saw the movie. I absolutely love it. I will read the other books as well.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is an amazing album. It got to me super fast and will be recommending it to others so that they can share the joy i did.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Ted,<br /><br />This film is a riot.  However, it's a little over the top<br />on language and subject matter for youngsters.
B005LAJ212|5.0|The writing on this television series is awesome.  I am truly inspired.  They also did a great job in casting. Can't wait for Season Two to come out.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! It is so powerful and emotional. Great acting and filming. I strongly recommend it!
B004K00NMG|5.0|Who would have thought John Cusack and Meg Ryan were the voices.  I wanted to update my collection from VHS to blue-ray and the price was just right.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|i was worried but the actors did a pretty good job considering the circumstances they sang in. seeing it will be even better. cant wait!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I bought this movie with expectations of seeing Matt Boomer dance.  This movie is a flop and I would not recommend it at all!  Stay far, far away.
B000P6PVLC|4.0|Seen it in the theatre ..and loved it ...as part of a non serial of movies by Latino directors ...<br />That are friends of course...and it seems that they are in competition with each other<br />The audience is the winner....period!
B00136JS8U|5.0|The product arrived fast and just like I ordered it. It was well worth it and I am so glad I went through with the purchase.
B008Y1YJZY|1.0|Tho not likely the movies fault.  the Samsung 3D blue ray player would play the movie.  Needs some sort of firmware update that not released yet.  Makes me very learly about buying any 3D movies going forward.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I love 3D movies, and the first Cars was one of my favorite movies, so I had to get this one and happy I did, great movie.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|My wife would leave me for jack skeleton if she had the chance! Lucky for me he is just a fictional character and is not real. Sorry to disapoint.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is my new favorite movie, so I had to get the 3D and I absolutely love it. I'll probably watch this over and over again, it's a great movie, and the 3D makes it even better.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|My husband and I thought this was a great movie.  We had seen it before but wanted a copy for ourselves.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I saw this movie initially in the theaters and I know once it came out I was going to get it. Full of action, what's not to love.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Disney put plenty of adult moments in this to attract adult viewers.  Very funny and can watch over and over especially my autistic son.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|One of the best piano blues recordings I have heard.... I am really into blues and jazz. Hugh is amazing... Saw him on TV and knew I had to have this... if you like blues... you will love this

B005NS5CX4|5.0|I was surprised when I heard a cut from this CD.  And so I decided to download the whole CD... I like it, and that is rare for me.. cause usually I will NOT listen to anything with a hint of country
0385342039|4.0|Favorite Quote: \\"Oh, my God, you smiled! Mr. American Frown actually smiled!\\"<br />\\"Must have been a mistake. I'll speak to someone about it. Won't happen again.\\"<br />\\"Well, good. Because you could do your face and injury, just smiling like that.\\"<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I almost gave this book up. Really, it happened more times than I can remember... I forgot how annoying Kinsella can be, and how neurotic and exaggerated her main characters can get. But I have this thing for ghost stories, so I persevered. Even if that creepy obssession over that stupid Josh guy almost did it for me.<br /><br />What I mean is: Good thing I got over those issues and kept reading.<br /><br />It was such a lovely trip to the twenties! And, as I happened to read it on the one day of every month in which I actually develop feelings (can you speel PMS?), I sorta cried a bit. Yep. Big deal. All the injustice over the ghost's life was just too much. It broke my heart. But moving on...<br /><br />After the annoying start, the story takes on a very nice, very pleasant flow and it becomes increasingly enjoyable. Really, almost freaking magical. (that's what happens when you write a review with a soft heart. I should have edited it a bit. LOL). The romance in the book was very sweet and I totally fell for the romantic interest... but then again, maybe it was just the hormones talking. I'm not sure. :P<br /><br />I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending, expecting a super special goodbye or something between Sadie and Lara, but it was nice nonetheless. (And now that I'm typing this with the return of my black heart, I realize that I wish the evil uncle was humiliated a bit further. It really wasn't enough. *evil laugh*).<br /><br />Have you read Twenties Girl? What did you think about it?
B00321MGPG|5.0|A must have collection.  I really appreciate the efforts that got put into making these kinds of videos.  A very good price for the collection on Amazon.  I'm pleased overall.
0142419400|4.0|I started this book a couple of weeks ago. It didn't instantly grab my attention, so I put it aside and read a handful of other books until I finally came back to it.<br />For the first 1/3 of this book I honestly had trouble figuring out what people saw in it. Really. So much fuss for this? >.> Until I realized that I had fallen for Etienne without even noticing.<br /><br />Yup. I read this one right after finishing Twenties Girl, which means I still had some feelings remaining in my heart due to the PMS and all that (LOL), so I sort of cried while reading this one, too. Embarrassing enough, I even felt my heart tightening when Anna and Etienne kept hurting each other.... very emo, believe me, I am aware. Damn you, hormones!<br /><br />But I digress. Oh, Paris. Your magic got to me. Suddenly I could relate to Anna (and started to crave a trip to those lovely tourist attractions) and wanted Etienne for myself.<br /><br />This one was a lovely, light read that, at the same time, managed to approach some very serious issues, such as divorces, controlling and unloving parents, the tale of first love, the difficulty in ending a relationship because it's 'safe', how to forgive your friends and accept your flaws/admit your mistakes, and, of course, trying to find your place in the world. See, I told you my PMS made me sentimental. It apparently also makes me philosophical. But don't get used it to it.<br /><br />Anna and the French kiss was an adorable read, and now I have to go and look for 'Lola and the Boy Next Door'. I hear it's just as cute. :P
B000002P74|5.0|Had this CD as an eight track tape, wore it out.  I was looking on amazon one day and saw this CD on sale.  I knew I had to have it again!
0547995660|5.0|As most of you know, I have contracted the Dystopian fever last year, and, as of yet, it still remains uncured. So when I heard so many good things about this 'new classic', I thought, 'why not?'. I was a bit apprehensive to choose a 'classic', because they always sound like very boring difficult readings, but not this one. Not at ALL. Well, this IS a children's book... but the issues dealt within are very adult. That's for sure.<br /><br />The Giver is a short, sweet, creepy and enticing book. There are no more than 179 pages, but the story is so well-written, the characters are so well developed, and the plot is so easy to get lost into, that you can barely believe that so much has fit into such a small number of pages! And, of course, it leaves you wanting more. Much more. I loved it, but I would have been even more content if the book was just a tad bit longer, showing what happened to the village and what really came to happen at the end. I don't like 'open endings' like this one had, but I hear the other books will explain a couple of things, so I'll just have to look for them. :)<br /><br />So, the big deal here was: I have read a LOT of dystopians, and I have always thought of how creative they were... well, as it turns out, (in my opinion, at least), most of them must have been somehow inspired by Lois Lowry's world, because the similarities with some titles are uncanny. I won't list them here, because, really, who am I to accuse others? What I mean to say is: once you've read this one... you'll know what I mean.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|This book is a well and thoughtfully written autobiography which provides the reader with an inside look to the development of President Obama's thought process and beliefs and helps one to better understand the conflicts that made him the man he is.
B008J34466|5.0|Love this cd - she's so talented. Her voice is superb, great songs.  She has matured so much in her songwriting. The whole album is something to enjoy!
1449410243|5.0|This is book is hilarious, perfect cat humor any owner can understand! Would recommend it for anyone who has a cat.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This album is definitely better than Just Push Play, has a couple really great songs, and I didnt get bored with it at all, didn't want to turn it of. And they kicked butt in concert!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this book. It was slow at first but then I got into it and didn't put the book down. Now I will go to book 2 and I am hoping it will be good too. Saw the movie and it was good but the book is better.
0345803485|1.0|Print in the book is too light.  Print in the book is too light.  The print in the book is toooooooooooooo light!
0525952926|5.0|I wasn't disappointed! Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors! I would highly recommend this novel. Can't wait for book 3!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Then it grabs you, shakes you, and makes you think,  back to the past, pets, family and racing events.<br />And to the future... It’s worth holding on till the end.  I will talk to my dog differently now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We love this show.  All of the actors did a wonderful job, and even though Nathan has moved on to Castle, we still think of him as the captain.  We recommend getting Serenity.  It came after the series and wrapped things up as much as it could.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have loved this game since my dad taught me as a child, we would sit opposite each other at the table and play double. Each with our own deck and playing only allowed on each other's aces.  Now I play here,arthritis makes shuffling cards too difficult and painfully.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love the plot twists from the initial faery tale stories I heard as a child. This show is quite dark and twisted in a sense, but it does keep the same messages that those stories had for us as children that a lot of today`s children`s show lack. This show is not all about beauty and material wealth that is encouraged often times today, so I highly appreciate that.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've always enjoyed it and then found the full version under free apps of the day. Wonderful :) I'd prob buy the game had I needed to.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my chair the entire time I was reading it. Okay so not the entire time, but the book was very suspenseful. The first few chapters do start out slow and leaves the reader really confused as to what exactly is going on, but as the book gets going the reader cannot help but keep turning pages to reach the climax of the novel.
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|I'm not a movie critic but the plot was missing something.  The story-line makes a leap from he knows he's a doctor to assassin--BAM.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Another suspenseful page turning book. Throughout this book you are not sure who to root for or who to align yourself with because Flynn develops characters that are less than heroic. In fact, at one point or another each character makes you want to slap them silly for being so selfish, greedy, and a little insane, but these flaws make up who the characters are and the motives behind each and every action that they do.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Works well.  Was outside the US and downloaded to Fire quickly and loaded cleanly.  Good backup to your phone alarm.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a quick and easy read. The book read like a typical chick flick with no real surprises. It is a great guilty pleasure read to take up some time.
B005HSL626|5.0|Love it because it allows me to take my mind off everything going around me. Just a great stress reliever
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Was hesitant when first purchasing this game, but after playing for hours without getting bored I realized just how addicting those goo balls really are. $5 might seem like a lot, but this game is amazing. I recommend this game to everyone I know, regardless of age!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Great action and storyline.  There is no one famous who plays in this movie but don't let this sway your decision to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i bought for my grandsons they love it and play it for hours they are 7 and 10 they find it easy to use and not frustrating
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Excellent book. A true page turner throughout in Ken Follett's griping style.  Easily accessible on Kindle. Perfect for instant gratification!
B0030B624E|5.0|My family and I have watched this movie a million times and can keep watching! It is a must see! If you havent watch this yet youve got to!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I purchased an Apple TV a while a go. Most of my gadgets are iDevices. Recently I bought a 2.1 stereo speaker Aego M as a home theater center for bed room. What I originally needed was to convert the music via AirPlay to Aego M. The optical out of Apple TV doesn't compatible with the 3.5 jack, a friend of mine recommended me to us D3 Fiio for converting digital to optical. So I have setup a beautiful audio system wirelessly. Now I can just use my iPhone or iPad to control the music to Aego M via Apple TV without connecting to TV. This cheap product is totally worth every penny! Highly recommended.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is a must see! The second season is just as good as the first! You never know whats going to happen next
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's the best game to keep me entertained while waiting at the doctor's office, in restaurants, etc. The missions give me a goal so I don't get bored and since they restart every 15 levels, the difficulty constantly changing keeps my interest. I bore super easy and I've been playing this one for a year.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|The movie was cute. Had a good story line to it. If you have a young child then you should definitely watch this!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it, I wish I could just touch the screen too turn it off instead of having to pick up and read
B000YHG72E|5.0|We watch Elf at least 10 times a year, and thats a lot since we dont have much time to watch movies in the first place. Its a classic Will Ferrell movie! If you love Will Ferrell and you havent seen this movie you must watch!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Worth a watch. I have seen all of the Bourne movies. This one, is by far, the best of the Bourne movies.
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|To be honest with you I am not sure why we got this movie in the first place. It wasnt that good and I actually ended up falling asleep during it because it couldnt keep my attention.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Do you believe in true love? If you truly, truly believe in forever love, then read this beautiful book. And, enjoy this happily ever after book...
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!! This is a must see! From beginning to end I was hooked! The story line is sooooo good and can I say SEXY too! MUST SEE
B000YDE4AU|4.0|These boots are comfortable, soft, waterproof and flexible right out of the box. They look great and feel rock solid.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Fell asleep during it, it was suppose to be stupid funny but I didn't find any humor at all. Dont waste the $$$$
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love the Big Ban Theory!  I can watch the episodes over and over again. I plan to buy all of them.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was funny! If you like movies like Brides Maids then you will like this one too! I was in the mood for something funny and funny is what I got! I LOVE FAT AMY IN THIS MOVIE! Must Watch!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory!  I watch the episodes over and over again.  I plan to buy all the seasons.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|I love jazz music and this guy is really good. When I hear him I am reminded of many great vocalist ahead of him.  He should have a great future.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory!  I can watch the episodes over and over again.  I plan to buy all the seasons.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This film had great potential (as any film about healing a marriage does). I thought it was going to be deep...but it was mostly just about the couple's sex life in the end. Very disappointing.
B000W967KQ|5.0|As it is said by the book, it kicks asses!<br />Bought it, downloaded it in my iPad and have enjoyed it totally.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To me this is the best series that has come along in a long time.  Too bad it was cancelled.  It should have rub for years
B0000AUHQT|3.0|Not enough action!  I read the book in school, watched the movie twenty years ago.  I can honestly say this is not Redford's best.
B002CLBJPK|3.0|the old version was much better, I thought..The musical version of Bednobs and broomsticks seem less appeling.  Besides, I just dont like musicals
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. This is not for everyone. This has a lot of adult humor in it.<br />One of the funniest more adorable movie I have seen.
1401235417|5.0|This story has to be read in one set because it's so good you won't be able to wait until you buy the next issue! It's wonderfully told and a page turner, I definitely recommend for any Batman fan!
0345529057|5.0|I'm currently reading the third book in the series, and so far they have been extremely interesting and well written. George Martin displays his literary genius with these books. They are very unpredictable and contain many twists. A Song of Ice and Fire is definitely the best book series I have read.<br /><br />The books are just the right size. They are small enough to be easily carried around, and the print is just the right size to be compact yet easy to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this book difficult at first and almost didn't finish reading it but if you stick to it you will find yourself drawn into the characters and trying to guess how it turns out. In the end I really did enjoy it.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|You know what you are going to get with Donald Fagan...good, solid music. A diverse mix of intelligent, mature, always pleasing music.
B004MMFBQU|4.0|I got this kitchen for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas.  We have a small townhome and it is a wonderful size.  It is also perfect for a smaller child as some of the other kitchens, such as kidkraft are larger and would be more difficult for her to reach some of the upper areas.  I also like the minimalist nature of the kitchen.  It has enough bells and whistles to keep her entertained, but also have her use her imagination.  It doesn't require batteries, which was also a plus for us.<br /><br />It only took my husband and I about 30 minutes to put it together and it is all wood/particle board.  The accessories that come with it are very well made.  It was the first thing that my daughter went to play with on Christmas morning.  She recieved [[ASIN:B0000BX8MA Melissa & Doug Food Groups]] as a present and the small bins that come with the play set fit perfectly in the cubboard side of the kitchen.  The pan for the [[ASIN:B00146K0I6 Melissa & Doug Slice and Bake Cookie Set]] fits in the oven side of the kitchen if you raise one side slightly.  The red knobs on the top make a clicking noise when you turn them.  I also love that the sink is removable so that  you can put water in it, but then remove it to empty the water out.  My daughter has also used the sink as an impromtu mixing bowl, which also seems to work well.<br /><br />I have only a few complaints, and they are minor.  The doors don't have a mechanism to keep them closed, such as a magnet, however they don't seem to fall open and it would be easy enough to put a magnet on the doors.  The \\"shelves\\" above the sink are a little loose, but I haven't encountered a problem with things staying on them.  The decorative birds are held on via magnets and the spots on the \\"backsplash\\" can be hard to locate.  A few of the holes were not drilled correctly when putting it together, however we were able to get it to work without any additional tools and it doesn't seem to have effected the structural integrity of thekitchen.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and would purchase it again.
B000E5N62U|4.0|There are several musicians I turn to when I want to listen to music that makes me feel good and Donald Fagan is one of them.  While this is not my favorite album from him, it is still better than a whole lot of other releases from so many other musicians.  Donadl Fagan is consistently good.
B005LAJ17M|1.0|I did not realize that such explicit sexual scenes would be on this.  Absolutely not for teenagers/families. I wish there was some kind of a rating system for this.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I was always an Eagles fan.  Who lived through that golden era of music and wasn't?  But this album of Joe's has really surprised me.  It's fabulous.  A couple of tunes I don't care for but a few of the songs are classic in scope.  He has really nailed it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have the box set of the first four Batman movies (Tim Burton & Joel Shumacher), which I love! I was worried when I heard there would be a \\"New\\" Batman. But Christian Bale is absolutely amazing! The Dark Knight Trilogy is awesome. I love the art book it comes with. It was worth the money to me!
B0087HT36U|4.0|I like the game better than angry birds, but there are some levels on the android version that I cannot beat because the object moves more quickly than I can fire my first shot. Other people who wrote things online are having the same problem. My brother's version for ipad doesn't have this problem.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Sherlock Holmes 2 was just as good, if not better, than Sherlock Holmes. The characters are witty, especially Robert Downey Jr. The costumes are amazing. I wish it came in a Blu Ray/ DVD option though.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|This is one of my favorite computer game and I was really happy when I found it on my Kindle.  The graphics are great and it plays just like, if not better than, the larger versions.
0553108034|5.0|This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down when i started reading. Such great characters and fantastic story telling. I am so pleased that i am ordering the rest. I am currently reading book 3. Amazing books.
006198969X|5.0|This book came in great condition. The photos inside are simple and understated and elegant. Sometimes a bit to simple of breakdowns, such as not buying too sheer of tshirts or trendy items, but In general it is interesting and motivating.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|For once the &#34;bad guy&#34; gets away with the goods, but you can't help root for him as he really was &#34;wronged&#34; by the system.
1423140605|5.0|Happy to have continued with my collection of this series.  Can't wait to find out what happens in this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great suspense, well written.  The ending was definitely the surprise and I hope there is a follow up book to this one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose a five because the author made me really feel and question life as a teenager.  Even though the main character and myself are very different, I could still relate to him on so many levels.  However, if your looking for a happy ending, you're not going to get it here.  Hey, I know. Life's Not Fair! And this book, is definitely about life.
B007MDB71O|5.0|My favorite Edgar Rice Burroughs book now comes alive (and VERY well done by Disney). Excellent, believable with excellent special effects. Underrated in my opinion by the film critics. The WOW factor when seen in 3D is HUGE!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great look into how our elite warriors operate. True Heroes. Our Country is never truly finished as long as we have men such as these. Too bad I can't say the same for our narcissistic politicians.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The latest and greatest reader from Adobe. It's quick and the install was smooth and error free. Now to get the pro version.
B006O3MU96|1.0|I thought this was boring and controls aren't very accurate. downloaded this because it was free and deleted it quickly afterwards.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir does a great job of making the incredible believable.  He uses enough detail to give the full picture while still leaving enough to the imagination.
B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|I have not liked or purchased an Aerosmith record/cd since Draw the Line.  I love their first 4 albums very much but don't care for the top 40 rock they cranked out for years.  But this record is really GOOD!  straight up rock n roll, some Beatles influences, guest singers and Steven and Joe sound awesome.  I am happy with my purchase.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game- fun to play with both 2 and 4 people.  The only thing I don't like about this edition is the the way the water pieces interlock like a puzzle- they really don't lock into place and are very annoying. I much prefer the editions where the water pieces are the same shape as the rest of the pieces.
B0034EEE2E|5.0|nothing beats a drive with this album in... there's nothing else to say just buy it & support great artists!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I'm in awe of all of his recordings and they resonate with me like no other.  The lyrics are masterful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very challenging for all ages. My neice and nephew love it.  I would recommend to all my frieds who have kids.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I'm in awe of all of his recordings and they resonate with me like no other.  The lyrics are masterful.
B000YJ6736|2.0|This book is a bummer. Don't waste your time bummer bummer bummer bummer Mj jg fr DVD no no no
B0036S4C6G|4.0|The characters in this book are great, and the way their lives are woven together through the book is intriguing and beautiful.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very good book I really enjoyed it. It is full of surprises. Every one should receive a standing ovation at least once in their life
1449410243|5.0|The Oatmeal delivers a hilarious take on our furry little friend, the cat.  Ranging from How to tell if your Cat is Plotting to Kill You to How to tell if your Cat is a Raging Homosexual, Matt delivers subtle life lessons in his comics.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this book so much but I did. It was very well written. I just wish we could have known more about thr mysterious friend this book is basically written too
B007SY3CEW|5.0|this app is great even our 4 yr old grandson is learning absolutely love it almost as much as my piano. my daughter has it on her phone I have it on my kindle fire.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I HAD to add this Movie to my Library. I enjoy this movie every time I see it.  I loved that this &#34;First&#34; Miracle on 34th Street is colorized. It was hard to make out some of the details in just Black & White. I love to see Natalie Wood as a Child and all the Actors are so believable. Watching this movie is a real tradition at Christmas Time for me. I think this Original Miracle on 34th Street is better than the &#34;re-make&#34; of the same story.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This is a timeless movie. Great acting, not many could pull this off with just six actors. Every time I watch I see something new
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent!!!! Going to start the next book immediately!!  Was glued from the first page right through the end and imagine the next will be even better.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|Do not buy it If you plan on using it with a nexus7, because its failing to sync up. Even if you factory reset it.<br />The playground app is practically useless. It would be better to wait .
B0042FZOFU|2.0|Really disappointed because I read in the details that this set, like many of the Disney Blu-Rays, had the Blu-Ray, the DVD, and a digital copy-- but it only has the Blu-Rays. A big disappointment in our house because we don't have a Blue Ray for the car.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|David.<br /><br />Beautiful voice - God has a heck of a chorus lead now.<br /><br />Nice collection of some ofher morefamous hits
B004LDLCDG|3.0|The Shakespeare story I have nothing to complain about. It is the way it was compiled in this form. Many of the headings are not in place so you think the wrong person is speaking. There are few of the required stage directions needed to understand the story. The person who put it in the kindle form did a horrible job of following Shakespeare's original play.
B00006IX0R|4.0|David<br /><br />Enjoyed the tunes on this CD. Sure maybe someof the other good songs are missing or cut short, its still a collection of hits - not an all inclusive CD -  its still good.
157421327X|5.0|I would recommend this book for the beginner. It has many Zentangle design samples and it's extremly easy. Great for children and adult beginners..... it also shows how to shade which is something you will want to do. It gives drawings more demensions.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Nothing like a few showgirls to get the show off to a rockin' start.  Enjoyed the movie.<br />Maybe a little corny, but its oneof thos feel good popcorn movies.
B00AODKSAA|2.0|I liked everything about it and I recommend it to anyone over 12yrs ,Full of surprises and action  you will love it
B008HK3XKO|5.0|My daughter loves it!!  She absolutely loves that the case acts as both a protective cover and a stand.  She couldn't be happier!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This is stupid because it's a dictionary and is it's boring I hate dictionaries but they can come in handy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's addictive.  I find it hard to put down. It was a Christmas gift with my Kindle,  I can see some benefit for children to develop spacial relationships.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Ugh. The movie is largely plotless. The acting matches the plot, in that it's missing too. If you like looking at male bodies, my female relatives say the first 20 minutes is worth watching.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan is a disillusioned woman whose biological clock is ticking. After a long term relationship ends, she's ready to settle for a sperm donor to realize her dream of having a baby. She goes to Vegas for a cousin's wedding, gets drunk at the bachelorette party, and wakes up married to a rich, handsome, hotty whose beautiful fiancee had dumped him days before because he is emotionally unavailable. Despite its outlandish, yet somehow also done-to-death story line, it is well written and the characters in Waking Up Married have a warm, approachable quality that makes you pull for them. The book delivers the feel-good HEA when the commitment phobic man falls for the afraid-to-love woman and they find an improbable love in each other. It is a light, quick, pleasant read.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Very funny if you don't mind the profanity! Very funny if you don't mind the profanity! Very funny if you don't mind the profanity! Very funny if you don't mind the profanity!

B008J34466|5.0|Nothing this woman could do would sound bad. She could sing the phonebook and I would buy it! I have all her music.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It definitely held me captive. I read it in less than 24 hours - more like 12!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this was indeed good for a demo big Time I did love playing our though.and still do defiantly very good
B000SW4DXK|2.0|The original had charm, a story, and a believable Susan, lacking in the &#34;update&#34;. How ironic to justify Santa Claus by referencing a dollar bill. Kris Kringle cringed!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|it was just too old for my little girl.if she was older it would have been funer for her I believe
B0076DELIG|5.0|I usually become bored when reading a series after about the fourth book, not so Michael Connoly and Harry Bosch another page turning great read!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|totally full of making people laugh. it was one amazing app and I use it every day. love it definitely
1616284382|4.0|The book, a christmas present, is lovely to behold with many unpublished images, illustrating the marvel that is Walt Disney's Snow White.I have just read through the first two chapters and I am surprised that no editor caught the blatant mistake in spelling. the german fairy tale is called ' Schneewitchen' ( Schnee meaning snow)  not Sneewittchen as repeatedly printed here.I hope, this mistake in research is not carried over into the rest of the book.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Great pinball, just like the one down the block I used to feed quarters till I was broke way back when. Before Pac Man, or Tron. Yes, I played when the dinosours were at home playing Atari! I would definitely recommend this app. Maybe a five star game, I just wish I had just bought the app instead of the free download..lots of distracting stuff with the freebie..
071815780X|4.0|I love the recipes but the time is out.  Family love the food so great buy.  Some of the recipes have taken me  out of my comfort zone which is good
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There was so much emotion and pain and at the end I even cried this book is now my favorite!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app.  Works just like the android phone app.  The Weather Channel weather is the most accurate in my area.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I thought that diary of a wimpy kid book seven was not as good as the others.  It was not that funny and only had a few main characters.  Rodrick, dad, mom, and Manny were barley mentioned.  I would get this book at your local library and save seven bucks.
B009ZE27US|1.0|It is not that funny. I'm 10 so this nonsense doesn't make me laugh. I want an actual age scanner. Not this stupid app!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It is a game worthy of console or pc and is addicting to play.<br /><br />I do hope they get new updates to<br /><br />If you ever played league of legends you will like this
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect because I'm not a great fan of baseball.  But the story was so engrossing, I just looked at the story and the underlyng points on technology vs the &#34;old timers&#34; and natural talent.  Clint Eastwood displayed his patented crusty, crotchety act. Amy Adams was great as a conflicted daughter in the wrong career. Justin Timberlake is an under-appreciated and under-used actor.  If you are over 40, I highly recommend this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game every!I play it all the time at my grandma`s house.I love the game so much I want to play it right now and now
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written recap of the day that Osama Bin Laden was captured and shot. Well written and very captivating review of the life of a Navy Seal.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so... amazing and captivating and just wow. I read it in 1 sitting. It was really worth buying
B00004WEJZ|1.0|It's missing a chapter, you be allowed to sell this for $66.00. Get a conscience!! Where are your ethics.  SHAMEFUL
B003ODIZL6|2.0|ITS AWESOMEE!!<br /><br />IT IS VERY USEFUL AND AWESOME! This book is great!! Blah blah blah blah and yes so yea
B004J64QSI|5.0|This concert brings me to tears with its beauty every time I watch it. Les Mis quickly became a favorite of mine after watching this dvd and I will be sure to watch it over and over again.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This was an entertaining,not overly challenging adventure game.  Some of the room entrances were a little difficult to see which may frustrate some users at the start.  The built-in hint system was useful to nudge you in the next direction just by reading the hint titles...helpful to people like me who lose track of what we are doing from time to time!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 11 year old grandson said this is the best book that he has ever read. Not only are they reading it at school but we are also reading it together as a family every night. We take turns reading it. We hope that the author writes another book called Wonder 2.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I am a beginning game player and immediately found this easy and fun. Love the story to it<br />Background pictures really enhance the game.
B005LAII08|1.0|My kids and I immensely enjoyed the movie. It is unfortunate that the regular blu-ray dvd does not play past the second scene. It is rather irritating. We ended up watching it without blu-ray all together. I just hope that the 3d one will at least work...
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Anyone who likes this song, good for Christmas and Christmas Spirit, Up beat and fun, no dislikes, fast download, great price,<br />thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just cant tell you how addicting and fun this game is. .once you start playing you don't want to stop. I have a kindle fire and it is on the wheel up top so I can play everyday. No glitches or problems. Just be prepared to want to play nonstop. . Have fun!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Anyone who likes Sail, good for the price cant wait to hear whole album, Up beat and fun, no dislikes, fast download, great price,<br />thanks
B001JU4S44|3.0|Story ok but and would be good movie.  The chase scene and fight scene get boring as they drag on too long.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my first Jack Reacher read.  It won't be my last.  Excellent character that you can love for the moment and still comfortable when he inevitably leaves.  Mystery is good; reading is fast and not overly complicated.  Just what I love in mysteries.  I can see why there is such a great fan base for Reacher novels.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|My brother was excited to recieve this present. It was awesome and classic. CDs are a great gift for anyone.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Cold case base brings back memories of a dramatic time in our culture and then blends some old school detective work with more contemporary elements.  Crosses the decades  wonderfully.  Timing excellent with the recent death of the iconic poor-soul Rodney King, who through his suffering and plea &#34;can't we all just get along&#34; shook our cultural sensibilities to the core -- at least for a few minutes.  God bless Rodney
0143038583|4.0|This book was quite interesting. It taught me the importance of knowing where food comes from. It was actually a bit disgusting in some parts of it. Overall, it was an eye opener.
B009B2VBWE|5.0|What a great collection of well done, simple, old school blues/jazz material.  It is one of those which I will listen to over and over for years.  Great first listen that also wears well
0765322889|4.0|I've heard so many good things about this series that I eventually gave in and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The good:<br /> - The characters are complex - not good or evil necessarily, but each acting in accordance with their own history and motivations.<br /> - The world is rich in detail - you get the impression that this story plays out only in one corner of one continent of a larger world.<br /> - The plot is intriguing, with all the strands coming together for a grand finale.<br /> - Unlike some other novels, each scene is short and well-contained enough that you don't get frustrated by the switching viewpoints (whereas with LOTR:TT/ROTK I would get really annoyed when Tolkein switched viewpoints (for several chapters) half-way through a story).<br /><br />On the flipside:<br /> - This is a brand new world, which doesn't make use of standard fantasy terminology - and you're dumped right into the middle of it - so it took me a good long while to figure out who was who, how things worked, etc. I was half way through the book before I realized that Tiste Andii and T'lan Imass were completely different races (they both begin with T...).<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed it. It didn't blow my mind, but there's a lot to like, and now that I understand the world (to a degree) I imagine it will be easier to get into the later books without being initially overwhelmed.
B009MFKO3M|4.0|there has been a lot said about Lonerism this year. Critic after critic have put it near the top of their ten best lists for 2012. This is a good album to be sure. track after track measure up to each other with a few really solid stand-outs. I'm not sure I'd say its in my top for the year. It would be really hard for anything to live up to the hype this recording has gotten. I doubt anyone who's heard a few tracks and liked them will be disappointed. While I like it a lot, it is at its essence, nothing new or life changing. Its a great psychedelic rock album. If you're into that sort of thing, this is a great album for you. But if you want to hear something that no one else has done before, you wont find it here.

1846551455|5.0|I have wanted to read Jo Nesbo first novel for years. I am a big fan of his books and finally this book got published. What a fantastic first novel! Harry Hole goes to Australia to help out with the case of a Norwegian girl murdered in Sidney, and gets more than his share of grief when friends began to die and he has to rethink the case.  I have all his books in Kindle and in print. I cannot wait for the second novel that has not yet arrived to USA.

B0000AM6IY|4.0|Despite being a child of the 50's, I'd never experienced this film until my recent purchase from Amazon. The price was less than half the price of a movie ticket today ($3.99!). Okay, a \\"basic edition\\" DVD....not Bluray, and not a deluxe edition..., but I figured at this price I could view it as a \\"sampler\\". I could always go more deluxe later. Incidentally, I was a bit curious when I noticed a messgage at the beginning announcing this presentation is modified from the original theatrical release. In what way(s)? And why? Being a newbie to the multiple Oscar winner....I would never know what changes are inherent here. (This is the full-screen edition. Maybe that's the change). I think most folks are \\"with me\\" in wanting DVD's to preserve all original theatrical release aspects. Right?  Be that as it may, this is one aventurous flick! The long steady camera fixed visual overture creates the feel of a stage musical (probably that was the idea). Once the \\"Jets\\" and \\"Sharks\\" arrive on camera....get ready for some of the longest choreographical sequences ever. (At first, I started to get a bit bored...I like musicals...but I have a slighly limited attention span for dance numbers.) I'm so glad I hung in there, though! After the final curtain comes down on ths legendary opus, it's \\"I want to watch it again\\" time! Great performances across the board! John Astin even stops by pre-Gomez Addams! I think special mention needs to be made for Russ Tamblyn (plus perhaps an Olympic Gold Medal) for truly gymnastic choreography. As far as I could tell, no stunt double, incredibly. At the end of the day, the legendary Leonard Bernstein score rules the day. \\"America\\" and \\"Tonight\\" are well-deserved American music standards. Add to that some of the most passionate work ever by a young cast including Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno in  her star-making Oscar- winning screen- dazzlement moment, and it all clicks. Excperience it. You won't forget it. (Once again, this review is for the \\"basic\\" DVD of \\"West Side Story\\" . Picture and sound are both great.).
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was very good. It was about Greg and his problems with finding love, he struggles with finding a girl who likes him. Once I saw my friend reading this book I had to have it. When I got it, I couldn't put it down. You must read it if you are a fan of diary of  wimpy kid.
0756666937|5.0|I didn't read this.  I got it as a gift for my grandson for Christmas at his request.  So I'm sure it was a big hit.
6305718954|5.0|Top to bottom this is just a well done flick. I can see why many might peg Stigmata as 'Horror' but I have my own little sub-genre 'Supernatural Thriller' that this fits into nicely. The plot is tense and well paced. The viewer has lots of tidbits with which they can begin to guess what's really going on and that leads to a very satisfying ending. If you liked Poltergeist or Bless This Child, you'll enjoy the time spent with Stigmata.
