B0070X0PGE|5.0|The quality of the download is quite excellent.  I have listened to this group before and it seemed better this time arounnd.  Kind of different music but excellent in the use of the instruments.  Mellow, but intense kind of music in the form of a story line.<br />Thank you Amazon for bringing it to me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good story line less control more of a relationship than the first one. Enjoyed the email banter.  Very humorous at times.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Once again, Susan Boyle has made another wonderful CD.  Beautiful voice, beautiful arrangements.<br />She's truly gifted and we look forward to many more CD'S.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|And its awesome. try it. if you hate it its free so you can delete it.so why not try it?
B0055SWM08|2.0|don't get it but it is very addicting that is why people gave it 5 stars listen to Md ok and if you don't then you will be addicted to it
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Yep, my daughter loves this movie.  She watches it over and over and over and over and over and over again!
B0042VJSVU|5.0|I just got around  to using this flash this past Friday at my childs school concert. It was truly awesome. What I loved most is that most of the lights were turn off in the room and this flash did an amazing job. The photos came out beautiful. Thanks so much.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|I kept hoping for something awesome to happen, but the big scenes never came.  It was just decent.  Good acting all around, but the plot just lacked for me.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Great movie.  The horse is the BEST character! He's just like my wife's horse.  What a pain but still a great horse. I could watch this movie over and over.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|This movie was great especially when it shows the relationship between and older brother and a younge brother.  The younger brother is trying to find his way, while the older brother makes it hard.  However they bonded and it was a good, clean fun family movie.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I found this dystopian film somewhat derivative, but Jennifer Lawrence's acting was terrific. The story reminded me a lot of \\"The Lottery,\\" but with a lot more action.<br /><br />Also commendable were a looming Woody Harrelson, a creepy Stanley Tucci, a barely recognizable Liz Banks, and the skin-crawling Tracker Jackers.<br /><br />I haven't seen any of the \\"Twilight\\" series, but I'm betting THG is a smart alternative to that portrayal of millennial angst.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I almost can't believe how much I enjoyed this album...usually albums have some songs that are hit and miss...not a one of this album! If there is a song I think I even might NOT like...by the end of the song I am in love. Lovely infectious songs. Just amazing!
B0096DZKZC|5.0|you are out of your mind if you think this is a one star. this app is awesome and you know it
B00005KAQP|2.0|Sister Act is my favorite Whoopi Golberg movie and I couldn't enjoyed because of the low quality of the DVD. I looks more like a copy than an original. I noticed this note in the back &#34;DISC MADE IN MEXICO&#34;. I don't know if that has something to do with the overall quality of the product. This is the first time that I ordered a movie from Amazon and be disappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game as it is an exercise for your mind and fun at the same time.  The game will teach strategic thinking.  It is games like this that keeps your mind young and may even prevent dementia.  We need more of them.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It was easy to get and to install.  It is easy and convenient to use.  It is also helpful.  And it is FREE!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I bought both an E3 and an E6. I work out of multiple offices and travel a lot so I figure it couldn't hurt to have more than one amp anyway. They are cheap enough so that I could afford both also. Bang for the buck, the E3 wins hands down. The E6 does sound better, but is it worth the additional $18? Absolutely not. If I were to quantify how much better the E6 sounds better than the E3, I'd have to say somewhere in the 5% increase in the quality of overall clarity. With a 300% price difference between the E6 and the E3, that simply isn't worth it in my book. When and if the E6 breaks, I'll be replacing it with an E3 which is the best $9 I've spent in my life.<br /><br />My A/B testing was done with a Lenovo ThinkPad W530 and Beats Pro headphones. I did an A/B test with my Samsung I717 note phone and found pretty much the same differences. Of course all of this is subjective, but whether you buy an E3 or an E6, you're still getting definite increases in sound quality, clarity, bass, a fuller sound stage, and volume.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As good as ever, maybe better with the new plot twists and characters.  The governor is AWESOME, friendly yet creepy!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I loved the idea and followed the story arc across the subsequent books. If you read all of the series I wouldn't bother with the Daughters vewpoint story but the Sagan Diary is brilliant.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Kept me interested throughout the book. Some parts were hard to imagine and a little sci-fi but overall a good read
B009MO5ES8|3.0|Doesn't necessarily live up to its name. This is about a bike messenger in New York (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who takes a dangerous package that puts him in great peril, even more than the constant running of red lights in rush hour. This features two of my favorite actors in Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon; I like them so much, I didn't even bother looking up anything about it, I just went. Unfortunately, though, this is only adequate. I could never get 100% excited or invested, and I think that is largely due to the story not being terribly strong; there are a number of cliches in this, and it feels awfully familiar for an otherwise original movie. The things that Premium Rush does have going for it is the fact that it is pretty non-stop, and there is extra depth that Shannon and Gordon-Levitt add to what would be shallow characters; JGL brings the charisma and Shannon bring the intensity. If you are a fan of the X-Games, you'll probably get more out of this, but for me, this never felt substantial at any point, and was just a decent way to pass the time.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|i think this is one of the best games its really addicting and really funthis is my favorite app on the market
B00138GZAC|5.0|Relaxing without putting you into a coma.<br /><br />Sade's voice is smooth, natural.  She is a true singer, not someone that screams<br />and moans like she has constipation.<br /><br />Good mood music.
B007THA4FI|3.0|First, let me be clear. There is no challenge from this viewer of Rowling's writing skills and talent. They certainly speak for themselves to the tune of a billion euros plus, but..........<br /><br />This might have been a gentle but penetrating expose of contemporary English village life, and I would have been satisfied if not delighted with that, but for some curious reason Casual Vacancy turned into a grimy, ugly examination of a village underbelly. In a turn from Harry Potter, was there some catharsis needed of things magical and romantic, to an extreme of things pedestrian, mundane, and bitter? In places the story line is harsh, often downright angry, as if Rowling felt the need to remind the reader that unattractive people do exist, unfortunate things to happen to good people, and out the
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Besides the odd stunning visual there is little positive to say about this film. The sound was appalling -- it was often difficult to understand what actors were saying. Part of the blame may lie with the actors themselves as most of them adopted the modern actor's naturalistic fallacy, believing it is OK to mumble and forgetting that a major part of their role is to communicate with an audience.<br /><br />Christian Bales lacks lustre and charisma in this role. I thought he did well with Batman Begins but it's all downhill from there. Michael Caine seems to have one gear as Alfred -- contrived weepiness and an attachment to Bruce Wayne that is unbelievable given the lack of any real relationship between the actors on screen. Bane was passable and Anne Hathaway does a great job.<br /><br />The real problem with this film for me was that it is basically an ensemble piece. There are simply too many points of view and to many bland characters I couldn't care less about. The audience is never afforded the opportunity to identify with a point of view character because the net is cast too wide. If we are to identify at all it is with the people of Gotham, looking on as observers of a Batman who is noticeable by his absence a lot of the time.<br /><br />The fight scenes seemed lame, partly due to the naturalised sound effects, I imagine. The CGI looks like it was done an an iPhone app and the editing lacked continuity, presenting us with a sequence of disjointed scenes that left me wondering what on earth was going on, who I was following, and why I was even bothering to watch the rest of the film.<br /><br />The concept of the Dark Knight is great but the execution in this film was poor. The writer/director seems to have no grasp of basic story-telling dynamics or the importance of engaging an audience. A good third of the film could have been cut with nothing lost.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Exciting is hardly the word for the action and mystery in this, the third of three, thoroughly enjoyable movies. My reservation is that the director and writers have made it so real that I worry how much of the story could be true. It is definitely an adult subject and I admit to watching the first two many times and have been thoroughly engrossed with them and will add this one to the mix. Matt Damon is master at what he does here.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I'm not very musical, so being able to play something simple like a Christmas carol is great! This is a timing game but can definitely be a learning tool for kids. Thanks!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great to add cities of friends and family or just where you are going.  However, it auto adds &#34;where you are now&#34; as a location. Plenty of actual weather info, detailed alerts and links to some weather videos and just fun videos of the moment.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Our whole family enjoys this movie so much.  We watch it every couple of months, especially when the grandchildre are here.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Performs as I expected and I love the color... although I am a more &#34;vibrant&#34; color kinda gal. This allows me to put my Kindle in my purse and not worry about messing it up..
B00A757EFW|2.0|Love Pac Man, but my fingers are too big and screen to small to enjoy this version.  Use of a stylus would make it better, but where did I put my stylus?  I uninstalled it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We loved this mini-series. My husband loaned it out, and it was never returned. He kept talking about it, so I got this for him for Christmas. The whole family will actually sit down and watch it. I can't wait for him to open it, so we can watch it again.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love Rod Stewart, and love this Christmas Album.  What took you so long Rod.  Love this album and would recommend it.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|excellent view, played well, ending sucked / wonder how they will incorparte Damon into the sequel?Can't wait to see how they work it out while its still a hot flick.
B009LXEBD4|3.0|I've heard many of her songs that I like better than those included on this album, but that just may be my taste in music.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|An engaging cast and subtle digs at all that is &#34;Glee&#34; make &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; and unexpected delight. Rebel Wilson is a revelation.

B007PF7MGS|5.0|This is by far the most influential and informative book if read in the past 5 years!! Its like a breath if fresh air. I've recommended this book to 7 of my closest friends and family members and all are just aa taken back as myself. I was already vegetarian and now I have taken it a step further with full and complete knowledge of things I was still doing wrong as a vegetarian. Excellent book, simply amazing!!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This was so much better than I thought it would be!! It's worth buying and I recommend it to anybody
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Tightly written, totally creepy, loved every minute.  Definitely one of the best I've read in a long time.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I really loved this film which has so many of my favorite actors.  Especially liked Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.
0525423656|5.0|I'm loving Ally Condie's writing! I was getting sick of reading future-gone-wrong books, but then read hers. Loved it. I also loved Divergent. This one is less violent. -Well, at least the violence is more subtle in Condie's books.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Loved the price and can't wait for my little man to see it Christmas morning!! :) Was a great movie and couldnt believe the deal on the price for new!! Thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The book has a lot of similarities with The Sea of Tranquility (which I read twice in just few weeks apart). Though I enjoyed reading this book I'm not considering re visiting it in the future.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|this movie was in great quality , i would have liked there to be a little more to the ending , but lots of great action and the actors all blend in quite nicely

0761169253|5.0|Don't let this tiny book fool you.......As I am a creative person, also, I can turn to any page in the book and get wonderful, positive energy in a second!!  Sometimes you don't want to read tons of words in a four inch thick book, however,  I feel that through these pages Austin Kleon speaks to so many creative people personally and a lot of us feel the same.  He states everything that is caught up somewhere in the dusty and cobweb filled chambers of our creative brains on each and every page.  It's all the stuff that we know, but most of the time we forget.  I keep it near my desk so whenever I need that push of inspiration or positive boost the energy is instantly right there!!!!!!!  Thank you, Austin
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Laughed a lot! This was a fun movie. You don't have to like Glee to like this unique comedy that's like no other movie I've seen.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the Twilight saga, I already had the first two dvds at home and wanted the 3rd and 4th. This was right around tbe time BD2 came out. I wanted to watch all the movies back to back before going to the movies to see bd2.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was one of the cutest kid's movies I have ever seen. I bought it for &#34;Scottish Movie Night&#34; in my high school dorm, and everybody loved it! We had three little boys too, and all of them were completely engrossed in the film. The music is great as well.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|My daughter put this on the top of her list for Christmas, so she will be thrilled to open it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One reviewer made the statement this plot is the same as the movie \\"Mission to Mars\\". Not even close. Makes me wonder if the reviewer read the book. This is a good, well written tale. I am not a scientist but am enough of a space geek to believe everything here is possible. But it is a good story even if you care nothing about science or space. This is one fortunate dude, I will forgive him for his bad language. From his logs you get the impression he is a kind of back of the line hanger-on for this mission. But the outcome shows him to be a very competent individual and scientist.<br />This is one of those books that make your eyes want to slip down the paragraph to see what happens.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|you havr to see it ... love how it has alot of the frist movie refenece , the way its updated make it relavent to the other futuristic movies out there today
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Its a nice little timesink.  Better than most of these types of games.  Resource management and the breeding options make the game shine.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|Don't trust this movie!  All the bad guys are capitalists and business people - but the goal isn't to be successful, make money, support a family or achieve the American Dream.  No!  All the \\"bad guys\\" want to accomplish here is pointless destruction and pollution.  It seems that they would actually be happy being be LESS successful, but only as long as more innocent destruction is guaranteed along the way!  TWO WORDS:  Cliche and Microcosm....  So sad that we have come to this as a people.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Product provided a perfectly cut bottle the first time we used it and it was easy to assemble and use.  Outstanding!

0307592731|1.0|Cheryl is boring, self indulgent/absorbed, ungrateful and downright stupid. You have to be a total idiot to go out even for a day hike unprepared and uninformed? The whole story is ridiculous and insulting to the readers' intelligence. What's with the package of condoms in her backpack and her obsession with sex? Was her goal to have a romantic interlude on the trail, stinking from days without a shower? What normal hiker sends themselves sexy underwear in a survival package? Thank goodness I was able to download the book through my library. Would be kicking myself if it had been a totally wasted purchase.

B002ZG9846|2.0|Una lastima, una edicion de bluray tan cuidada, y tan dedicada, con tanto material extra, que NO TRAE subtitulos en español, ni siquiera en ingles. El Film si trae subs en español, pero no audio. Lastima porque la edición es simplemente excelente.
030759565X|4.0|Loved the book.  She tells a bit of a story with the recipes, which is always interesting. I cook a lot.  These recipes are easy, and the book can be recommended to all levels of cooks.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|Such a great book! The ending was kind of cheesy (in a good way though) but I loved it in general! Edward and Bella are such well thought out characters, Jacob too. The one thing that I think could have made this book better, is if there was a section from Renesmee's perspective.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This is a great book. If you are a fan of the series definitely read. &lt;3 :) :) :) &lt;3
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It is a joke to me that people would give this movie anything but 5 or 4 stars the lowest.  The entire trilogy was probably the best that I recall seeing EVER for a super hero interpretation and a movie period!  I enjoyed the depth of the movie and how it explored multiple themes like good vs bad, class warfare, loyalty, betrayal, etc.  I am sad to see the trilogy end but will enjoy watching all three movies over and over again!<br /><br />By the way I think it's funny that many of the folks that says this movie was average or not good are the same ones that thinks Avengers is a masterpiece.
B000002H4C|5.0|It has fantastic music from all sorts of great bands.  The bands include Sammy Hagar, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, Stevie Nicks, Black Sabbath, Nazareth, Journey and more.
B005PK553C|5.0|We started watching this series after the first season and WOW, we went through the entire first season in one weekend.  I used to watch Nip/Tuck so the provocativeness and weirdness reminded me of that show.  Now we are watching season 2!
B006MW3VGA|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece. My wife and I love watching this show. We are now caught up to the beginning of 3rd season. We can't wait for it to start. The setting, Downton home, house staff, story, and drama is gripping. We love it!
160094048X|5.0|Fantastic baking information at the beginning of the book which was very helpful to me.  I love the recipes, very easy to follow.  I made the Rocky Road cookies and can't stop eating them!!! I'll definitely make this my 'go to' book for vegan baking!

098478280X|5.0|I would recommend this book for everyone that is looking for a software engineering interview, especially if you want to use Java. By the time I finished reading and practicing the content of the book, I am more comfortable working with algorithm, data structures and etc.<br />It neatly divides coding categories into chapters. It also give a good solution for every single listed problem / questions.<br />Practice makes perfect, and this book will definitely help people for interview or for adding more knowledge about coding.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie helps shows what happens when we overuse/abuse our natural resources. The songs are catchy. And the characters loveable.  My daughter and I loved it and had to have it in our personal movie collection to watch anytime.

B000QGAU4E|1.0|I don't see the point of this movie. Its all about people freaking out because there were no children. I don't see what the big deal is. So what if its the end of the human race? I didn't feel sympathy for any of the characters.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|And it might have a bunch of ads when you get it but once you start using it for a long time, the ads will go away. And if you don't have a camera on your tablet, it still is pretty good. You can use photos from your gallery or picasa. And you can also use lots of photos provided by Picsart. It is also a social network. Who can beat Picsart?

B0007MWZEK|2.0|The sweeper itself works fine.  This is our second one.  But, when emptying the dust cup, the entire cup falls off instead of just swinging open.  You then can pick the dust cup out of your trash.  The other one of these sweepers perfect.  What changed and why??
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I will not get into details, I will just say that I have people under 40 age that like it here in my house that watched it, around age 50 also, kids too, but most of all the 80 yr old retired Air-force military 80 yr old man has picked this TV show of them all to watch right now and even HE lines up for every single episode.  So there is something for everyone and if an 80 yr old buys the series then there must be something good, funny, and action based to it or they may not like it and watch it so much.  It is interesting too, like the TV show Eureka or StarGate, we enjoyed all these.  Something for everyone to basically like in general as a family.  He likes it as more than Once Upon a Time TV show, I like both.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Will Ferrell continues to delight and entertain with his witty sense of humor and hilarious antics!  His child-like performance will have you laughing out loud.

0316017930|5.0|I recommend this book for just about everyone. Intelligence and hard work are ingredients for success yet opportunity plays a tremendous role.  Gladwell makes good sense, and his books are always a quick enjoyable read.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I really liked this book and think it's one of the best self published books I've read.  In spite of complaints in other reviews, I felt it was well written.  Most important to me, the characters are well developmented and they really come to life.  It was also a good story in a well developed world.  It is a coming of age story where the young hero is being raised as a warrior priest in a country run by a conniving king where magic is thought to be evil.  It's a good read with some interesting twists along the way. It was also refreshing to have an honorable main character who seemed (usually) to behave in a consistent fashion within the framework of his character as developed in the book.<br /><br />I felt that the manner of the story's telling to be a bit contrived.  The hero is telling his story a number of years latter to someone who is escorting him to a duel, but the book tells more to the reader than is apparently being told to the escort.  I didn't really think this added anything except a bit of occassional confusion.  There were also a few places where I found myself wondering when things were happening.  In spite of these comments, I found the book to be a really good read.

B00APUYN0I|4.0|Don't come into this movie expecting to see Glee, because it is NOT Glee (thankfully!). You will find a very fun movie with lots of great A Capella, inappropriate commentators (John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks), crazy funny characters (like Fat Amy), and projectile vomiting. Good times for teen kids to adults.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|There is a lot going on here.  The history lesson goes beyond the relationship of Society and those in service.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle after reading several good customer reviews here on Amazon (a \\"thank you\\" goes out to all of you fellow customers who also take the time to write these reviews). This was the first novel I have read by the author, John Scalzi, but having finished it, I will definitely be reading more of his work in the very near future.<br /><br />So what made me give this novel five stars? Easy; it was an excellent scifi read that I went through in just two days, because I found it hard to put down. Which, to me, is always the signature of a good book. A tight plot that advances steadily, without the author getting sidetracked by ancillary details or character development. We learn about, and get to know the characters just enough to keep the story moving forward. Yet the characters end up having quite a bit of depth and personality by the ending portions of the book. The new technologies introduced by the writer may sound somewhat familiar to scifi fans, but he twists them about in a manner which leaves them feeling fresh and original, IMHO. The alien species introduced to us during the story are also pretty darned original too.<br /><br />Without revealing any of the plot, suffice it to say that the story moves along at a brisk pace that keeps you turning the pages, and develops in a way that leaves plenty of material for the follow-on novels. Which is a good thing, because the end of this first one definitely left me wanting more.<br /><br />Anyways... if you love scifi with a tight plot, genuine-feeling characters, and interesting new technologies, be sure to give this one a read.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|This is not, and was never meant to be, a historically accurate version of the 300 Spartans.  While it is based on an actual event, it is an adaptation of a graphic novel version of the story.  If you are looking for accuracy or a documentary this is not it.  If you are looking for an action movie with great visuals, good fight sequences, and good (but certainly not great) acting, you will probably find this to be entertaining.  Personally I think the best performances in the movie come from Dominic West and Lena Headey. If you are looking for movie that is an accurate representation of the Battle of Thermopylae pass this by, but if you are looking for a good action movie that looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, then this will be a good addition to your collection.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Fun to watch. Excellent animation... uncannily realistic. Good story. Like (almost) all fairy tales the message is right prevails and everything ends happily for the good guys... and the bad guys get their comeuppance. A good message, well delivered. Our grandson enjoyed the movie and understood the message; he was able to tell us what he had learned from it. (Personal comment:  It's tough to balance these kinds of messages with how life actually unfolds... but, maybe reality should be deferred as long as possible.)
0060245867|5.0|Thanks you for a sweet book for a sweet price. The book arrived on time and was able to please the child in an old woman.
0812993357|5.0|What is not to love about this bio if you care at all about fashion?  Loved her narrative, enjoyed her line illustrations, wished or more photographs. A fine read.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This is the best album that I have heard in years. I just makes you want to dance. I am very glad that Phillip won.  I was rooting for him.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|This CD is awesome best album love it. Other disk has rate songs never before released till now how can you not love it
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The cast is superb, the setting, well, exotic for me, the dialog well done, all in all a top flight job. The movie covers several interesting topics that I find quite timely. To start with it's about the getting older process, something we are all doing, but some of us are just a bit more into it that the youngsters. Point is it's something that effects us all. The setting is in India and my, like one of the characters says, sic, &#34;an assault on all the senses&#34; and all at once.<br /><br />Good flick, both comedy and pathos. But not so heavy you dread re=seeing it. Uplifting and funny in points I guess I would say!
B001E5CH0G|5.0|I dont care how many time they play this movie on tv, I will continue to watch it and laugh my butt off. Will Ferrell is great in this movie. This is a great one to add to the blu ray collection.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I read this book after hearing the author in several media outlets. The interviews are more interesting. Since he is a doctor, Eban uses way to much medical jargon to keep explaining how what happened to him is a medical impossibility. Left feeling like I was reading a textbook.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The picture quality was great while streaming to the PS3 in standard quality.  It may have looked even better in HD.
1607066017|5.0|\\"Saga, Volume 1\\", a graphic novel from the folks at Image, by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples, fit that description to a \\"T\\" - although I DID enjoy it, as well.  Heroes have dark sides, villians have soft spots, and any one of them could end up dead on the next page.<br /><br />This graphic novel is not for kids. The opening scene is a back-room childbirth, not as graphic as it could be, BUT far more than you'd see on television - even cable.  Lots of \\"bad language\\".  Some sex (yes, this really is a GRAPHIC novel!!)  And violence, even implied or downright administered against kids.  BUT it all fits together.  (OK, I'm a bit more of a prude since I got my AARP card, and I could have done with the sex being done off-screen, but to each their own.)<br /><br />If you want super-heroes in tights, taking on threats to our way of life - pick up a different book.  If you want DRAMA, if you want ART, if you want something that shows how \\"comics\\" have evolved for the new millenium, pick up \\"Saga, Volume 1\\".  Then, you probably will want to grab \\"Volume 2\\" when it comes out next summer.<br /><br />I don't freely give out 5 stars, but this was so close to that mark that I decided to round up.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: This book was supplied free of charge via random draw. The distributors probably hoped for a review in return, and further hoped that it was good, but no promises were made to write a review, let alone influence its tone or content.
B005DNPJKU|1.0|This movie is not true.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've never use to like these games but now I love it because finding the tiles are interesting, challenging and fun.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful storylines great acting and very believable sets. This unique and wonderful series holds us spellbound. Cant wait for Season 3!!
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Good stuff. Just got into this genre of music and I am not dissapointed. Catchy stuff. Why do I need to keep typing words to submit this review?!?!?!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie related to my husband and myself in so many ways. The economic times when<br />you thought when you were getting older you would be living a little better than what you are.<br />The laughs you get when you find you body not working as well as it used to!!<br />And finally you reach the age of not giving a dam what anyone thinks of you!! such freedom
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My first review was not very good, but after going back and concentrating a little more, I figured out the strategy of this game.  I play this a lot while waiting in the Doctor's office, or other boring places.
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie. It's not spectacular, but it's good entertainment. The kids really liked it and we've watched it a few times.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Partial spoiler below, but before that, from technical point of view, this is a brilliant mystery.  I usually don't like long italicized sections that bring you into the mind of a character, but here they're used extremely well to advance the plot step-by-step, to keep up with each new discovery.  The writing is wonderful, somehow both lush and spare at he same time.  The flawed love of all the characters makes them real (flawed love, flawed virtue, virtuous vice being a constant in Nesbo, but never more than here, symbolized by the cheap ring with the nick).  The hints Nesbo drops work wonderfully too, as every detail comes back.  Now for the partial spoilers: this is a very novelistically written procedural, with all the techniques of novels, including motifs that recur transformed and symmetry and reverse symmetry.  But the symbols can be obvious, and their obviousness is wearing.  And because Nesbo plots around symmetry, you can guess too much in advance.  It's too easy to figure out who the murderer is, not because the clues are too easy but because this is obviously where Nesbo is heading.  For the same reason, it's too easy to guess who the Phantom is.  (Though it is rather nice that &#34;phantom&#34; could equally apply to so many of the principal characters, not least Harry himself.)  Finally, I had to roll my eyes when Harry's running around Oslo with a nasty, infected wound that would drop any normal person; Harry just wrap it in duct tape and drinks some bourbon (that bourbon bottle, of course, later becoming key in yet another super-human escape: get it? Jim Beam detroys Harry but saves him?)  You expect this kind of ridiculousness in a Hollywood action movie, not in a noir Scandinavian procedural.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|I actually rented this for my 17 year old recently when he stayed home &#34;sick&#34;. He had never seen it and I thought it was fitting. I made him watch it before he could watch anything else on his &#34;sick&#34; day. &#34;Anyone?.... Anyone?.... Bueller??&#34;
0399160450|5.0|clancy's books are always good. these are the kind of books that you don't want to end even though they are 800 pages long!!!
B0041OOEJY|5.0|Great family fun movie. We enjoyed this movie as a family. My kids really liked it. Even though this karate kid is learning kung foo!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|In my opinion it help out a lot!!! My kids nd I use it constantly and I like 2 know how much battery life is left as well as 2 check the temperature nd make sure if it needs a cool down!!! I would recommend it 2 the people I know :))
0307272702|5.0|I was a Home Economics major in college during the 70's...food pyramid and all.  Nutrition was a big focus in the program.  But this book, combined with the Wheat Belly have really opened my eyes to some pretty compelling research.  I began the program on November 5th and have lost 18 pounds.  My own doctor lost extensive weight following a low-carb approach.  Interestly he wouldn't volunteer this information until I brought up what I was trying.  I have been hypoglycemic for years, so I knew with all the increased weight it was only a matter of time before I was officially a Type II diabetic.  Since I did blood work at the beginning of the plan, I am looking forward to a follow-up visit in a couple of months.  So far, I am not having any luck with my own family in buying into the plan as they cannot imagine giving up the sweets and the breads.  Amazingly, I have had NO cravings for carbs or sweets, even through the holidays.  It's facinating.  The weight just slowly keeps dropping.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|I love buying movies from Amazon.  Great prices and fast shipping.  I am a big movie fan and buy whenever I can!  Awesome!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's simple and easy to use. Anyone can use it.<br />I enjoy using this app. It is what it is!
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Arrived in great shape. I will certainly use this person again and reccommend him to all my friends and family !!!!!!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really do love the Holy Bible, it is such a blessing to me. I love to read the Holy Bible.
B004XGN8W4|2.0|I was very excited to get this device. When I got it i was very happy to open it and I have only used it twice, BUT each time I have used it the screen takes 20 minutes to turn on (actual time I had a timer) and the second time i used it it completely broke. the sound cut off(and it makes this loud annoying noise) and while I was in the middle of playing the screen kept powering on and off. I am very disappointed in this device, it also did not meet the screen quality in my opinion. This was a HUGE disappointment to me. This thing was far off from what was promised the only thing it's good for is a case for my ps3. maybe carrying around a monitor is more ideal than this faulty device.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|After reading that Patrick Stewart reads &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; every year, I felt that it was a tradition that I could join in.  So, for the past 7 years, I have done so.  This is the first year that I had a Kindle, and so I tried it on that format.<br /><br />The book reads just as well, and the illustrations are just what I want.  I enjoy reading it in landscape mode on the Fire over portrait.
1451638450|5.0|Another great novel by Bujold. I always love everything she writes. Glad to see Vopatril get his own novel.<br />Just great!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i love this app i use it to get up in the morning and for my  meditations . i like that you can set your own music as an alarm.
B009CMZAES|5.0|Not usually a big sci-fi fan and almost didn't buy this book because of it's format(5 short books), but I'm glad I did because this book was great. I thought it was great writing, great characters, and great plot that just kept getting better. Can't wait to check out some more of his work
B0041KVW2K|1.0|This box set is mastered from the digital tapes that produced the 2009 CDs. Therefore there is no sonic advantage to the vinyl in this instance. The vinyl only adds surface noise, cross-talk and linear-speed degradation to the digitally mastered sound. This set may be worthwhile for the packaging if you are one who doesn't have the original LPs or want an additional book on the Beatles. For those who want analog sound in a box set of Beatles LPs, I highly recommend the half speed mastered, fully analog MFSL box set. It was released in the '80's and goes for a couple hundred more than this one on Ebay.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I thought that everything was wrapped up nicely in this book, and will definitely be reading the next one even if it's 300 years later.
B0017YZIL4|4.0|A fine recording of the outstanding talent of Wes Montgomery. His music will make a fine addition to your music library.
B005PK553C|5.0|If you follow this then you love this.  Self explanatory.  If you don't follow it is an inexpensive way to see if you like it.  Try first season.  Story 1.  The next season has many of the same actors and actresses but in a completely different story and setting.  Gory doesn't even say it.  Not for the squeamish.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I never thought I wanted a clock for the Kindle, so I downloaded the free version to see what it offered.  Liked it so much I went ahead and downloaded the pro version. so far I'm glad I did.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I liked the CD then loved it after seeing him in concert. Pop with a bit of jazzy fun. Butterfly gets me in the mood.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|My sister is a huge \\"Walking Dead\\" fan and this was a huge hit to start her collection.i believe this was one of Amazon's lightning deals they run in December. Super fun and easy purchase.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I would recommend it. The cd was sold for more money at his concert. He played every song on this cd.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|I get the feeling that the band is looking for solid ground, and after buying Last of a Dying Breed, I think they may have found it.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This is Steve McQueen at his best!!! Rugged yet refined! Steve McQueen is the coolest actor superstar ever!!! Greatest Actor ever!!!
B008AWBQGW|5.0|The title pretty much sums it up.  All of us &#34;old line&#34; R'nR's are going fast.  Maybe it was the lifestyle, or maybe we just worked too damned hard for our country, either way, we're falling by the wayside in droves.  I seem to have the peculiar position of observer and participator at one and the same time.  Try to imagine my pain.  You can't.<br />Nonetheless, Skynyrd has done very well with this release, even positing that there's only one original member present.  The guitar work is almost flawless, and the lyricist is on the right track to extend the band's continuance.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Not typical Michael Connolly.  Like his books much better and even liked some<br />Of his other short story collections better
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love the \\"dash\\" games.  always a lot of fun! I find that doing a lot of different tasks nearly simultaneously is really a challenge.

B0063GORYU|5.0|love spider solitaire. it's very addictive. only complaint is that the game doesn't end when there are no more moves.

0446554995|1.0|I'm 1/2 way through this one and I don't know if I'll finish it. What is with these authors making their characters more and more unreal and the plot lines just completely unrealistic? I used to like the Pendergast story line but now, I don't know. People coming back from the dead? cross country drives that beat planes? new kids popping out of the woodwork? self induced hyposis to talk to your dead wife? 200 year old woman? It's like the Patricia Cornwall syndrome: &#34;I've run out of ideas but I want to keep the characters alive. So, I'll just make the stories crazier, the &#34;special effects&#34; crazier, the people into super humans.&#34; In all honesty, I just gloss over the descriptions of the &#34;beautiful, wealthy beyond belief things...and the super necho gadgets..and the descriptions of the people and their abilities that are just so unrealistic. Just give me your murder mystery..do some police work..have some gore and whackiness..but please please please give the stories some aspect that is real. If you don't, I'll never buy one of your books again...just like I had to do with the Patricia Cornwall series..never again. Thank you

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this story... the characters are flawed and trying so hard to be happy and heal themselves. It shows that if you truly want a relationship to work, you have to be willing to give everything...

B000FBJHT4|5.0|After reading Philip Corso's report on Roswell, I am a believer.  It makes sense that so many of our newest &#34;inventions&#34; came from alien technology.  If you doubt this, then read this book.

B00881VLCE|3.0|It's not a major challenge.  Good for kids, but not any sort of challenge for adults.  I'll keep for now.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Don't kid yourself. As in any profession where excellence is expected, its hard, physical and stressful work cranking out those 4-star meals for $100-a-plate. Book is a little rough with language and if you don't like reading about folks having sex in various locations within the kitchen, maybe you should skip this.<br /><br />Book is funny, sad and insightful about managing people, as the author works his way up the ranks in gourmet kitchens to where he runs his own restaurant.<br /><br />I always knew being a waiter was very hard work, but I have a new respect for those in the kitchen.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I always wondered why so many baseball traditionalists argued against the success of the Oakland A's, and now I know.  In quality management, we call it, \\"Not invented here!\\"
B000HAB4KS|2.0|To be fair to this movie, I have changed over the months. I now find watch shoot-em'-up stuff to be very unpleasant. As a seriously religious person I am totally turned-off by fake religion/magic events. I was told this was a great movie, and before becoming sensitive to violence, I might have liked it. Too much reliance on special effects/violence and magic for my taste.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|We love the Supernatural series. Season 7 is GREAT! We have watched it many times and can't wait for season 8 to be available for purchase. Just wished I had waited one more day to order as I would have saved myself $20 of the original purchase price.

B004KBSQBA|5.0|An old favorite album repurchased to load on my electronic equipment.  Replaced an old tape!  If you like Paul Simon with an African beat, this is a great choice.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|I had heard good things about this movie and was interested in watching it. It was way more intense than I expected and I enjoyed the suspense. The ending provided a good twist.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm not surprised that George Lucas let u make this. The old man wouldn't even care about it. The new features and stuff are cool but it will need more levels  and worlds from the movies. Here's a suggestion that might help you get more 5-star ratings for this game: this time, make a Imperial Star Destroyer-themed world, with new features and birds.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|What can I say, it charges the kindle. It works does what it is supposed to do. This should be with the Kindle when purchased, you have to buy it separate.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|this is  one of her best CD. I listen to this CD a lot in my truck and kindle fire
1451695195|4.0|The book is awesome, but not enough details of his journey and leaves many questions unanswered.  I guess he will be writing a series of books on this and that is why it not all here.

B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Was a action packed movie, kept you watching all the time, showed a little about the drug world along the way
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was to graft for me. I dont like all the sex things. Only if you can handle this over sex things would I recommend reading
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|lots of action I like these types of movies that keep you interested, a little corny in spots but what the heck a fun watch
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I didnt like this book because of killing the children off. I did not read anymore of them. Would not recommend it was to real for me.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I loved Gone Girl so wanted to go back and read more of her novels.  I was reading this as the shooting at Sandy Hook occurred and I found myself unable to stomach the horror of little children being murdered.  I still wanted to know what happened and I ended up skimming a good fourth of the book to find out &#34;who done it&#34;...especially the pages with the character Diondra who was so unlikeable I had a hard time reading any scenes she was involved in (which is not normal for me).  It turned out to be an interesting ending, one I had not figured out and if you enjoyed Gone Girl you will probably like this one also.  I think after the tragedy at Newtown my sensibilities have changed and I won't be reading any more novels that involve the death of such little children, especially in such a gruesome manner.
B000YDCG5A|5.0|Soft leather that caresses the foot like a favorite pair of boots you've been wearing for years.<br />Even if Timberland had not made this commitment to Green manufacturing and packaging, I'd love these, but the highly ecologic production of this fine product endears them to me all the more.<br />I have rarely experienced this much comfort in a boot like this, which accommodated my 4E/5E feet well: I did add my own orthotic foot bed to fine tune the fit. Now, I could wear these every day!
B00722ZHG6|5.0|I've only bought 2 CD's this year and this is one.  The other was Snow Patrol.  I heard her by accident on youtube and loved her voice.  Very soulful for such a young person.
1449410243|3.0|I picked this up expressly for the new material that the author/artist said was inside. While there wasn't a whole lot of that, I do admit that the ones I'd seen online and thought were hilarious are still just as funny in book form and the ones that I was lukewarm about on the website I'm still not wild about. I think the next time around, I'll just revisit my favorites on the website should they still be available.
B003VANOFY|5.0|My 14 year old son will not take these off!  We went through three sets of Radio Shack headphones, before deciding on these.  The built in mic works like a charm, and the other features such as hot keys, and voices are a nice touch.  My son says they are very comfortable, and the sound is fantastic.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game for everyone in the whole family. can be played by all ages as long as you can read. will enjoy for hours and hours
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Quite simply, if you are a fan of LES MIS (the original show or the movie for that matter), this recording is woefully truncated. Even as a \\"highlights\\" recording, it's a scant 60 minutes that leaves out another 100 minutes of the film. Worth a few listens, but I hope that a complete recording will be released.
B0016BWACI|5.0|This is a movie from my childhood that I have loved from the first time I saw it. One of my favorites
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read most of the Jack Reacher series.  Some were more engrossing than others; but this one had me from the beginning and I couldn't put it down.  If a book doesn't grab me right from the beginning I loose interest.  I love when I can't figure out who the bad guy is.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I'm with you. its too short and I didn't get to do anything at all practically.  good game for such a short demo I would recemend for a good game get minecraft pe instead

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Prequels:<br />Phantom Menace: 1/10<br />Attack of the Clones: 1/10<br />Revenge of the Sith: 1/10<br /><br />These three films are the absolute bane of my existence. They are horrible in every conceivable way and even if you like them, you don't. I'm sorry, you just don't.<br /><br />Real Movies:<br />Star Wars: 10/10<br />Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back: 10/10<br />Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi: 10/10<br /><br />Even with the cuts, edits, and the terrible CG that Lucas attempts to pass off on us, this is still one of the best stories ever told and well-deserving of repeated viewings.<br /><br />Quality of Product: 5/10 (The edits and cuts Lucas made to his own films is unforgivable and he should be ashamed of himself for nearly ruining a perfect trilogy as well as making an already terrible trilogy worse)<br />Quality of Prequels: 1/10 (terrible, dreadful movies that you should avoid and skip if you buy this product)<br />Quality of Real trilogy: 10/10 (amazing, but the edits and cuts do get on my nerves a lot)<br /><br />Overall score: 6/10<br />A passable buy but for the price, I'd just skip it and buy the films separate from each-other.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really liked the storyline and premise.  I normally like suspenseful books better but this was a great read and I enjoyed it a lot. Might even save it to read again.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|When I say \\"kind of questionable\\" all I mean is the audio (much like all DVDs) sucks. It's quiet and no it's not my television  set. I've tried it on every TV I own and my laptop (with headphones on) and the problem persists to this day.<br /><br />However that's a minor issue and can be easily overlooked when reviewing a masterpiece such as Terminator 2. It's a perfect mix of action and philosophy and to this day absolutely amazes me. One of my all-time favorite films period and in my opinion one of the best ever made as well.<br /><br />Quality of Product: 9/10 (the low audio quality kind of detracts a bit, but it's over-all great)<br />Quality of film: 10/10 (One of the few films I can genuinely call perfect)
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I have always loved Shinedown and they  never disappoint.  Keep it up!  I will look forward to their  next effort.

B005NPD2I4|4.0|I find their music to be very thought provoking at times and I really like a lot of their songs.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I decided to order this to complete a collection of the book series and Katness Doll as a collectable to go with the books. Thinking about getting others since she was so nice ...she will not be taken out of the package
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|while it's obviously a collaboration and not entirely a Clancy original, the Ryanverse deserves to continue on and this one was good enough to keep me waiting for the next
B008FIHUDO|4.0|I have not been familiar with Ms Lavettes music mainly because i am not a big blues fan. After watching an interview on Tavis Smileys show i decided to check it out. I also purchased her book which i have not read yet. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i was drawn in. Every song sounds so personal and real. My favorites are I'm tired and a woman like me. I would like very much to some of her older recordings. I just don't know where to start. She has a new fan in me.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game is horrible. i dont know how to move around. why is playing time so short. i hate it. the animals look weird. GET MINECRAFT BECAUSE ITS SOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Honestly, I'm not sure how there can be so many sequels to the first one. The acting is so terrible, you might think this style more suited for a long music video than a movie. Everyone is so corny cool. People fire guns without squinting, they get tossed around in rain/snow and their hair is perfect, no sweat .. the stuff that makes you believe someone went through stress/strain. The ridiculous wide leg stance/posture of the actresses, the corny lines the guys had. And did I mention the 'acting-in-bottle' acting? I guess Hollywood is milking it for its worth. Glad I didn't pay movie prices to see this.. maybe movie directors will get the message if theaters are empty when they show us this crap.
1452110581|5.0|This book is funny even if you don't own a cat, but if you do, every page hits home in a very funny way. I've sent this as a gift to my cat lover friends and relatives and they all love it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is no well developed story line, but even beyond that the grammar errors are too many to count!  Basic pronouns usage is wrong over and over again.  I can't believe I wasted any time or money on these books.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|I really enjoyed the action graphics.  Good story good acting and overall enjoyable.  Maybe better than the original.  I felt it was more clear in what was real what was not.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book may be one of Grisham's best.  It has totally unforeseen twists and is most artfully constructed.  A real page turner!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|It is nice knows that someone tells you his own experience in such way you will avoid his mistakes and have more chances to become author! tahnk you John for everything you have made available to us all. I stronghly suggest to buy it !!! M.R. (aldentekitchen)

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book offered a very interesting angle from the dog's perspective. You felt the love and anguish of the dog and the humans. A few funny parts too!

B001EN71CW|5.0|Others have reviewed this series, it's plot, and it's writing, very articulately and I can think of nothing to add to their praise. In deed Firefly is like a geode, open it and you'll find something beautiful and amazing inside!<br /><br />This review is about the Blu-ray version. Some have said the quality isn't what they were expecting. I beg to differ, I have the DVD set and I'm glad I upgraded to the Blu-ray set. The video quality is superior to that of the DVD and I like the added bonus features.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Firefly, I think it's definitely a worthwhile upgrade.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|An excellent film!! I love the casting, the filming too, and the story is touching. Ewan McGregor is a favorite.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|The FLASH is good but I am giving one star less because of the misleading \\"Frequently Bought Together\\" section. I read that section and bought the \\"EasyFoto Flash Diffuser Cap Box for Nikon SB700\\"  thinking that the Flash would come without it. I was wrong. The flash comes with the Diffuser Caps. So don't buy them. I cannot return it either since it cost more for me to ship them back :-(. I just wasted some $$$ on it. :-(.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This was an interesting take on the Red Riding Hood story but they will never come close to the shock I got when I was a kid and saw a Red Riding Hood movie that got banned in the U.S.  RRH has been my icon for years.

B009186E3O|4.0|Packaging was very cool. The 10\\" vinyl was boring to me.  The soundtrack on cd was very good.  Loved the DVD.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Awesome product I love it! It Works great for me! Couldn't be happier! Can't live with out this! Thank You!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|My challenge with reading this was that it inspired me to get back running, but I couldn't put the book down long enough to get out running (in flat shoes).  A very cleverly woven series of tales on the history of running combined with good ideas on how to run without damaging your body.  As a 56 year old addicted to long runs, it was insightful.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|THIS IS A REALLY GOOD KIDS MOVIE! MY HUSBAND AND SON JUST LOVED IT! THIS IS TOTALLY A GUY MOVIE!

B004X80QNG|3.0|I really like this app but the tablet view does not work properly for my Galaxy note 2. I keep waiting for the upgrade that will fix it. The top menu buttons don't work and I cannot see the name of  months.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game has great graphics and is easy to control it is in my opinion the best free game on the app store
0763644765|5.0|Well we all know that toddlers have potty mouth.  My toddler started this book when he was one, and he loved it then.  Now at the ripe age of three and a half, a fully potty trained for a year, this book remains one of his favorites.  He was originally attracted to the gallery of underpants, and he still loves it.  In fact the early toilet training was his idea.  Now he&#34;reads the book&#34; to his little brother, eight months.  He points out the riches of underpants in store for the potty trained.  Little brother seems interested.  Great book.
B0047S1KMS|4.0|If you like 'Big Brother' and zombies, this is the flick for you. I dinged it a star only because the zombies run.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was one of the best Clancy books....End to end thrills, it did not stop. I look forward to the next one
B006C1DH92|5.0|My 5 and 8 year old love this game. It's very challenging, funny and awesome (quoting my kids). The price is right too.

B004132HZS|3.0|I recently purchased season 1 and 2 from Amazon, while I have nothing bad to write about the DVDs themselves I was disappointing with the packaging. Season two came with a DVD sleeve whereas season one did not. While this is not a big issue to most, it is a concern of mine because this was intended as a gift and with one having the sleeve and the other not it comes of as a bit tacky. Anyone else have similar issues? If my order was the dud of the bunch, I'll readjust my rating and take it up with Amazons packaging department.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|FAST AND RIGHT ON! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY .... IT'S A RUBBER CASE AND IT WAS PINK. JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE REQUIRED 16 WORDS

B001KX50BK|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for a family member.  This is her favorite movie so she was pleased with it.  It was delivered as promised in a timely manner.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|this has to be the best game and its my favorite i would take this over 4 but you cant listen to music whill playing. Like i can listen to pandora whill i play it would be nice if they made and update for this if or when they do this i will rate 5 stars.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Such a gift! after so many years lost, and I grew up in Detroit in 1968.<br />But we know now- Rodriguez! and I listen to Cold Fact often- have delighted folks<br />with cd as a gift and his story told in the movie that came out at Sundance is so good.<br />Grace...eloquence..tough. Poetry and sound: I will give it again and again.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|You can tell this is a film adaption. Yet because they did their signing live (Broadway Style), you get pure emotion. The songs are in different keys to accommodate the performers, and the key changes are brilliant!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|My son is 21 .Not a sap...requested this book in hardcopy for Christmas last year, Just bought kindle version for myself, A must have for all parents.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like to play this game however on some of the boards the blocks are to small for me. I know it is because of the higher level but they need to stay the same size. When it goes to small blocks it is harder to match.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|I can't get enough of Angelina and on the big screen in high def, it don't get any better. Wonderful!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Producto increible.<br />Excelentes tiempos de entrega (pedido el 8 de diciembre, llego a Bs As el 19 de diciembre :) )
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Watched this on blu-ray for the first time and it was mind blowing.  We are projecting it to 106&#34; and details are visible that just were not visible before.  A treat just looking for things you never saw before.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I really love this Case. It's perfect for every Kindle user and it's easy to put the Kindle inside the Cover - just one Click and you are done !<br />I love it that it is leather and it will last longer then a couple weeks :)<br />The case is absolutely worth the money!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|I liked it but it got boring all you do is hit a ball into some blocks and if you lose you have to start the whole game over.
B004GYY714|5.0|this is really great..... I dont recall if I paid for it or not.....but I use it often. I love that I can listen to music from all over the world, with a click.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|I didn't like this game on some of the levels there are like no ways to beat them, i don't think you should play this game
B0044XV3R8|5.0|El producto cumple con las expectativas que tenía.<br />Lástima que las entrevistas con Cameron no tienen subtítulos de español. Allí se plantean temas muy importantes para nuestra sociedad y el medioambiente.<br />Otra observación, la empresa de correo que realiza las entregas del material, es bastante irresponsable. Dejó el sobre con el producto tirado en el jardín, y por pura suerte (?) mi esposa lo retiró (cualquiera podría habérselo llevado). No sé si esto depende de ustedes, pero cuidado.<br />De todas formas, estoy muy satisfecho con este excelente trabajo y con Amazon. Valió la pena esperar unos días.<br />Gracias y saludos.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app it is like a puzzle to go and it doesn't take up space at home. Way more clean.
B008D37J6O|2.0|was able to decode wmv file, but could not play large hd video without very slow frame by frame... no where near normal speed.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is very fun. I still like angry birds better but this is a close runner up. You should get this game.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|But epic all the same!! :) I would definitely recommend watching it to any horror fan out there! Worth your time :) cannot wait for the next episode to get out!!! Again though, if you haven't already seen American Horror Story Season 1, go watch it as well!!!! They're unrelated so you can really watch in any order
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this alarm clock app everything work perfect with it. Its easy to read, easy to set and easy to turn off.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Having watched the entire American Horror Story Season 1 many times, I was doubtful that anything else could live up to the first season.  I was wrong as Season 2 is just as riviting and horrific.  This sets a new standard I hope for the foundation of the horror genre and I hope that it will inspire other movies/series to follow suite as all the same, mind numbing and cheap horror flicks that come out of hollywood these days that don't hold interest longer than 10 minutes.  The writers of this New Series I hope will continue in the same tradition of these first 2 seasons.  The cast is absolutely perfect and being a Long time fan of Jessica Lange, she is the show stealer of these episodes.  A truly unique horror experience full of mistique and spine chilling entertainment that you will not be disappointed in.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like the bubble popping games but this one was to much like all of the other ones I have played.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app is great. I used it to scan some receipts for some rebate offers. Worked perfectly. I am definitely glad I downloaded the app.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game i play it on my kindle all the time. It is challenging but fun all at the same time.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really awesome.I recommend this game to everyone it really keeps you going and keeps you away from being bored all of the time!!
B004GVUPFE|3.0|I think that it was alright for older kids but its kind of hard after a while. you may or may not like it
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Hornblower for grownups; not everyone will enjoy the technical descriptions, but the rest is so wonderful.  I am rereading the whole series and again marveling at the quality of the writing.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|It&#34;s fine but its just like all the other restaurant games but just hello kitty. Little kids may like it.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Great series and I cannot wait for S6. In this season Don gets his life under control but I am sure it will not last.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|I was fun when you first start but then it starts getting to hard then you don't want to play it.
B00A2IUHM6|3.0|A few gigles but lame.  The movie is preditable and you will like Ted bit the endeding is like every Hollywood movie
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I didn't like this game it is kind of hard to control and boring you have to you real money to get more race tracks and stuff.
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|This movie is fantastic movie and lots of fun.  If you understand the 80's and Los Angeles you will love this movie.  If you are unfamilar with the 80's music scene you might get board.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved it until one day i was playing and i said unexpected shut down and then i tried to play it and i doesn't work any more.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Such attention to detail. Great read. I felt that sometimes too much description made the book slow to read, but other than that it was great.
B009ZE27US|5.0|This app is very funny it usually say the wrong age but it's funny. You should try it out for yourself though.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|The story of the Joad family is compelling and important. As the Joad family are 'tractored off' the land they had owned, this depression era story could well be relevant today. It is a story I was assigned to read during my school years. I doubt I finished it. It is not a happy story. I am glad to recommend it today.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I didn't like how they give you a limited amount of bubbles to throw. I like most of the other bubble games better.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|We live in an area where we don't have access to high speed internet. This makes downloading content to my Kindle so much easier. I really wish the Kindle Fire had come with this accessory, though, instead of having to purchase it separately.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Timeless classic. Entertaining. One of the best &#34;Christmas Carol&#34; movies ever.  Made me want to hug my grown up kids all over again?
B00846REIS|5.0|I saw on pinterest if you liked 50 shades of grey you'd like this book.. I loved it! I enjoyed it more I think. It was very comparable to 50 shades but this one was less violent and not as dark.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It is nice to own a copy of this classic movie without being forced to watch it in black & white.  The colored version is very vivid and helps to bring out a lot of detail that is missed in the original version.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I will leave on my kindle for ever to read it over and over and over again.
B004EPZ034|3.0|It was ok. The dancing scene was a bit risqué for being a rated g movie though. I'd give it 3 stars
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great clock app for my kindle hd. Now I can quit using my phone to wake me up for flights, etc. And the white noise generator is nice to fall asleep with.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this is a great book. I have been a little dissapointed in his book latley but this brings back all of the intensity I have loved about reading John Grishams books in the past.

B004OO4UFY|4.0|A couple of the songs on this Album I had already heard, so it just seem natural that I listen the the whole thing. Wow! The lead singer's voice is sooo masculine, Like James Brown and Steve Winwood had a baby. It's raw and smoky at the same time, like a shot of good Scotch; and the band is tight and funky. It is like they studied the Sixties and Seventies funk scene and decided to move it to the 21st Century.
B000001EGA|5.0|el producto llego muy bien y muy rapido.realmente esta en codicion de exelente.se recomienda al vendedor.saludos a todos los fanaticcos de la buena musica ,la de antes

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Anyone who's even somewhat fluent in Beatle history knows that if it wasn't for Paul McCartney, \\"Abbey Road\\" wouldn't exist. Of course, that sentiment could apply to every Beatles album from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" onward, but that's another essay altogether, including many debates. So, I won't go there. This little ditty I'm writing today is only for \\"Abbey Road\\", the Beatles last album.<br />First, let's clarify one thing for those still not in-the-know: \\"Abbey Road\\" was the last recorded piece of work from the Fab Four. \\"Let It Be\\", released AFTER \\"Abbey Road\\", was recorded BEFORE \\"Abbey Road\\". But \\"Let It Be\\" was recorded during a very tumultuous time and the band shelved it and decided to go back to the drawing board and try it again, resulting in \\"Abbey Road\\". The following year, it was decided that something needed to be done with the \\"Let It Be\\" tapes and an album was released. So, although \\"Let It Be\\" was the last album released by the Beatles, \\"Abbey Road\\" was actually the last album they made.<br />Be that as it may, \\"Abbey Road\\" does preserve the myth of the band, since it was McCartney's want and brainchild, buffered by the other three's two cents. According to most sources, Lennon doesn't even play on a lot of the tracks. But the album as a whole was, and still is, presented as a band effort, and as such, it shines. I can forgive the illusional thread of total band involvement simply because I, too, like McCartney, want the Fab Four to go out \\"with a bang\\".<br />All details aside, the album is an astounding achievement for a band that was literally disentergrating. It's testament to the fact that they were, and still are, the greatest band there ever was.
B00005LSU7|5.0|muchas gracias por el disco esta en exelentes condiciones.se recomienda este vendedor.el disco llego muy rapido y como dije antes exelente.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Overall - book is very good. This is more of a &#34;fun&#34; read as it leaves major details out in order to propel the plot along in a certain, unrealistic way. For example, there are a lot of different species of drone and there are quite a few of them;however, we never see the group of people who have labored to bring them to life and who control them. We are the bad guys? It's no fun having heros without the bad guys! The drones can't be the bad guys - we need a Dr. evil and there isn't one. I guess these little buggers just crawled out of the primordial ooze with pheromones and circuit boards!<br /><br />Fun read - just be sure to not challenge it!!
B00005B36H|5.0|hola soy hernan de argentina , quiero decir que el producto que compre es exelente . llego muy rapido y muy bien embalado .se recomienda
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wonderful show...hard to see some of the favorite characters from season 1 slowly disappearing however...that is what happens when zombies rule the land.
B000VVTHSO|3.0|para mi forma de ver y comparando con otros discos este no esta en condicion de very good ,sino de good.la tapa esta un poco vieja  y el disco tiene bastante fritura.
B004EKCNMA|1.0|We rented this on Redbox and the movie skipped...through the whole movie, but it wasn't scratched or visibly damaged in any way.  Then my boyfriend bought it for my kids for Christmas...the brand new one skipped in the exact same way - also not scratched or damaged in any way.  Is it possible that Disney had a problem with production???  My kids are really disappointed...AGAIN!  I would not buy another one until they recall all the bad lots.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|the characters were strong.  Each held a very important role.  Wonderful story.  Gave me an insight into a strange a mystical country
B009ZE27US|3.0|I mean its for fun ... its not really being serious. WARNING: you do have to be somewhat mature to get this. it obviously doesn't tell the truth I mean its a game. If you are super sensitive ... I wouldn't buy it! good luck to all!!! remamber its for fun:)
B008476HBM|4.0|I love the old classics and this is one of them. It also downloaded easily to my new windows 8 kindle from the apps store.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It has taken the place of Solitaire as my go to game of choice.  I still don't undertand all the rules, but who cares.  Matching up those little tiles is all you need to know.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This is more of Webber's wonderful work!! I need to watch in 2 sessions.<br />I couldn't even dream of what might happen in Act 2.<br />I don't think I'll live long enough to read the book this<br />was taken from..
B0071FBARY|5.0|If you love The Fray like I do, you'll love this album. Absolutely perfect. I play it on repeat all the time and it never gets old.
B0086213XW|5.0|I was a little skeptical about watching this movie based on the negative reviews but I'm glad I chose it. This movie is appropriate for those who can appreciate the realism depicted by displaying scenes where an insightful person can grasp its meaning. The writing, filming and characters are genius. This is not a movie that screams at you, instead its one that promotes thought.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I really l liked the original, having read all the Asimov robot books.  I thought the entire movie was well done, and it benefits greatly from the 3d treatment.  I didn't take time to note the specific 3D effects, but felt that it added well to the experience of the movie.
B009POCFTG|5.0|Killer Joe is a film that some will find to be too offensive and sleazy while others like myself will find it to be brilliant and daring filmmaking of the highest order. It's truly not a film for everybody as it goes to some truly dark and depraved territory particularly in the insane third act. The cast is amazing, William Friedkin directs the heck of it and Tracy Lett's dialogue (who adapted his play of the same name) just sparkles with trailer trash ingenuity and also hilarity at multiple points. I also wasn't prepared for how darkly comic the film was even as it goes further off the rails in terms of overall depravity as the film goes along to a truly crazy climax which involves a twisted act that was solely responsible for the film's theatrical NC-17 rating (which I don't agree with, but the MPAA has proven time and time again that they hate independent films). Matthew McConaughey has never been better. Highly recommended!
B005BCE7II|3.0|The movie moves so S L O W ( as in GLACIAL).  I don't really  see how it will keep young kids watching, and they are supposedly it's target audience, I bought it as a 3d, and I still enjoy kids movies, but this one I'll have to save for a day when there just isn't anything better to watch.  I didn't make it all the way through before I pulled the plug and put on something a bit perkier.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Okay movie to watch on a rainy Sunday. Definitively not an Oscar winning production or worth watching a second time.
B008Y1YJZY|4.0|Enjoyed this holiday themed movie reasonably well.  Bought it for the season and the 3D.  It worked fairly well for both.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Works great!<br />The worst part of my Magic Mouse has completely gone with this Magic Charger.<br />Replacing new batteries used to be a quite tedious job for me even though I'm using rechargeable batteries for Magic Mouse.<br />Magic Charger works just fine and quite easy to use. Replace the battery part on the back of Magic Mouse and connect the induction base to USB socket.<br />Only thing I may wish for the next version of this product would be the precise battery recharge indicator.<br />Although LED indicates whether it is recharging or fully recharged with the green light. But cannot find out how much exactly charged. Showing it by three or five LED lights would be much better~<br />Anyway, for now, it's a great product if you're a user of Apple Magic Mouse.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I enjoy reading military books but many of them cover the same ground. This one truly stands out because of the humanity of Adam Brown. His life story would make a terrific Hollywood movie except that it doesn't feature the typical happy Hollywood ending.<br /><br />Adam Brown's story is one that many men can relate to. He was a good guy who cared deeply about others and wanted to make a difference in this world. He also had a dark side that he had to do battle with constantly in order to prevent his story from becoming a total tragedy. His discovery and development of his relationship with God was poignant because it shows how faith doesn't make our problems go away but offers a meaningful and effective way to navigate them.<br /><br />The ending of Adam's story, while sad, is also incredibly inspiring because of the impact he made on so many. To see how his friends, family and fellow soldiers responded was a true testimony to a life well lived. This is a book that both of my sons will read because I want them to learn from Adam's example of selflessness and sacrifice. Living that way isn't easy but it leaves a legacy which is well worth the effort!
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|Love Amazon and the digital products. But this HD streaming movie wouldn't stream in HD for the life of me, my high-speed Internet or my Xbox-360. I even reset everything, and speed-tested (20MB+ to the device) but only get a grainy SD version of this otherwise great holiday film. I wound up abandoning watching it on Amazon Instant and using another vendor.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I must respectfully disagree heartily with those, whose reviews state that Books Four and Five move too slowly and don't move the story forward.  As a writer myself, I can tell you that sometimes, with a work of this scope and breadth, the story must move laterally before it can move forward or the quality will suffer.  Obviously, the author does not intend his work with this series to be a succession of quick, shallow, A-to-B-to-C-to-D-to-E, slam-dunk-you're-done novels.  Any writer can do that.  But with a work of this scope, it's important (and I think very fascinating) to know how the characters each got from C to---let's call the final book F, which I am assuming will be the grand finale.  This series is epic and so well done that each time I put a book down, I have a hard time returning to reality for a few moments.  If you aren't, you're missing the whole point of a work like this.<br /><br />The excellent quality of the author's writing, alone, makes Books Four and Five WELL worth reading.  And they are quite necessary to the work as a whole.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Better than I expected on an Adult level. It was actually a moive you could let you small children watch. .
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book I really loved. Easy to get into. Though it's a spiritual book, I would not say it is necessarily about religion - though others might. I enjoyed the symbolism and found it meaningful for me. Can't wait to see the movie now.
0061537969|1.0|I am a pet lover and I heard from a few people this book was a \\"must read\\".  I was thoroughly disappointed!  I am a pet lover, but stories that are told from the dog's point of view, I think are dumb and a waste of time to read.  I cry at movies and sad books.  I did not shed one tear and could not wait to finish this book so I could send it to someone else on my swap list.<br />My expectations are so high, when there is hype. Yet, again...I am let down.  Waste of time reading this book.
B004IYISSK|5.0|I got a little confused keeping track of which mother was whose, but overall I enjoyed the book. Not so different really than non-Chinese mother/daughter issues, so I could relate to it.
B004IKNB5Y|5.0|Although I had to return the item, it was well packed and delivered in a very quick manner. This was to be a gift for a friend who does not have this CD. There is no doubt that the delivery service smashed the package resulting in the jewel box arriving with a crack across the front. Not good for a gift.<br /><br />Would buy from this seller again as the return was painless and the customer service was top notch. A very honest seller.<br /><br />James
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Great movie for the whole family to sit and enjoy! More suited to teens than little ones. Emma stone is a fantastic actor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bought this book based on reviews online and found it to be as good as reported. Excellent ability to evoke imagery of the silos these colonies were living in and plenty of suprises to keep you reading. Liked character development but found the character of Lukas to be somewhat immature for counterpart to jules. Overall though excellent story and well worth the cost.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Kind of a dumb movie. Some silly funny parts but over all not worth spending your money on. I can usually watch anything with Markey Mark..  But this even made him seem lame.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It wasn't the worst movie I have seen. I think that the franchise should have been killed off before this movie. Tommy Lee just wasn't into it. The sight gags were getting tiresome, as is Smith's performances. Hopefully, there won't be another installment of MIB.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I won't be able to spoil the ending of this turd for anyone.. Had to shut it off 3/4 of the way through. Embarrassingly awful.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|A lot of people liked the movie, so my opinions are only that...opinions.<br />I am over 50, and I grew up with the old school superheros, so the whole &#34;dark&#34; thing is a little different than what I'm used to.<br />The first installments of the Dark Knight were pretty good. This movie however, was way too slow for me. Too much back-story and not enough action.<br />And with all the back-story, there were still some elements that weren't explained at all.<br />Over all, not a movie I would want to see again.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie for the family. I also gave a copy to my friend's 5 year old. I think she liked it.
B009DA74ES|5.0|I almost decided against buying this season because of the critical reviews on here...  then I realized I could buy an episode to stream and see what I thought.  I ended up buying them all!  This season is great!  I just love it!  The relationships between characters are some of the most real, riveting, challenging, honest, surprising, and keenly observed I've ever seen!  Duchovny delivers his unparallelled and constantly revelatory performance as Hank with all the skill and timing of a master.  The supporting characters are the punctuation that breathe infinite life into the story line.  Bravo!
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|As with all Mitch Alboms books.........this is a gem. It requires a person to think outside the box,<br />and also to consider another aspect of yourself and your values.<br />I would recommend this book to people, who like a bit of a fairytale aspect, and to people who like to<br />think what if???.<br />For me it was an easy read, and a chance to escape into the world of the book.
B0086449YA|5.0|While it is a shame that this product isn't being released in the U.S., getting it through Amazon eased the acquisition.  Buy this if you enjoy the U.K. folk influenced style of music that Knopfler has been playing since his dire straits days.  I saw Knopfler on his recent tour with Bob Dylan and his show exceeded expectations.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|I'm on holidays so managed to read this in just two sittings. Bosch is still doing what he does best, solving murders and doing it in spite of the system he works in. The case to be solved was woven in such a way that it took me a while to work out where it was going and how all the clues fit the puzzle which is the how the best murder mystery books are written.
B009EEKPWQ|5.0|I love this movie.  It is hysterical yet poignant.  Anyone who goes to college believes they are going to get the education, the degree, and land that perfect job where everyone gets along.  And, then, each person must pay their dues.  Dues, in this sense, means you have a hellacious demon for a boss.  Add in some very dry humor, outlandish situations (that are fact-based!), and you have a very good film.<br /><br />After watching this film, watch &#34;The September Issue,&#34; either on Amazon Prime or Netflix.  It's an actual look at Anna Wintour and her crew.  You'll find yourself noticing how some things haven't changed between the time the book was written and the actual true story.
B0061S073A|5.0|great app! don't know what I did before I got it. keeps my kids in their apps, and wont let them buy anything! its a big help.
B008Y70LJ6|5.0|I gave this movie 5-stars for several reasons:  The plot, the score, the performances, and the direction.  I have seen this film many times, and each time I find myself mesmerized by the performances.  Amy Adams conveys the naive and innocent Sister James perfectly--bright-eyed, innocent, and only wanting to see the best in everyone.  Meryl Streep is hell-bent (literally) on proving her point and keeping control of the school she is principal.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of the priest is spot-on:  Is he a manipulator?  Does he really want the best for the children or is he furthering an agenda?  You can watch the movie several times, and you'll still have doubts about certain aspects.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Sacha Baron Cohen is quite talented.  I really didn't like his first movie and don't know what motivated me to buy this one but I'm glad I did.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I didn't think I would like it. turns out that I like it. try it you magnitude think that you will like it
B009JBZH54|5.0|I can say this, I have never purposely seen any movie more than once in the theatre.  Until this trilogy!  Nolan did an amazing job and the actors (RIP Keith) preformed some of the  best acting ever to grace the screen.  Wasn't crazy about the leading lady swap but what can u do.  Great value when buying bundle.  The book that comes along with it is cool as well.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This was a very good Cd, Rod Stewart is one of my favorite singersHave seen him in person have a large collection of his
B004UID2LC|2.0|Used to work properly, but now it doesn't respond. It says I need better connection but I have been using the same as normal.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|this  show will lift your spirit and make your day, very funny ,  will make your day, nothing like agood laugh
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Read great reviews but it never seemed to pick up my body movements as well as the regular Kinect sensor.<br />I have a small living room with ceiling fan and only 7 ft. ceilings so I hope for more.<br />Went back to the reular Kinect sensor and just adjust.<br />Maybe others had better sucess.
B000BGH22W|1.0|i never get the item but was my fault i never reclame any about that so is ok for me
B001PPGAIK|4.0|I have this in non Blue Ray but the Blue Ray version is much prettier and better sound. Good job in upgrading it.
B000BEZQ18|1.0|i never get the item but i never reclaim so is my fault but is ok for me thank u
B005ARYDYC|5.0|I love the story and enjoy Kevin Bacon in this version.<br />The newer version  if great too and has some different stories in it and a great ending, but this is to me a classic.<br />Love it BLUE RAY  as the picture quality is great and sound blows you away.
B008I43DYU|1.0|The basic functions (add, subtract, multiply and divide) appear to function properly.<br /><br />The scientific functions, on the other hand, do not follow proper operator precedence.  In addition, depending on what order you execute them, you get different results.  For example, if you take the sine of 90 deg., the calculator properly returns an answer of 1.  If you immediately follow that with the cosine of 90, you properly get 0.  Take the sine of 90 again and this time, the calculator gives an answer of 0.<br /><br />There are more instances of this than I can recount but the basic takeaway is that for anything except the most basic operations, this calculator is essentially useless.  This applies to the Kindle Fire HD, and resetting the device did not help.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I always enjoyed this movie - saw it as a teen and this Blue Ray is so much nicer to watch and sound is much better.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie I rented was funny and enjoyable, and i loved the remixed songs. And the actors were great! I recommend this movie highly
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed the story very much.  I watched the movie first but was intrigued by the story so decided to read the book and was very satisfied
B001EN71CW|5.0|great series great price. I love this program and I'm happy to have it on blu ray.  wish it would have come with a few more extras but then it would have been more money
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Slammed and Point of  Retreat, I knew I had found my absolute favorite author.... this book only confirms that. It's amazing to a actually feel the emotions of the characters in the book. My stomach was in knots.... I laughed and I cried. Ah I'm sad it is over. I can't wait to read more of her books in the future!!! And I'm pretty sure Holder is my new book boyfriend!!
B00178JDCK|5.0|So, I got this as a gift for my boyfriend, he tried it out and told me that he loves it; that its a sound he was looking for.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Interesting story line leaves the reader trying to figure out what is going on In a ground hog day type scenario
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I enjoyed this film. There were not too many boring parts. The music is nice but not excessive. The actors are simple yet distinct.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The second book is just as good as the first ,they did a great job on the series ,I cannot wait until the movie.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|This film was not as funny as I was led to believe after talking to my friends. I wish there were more funny parts and less boring parts.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Everyone should know that Tom Sawyer is an American classic. Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer were the pinocle of Mark Twain's literature career. This is a must reading for all American children, no matter their background. It will help develop and understanding of the mid 1800s in America and the struggles and joys found then.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This film was largely boring. Nothing unique or new happened that has not been done in films before. The story was overly simplistic and did not feature enough detail to make the viewers care.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great plot with Pixars over the top animation! Audio 7.1 Dolby Digital True HD sounds incredible. Something to watch for the whole family.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Loved it! Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale were great in this retold, slightly revised, story of an old classic. Must see.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and self-deprecating humor! I love it when movies stars don't take themselves too seriously.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The movie was entertaining and had some really good CG in it.  Overall worth watching, with some references to the original.
076115678X|5.0|This book has been revised and updated with considerably more information and is a great read.  It's a lot of fun especially for those with curly hair with little/no idea how to take full advantage of that texture.<br /><br />The book begins with the Author's own bio and how she fought, then reconciled, then rejoiced in her own curls, starting the Devachon salon, which specializes in curly haired clients.  She then introduces the many different kinds of curls and how to determine which type of curl you have. While I found this interesting, I wasn't personally able to determine my own curl type, because some of the criteria overlap onto more than one curl type. However, the information is still helpful and entertaining.  Other chapters deal with hair styles for curly hair, general care and coloring of curly hair.  The updated book also includes a CD ROM disc which instructs how to cut one's own hair. These instructions are only applicable to someone with very long curly hair which can be pulled to the front of the face, those of us with shorter hair aren't able to see our hair to clip ends evenly. Frankly I would not recommend this to anyone since IMO success with curly hair is 95% all about the cut, which should be left to the care of a stylist experienced in cutting curly hair (and ladies, regardless of what they say, not all stylists can cut curly hair successfully )<br /><br />In summary, this is a fun and educational book which should leave curly girls far more knowledgeable about their curls, the care and holding their head up with pride.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Got this for my granddaughter for Hannukah and she was so happy ..we watched it together it was so much fun..
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Book gives message how to lead life greatly with simple techniques.<br />The seven spiritual laws each one has power over the other .
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game its free so there is a lot of things that pop up to get you to buy things. the game is more of a challenge if you don't buy anything.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This one had lower ratings than many of the other older Follett novels, but I really enjoyed it.  Typical Follett characters are the heroes... but this one's a little different.  The main character is the &#34;bad guy&#34; in this novel, and I liked getting that side of the story.<br /><br />I'll admit, it's not the BEST of the author's work, but it's definately and enjoyable read, and for such a good deal, it's worth it!
B003UESJEM|5.0|Great actors, and true to life. The quality of the dvd is great, and the delivery was as scheduled. Its a great movie to had to ones collection
B003B02PFO|4.0|Quick read, funny scenarios.  Someone recommended this to me after watching Christmas with the Kranks.  Surprising coming from John Grisham, but enjoyable and makes you remember the important parts of Christmas.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This is a fun game in a casino because there is money to win. But for a tablet game not much incentive to continue to play.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Have become an Outlander addict after a friend got me hooked.  As the other novels in this series, this one winds many small stories and differnet lives into one giant picture.  Several ends get tied up, cut loose, and tied up again in this one.  But it leaves you still wanting to read the next one!<br /><br />While this one was not my favorite (if the four total that I've read), it's still wonderfully written and entertaining.  I'm only giving 4 stars because I save 5's for the best of the best.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love that I learn so much history along with enjoying the fictional lives of the characters.  They should make this series into a movie.
1419705849|5.0|bought for grand daughter whom is 10 and she has a collection already and this is the new one she didn't  have and she was excited to have it she loves to read
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I like I like I like I like I like I like. Works good with my Bose, Sony and my turbine.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Straight and to the point. Pure Action! Jeremy Renner has been doing nothing but coming up as a GREAT actor!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved the flow of this book. The story contains devastating events that only strengthens the young main character. Holder and Sky are two of my favorite new characters!<br />This is the first book I have read from this author, but I am now adding her other books to my list! Hopeless is a must read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a blast!! too bad the free version doesn't have more coins but it IS an exercise in patience.
B001UE27X8|5.0|I just lllove it when new economical reissues of genius sessions turn out to sound better than 90s releases and are cheaper. Why live another moment before bringing this beauty of voice and piano into your home?
B008MEM24S|5.0|I absolutely love this game ! its very fun and addicting hays I have to take breaks from it wen j really get going.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Whitney's individual CDs  sold so much, you may already have all these songs in fine shape, still. But the selection is good, and timeless classic &#34;I Look to You&#34; re-cut with new R Kelly duet vocal is as moving as anything we ever heard from her. An account of pop perfection, inspire a young singer by gifting this along with Aretha Franklin's complete &#34;Amazing Grace.&#34;
B004FQX59I|5.0|One of the most significant films of all time. The film motivated the American public to stand up and demand answers. Oliver Stone's greatest achievement, in a long line of great works. An all star cast with Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, joe Pesce, Gary Oldman, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau and Sissy Spacek amongst others. A must see film for all!

0061714402|5.0|If you read this book, you will see who Dave Mustaine really is. You will see how much he's been through, and you will understand that Mustaine was more driven to succeed than most people will ever be. He was driven by his dark side. He was driven by revenge, and he could never attain the number 1 record he desperately craved. I'm shocked he was able to achieve what he did with all his drug use; I guess that's what genius is capable of. I haven't read a lot of fiction books, but I doubt you could make this stuff up no matter how hard you tried. If you decide to buy this book, you're in for a treat whether or not you've heard about the guy.<br /><br />If you've read about them on Wikipedia, have watched their interviews, and have watched their VH1 documentary, you may have a convoluted idea about the band's history. This book will fill many of the gaps left by unreliable sources. It will also give you fascinating information about Mustaine's early days and pictures of his path that you are unlikely to find anywhere else. There is, however, something I was hoping to find in the book that Mustaine has ignored. He only had good things to say about Cliff Burton. There was no way he was going to put anything bad on the guy, but from the lyrics of the song \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" and from a Metallica interview, I got the impression that Burton was the one that got Dave fired from the band. Mustaine doesn't mention, or even allude to this. He instead says that the song lyrics were based mostly on his relationship with Diana at the time, whereas the music was based on his feelings about Burton's death. I don't buy it, but then again, I don't have any proof that what I'm claiming is true either. He also barely mentions anything about his dabbling in black magic, leaving the reader wondering how big a part that had on his life and career.<br /><br />The whole book is Mustaine's story as seen from his current mindset. I think in a different world, he would eventually look back at the current period of his life and see it from an even clearer vantage point. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen. This may be morbid of me to say because I feel he's finally at peace with his past demons, and he certainly wouldn't agree with my assessment, but a guy like Dave Mustaine settling on Christianity is not something that should happen in an intelligent world. I am not saying Christianity is wrong. I'm not saying Christianity didn't do good for him. I saw him playing in Dubai, and seeing him uttering \\"Thank you, thank you, thank you\\" at the end of the show, with his eyes closed and his arms wide open, was a heartwarming sight. Clearly, he has defeated his demons, and is spiritually sound for the first time in his life. He even made peace with the guys in Metallica, so how could I think that it's a tragedy that Mustaine has become a Christian?<br /><br />It is because he now believes that everything that's happened to him is a result of a higher power. He says so in the book. Such an individual, who was self made, had to surpass agnozing obstacles growing up, was kicked out of Metallica, left in New York with no money and had to beg people for four days in order to eat, who built a band that sold millions of records and became world renowned, should know that it was not all as a result of a higher power. It wasn't all him either. Life definitely helped him out in some places, and threw him curve balls in others, but if it wasn't for Dave Mustaine being \\"driven (...), possessed in a way,\\" as his former road manager Scott Menzies said, you would have never heard of him. In a more intelligent world, Mustaine would look back at the last part of the book and might say:<br /><br />\\"Well, at the time I needed to surrender to something bigger than myself because I had no other options. It was either becoming a Christian, or losing my family and dying from my drug use. Many years have passed since then, and I now know that my success was a result ofboth me, Dave Mustaine, and some higher intelligence that we still can't adequately explain. You can call it God, but I don't like to put a label on it. It's more like an underlying force that governs the world without interfering. My success wasn't all on me, but if I wasn't who I was on the inside, you would have never heard of Dave Mustaine. I'd just be another guy working 9 to 5, selling insurance to make ends meet. Ha... I chuckle just thinking about that kind of life.\\"both me, Dave Mustaine, and some higher intelligence that we still can't adequately explain.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I played the first Persona 4 game on the PS2 and it was great. Golden is no exception. It has been improved and is an amazing game for the VITA. One of the best games that you must have on the system. Though the boss fights have gotten a little easier.....
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Frankly, I got bored during this movie. It is too long, and I was disappointed with<br />Christian Bale changing his voice when he &#34;became&#34; Batman. It passed the time, but<br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to someone unless they want to sit for almost 3 hours and take a nap.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app it. It is great and awesome. I give this five stars and 2000 million thumbs up :) wow

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Recommend reading - you are always wondering where the story will lead!  The storyline keeps you interested and involved - the characters are quite imaginative!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Seems cheaply made. The soundtrack sucks. The books aren't written extremely well but are more interesting. I still think its worth watching.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Fortunately there are none of the sound issues that others report, maybe I'm just lucky! What really seals it for me however is the price! I'm from the UK and on the amazon site there it costs a whopping £140 ($226!!). Even with international postage the US version is less than half the price.<br /><br />Look around before you buy!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|there really isnt much to say other than this is a bad movie and not very entertaining. Tom Crusi is basically wasted in this movie. However one redeeming quality is the songs. When they are singing it's great. When they start talking just fast forward.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun and a good time passer works relly good for the kindle fireif your 5 to 14  you will like it

B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Some of the songs so beautiful I was driven to tears (in public even). The singing voices were excellent and the word likewise moving. The movie itself may have some bad points but the music (especially the Song of the Lonely Mountain) does not. It would be even better had there been more vocal songs.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent. I don't think you could see the performance any better, unless you were onstage or in the first eight rows.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|It would be nice if the app would download it is really getting on my nerves. it is woo annoying
B005L38QHA|1.0|I had this mouse for about 2 months and it started screwing up. Now my laptop doesn't even recognize it and when it does it's for a short ti e.

B000SO7OL6|5.0|I found Diana on Pandora and Find her voice very soothing and relaxing,  She has me listening to Jazz now.
B005LAII3A|5.0|When Colin Farrell is in a movie I am never disappointed and here again I was thrilled to see him looking the part and bringing his body of work as an actor to do the best he could to remake a movie that has just been tarnished by the original star. But Farrell pulls it out and puts emotion, physique and believability to his character who we root and care for. Unlike the original drone-like actor who really depended on the set to move the movie Farrell plows through the set and pulls an otherwise sinkable script off the ground and gets us to care and believe in the world we see.<br /><br />Other movies where Colin Farrell brings great characters to live and have great scripts are [[ASIN:B0018BD9DA In Bruges]] and [[ASIN:B0002Y4PPK A Home at the End of the World]] but each role he plays I applaud this once innocent young actor who has taken control of his craft and given us some great films to enjoy again and again.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I like Diana's smooth voice.  She reminds me of the singers back in the 40's and 50's who knew how to sing.
0307949486|5.0|Providing summaries of the plot I find is never helpful towards the review, however, a summary of the novel or the author's summary may be helpful to shoppers if it takes into consideration the review's economy and contributes masterfully to the reviewer's point. With that said, no plot summary will be provided.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a fine locked room mystery. Those who enjoy locked room mysteries will almost certainly enjoy this book, as well as mystery fanciers, crime/detective fanciers, and young bandwagon readers alike.<br /><br />Enjoy.

I live a lifestyle that is busy and on-the-go, so the times that I can sit in peace and quiet, I'd spend it reading 50. Those opportunities are few and far between, so to create more time, I'd wake up super early and go to sleep in the wee hours of the night.  Obsessed, I tell ya. And you will be too...

B001KP2J3U|5.0|DEATH ON THE NILE was written by Agatha Christie and first published in 1937, and this movie starring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot was released in 1978. In this review I will speak about both because many fans will enjoy reading the book and watching the movie, as I did.<br /><br />The main story centers around twenty year old Linnet Ridgeway, a wealthy heiress who somehow manages to make enemies of several people including her best friend Jackie when she steals and marries Simon Doyle, her fiancee. Linnet and Simon spend their honeymoon in Egypt, where most of this story takes place. She is murdered one night in her cabin aboard a Nile cruise ship, and Poirot and his friend Colonel Race conduct the investigation. There are several suspects on board the ship who either had a grudge against the victim or would benefit financially by her death. Christie has written a great story, with a complex plot, several twists and turns, and a seemingly impossible solution. The book is hard to put down.<br /><br />Anyone interested in getting the Kindle book should know that it is nicely formatted and reads well.<br /><br />As is typical, the book has several characters and intricate story details and some of these are omitted from the film. There are also some variations in the movie story vs. the book, and to me the biggest difference from the book is that Poirot overtly accuses each suspect of having a motive and the opportunity to commit the crime, and there are accompanying scenes of each suspect retrieving the pistol and killing Linnet Doyle as Poirot describes what they could have done. I suppose this was necessary for the film because much of the book contains quiet, low key Poirot discussing clues and possibilities with Colonel Race, and this would not have been as interesting for movie viewers. For dramatic purposes, the movie also creates enmity between Linnet and Dr. Bessner and Linnet suing author Salome Otterbourne for libel.<br /><br />The movie creates a nice period setting with award winning costume design, and was filmed on site in Egypt. The photography of sites like the pyramids and ancient temples is stunning. All players acted well, except I think Angela Lansbury over-played the role of alcoholic erotic author Salome Otterbourne because she was always drunk and rarely stood up straight. This exaggeration was done for movie audiences, I suppose.<br /><br />DEATH ON THE NILE (1978)<br />Director: John Guillermin<br />Writer: Anthony Shaffer (screenplay)<br /><br />Cast (from Wikipedia):<br />Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective<br />Lois Chiles as Linnet Ridgeway Doyle, a beautiful heiress with many enemies<br />Simon MacCorkindale as Simon Doyle, Linnet's handsome husband<br />Mia Farrow as Jacqueline De Bellefort, Linnet's old school friend, formerly engaged to Simon<br />Jane Birkin as Louise Bourget, Linnet's maid<br />George Kennedy as Andrew Pennington, Linnet's embezzling lawyer<br />Bette Davis as Marie Van Schuyler, a rich kleptomaniac<br />Maggie Smith as Miss Bowers, her companion whose family was ruined by the Ridgeways<br />Angela Lansbury as Salome Otterbourne, an exotic novelist Linnet is suing for libel<br />Olivia Hussey as Rosalie Otterbourne, her delicate, devoted daughter<br />David Niven as Colonel Johnny Race, Poirot's friend<br />Jon Finch as Mr. James Ferguson, a communist who resents Linnet's wealth<br />Jack Warden as Dr. Bessner, a Swiss doctor whose methods Linnet deplores<br />Celia Imrie as Maid<br />Harry Andrews as Barnstable<br />Sam Wanamaker as Rockford<br />I.

For convenience to anyone who may be interested, I include here a few notes comparing the book to the movie.

B003XRELGQ|5.0|A really good book about the the folly of man.  Hilarious, heartbreaking, profound, deeply intelligent and perceptive!  Magnificently constructed and eloquent!

B009K0P10K|4.0|I quit watching Revenge mid-way through season one as I thought the story was dragging along.  I thought that I would check it out again for season 2. Believing that I hadn't missed much I erased this review episode from my DVR and jumped to episode one.  I took me about five minutes to realize that I had no idea what was going on.  I watched this episode on Amazon which did a good job bringing me uptodate.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great product. No need to buy the premium one. The free one does the job. (Just trying to feel up space)
B009POCFTG|1.0|This film is utter garbage, bad material, poor direction and indulgent acting.  I dont know why the people involved would not try to elevate it from the crappy 1970s noir style to something more contemporary. Its homage to nothingness. I feel bad for the actors, having to debase themselves with the material. sad
B003YOZNBU|5.0|I like the movie because of Megan fox, she is totally hot . I have the comic books and they did a really good job doing the movie
0984536132|5.0|Hitler said that to move millions to your will, you must speak simply, directly, and must hammer your point a thousand times before the masses understand. Only by repeating the same words over and over will the people begin to comprehend. He believed the intelligence of the average voter could not comprehend much more. This is the same tactic other politicians have used, and the difference between the successful politician and the one who failed is how fiercely they delivered that message.<br /><br />I am enjoying reading Hitler's words, uncensored to some extent. I wanted to know how a man can go from humble beginnings to rallying and leading a productive nation. Inside the book are a sentence here or there when Hitler refers to something, and the editor explains what it is; it's brief, so not annoying overreach.<br /><br />If you want to get inside the mind of a leader, this is a great edition to purchase. It's an easy read and when you read the words it's almost as though Hitler is speaking directly to you. Perhaps you will become enchanted, mesmerized, like millions before who fell to his power through the spoken word.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|I enjoy this game. Its a blast from the past. I enjoyed My Little Pony many years ago, and have found it interesting to play again.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|One of the best music DVD's I have ever watched! The music, the musicians, and the editing were close to perfect. You will love watching great musicians like Diana Krall, John Clayton, John Pizzarelli, Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, and others backing Paul up. I almost felt like I was sitting in the Capitol Recording Studio last February watching this being recorded live. Be sure to buy this one on Blu-ray!
B000I9YLTE|5.0|Leave your sensibilities at the door and don't get offended when your personal space is invaded by the juvenile humor in this classic 1970's comedy.  The facial expressions of John Belushi capture the silliness, and watch out, you'll laugh out loud at the utter stupidity.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I saw plenty of hype about this movie so I was excited to see if the movie could prove true to all the great reviews I saw. It certainly did! This was a great movie with great graphics. Any fan of anime should buy this movie!
B003WQT2YY|5.0|Amadeus director's cut<br /><br />the blue ray version is not full screen therefore there is no real gain in quality when 30% of the picture data is missing.Some of the scenes where new in this version.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very dry at the beginning but then turned into and exciting book. If you can make it through first 100 pages it gets better.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I for one think this is a great app I have downloaded twenty songs and 30 videos with it and I'm pleased with the quality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it!!!!everybody in my family...really enjoys this game....would recommended...my older kids and ... my grand kids really enjoy it also...all ages....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series. It grabs you and makes you want to read more right away. I just hope that Suzanne Collins makes more stories in this series or at least in their world.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Then greatly enjoyed discussing the book with my grandson.  I recommend it to other grandparents and their grandchildren.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love this series. It grabs you and makes you want to read more right away. I just hope that Suzanne Collins makes more stories in this series or at least in their world.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Product arrived on time without any damage.<br /><br />The music itself is amazing, I really do recommend this cd, for pretty much anyone.
B00563M11M|5.0|Let's face it, Terry Pratchett is a legend!  The discworld novels let you laugh at the world as it is, while creating a completely fictional land.  Such a complex world, yet Terry Pratchett makes you feel like you've been there.  The characters are funny, and.....well, us!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Interesting premise.  Great graphics, good plot.  Some actors playing specific parts don’t fit.  Could use some explanation of  the opening scenes.  Off world contact in opening scene?  Some unexpected surprises.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|this is an incredible series with twists and turns and unexpected decisions by actors who are so good in their roles it's hard to believe they are acting.  hard to view at times but fascinating.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|this bag is very good, very comfortable, is sufficient size for travelling .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .
B008Y1YJZY|4.0|Fun to watch in 3D and will probably become a Christmas classic. I know I will watch it next year.
B0091REZMW|4.0|really fun and addictive game. I enjoy it when I have nothing better to do in my spare time. I like it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really fun and enjoyable.  Not too difficult either. Another great game from G5! If most of their games weren't so expensive I would buy more.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Recommend- little dark but I like that sort of thing.<br />I've read her other books to! Hopefully she is working on her third.
075669812X|5.0|This was a wonderful book for both of my boys!  I bought 2 books so the boys wouldn't fight over them and they could also each have one Lloyd each!  This book encourages reading and has big, vibrant pictures too!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I enjoy the fact that this movie portrays mental illness as not necessarily &#34;crazy&#34; but something anyone can catch. I just wish Gilchrist wasn't so awkward. He certainly plays the part of a 16 year old boy well. Maybe some years from now we'll see him man up in a really male oriented role. With his body, he certainly has the potential to be a future Marvel super hero.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app works well and newest update is awesome new background great deals just awesome great way to pass the time
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Loved the sense of discovery throughout this book.  Loved the interests of the characters.  Anything else I could say would be a spoiler.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I suppose if you like repetition and watching a video game, then you'll like it. I got bored fairly quickly and I've never been a fan when the actors in a film look like animated cartoons.  Nor do I care for actors who sound scripted.  This is a definite one time only watch (barely)  and I won't be adding it to my collection.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|good movie, grandkid's love it.  Arrived as promised.  Got it during Amazon movie sale.  Can't wait for movie sale again. Picked up several movies at unbelievable prices.  I am becoming a regular Amazon customer.  Can't wait for another movie sale. Delivery was fast and accurate.  I ordered several movies in same order and got everyone.
0547884591|5.0|I'll rate it a five star because is just not about cooking or the quick fix for cooking. It goes into deep detail on how to break something difficult down to the learning basics. Once I'm done with this book I'm going to order one of his other books and keep on learning.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|arrived fast and as promised.  Great movie for grandma's house.  This was one of several movies I ordered during Amazon movie sale.  Can't wait for another sale..
B0076DELIG|4.0|another enjoyable Harry Bosch novel. All elements intact: a twisty mystery crime that Harry solves, Harry's worldview and his drive in full force, his future at LAPD evermore in question as he ages in almost real-time. We've been through a lot with Harry Bosch over the past 20 or so years and dropping into his life via the latest book is always interesting and entertaining.<br />Besides the crime at hand, Harry's now doing his best to raise his teenage daughter Maddie, a single parent who also happens to be an obsessed homicide detective. Michael Connelly remains at the top of his game with The Black Box. Glad to recently read a different Connelly piece with his views on Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher on the big screen (no comment, haven't seen it)  -where Mr. Connelly mentions Harry may be coming to a TV series.
B000HGA5PM|4.0|Upon opening this package, I will say I was impressed. The cardboard sleeve is pretty cool. Triple gatefold with all the artwork from the wall. The two CDs are packaged in sleeves the are replicas of the original inner sleeve from the LPs which is B.A. The DVD is exactly what I expected, the very same bootleg that is available on any video site on the web, however it is nice to have it on a silver pressed DVD. The two CDs are the studio version of the wall, using the same discs made for the '93 remaster, by EMI, which almost adds some authenticity to this bootleg. All in all, if your a pink Floyd collector pick this up. If your just a casual fan, only buy it if you don't already have the wall, and would like an extra treat.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|There are a few leaps you have to just accept, but overall it is a great movie.  It is best if watched twice to get some of the more subtle jokes and comments.
1612680011|5.0|Whether you've just started your first job or are decades into your career, Rich Dad Poor Dad is a must read book for understanding financial literacy.  This book teaches you the tools of understanding decisions you make with your money.  It talks about the boring subjects of saving and investing which will allow you to have resources set aside when you retire.
B00632HWOG|5.0|when i updated my Yahoo! Mail app a couple of weeks ago it was not working at all. i was really upset, but finally they fixed the problem and i can check my mail now. i am very satisfied. no other email app can even compare! believe me.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Muslims... and fly fishing, yeah right! Muslims do not enjoy the finer things in life unless they were exposed the western society and learn to appreciate our lifestyle. Good love story though.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Definitely the best I have played in a while; A fun, challenging puzzle game that will keep you kn your toes.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Lots of Mahem, crime, sex, and battle, lots of it!!!  I love this show, you won't be disappointed.  Not for the faint of heart.  Loads of Violence, gore and killing.  Running guns, Gang violence, Drug Cartels, you name it.  Don't let your children watch this one.  BAD Boys amuck!!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|All of the items in the shop are overpriced considering how you only earn a few bits from leveling up, quests (which often cost more than they pay out) and the ponies' jobs. It's fun if you're into the MLP universe but otherwise its a game to pass on.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I am really enjoying this new &#34;Super Hero&#34; type show, he doesn't have super hero strength or powers, just really trained well, kind of a cross between Batman and Robinhood.  A wealthy Socialite that gets stranded on an island for 5 years, he is helped and trained by a man who is imprisoned on the island.  After being rescued, he goes home and tries to start cleaning up the streets of his town, per a list his father has left him.  This list is of corrupt businessmen who are &#34;ruining&#34; the city.  There's a bit of romatic tension, lots of action and battle.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Awesome fictional story interwoven into history.  After finishing book 1, I thought the series couldn't' get better, but this one is just as good if not better than Fall of Giants.  Can't wait for book 3!
145210655X|5.0|This is a perfect gift for my husband who's a life-long fan.  Funny, and well made - I know he will love it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|really enjoyed this movie, its great to see a movie that is not about violence and is a happy movie, the acting is great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|On of the best books I read<br />I hope I get to read the next book<br />If I didn't get this book for free I wouldn't get to ever read this book
B0058VW36U|5.0|LOVE THIS APP>  My boys play this all the time.  Great game.  Teaches left to rigth tracking.  Physics and other things.  Cute game too.  Love the nom-nom...
B0063IH60K|4.0|could use a bookmark feature, otherwise plays great. like the type of deal selection. allows specifying that the hand will allways be winnable if you can just figure it out.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I read this book for my job. It was good, but a little repetitious at times. I learned a lot of interesting things and was able to apply some of the principals in it to my own life.
0399160450|1.0|First me say that I have been a big Jack Ryan Series fan. Several of the earlier books I have read multiple times. But that will not happen with this one. The first warning sign was the physical book itself. 835 pages with big margins and widely spaced lines. With no loss of readability this could have been a 600 page book - which makes you wonder if the publisher is 1) trying to make you think it's a more substantial book that it is, 2) give you plenty of room to write notes in the margins, or 3) thinks the Ryan readers need help with their reading skills. Then you get to the story. As usual, the basic premise is interesting - in this case a orchestrated cyber-attack on the US. The general plot wasn't too bad until the last third of the book when Thor, the Hulk, and Batman...er, I mean John Clark, Domingo Chavez, and Jack Ryan Jr carry out missions that are so implausible that the reader stops reading and thinks to themselves...\\"What! Are you sh...ing me!\\" In fact, the resolutions are so implausible, that when combined with the factual errors in being consistent with earlier novels pointed out by other reviewers, I doubt Clancy ever actually read a draft.
B005P3NPXG|3.0|O.K. So I didn't pay attention and thought I was getting more of Seals' music. Since what he has written is so beautiful I don't know why he's singing others' songs. His voice, as always, of course, is awesome.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I have bought every book since Vince Flynn started his hero Mitch.  But it is time to adjust the puzzle.
B001H1SW4M|2.0|We haven't watched the movie and I'm hoping it isn't scratched. It's loose in the case. Not been opened. Here's hoping it will be watchable!! I know it isn't your fault, but I'm just kinda worried about scratches. It's wrapped for now. I can't watch movies like these because they scare the s*** out of me, but my husband likes horror movies. Thanks!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|DragonVale is one of the best games I have ever purchased. I love the variety of dragons availible and the graphics of the game. Breeding is a blast and the items in the Market are pretty cool. I would recommend this awesome app to just about anyone with a knack for caring and a sweet tooth for the best creatures around!
B000Q9IR0A|4.0|Pros:<br /><br />- ...So I read this book<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- My boss told me to read this book...<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />It's good. I learned stuff which is sometimes hard to admit but in my case it's very easy as I know little to nothing.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I purchased this for $20 through a lightning deal or something and it may possibly be the best deal I've seen if you are into this series. I have never seen it and was really impressed by the packaging and dvd menus.
072325804X|5.0|Beautiful book for my son's first child. Can't wait until Christmas so we can read together. He will have a life long memory of his first Christmas.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I bought their second cd first (Take Me Home), and then I bought this one. Both are amazing, I love all their songs! They are wonderful! I would most definitely buy this for anyone! They are hot TALENTED british boys! <3 ittttttttttt!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this book as a young girl and thoroughly enjoyed it then. Forty plus years on I enjoyed it just as much if not more the second time round. A book of it's time, very engaging and endearing the story follows four sisters throughout their moral upbringing to womanhood. Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times. I would definitiely recommend for a heart warming story. I read it in abou four long stints, so be prepared to put some time on one side!<br />Denise<br />12/12/23
0547848412|5.0|This is for a granddaughter as a gift. I was supposed to take her to the movie but she got sick just before, so we missed it. Know she will love it
B003G4W49C|5.0|I did not expect to be so moved by this story, and yet I sit here crying as I come to the end. What a well-written book. I am so glad I stumbled upon it. It's one of those books that you feel like your entire life is changed just by reading it. There really is no higher praise I can give, no greater recommendation. Read this story. Let it fill you up and change you.
1451695195|3.0|Hope this book will be well received by a grandmother who lost a grandchild. I hope this is not going to be overwhelming to her
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Love the premise of the book from the animals point of view.  The sotry ranges from clever, funny, sad, real-life.  Enjoyed every page.
B0091REZMW|4.0|pretty good game for staying busy. I had gotten really far along and the game froze and didn't track my progress so I started all over.
B005HSL626|5.0|While visiting with my six year old nephew, I showed him my new kindle (opened earlier that day). He was having a bit of a rough day (six is tough when you can't open presents early) so I showed him the games I had downloaded and that was that. I didn't get my device back until we left. He loved fruit ninja. He told me so. He made sword swinging noises and hi-ya noises and fruit was destroyed. I haven't played it yet but if his reaction is any indication, I'm sure good times will be had.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|excellent
B0061JPT46|5.0|This was one of my favorites on vinyl many years ago. Glad to finally find it on a CD now.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|They did a nice job with the remake. the variation from the original was better than the mars version. I would recommend it to others.
B008F9E306|5.0|I live in California and guess what my brother sent me for Christmas? A signed T.I. Autographed Trouble Man....Took it to the gymn and was in love and motivated with the entire CD; because I normally go 30 minutes - but this whole CD had me pumped! From the first tune to the last, T.I. shows us that his time of thinking has really put him in a place where he understands life in a way he can give it to us with such great, great music. The King Lives and I am loving it! Can't wait for the next album and the next one after that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you interested through out the entire story.  I hated to put it down and didn't want it to end.
B001684L0A|5.0|American democracy is an ongoing experiment in communication. John Adams was one of the great communicators of his time. Paul Giamatti and, even more so, Laura Linney add tremendous depth in expressing the throes our forefathers engaged in early on and in the manner of resolving the difficulties. Both my wife and I have been well-entertained by this series.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Started slow in the begining; then turned into a great read well written.  Looking forward to the next in the series.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|.. it was too short!  Maybe it just felt like it.  But it was really great. I really am glad I bought it :D
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I like this game.  It is much more improved than the original.  I miss buying weapons with in-game currency, though.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I'm told there was a plot.  I kinda got bored with trying to pay attention to it.  Not exactly riveting.  But the dancing?  Meow. ;)
B005S9EJ46|5.0|A joy of a movie about a group of strangers, their trip to India, and how they discover each other and what's really important. As you might expect with this cast, the movie is very well acted.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I lovelovelove it! My friend didnt like it because it wasn't done in the recording studio. They are live songs done while acting! There is so much emotion in the songs! It makes you actually listen to and take in the meanings if the song! I couldn't be more excited for this movie!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So far so good from the sample. This book has my attention at the moment just from reading the sample.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I enjoyed them movie. I'd watch the sequel. As others have pointed out, I wish there was more to the story.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|well worth the $2.99.  great graphics. fun puzzles and lots of hidden objects..  definitely one of the best g5 games!
B0061QD82E|5.0|I preordered this and was really excited when I got it since I hadn't watched it in years.  Brought back happy childhood memories.  I received this item in the time frame specified and in excellent condition.
0425263908|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades of Grey (and who didn't) you will love Bared to you. Steamy sex senses, not just one partner with a past full of secrets, a page turner for sure. Once you start reading you'll want to be left alone while you finish this book. :-)
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm an LOTR fanatic.  SO much so that I have an Evenstar pendant necklace with matching earrings.  I received this item in the time frame specified and in excellent condition.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book - until the end, at which time you will CRY.  Each character's point of view is clear - Riordan writes to show each of his character's personalities, and you can tell they are different - he really brings their voices out.
0439023513|3.0|SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Like other comments for this book, I also thought that Mockingjay was rushed and underdeveloped. I finished the book yesterday and it just felt empty. And not like, I-miss-the-characters empty, but more like the ending was pathetic given the heroic size of the characters. The first book was so great, the second one so-so, and Mockingjay could have been a great conclusion. Instead, I actually grew to dislike Katniss. She really became selfish and uncaring at some points. Her behavior was uncharacteristic at other points. This wasn't the same brave girl who volunteered for her sister, befriended Rue, and risked her life for Peeta. This Katniss was even petty at times. The epilogue just added insult to injury after committing my time to these characters. It was just so bland and sad, and unreal to who these people were originally portrayed to be. I get the part about the mental anguish that Katniss must have gone through after the war. I do. But people move on, especially seventeen year olds. Anyway, I wrote an alternate ending as a parody for what may have worked better. Here goes:<br /><br />Soft, chubby fingers tickle my nose with the peddles of a flower. I awake and he smiles. He's four and wants my attention. I see myself in him. Peeta has left early to open his beloved bakery. The flower is from him. Every morning he leaves me a flower, always in season . . . never a rose. Twenty years have passed. A lifetime for the seventeen-year-old girl, who came home physically and emotionally broken. I take the child by the hand and walk him to his room, where his brother and sister are already changing. The house is alive with chatter and laughter. Peeta really wanted children and I couldn't deny him that happiness. I knew that I alone wasn't enough to heal him . . . I guess I was still trying to save him. Primrose. She was born early, frail but determined. She saved both of us from our nightmares. Blond with soft blue eyes, anda heart for giving of herself that only Peeta can fully understand. She's sixteen now, and wants to be a doctor. In a year she will go to a school named after her famous aunt, and administered by her loving grandmother. She will continue to heal others. Six other children were born. Strong. Wonderful. Free from fear. And in their names, Rue, Maggie, Marcos (my father's name), Finnick, Madge and Cinna, the echoes of those who came before them are remembered. Like a Mockingjay's song, which is never fully his own but built upon something beautiful.<br /><br />We all walk to the gate leading out of District 12, Peeta meets us there with a basket of food, and we go to our favorite picnic spot. Rue and Marcos have taken to hunting, and today they guard their family against predators. Using bows and arrows that I taught them to make. I walk with Peeta, holding his hand in mine. Behind us, District 12 has grown. Medicine is now it's main source of production, but coal is also mined . . . safely now, with minimal need for human labor. Beautiful homes have sprouted on the ashes of the hovels that I once knew. Out here, I always remember Gale. He's doing important work now, but I see him sometimes. And our embraces are always genuine and without conflict. My children know about him and our hunting adventures. In time, they will know about the war, and about the other world into which they would have never been born.<br /><br />We find our picnic spot and spread our blanket. I lie down to see the clouds forming above me and hear Peeta playing with the children. Madge has brought the cat, a descendent of Buttercup, who curls up against my leg to avoid the little feet of children running and laughing. Soon I will visit each district and remember with them what we struggled for twenty years ago. Nothing has been perfect since our victory. Various leaders. But they have weathered these problems peacefully. The atrocities of the Capitol were all made transparent. And in time also the atrocities of District 13 and President Coin. We've looked beyond us and discovered that other lands exist. Perhaps other threats. I have stayed out of everything and devoted myself to rebuilding District 12 by mentoring leaders and youth . . . for now. No, nothing is perfect for Panem. But its people are at least free to pursue happiness. For me, today is perfect. It's a good day for a picnic. My name is Katniss Everdeen Mellark. I am thirty-seven years old. My home is District 12. I am a mother and a wife. I am a writer, a hunter and a mentor. Peeta loves me. My children love me. I continue to survive.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Can I saw awesome repeatedly?  Answers my 15 yo when I ask her.  But just as Rick Riordan does in his other books, he brings a snarky fun tone to this book that reflects today's intelligent teens.  And everyone can relate to the drama and excitement he shares.
0375851569|5.0|Everyone knows that Dr. Suess books are timeless but this is a good deal.  I can't have enough Dr. Suess.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|great story, great writing, love that most of the same cast is back playing different characters.  just enough sexy and scary - highly recommend!
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Well written, informative, uses alternate thinking, need to be bold to attempt some of the tactics, worth the money - beauty of a book, you can filter according to your personal values.
B0086700CM|3.0|well this game is fun but not when u lose for no reason at all. cause every time u try to jump you don't even jump at all. so what's the point of playing then.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|The Folder Organizer (FO) might be the best app on my smartphone. It cleaned up my homescreens in a neat organized manner. I tried various launchers in place of the stock but they were too invasive, compromising existing functionality w/o a replacement.<br /><br />FO allows to label the installed applications and represent the labels on the homescreens. The labeling can be done by hand or automatically. The FO widget representations for the labels consume quite a bit of battery power, but shortcuts do not. Icons can be assigned to the labels either from installed applications or from separately purchased icon packs. Unfortunately the latter serve a bit as a money-making racket - most and at times all icons are throw-aways and they cannot be used outside of FO.  Within the labels, the applications can be ordered according to the user-specified rules.<br /><br />Besides the labels, FO can work with other categories and in particular with contacts and bookmarks.  From the contact list, represented by a shortcut on the homescreen, you can dial your contact, send an SMS and even Google navigation directions to the address.  FO has difficulty coping with long lists of items and can crash.  The majority of my attempts to work with bookmarks ended up in crashes, likely because of the number of imported bookmarks I have.  Even with the crashes, it is so helpful that I don't think twice in awarding it 5*.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is a well implemented rhythm/pattern matching game similar to the more famous guitar based games. While you might learn a little more about the piano from this than the guitar based games with the buttons and one &quot;strings&quot; bar, it's really just a game. The keys indicate the note you are playing, so there's the opportunity to just get familiar with the primary notes you're playing. With this game, you are basically playing one handed piano with the software filling in for you the missing hand. Very fun and addicting. I purchased the Piano Master &quot;Full&quot; version after having spent time with the Christmas Special in order to get a bigger range of music.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Many people can consider this movie a rubish mix of special effects and young sensual girls fighting, but to me, this is one of the best movies I've ever watched! The soundtrack is amazing, the production is absolutely wonderful and the plot is very interesting. To me, Sucker Punch represents Zack Snyder at his best.<br />If you're, like me, a fan of the movie, please do yourself a big favor and by the extended edition! It's very worth it!
B008Y1YK0I|3.0|This was a Christmas gift for someone else, so I really can not review it. I don't have a blu-ray player to do so anyway.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Juries.....Executioners......Judges!!!   WOW! Soon as I came home from the movies, I took the 94 Judge Dredd with Slye from my DVD Stand and chucked it in the GARBAGE!!! I would be ashamed to give it to somebody or even have it on my shelf after seeing Dredd!!! The 94 version is practically a Candy Factory reproduction of the 2000ad Comic which origins are Hardcore and from the GUT!  The new Dredd is in your face with no Holds Barred, violent and never lets up (Not senseless violence, violence with meaning). Cant wait to see if they have an unrated version. I grew up reading the DC Comic and finally saw it on the big screen the way it supposed to be two days ago. I was a teen of the 80's so you will understand what I'm about to say, Robo Cop, Terminator and Escape from New York!! Dredd had all the elements of these movies. I give it a B+ for originality (which is rare now days) and It's a breath of fresh air from the constant bombardment of garbage being pumped out every year from Holly Wood which you have to constantly sift through the s*** to find some quality !! Karl Urban and Lena Heady are off the chain!!, Good solid acting, nobody is trying to win an Oscar here but just sticking to the GRIT and premise of Dredd and making a damn good movie! Karl Urban plays an UNEXPECTED role as Dredd which surprised me and I didn't take him seriously to begin with when I saw the previews on TV. I was like &#34;Karl Urban! Dredd! get outta here!&#34; just never imagined him playing a role like this and he kicked ass! But I must save the best for last, Lena Heady, WOW, lena plays Ma Ma, an evil, psychotic, insane, demented, deranged, Drug Lord who leads a band of psychotic lunatic misfits, may I say more! how often do you get to see an actress play a psycho who actually makes you feel uncomfortable....She did! Lena Heady took the show! Olivia Thirlby plays the Rookie Anderson who's a telepath and Dredd's Trainee, she was also impressive and her character was most definitely needed to make the story click. This movie did not have a ginormous budget (thank god cause it would have probably sucked), they relied on some ground breaking cinematography and creativity which I thought was awesome! WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS A TON OF MONEY DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE A GOOD MOVIE, haven't we?   Why did I give it 4 Stars? If the DVD comes packaged with Slow Mo, I got 5 on it!  Dredd! not yo MaMa's movie! But I Highly recommend!
0316227706|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend, but enjoyed it so much, I'm keeping it and ordering another. It may be my second coffee table book. You'll enjoy all the sweet underwater faces that don't realize how funny they look.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Keeps the kids entertained. I don't like that the beginning games are so monotonous but I understand the concept. It's a good way to pass time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the chracters, the flow of the story line and the twists and turns throughout this great book.  5 stars is not enough.  Will definitely recommend this to others:)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is an awesome feature film for all ages ! My kids loved this movie and I'm sure will watch it again and again !
B00571F26Y|3.0|I should preface my review by saying that I am an MD and hold a PhD as well. This book does a great job at explaining how carbs trigger insulin spikes, which in turn trigger irresistible hunger in a never-ending vicious circle.<br /><br />The crusade against wheat, however, is biased and scientifically unsound. There are so many mistakes that I cannot even start enumerating them. The whole concept of &#34;exorphins&#34; makes no sense: these things cannot reach the brain in sufficient amounts to trigger pharmacological effects. Also, to nail every single unexplained disease, including schizophrenia, to wheat consumption is plain silly.<br /><br />Nevertheless, taking wheat (and other carbs) off your diet is a very good thing, and this book makes a very convincing case for that. That it overdoes it, in a kind of religious anti-wheat zeal, does not make carbs any better for you!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is really fun but it takes to long to load that's the only thing I don't like and they only hive u 10 coins so dumb so I say you should get the app but you should get the app it's free it's not 1&bull;99 or something and you should get it for the people ages2-13 because by then you will lose the fun of the game now remember this is just my thoghts!
B004SBX112|1.0|This game seemed fin at first, but then I discovered I can't. play without. a network. connection.  As if that wasn't, bad enough, then after playing 4 or 5 levels in a row it tells me I have to wait 2 hours and 7 minutes for the next level to be available.  Goodbye Angry birds, no more money for you Rovio.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I love.this movie.beyond words. Edward Norton in a Khaki Scout uniform makes me impossibly happy. I.makes me wish I was young enough to run away from home again.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|Listen Bernstein ahead of one of the best orchestras in the world is pleasure, contemplation and time of profound inner journey before what is great and eternal.<br />I recommend all people sensitive to music and also to those who will not be able to stop listening to Beethoven
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I saw this for the first time during Halloween and fell in love with It. I just thought I should watch it from the beginning. to see how it started.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Totally enjoyed this movie, of course the effects were fantastic and much better than the first.  Colin Farrell was very convincing.
0670451495|5.0|This is such a wonderful story with great original pictures that I read and loved as a very young child!
B00004ST9Q|4.0|I thought it was the cd's but I'm happy with this thanks never open it yet I'm just saving it
B003DZX3SA|5.0|That's all my granddaughter talks about! I love disney movies because you can teach them about the messages that are in them!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I purchased this for my son to play and he has been playing with it every day.  He loves it!!
B002FGU46C|4.0|What's to review? The sandals are as good as ever. I expected excellent quality and that's what I got. The last pair barely has any sole and bits are fraying around the edges - but then I've been wearing them for years.<br />Only problem with latest is that the back strap now has a plastic gripper that protrudes slightly. But once you've set up the sandals to your feet it doesn't need any further adjustment and that bloody plastic gripper becomes an irritating nuisance. I cut it off and it's much better.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It was well written and the story line was good.I have read a few of her books and enjoyed them all.Nice writer.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|Zaz is absolutely amazing!<br />Each song is truly perfect and the whole cd leaves me inspired<br />Vibrant singing and beautiful words!<br />I'm going to learn French just to sing along.
B0014BECF8|5.0|very happy, I would recemmend it to my friends and family.  Good selection of songs that I like. Thank you.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This app is very entertaining. Good variety and challenging, lots of fun. Good way to lose track of time. No problems.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I LOVE games like this and it was great. I beat it pretty quickly. I reccomend this to people who like mystery/finding things games. your in for a real treat if you get it!!!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved the different spin on a long time traditional story. I think every culture has their version of Cinderella but this is definately a different perspective.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|It's my daughter's Christmas present ,and I know she 'll love it. It's Coldplay.i was pleased it got here in plenty of time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely a GREAT book! I literally have a headache right now due to the fact that I couldn't stop reading last night. I read till I could no longer hold my eyes open. I definitely recommend buying this book. I love the romance in it and the story line is different. I read romance novels ALL the time. This is on my favorites list! Buy it!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Nor funny. Obscene stuffed animals is not my thing and the comedy was just low. No stars is not an option.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I enjoyed this .  They cast of course is not quite as musical as the stage cast but It was a great memory of the movie
B004GVUPFE|1.0|I normally like this type of game but this was difficult and tedious and not fun for me. I've tried it several times but it does not hold my interest.
B00530FC6O|5.0|Must read.  Laugh out loud funny, ingenious plot development and use of language.  Wodehouse should be better known in the States.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I got this to have a convenient comfortable and effective headset for doing gaming on and it certainly fit the bill.  It could be a little more comfortable certainly but the sound is excellent and the microphone is convenient.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I have all of the episodes that have been made available so far and I will continue getting all episodes that they make available
0679805273|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I even used it as a theme for my son's nursery.  I give this to new babies to college graduates.  So inspirational!!!
B009NQX48C|5.0|This is a film I used to have on DVD.<br />Universal pictures has been doing great  Blu-Ray teladine tranfer work lately.<br />So I exspect this Blu-Ray to be very  good as well.<br />Looking forward to receiving my copy.<br />Thanks Universal
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Loved the movie, love the soundtrack.  I crank it up and belt out &#34;All I want for christmas is you&#34;.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I was hoping for more fun, fun, fun upbeat type stuff and that's not there but the music is gorgeous, lyrics are nostalgic and I love \\"Isn't It Time\\" and Mike Love has some great vocals throughout. Jeff Foskett is amazing on Shelter! A great release but I hope there's more to come!
0920668372|5.0|One of my favorite stories and now my 3 yr old sons favorite too.  He makes me sing the song to him and rock him.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is a great end to Christpher Nolan's Batman trilogy.  It ties everything back to the first movie nicely and has a satisfying end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author. This book is amazing. He truly outdid himself. It was more than just a love story. It was a story about courage in the face of fear and evil. Loved every second!!
B0016CO2HS|5.0|This is the best Stones album from the early days, and my favorite along with Sticky Fingers. Get this one, not the US release since the US release is like possum urine compared to this, which is like caviar!! Mother's Little Helper was the best song from the early years, and the idiots left it off of the US release. I really like Brian Jones, and I feel like you can really get a sense of his genius here, the best from this era. I burned this to CD immediately, and it is in my car player and staying for awhile!! So fun!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The story is great and the acting also.  I look forward to seeing some sequels.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Love British movies.  This was one of my favorites.  The actors were fantastic, location perfect, script was sad, hilarious, and feel good.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Case Arrived and was missing a piece ti turn iPhone sound off and on.. Within two weeks, case cracked ;without any rugged treatment).  Emailed Lifeproof and have YET to receive ant response- looks like I am going back to Otterbox...
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved this film.  It was entertaining, funny, action packed and the actors are all favorites of mine.  Hope to see more from all of them.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Was an Awesome read, as almost always with Clancy. Not too technical in this one, and pace was fast. 4 stars bec ause this review policy really sucks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is just like the x box version and Pc version. slow on updates cool good awesome fun good priced.But it takes a while for updates.
B000VHXBIU|5.0|This is a comedy that is really and genuinely funny. John Cleese's script gives the bulk of the laughs to Americans Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. The charachters played by Cleese and Palin mainly play as straight men for the wild antics of the 2 Americans. Cleese gets in some great lines here and there also such as the quote above that I'm using as the title for the review.<br />Kline won the Academy award for Best Supporting Actor for this role of Otto and deservedly so as he is just wonderful in all his scenes. Curtis is equally strong as Wanda and one of her best parts right up there with Ophelia in \\"Trading Places\\" and the 2 Brits play their parts well also.<br />Little tidbit - the name of Cleese's character is Archie Leach which was the real name of Cary Grant, who was certainly no stranger to great comedy himself. This is a great one when you need some laughs as they are very much here.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a really good time waster, it doesn't pester you to make in game purchases, and the special currency is easier to get than most games like this
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Product arrived in good condition. After viewing about half of the DVD's the quality of the reproduction seems very good. The DVD's are segregated by season and are in sleves that may not provide long term protection of the DVD's, especially from dust scratching.
B008220CYM|3.0|This reviewer hasn't read the any of the Lee Childs books and had no preconceptions about the movie, which opens with a seemingly senseless sniper attack that kills five people. A rapid police response results in the arrest of a disturbed veteran and former sniper, who asks the police to \\"call Jack Reacher.\\"  It turns out that Jack Reacher is a highly skilled former military policeman with authority issues and a willingness to go off the books to get justice.  Reacher reluctantly agrees to assist in the defense of the accused sniper, and quickly discovers the slam dunk case might be too good to be true.  Whoever is behind the setup reacts badly to Reacher's presence, sending a group of thugs to scare him off the case.  Reacher doesn't scare easily, but soon finds himself in a race against time to stop a ruthless conspiracy, before the conspiracy puts a stop to him...<br /><br />The plot behind the killings is fairly complicated, and it will become obvious to Reacher and to the audience that someone involved with the case, whether the lead police investigator, the district attorney, or even the defense attorney, is working with the bad guys.  There are a series of exciting, if not very realistic, action sequences, in which Reacher beats up thugs, survives high speed car chases, and picks off the members of a nasty gang one by one.  Veteran actor Robert Duvall has a nice extended cameo as a former Marine and rifle range owner who gives Jack a hand.<br /><br />Judging by some of the harsh reviews already posted, if you'r a fan of the Jack Reacher novels, this movie probably doesn't do it for you.  If you're a fan of Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible franchise, \\"Jack Reacher\\" will probably turn out to be a decent little action flick.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|The fact you can buy just the games you want and costs 99 cents per game is a good deal. The negative for me was the controls , and sounds. For the price I'll forgive. Bought Centipede and I own a real arcade version of this so having the controls and sounds off was a real bummer. As for the fun taking this to kill time , it will. Looking for arcade perfect ? No, but a good waste of 99 cents.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've tried several calculator apps on my Kindle Fire,  but this is the 'go-to' app. It just does what it's supposed to do - and it does it well!  Thanks Digitalchemy!
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Everyone was raving about this series so I finally bought it.  Completely worth the price.  Not as fabulous in the casting and acting department as series such as Sopranos, Six Feet Under or West Wing - but close.  The plot is very intriguing and I can't wait to find a spare hour to watch the next episode.  Now that HBO seems to have decided to take a creativity holiday, I welcome this series.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The basic idea is that habits are a behavioral cycle of cue-response-reward, reinforced over many episodes.  He expands on this by looking at how craving (which occurs when there is the insertion of a pause between expected reward and received reward) fits in.  He also applies the idea to institutions and looks at how corporate culture has it's own set of &#34;habitual&#34; behaviors.  The former part I found a little simplistic, just simple behavioral psychology.  The second part seemed Procrustean.
B005USZML4|1.0|This book really didn't show me much.  Perhaps, there were messages that were not a part of my belief system.  I will be very cautious before reading another Grisham.
B008BDZP30|5.0|The prior version by Ryko had all sorts of weird channel drop outs, which made me not listen to it. One of the FZ/Bob Stone remaster screw ups. Now this has been issued from the original analog masters, and I now can listen to this CD in its original intended glory!! So much better, it's not even funny.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|a really great read! you feel connect to the characters. A lot of real life sistuations and important life lessons.I couldn't put it down
B008B37CB8|5.0|Zappa's first album gives a wonderful glimpse of life in the early to mid 60's. His commentary during Trouble Everyday is as strong a protest song as ever been written. Plus wonderful doo-wop parodies, and other assorted weirdness.
B008MM9630|5.0|I relllly like this game. I like the crops best. I think this game is the best one yet because some games are not that good.
0205632645|5.0|Great concise guide for tightening your writing style. It makes me want to read Charlottes Web again! Buy it without hesitation!
B007HNG0ZM|5.0|cant wait for season 3!! Icould not turn the TV off while starting S1 and finishing S2<br />Such an interesting series in a historical setting.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|You get exactly what you pay for. No surprises, it is pretty durable. I like it and would reccomend this product.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an enjoyable read that had you cheering for the characters. Good character development. Would love a sequel or series for these characters.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|this is a cool game i like playing it with my 5 yr old definatley know why angry birds is everywhere because they are frickin awesome.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|If there were no elements of Halo in this movie the story-line and character base could not keep it above the threshold of being entertaining. The graphics are on par with, let's say, a STARZ mini-series. I know most people will say that the substance of a movie is not derived from the graphics, but to those people I say that there isn't much of a story to compensate for mediocre graphics, and in a Halo movie graphics ARE important. You're not going to put a guy in a Covenant costume...you hire Andy Serkis and pump 70 million dollars into those CG scenes, HALO deserves it!<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way I will tell you why this movie deserves a 4-star rating:<br /><br />1. It IS Halo, afterall.<br />2. It feels like a \\"fan=boy\\" production...and I can relate to any fan-boy of Halo.<br />3. It is the best Halo film available.
B005D63ICI|2.0|One must have a certain bent in order to appreciate Dexter.  I admit I don't have it.  Though series five did leave me with the chills and I found it suspenseful and horrifying, the butchery is too well done and all in all it is truly repugnant.  I can't subscribe to the lovable Robin Hood serial killer theme.  It is not going to be a classic in my book for sure.  And the acting is flat. Dexter lacks a depth and intensity, and that is frightening.  A true picture of a sociopath.  Thanks for teaching our kids about violence.
030788743X|5.0|This item arrived on time, packaged well, in perfect condition. I have read this through the public library and wanted one for my home. If you love gaming, this book is for you.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I totally enjoyed myself.  Again Depp delivers a flawless performance.  This movie is fun and a wonderful ride.  Well caste.  I can't imagine why the critics were not enthusiastic about it.  It is great fun and true light hearted entertainment.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This works very well.  Makes navigating a lot more simple than before.  It is clear and crisp.  I am very happy with my email access on my Kindle Tablet.
1451695195|4.0|We don't know do we. That is what religions of the world are trying to answer in their own limited way. Humans just don't know so we make things up and then demand others believe us. This is NOT religion based which is a huge plus, but we still don't &#34;know&#34; do we. Good book worth reading in my opinion
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I thought this app was very cool because it's like all the Rockstar or rock band games but it's piano and awesome Christmas songs.
B002WTOXUK|3.0|I guess they never saw the TV series, Alien Nation.  There is nothing original in movies.  Just subtle twists from the same old stories.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome. But it's stupid you have to redo some of the missions even though you have already completed them.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|W Shaw<br /><br />Recieved items in perfect time and everything works perfectly, great work. Thanks Men keep up the good work<br /><br />WMS
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|Updated review - I deleted and reinstalled it.  Now it will run.  But there are cartoon - like graphics and a stupid story.  I still don't recommended this.<br /><br />I open it but it just stays on nevosoft screen and won't open at all.  I'm very disappointed.  It is only 99¢ but not worth it because you can't play it.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|W Shaw<br /><br />Recieved items in perfect time and everything works perfectly, great work. Thanks Men keep up the good work<br /><br />WMS
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I CAN'T STOP SINGING THESE SONGS! I sing them in the shower, in bed, in my car, at the board meeting, at Starbucks.... everywhere! i ANNOY SO MANY PEOPLE EVERY DAY.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This show has interesting historical references and an intriguing cast of characters.  My wife and I like to watch it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A sweet story that made it easy to while away the day, It was an easy read that had a feel good feeling to it.
0446554995|4.0|If you're a Pendergrast/Preston/Child fan you'll probably like Two Graves, I did. It's a good read.<br /><br />I notice the negative reviews talk about how unlikely and contrived a lot of the situations in the book are. Well... seems to me some fairly unlikely stuff might be expected from an FBI agent named Aloysius Xingú Leng Pendergast who dresses like a debonair grim reaper,drives a Rolls to work and has a waterfall for a wall in his apartments in the Dakota.<br /><br />As to contrived situations well, I guess that's in the eye of the reader. I found the book a swashbuckling good read, I get enough reality please and thank you very much and this book is, as expected,an adventure!<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys!
B0086700CM|5.0|I just can not get enough I play Temple Run nonstop. not only that but it keeps little kids occupied for hours on end.

B008U7ZPHS|5.0|We are already anxious for the next installment. A SUPER continuation of the Heroes of Olympus series. We all loved the fast pace of the book and it does not let down on the adventure too. My daughter (age10) says &#34;I couldn't put the book down&#34;.
B0086700CM|5.0|wish it would load on facebook because I would play it a lot more. on my Pc. for hours and hours. maybe

B0000DJZ8R|3.0|I ABSIOLUTELY LOVE THE MOVIE BECAUSEM ITS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS DISC IS THAT PART OF THE MOVIE IS UNVIEWABLE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MOVIE STOPS AND STARTS AND HAD TO FAST FORWARD TIO SEE REST OF MOVIE. I WOULD LIKE THIS DVD REPLACED AND WILL SEND THE DEFECTIVE DVD BACK TO YOU. I AM STILL VERTY SATISFIED WITH MOVIE MARS  AND THIER PRODUCT. AND I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THAT THIS MOVUIE BE REQUIRED VIEWING.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I love the case (the feel, look, versatility). The reason I have the case 4 stars is because we can't charge the kindle while its in the folded stand position. Other then that, I love the case.
B00ANAC32U|1.0|Wow, still have 20 available.  No f-ing wonder no consumer was able to buy any, and on top of that triple up the price.  This isn't making a profit, this is f-ing robbery.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I like the music because is upbeat and lyrics because they are clean. I so her performance in XFactor and l
B009MO5G90|2.0|I have been a fan of the Resident Evil movies because they are fun to watch. They aren't necessarily the most well developed plots over all but this one was a nightmare. The 3D was excellent but the plot lost me numerous times. I watched this with a friend who also felt that it was a pathetic attempt at a RE movie. It's as if they didn't even try on this one. I'm very disappointed. Lots of action and special effects but just barely held my attention. I think it was a little bit of a rip off of the Hunger Games with some of the scenarios. I will definitely be more cautious about pre-ordering from this series again.
0345803507|5.0|came exactly as described. the book looked new even though it was used.  shipped very quickly, faster than they told me.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tons of stations from lot of countries, easy to use, and the sound quality is superb. I cant think of any better app for web radios. And IT'S FREE!
B000009ED0|5.0|Its a great album with many good tunes. I played it to death in my cd player in my car. Also bought the album on iTunes.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Sharp Objects was a fun read, good character development, use of place, and pacing. I object to a mystery novel in which a brand new character is introduced at the end and revealed as the villian, though -  it take most of the fun out of the &#34;whodunnit&#34; experience.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is without a doubt the Best Columbo Box set I have ever owned.  As the title implies. . .It is 100% Complete (Seasons  One thru Seven & all of the TV Movies from 1989 to 2003 are included.  A must Have for any Columbo Fan!!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome! I loved this film! It's soo cute and I love the sister bond between Tink and Periwinkle.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|I got in trouble with my wife because, once I started reading she couldnt get a conversation out of me. Suspense was high, plot was so close to reality I expect to see Obama calling the Chinese out any day soon, particularly with America's current debt predicament.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend. He loved it. So far the documentaries are great.<br />Thanks Amazon!<br />Fantastic! Great! A bit dad but good stuff.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|The movie was great for as much as i could make out of it! The quality sucked it was broke up in pieces for the most part!
B005LAIHZY|1.0|Love the movie, but, the blu-ray stops about two minutes into the movie. This is on a new blu-ray player. Have not had te to return per busy life with two small children. Expect, at this point, Zi am stuck with defective disc.
B00447G29S|5.0|The 3D effects are really good!  Received it on earlier than expected. The original movie is good so with the 3D it's even better!!
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Not a good story. Many errors in it which is disappointing because I expect a lot more from Harlequin.<br />Initially, the first few chapters, had promise but it quickly went down hill and there was no recovering it.  The side characters were extremely boring and in most cases they were nails down a chalkboard annoying. The intimacy between the male and female leads was lacking, and together they didn't make sense in the least. There was no saving them or the story.<br />Very disappointing, especially with all of the hype that Harlequin's hype on facebook about it.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I bought this game and my little brother played it and it completely broke down my kindle wouldn't turn on for 2 days.WARNING:DO NOT BUY APP!!!!!!!!!
0547884591|5.0|Readers get more than they expect (or if they have read either of Tim Ferriss' other two books, perhaps it's no surprise). If you long for the shortest path to learning across a broad range of subjects, this is your book. Oh yeah, Ferriss' learning process just happens to use cooking as its frame of reference. Girls, buy it for your boyfriend and you'll also get more than you expect - perhaps even some excellently crafted meals!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|There's a lot of action. However, to much explicit language to enjoy. PG13... parents beware! This should have been designated an R rating.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I bought this to work with my Kodak Zi-8 for doing video podcasts. It works great for what it does. The only thing that I wish it had is an indicator showing that it is on and that the battery is still working. With no battery indicator, you could end up recording the perfect shot, only to find out that your battery was dead the entire time. I like this microphone for what it is, but I may end up buying a different lavalier microphone for this reason alone.
B008XBASVY|2.0|I bought this book based on the wonderful reviews and the fact that I really enjoy Chris Colfer. After only a few pages I really regretted the purchase. I forced myself to finish the book only to find that the last two pages were truly awful. No twist was needed. All in all, I felt like Carson was way too whiney and unlikable. It seemed like more of a short story that should have been submitted in a high school English class. I feel bad for being so harsh, but I had high hopes and I was very disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Game play is a lot of fun.  Daughter loves it.  We have two kindles and we have had no issue with the game freezing.  Beware this game takes advantage of those who have set up their kindle account with &quot;ONE TOUCH PURCHASE&quot;..  Disable this feature or be like the many others that pay for unknown items
B0043RSJ8G|3.0|While I have read, and usually loved, every other Jodi Picoult book, Sing You Home was not my favorite. While it was a very good book and kept my attention, it was not very good compared to Jodi's other books. I felt like she didn't give the characters and relationships enough time to develop so they weren't fully believable. The beginning of the book was amazing -I couldn't put it down! (MIGHT INCLUDE SPOILERS) However, despite the first chapter describing Max and Zoe's relationship in such detail, the rest of the chapters lacked just that. The only character who I felt had depth was Lucy and I never got an ending to her story. I was left wondering what she meant in Vanessa's office, what she told her parents, what happened to her, etc.<br /><br />As for Picoult's one-sideness, while I agree with her view completely I love how her books always make me second guess my beliefs, which this one never did. This book simply made me angry at \\"the other side.\\" I have to admit I was looking for a story like Nineteen Minutes where I actually sympathized with, or at least understood, the shooter.<br /><br />While this book is a good read since it is a Jodi Picoult, it is not her best. I suggest Jodi Picoult fans read it to complete the collection, but readers new to this author should definitely try almost any of her other books.
0547884591|5.0|This book is very well written, with the authors personality indented in each page, the layout is very clean and easy to follow.<br /><br />As far as this being the only way to do things not really, this is only the authors way of getting things done in the simplest way he know how and a formula to follow so you can apply thyis to any other thing that you would like to master.<br /><br />All in all a good read.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|i could not see the movie at all ,because was the wrong region!!!!!!and i couldnt find anywhere a way to contact you about it ,in fact this is the second movie that comes with this problem, so i will NOT PURCHASE MOVIES FRON YOU AGAIN!i bought two Tango movies last year! one was a gift and only one of them play on my dvd player,i end up buying the movie midnight in Paris here<br />regards<br />Edith
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great way to pass the time very fun and doesn't pressure you to buy things with real money. worth the download!! :)
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is LOADS of fun! But, the problem with this game is that it's nearly impossible to complete. You have to use real money to get the large amounts of gems to buy ponies like Rarity and Rainbow Dash that are NEEDED to complete this game. Those poines are 2000 gems or more. That's over $250 of real money! Plus there is no comformation box when you<br /> buy gems. Little kids and accidentally spend loads of money on the credit card your device is connected to. A wonderful game but impossible to complete D:
B0086700CM|5.0|This app was totally addictive I realy cant find words to describe it. I almost unlocked everything in only 2 days.To call this great is an understatement
B00A757EFW|4.0|classic. the controls have a definite learning curve. I just swipe my finger and ignore the joystick. this is what I recommend.
1400069289|5.0|This is an engaging and informative book. Who do I say skip to the appendix? Because that's where the lessons of the book are distilled into a set of steps you can take to break an old habit and replace it with a new one. But I say this to some extent tongue-in-cheek, because the book is so engrossing that you will be soon at the end and right into the appendix.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games are an allegory. It shows the nature of human beings, how evil we are. It is a great book!!!
1400067820|1.0|Taleb's books are hard to read. I did not find it worthwhile to labor through all the difficult words in his book Antifragile. He goes at length to justify the need for a new word \\"antifragile\\" but there already is a word in the English language for the phenomenon he tries to describe--it is ADAPTIVE!  My guess is that he will dismiss it and say, I (the reviewer) did not understand his idea.<br /><br />***Please read interesting and more rigorous stuff under the following keywords: Complex Adaptive Dynamical Systems***<br /><br />What Taleb calls \\"fragile\\", the literature calls \\"turbulent\\" or \\"chaotic\\"--e.g. storms, clouds, smoke from a cigarette, etc. Such systems or phenomena have positive feedback and, thus, small disturbances can quickly amplify into chaos.<br /><br />What Taleb calls \\"robust\\", the literature calls \\"stable\\"-- systems with focal (equilibrium) points called \\"attractors--e.g., our solar system is stable and most manmade systems are designed with negative feedback to stabilize them against small or intermediate shocks. In some systems, we like having negative (stabilizing) feedback mechanisms because unanticipated shocks could destroy a system, forever, with much loss--e.g. if there is smoke in a building, it is best to automatically turn on the water sprinklers (which are stablizers).<br /><br />What Taleb calls \\"antifragile\\", the literature calls \\"adaptive\\".  Most Darwinian systems are adaptive and evolving systems. The risk of letting such systems continue without stabilizers is that some shocks could destroy them, forever.  But allowing them to absorb small or intermediate shocks lets them mutate, adapt, evolve and produce diversity and complex beauty as long as they do not get purged in the process.<br /><br />For some systems, capable of learning, adapting and evolving, it is beneficial to introduce shocks and letting them develop immunity so that they can survive future unanticipated shocks. But with other some systems--like, passive ETFs (exchange traded funds) or index funds--there is no gain from introducing shocks (volatility). Consider zero-mean continuous symmetric (positive and negative) shocks (as experienced in financial markets) to passive investment portfolios--it eats the capital. Only if the shocks are rewarded with sufficiently large positive return does the ETF survive, over time, the thousands of cuts and bruises from daily shocks. How large and positive does the reward have to be? It depends on the size of the variance of the shocks.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|A different kind of film for these times. Harkens back to a time when movies were an elegant source of escapism. Part 'Pink Panther' part 'the man who knew too much' and a little early James Bond thrown in. Not boring as some reviewers stated, just slower moving than most modern films, building to a crescendo. Depp is always good, although he affects a sort of weird accent, sometimes euro sounding, for a Wisconsin shcool teacher. Jolie is at, maybe, her most beautiful and elegant here, and  her walk in her slinky gowns just grab your attention and dont let go until the scene changes. Not the best movie Ive  ever seen, but definately worth a watch.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was another good solid story.  If you are a Harry fan, this won't disappoint and there was a loose end left that I hope shows up in the next Harry.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I was sad when I learned of R.E.M's retirement last year. While it's always a gloomy day when you learn that one of your favorite artists is calling it quits, it's easier when you know they're going out on a high note. In R.E.M.'s case, Collapse Into Now is the best possible way to close the curtain.<br /><br />One aspect that makes this record so appealing is the ability to hear pieces of the band's past in every track. Each song is sprinkled with hints of the group's previous efforts: you'll hear the alternative guitar of Monster and New Adventures in Hi-Fi, the mandolin-driven folk pieces of Out of Time, the alternative energy of Murmur and Lifes Rich Pageant, and the pensive ballads of Automatic for the People and Reveal. However, it would be a mistake so assume that the band simply repeating themselves. Instead they've managed to encompass their entire discography in one complete package. Every track is solid and I honestly can't pick a song that I would consider filler. From the soaring choruses of \\"Mine Smell Like Honey\\" and \\"It Happened Today\\" to the soft touches of \\"Every Day Is Yours to Win\\" and \\"Walk It Back\\", there's something for every fan to enjoy and plenty to entice newcomers to look into their previous efforts.<br /><br />I'll miss hearing new music from these guys, yet this album and their extensive back catalogue will always be there to come back to. Collapse Into Now is a life-affirming swan song that shouldn't be missed.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. Beautiful romantic story and great actors. Love it and i will recommend it to everyone
B005ZHB84U|5.0|We love the Sherlock Holmes movies. This one is as good as the first and we're hoping there is a third!
B007RE0RR8|3.0|I recommended. Nice doll, clothing interrested, handsome packing, awsome accessories. Great ideas of this productor named Mattel. I LOVE IT.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|So enjoyed it ourselves, we purchased it as Christmas gifts. We are sure our friends will enjoy it as much as we do.
B007ADIRDM|3.0|I recommended. Nice doll, clothing interrested, handsome packing, awsome accessories. Great ideas of this productor named Mattel. I LOVE IT.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! He's been a Pat Metheny fan for years. Just more great music!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I did something I rarely do. I watched a movie before I read the book. I kind of don't regret it though; the whole book I could \\"see\\" what I was reading. The book was of course better, and I just bought the rest of the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this app to a Kindle Fire for an 82 year old man to use.  It is easy to play and manipulate.  I believe it will be a good app for him to practice with and learn how to use his Kindle Fire's touch screen and functions better while playing a familiar game.
0385535147|5.0|I started reading this on the plane ride as we left town for the Christmas holiday thinking it would be a good time filler in between family activities. Instead, the book drew me in, like all Grisham books do, from the very first paragraph, and I couldn't put it down. I got in trouble a couple times for sneaking back to my room to keep reading its that captivating a story. I can't wait for the Racketeer to be a movie with Halle Berry as Vanessa!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The movie was humorous in a few parts but as a complete flick it was lame.  (Four more words required, thats lame too.)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I found the power cord worked perfect. It appears to be longer than the original. I have had no problems with it.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Exceptional, if you like old movies & the Special Features are packed with things you may not know about this classic film & it's<br />icons who star.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I like the hard shell cover. It really protects my kindle fire. The strap keeps it securely closed and the screen protected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome I really want to find it somewhere else to restart it I hope you guys like it
0689853637|5.0|I buy Sabuda for my grandkids supposedly, but I may enjoy his ingenuity even more than they do. Each time we open one of his pop ups, we discover something new.
B009E9R2OK|5.0|Awsome concert, LZ at their best. Great surround sound, just don't know why they edited it with 1 to 2 second camera changes, way to fast. Still gave it a 5 because of the great band performance and sound.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought this was a great book.  Cute plot.  I really liked the Characters that was used.  I would read again
B0095XPZBC|3.0|It's undeniably exciting to see this season looking so much better than it did on DVD or VHS, but... compared to Season 1, it's disappointing. I don't know what happened, but some episodes look remarkable, and some look pretty sub-standard. \\"The Schizoid Man\\" in particular leapt out as a particularly bad transfer; I've got nothing against grain, it's just that there's a general lack of sharpness, and lazy effects remastering (compared to the stunning job done on the first season).<br /><br />Of course, everything else is great (sound, special features, etc). The thing is, if the first release had been this quality, we all probably wouldn't have known the difference.. but because the Season 1 blu-ray set the bar so high, this mysterious drop in quality is quite puzzling. Still, an essential release TNG fans.<br /><br />You need a 1080p Riker beard in your life..
B000AY74OG|5.0|I can't wait until Christmas so I get Madagascar 3, since I have enjoyed all of the Madagascar movies.  It feels good to laugh at things for a change, with so much bad stuff going on in the world.  Keep up the good work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this game.  Solitaire is one of my favority games to play.<br />Would recommend this game to everyone  of any age.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We purchased this as a gift for a friend with small children.  The children at seen part of the movie and really wanted to see all of it, so we purchased it for them.  They enjoyed it immensely.
B004D9FLJE|4.0|Though I only gave it 4 stars because I learned after purchasing it, most seasons of Glee are available free in streaming on Netflix!  I may return this because of that, so if you have Netflix streaming--you may not have to buy this!
B000002GJH|5.0|Some people say Cornell is overrated, but this and Euphoria Morning, Down on the Upside, Badmotorfinger and Superunknown are constant sources of inspiration. Maybe because I'm a musician and a writer of sorts, or maybe because I have good taste in music, or maybe I'm in a fantasy where no one agrees. Don't care. Love.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Visually this movie is gorgeous.  I go back and forth on my feeling for Bill Murray--sometimes I love him in movies, other times, not so much, but he's great in here.  As is Bruce Willis, but the kids steal the show.  The little boy in his nerdy hipster glasses was fantastic.  We weren't expected to enjoy this so much, but both my husband and I did.  And I love the title too.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you are new to cooking this book will be tremendously helpful. I already cook a lot so I enjoyed the meta learning sections more. There were also some odd tips that I really liked plus the stuff on entertaining was fun. This book was not as life changing for me as the four hour work week or four hour body but I still put it as a must read for anyone interested in learning, cooking or the writing of Tim Ferriss.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Without trying to spoil it. I thought this book had a good beginning, a great middle, and an unsatisfying ending. Through some parts I couldn't wait to see what would happen next, and through most of the body I was really turning pages. At the end, I felt that the author just wanted to finish, which was too bad.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I got the game for 3$.loved it. until I beat 2 levels, yes you heard me 2 levels then it says I have to spend 2$ to get another level. what a rip off rovio
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain's story Quiet is a wonderful testament. The book is well researched and insightful. She has a video on Ted Talks that talks about her journey and life. I love her story and I loved the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I try to mix up different authors and this was my first read of John Grisham, so to be fair I can't compare to any of his other books. I did think the story moved well, but allot of x'tra info (judicial ) that I didn't care for personally, but it was a good read and I enjoyed all of the characters, and good plot and not to much drama.
B009C7JS14|5.0|You never have to guees what the where is anymore-anywhere. I used to have to wait for the local weather on the &#34;8's&#34;. But now I don't. It's great.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|Usually, I don't do many reviews of movie soundtracks.  This time I got the album before I saw the movie!  The movie only cemented a fondness for the music.  Get it, Enjoy it, and tell all your mates!
B006FE83UE|5.0|This movie is a classic, and for good reason--- everyone should watch it at least once.  I've seen 'To Kill a Mockingbird'  several times. My latest purchase of this movie was to replace my VHS version.  In addition to excellent acting and an excellent story line, it portrays history the way life was in America in the 1940s.  There are some valuable lessons to be learned in this film.
B007THA4FI|4.0|great character development and unexpected twists later in book. a bit surprisingly sexual for rowling. small town drama will keep you turning pages.refreshingly different read with an ending that makes you think.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|this was a really good book. didn't think I was going to like it at first but had a hard time putting it down
0525478817|5.0|A funny, poignant, and moving novel that draws you into a world that is unfamiliar to most of us and reveals how various characters react under gruesom pressures. If you like to have your thoughts and sensibilities challenged wjhile being made to feel different emotions, you will love this book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This in my opinion is the standard. Lots of different events put together telling the whole story. Unlike many books, this one has an &#34;ending&#34;
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm only half way through it because I'm too busy with the holiday but I wish I could read it all the way through.  I hate to put it down.  His writing is superb, you get so caught up in the characters and story.  I think he could write an insurance manual and make it interesting.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Mr. Vonnegut tells a very good story, it is in the way he bounces it around that I found distracting. I understand it is essential to the story, it just seemed over used. I am by no means any type of expert however :-)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game to pass time and its just like any other war GAMES!!!!!!!!  I WOULD RATE THIS 5 STARS IF I WERE YOU!!!!!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|What I appreciated about the novel is how the author established the protagonist in the story and how everything about him is interesting.<br /><br />Having said that, what I appreciated the most is how there's a chapter in the book by the author talking about how the idea for the book started and how he designed everything else later on which is a seriously good read for those who are interested in writing their own fiction.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading the book now, there's a big chance that you have already seen the movie like myself, and I can assure you, even though you have seen the movie the book is still an enjoyable read and for that I give 5 stars.<br /><br />Fahad H.
0810983915|5.0|Fun, engaging series for boys (well probably girls too)!  My son has done every bookshare this year (3rd grade) on a Wimpy Kid book - next quarter we're bringing the dog to school!
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is hysterical and tackless a lot of the problems people in their 20s/30s face in a very comical manner.
B008F9E306|5.0|I've been a T.I fan since the beginning of his rap career, and he never fails to impress me. I bought this CD with confidence. I knew as soon as I purchased it, the songs were going on my IPOD, and the CD was going in my cd player in the car. I would highly recommend any TI music to anyone who is looking for geniune,and real music. T.I is always at his best.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|From Megan Markle to Gabriel Mact this show is hot! The cast does an amazing job and the show is very well written. It's funny, but also has a great plot about a kid trying to decide if he has what it takes. Love this show and can't wait for its return in January.
0375507256|4.0|I'm not quite sure what stops me from giving this book five stars. It was, in a word; excellent. I enjoyed the stories quite a bit, particularly An Orison of Sonmi~451. I think one reviewer writes that he had trouble getting through the first story because of disinterest. This was not the case for me in the slightest, I ate it up and questioned whether we were discussing the same book.<br /><br />I thought the way Mitchell connected the stories was solid, but not quite as intricate as others praise had lead me to believe it would be. Perhaps I should have disregarded that information though. If a person read this book without any preconceived notions surely they would be surprised at the way Mitchell weaves the fibers of the different stories into a single fabric.<br /><br />This might sound crazy, but I would have liked it if this book was more challenging to read. I like to be faced with obstacles that force my brain to jump into fifth gear when I read and I did not really feel like this book did that. It was very well written, especially considering the assortment of linguistic styles, but it rarely ever made me slow way down and go back a page or two to try to shore up what was really happening.<br /><br />Overall; an excellent story. Unique as all get out. When the first story ended I had to check the book several times to make sure it was actually supposed to end there and that my book was not defective. Would happily recommend it to someone but at the same time, I would also be likely to give them a copy of my book because I don't feel like it is one I will pick up again for quite some time. Four out of five.
0767903862|5.0|great story of events and how they effect the person as they travel.  Informative and interesting about something i may never see but now can better appreciate.
B000059TFO|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Great story and filmed so well. It's well worth watching and owning. A movie you can watch many times and still enjoy.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this as a present for a friend and they said that so far it works great and that they love it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|is a very good product ... highly recommended especially luxury packaging and design of their albums, is a perfect purchase
B0063IH60K|4.0|Definitely keeps you into the game. A simple game that makes you use your eyes. I have enjoyed the game so far. No issues or complications.
B002M9WW30|5.0|is a very good product ... highly recommended especially luxury packaging and design of their albums, is a perfect purchase
B00008G6EZ|4.0|Don Giovanni:  The music was wonderful, the acting superb, the staging well done, but I'm conservative and old fashioned.  Most operas seem to allude to illicit sex, adultery, drunkenness, murder, etc.  I don't understand why just about all operas have to violate the laws of decency.  Why can't some operas be wholesome and uphold family values?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not my kind of book......interesting, but predictable.......I have no interest in reading the rest of the series.....I read it during a Hawaii vacation and had other things to do.....
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|I earlier thought the one most-popular song was the best song on the album.  The other songs are significantly abstract and at first I thought they were a bit rough to listen to.  At first, this CD sat on my shelf untouched for just over a year.  Then, I came across a few of the more abstract songs in my iPod and I listened closely and was awed by the meticulousness, detail and creativity of this music.  All the different sounds of the song \\"State of the Art\\" are quite artistic and unlike other mainstream music, but I really got to like that song and then onto the rest of the album.  There are probably 7 songs that are real good.  I am now hooked on Gotye music.  So, if you are unfamiliar with his music it might take a while, but I think you'll like it.  A friend of mine listened to it and liked it all right off the bat, so maybe you'll like it all right away.  Have fun.
B005KR6NS6|4.0|This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again.  The Argentine Tango danciing is the highlight of the movie.  Story is intriguing; but the dancing is amazing!
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I pre-ordered this.  It is great!  The CD is great and the DVD is even better.  There are about FIVE extra live songs on the DVD than on the CD.  The DVD also has additional video of the band members.  I ended up purchasing four more copies of this CD/DVD to give to family to get them listening to Coldplay, as this is the best introduction to the band, in my opinion.  The one thing I would change is that I would just cut out the f*bomb that Chris Martin drops about six times once in a while in the album.  It is not a big deal, but it is something that can just be edited out.  When I bought the gifts for family, I bought the CLEAN version, not the EXPLICIT version as I knew it would be unquestionably loved.  I wish, when ordering it it would have been more clear.  Regardless, even with the occasional word, I still listen to this over and over and love it.
034580404X|4.0|I'm not much of a reader at all, and it took me a while to get into it with the first book, but once you pass the boring, non-eventfull introduction, watch out!!  The first book is quite...juicy!!  Not for the modest...lol<br />I'm almost done with the second one, and it was very good to read, and kept me intrigued...
B009SQRL4U|4.0|a treat!  i expected little, but was surprised at the wit and humor,  it was sharp, funny, and touching.  Worth watching
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I've had this on DVD forever, but the graphic fidelity on Blu-Ray cannot be beat!  Always a classic to watch on halloween and before christmas!
9500426404|5.0|I had read this book long ago and I loved it! It's appropiate for children and adults. An imaginary story that makes several profound and idealistic observations about life and human nature.
B009FZFONO|5.0|What can i say?  If you dont like The Walking Dead, then something is wrong with you!  Such an awesome show...and im waiting on the remainder of season 3 to finally start up again.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This movie goes back and shows where it all started. Awesome. Money well spent. This movie gives you a better understanding of what happened in the past.
B004G6009K|5.0|These Disney films continue to draw in all age groups with the witty dialog and interesting story lines.  Great animation!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|When you see the VETS in this movie you get choked up. This is a great combination of SciFi and the military today.
B000KOZMUE|3.0|Much better than the flash on my Nikon D80, but I was hoping for a bit more light out of this unit.  Though much more inexpensive than other flash units, you get what you pay for, as this model was fairly cheap.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|What more can be said? This is the best Living Dead Series ever!!! Well worth the money and time to watch this series.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really cool game for the kindle fire hd and fun and I highly recommend getting this game but it takes really long to load but it it is worth it
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|All the great Clancy characters in a current day setting. If you like the Jack Ryan novels, and I've read them all, you're going to love this one.
B000B5XOSO|2.0|I had good memories seeing the Batman movies as a kid, when rewatching them (such as Batman Returns), those memories were immediately shot.  The plot lines are somewhat bizarre and the character development leaves something to be desired.  Its one of those movies you watch once, and then don't ruin it by watching it again.  Proceed directly to the Dark Knight series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Is love this app.  Just a simple thing but I find myself using it all the time. I love the large keys<br />5stars from me
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As addicting as Angry Birds. Just can't put it down. This could be a real time sucker. There's b problaby something else I should be doing. Right!
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|As other reviews have stated, this is not a way to learn how to play the piano, but a game to press the buttons to hear some music.<br />Unfortunately the buttons on the Kindle Fire HD are not equipped to handle this game and when you press the buttons on your Kindle to play a note on the Piano Master, it is too late and not recognized by the game.  No matter how fast you press your buttons (which is the goal of the game) it's not fast enough for the game to recognize.
B00917IQFY|5.0|Quality from start to finish. You can hear the fun all the way through this album. Sounds like they have been playing together for all these years.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|simple and fun I love it! regent could be faster but what ever i enjoy it plud more then 1 game after so long
B007URVZJ6|2.0|I downloaded it to my Kindle with every anticipation of being able to read, learn, and eventually publish.  When I opened it, I discovered the print was slightly smaller than phone-book printing and very hard to read.  Maybe I can fix it so its visible, but sheesh!  Usability nearly zero!  I may be able to expand the thing, but as for being readable on a one-year-old Kindle, forget it.  It is very annoying to have useful information, needed information, that is not accessible on the device it purports to be developed for.<br /><br />Don't bother trying to expand the image, either; a lot of the instructions are full page, filling the screen with microscopic type and remember, no vertical movement.  I finally had to go to the \\"letter size\\" settings and re set the whole thing so I could read it. This messes up the pagination and makes it harder to read,another disappointment.  Now I have instructions on one page and the illustrations on another. Groan.  Every other thing  I have ordered from Amazon for my Kindle came in a readable format without having to fiddle with things.  Not this one, bad idea for a budding writer trying their \\"Ice Breaker\\" on Amazon who isn't sure what they need to do.<br /><br />Maybe I can order it already printed.  At least that way I can read it.  To give you an idea of what I mean, take a look at \\"The Fine Print\\" on this screen.  The text I received is SMALLER THAN THAT!  I foresee many headaches and magnifier-hours trying to get to the information in this if there isn't a pre-printed version.<br /><br />What a disappointment from a business on which I had planned to publish.  This is targeted at new people; bad idea.<br /><br />So now with my handy-dandy notepad and pen I'll turn it into usable instructions which Amazon should have already done.  Meh; at least now I know what I need to do for publication here.
B000UV8L8W|4.0|It sounds good, there are a few good songs on there. But, it is no Neil and Crazy Horse album.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|Well, I ordered Born to Die first and fell head over heels in mad mad love. I seriously have not listened to anything else. I bought Paradise with the same expectations. The lyrics are just as great, but it's much slower. I'm certainly not playing it as much as Born.
B000SVRVDU|4.0|It sounds good, there are a few good songs on there. But, it is no Neil and Crazy Horse album.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Overall I would give this movie two thumbs up. My only issue is the story is a bit slow and disjointed for the first maybe 30 minutes. The action scenes are great with some great back drops. I personally see this movie as a build up to continue the series using the Aaron Cross character giving him a foot hold into the series and introduction. With the ending so wide open a follow up is in the works.
B000FLHYPS|4.0|It sounds good, there are a few good songs on there. But, it is no Neil and Crazy Horse album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing from start to finish. I had to take moments while reading to just silently fist pump how FANTASTIC a writer Colleen Hoover is. I got the kindle version, and I need to buy a hardback copy if available because it is THAT good.
B000LXTRN2|5.0|One of Young's best albums! Crazy Horse really helps bring the music here! Must have for a Neil Young fan!
B00003CXA2|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase.  The 2 disc special collector's edition is great.  This is a great find.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app will not show more than 5 or 6 post. Not even worth having at this point. Very frustrating.
B00005JPCF|5.0|This is a great movie.  I actually purchased it to have when at my home for my grandson and me
B000HT3P7E|5.0|We are very happy with our purchase of How I Met Your Mother season one. It's awesome! Its a 3 disc set . We are very happy with the price and it was delivered in a very timely manner and in great shape. We would highly recommend buying this TV show.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Fantastic movie at great price
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|We are very happy with our purchase of How I Met Your Mother season 2. They arrived in a very timely manner and they were in great shape when they arrived. We would recommend this to everyone
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is the most useful application I have period. The graphics are sharp and its capabilities are more than I even knew I needed. After using the free version for a while and becoming dependent on its usage the next step is to \\"tip\\" the developers for their hard work. . . A program of this sort would probably cost BIG bucks. Be thankful you're only paying pennies for such an excellent piece of technology~!~
031620157X|5.0|I loved this book.  Brought back stories/characters from my youth.  Gave them more depth and extended fairy tales you thought had ended.  Everything was well connected by the sister/brother characters.  Glad this actor/singer tried his hand at writing.  Well worth the read.  Enjoyed it and brought a smile.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|all time favorite Tim Burton movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Love it. Also Nightmare Before Christmas is my 2nd favorite Tim Burton Movie.<br />Bye.
B00A757EFW|2.0|If only it was the full version. but since it isn't I do not ha e fun with it. What the Heck!
B000UD0ESA|4.0|Ok. It seemed a little different than my feble memory, I though it was missing a few things, still a good flick.
B000FDECGA|5.0|I own 7 movies, in my movie collection i have this and this is one of all time favorites, this movies is very creative and a piece of art.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Hi<br /><br />It was a few hours of a bit of entertainment and the ending was nice, but can still give a Teddy Bear to a young child....I think there's a good chance I wouldn't after seening TED.
1781161097|1.0|I am a big fan of \\"art of..\\" books. LOTR trilogy, star wars trilogy, Art of Star Trek and so forth, so I was super excited to see The Art Of Prometheus was out! But I am totally disappointed with it. My biggest gripe is that they show very little of the creative process in it. People who get \\"art of..\\" books expect to see all the ideas, all the concepts, all the things that could have been. It's like a brain storming session in concept art. That's the fun part of these books, to see the process and to see how they arrive at the final designs that appear in the finished film. But this book actually tells you, \\"we had our design team take a crack at what the creature should look like...\\" but they don't show you. They skip the whole conceptual process to show you the finished design. All they show you is a bunch of hurried crummy photoshop images of final designs. Or the final design with a bunch of variations on what color the ship or creature or what have you. Very disappointing as this is a visual movie, with tons and tons of ships, characters, creatures and so forth. To get my meaning, crack open a Art Of The Lord Of The Rings, and compare it to The Art Of Prometheus.
0525478817|5.0|This author is amazing. I loved this book very much and I will buy all of his books from now on.
B0053O89IS|5.0|A terrific series, can hardly wait for #8!! It was a bit different with the. birth of the baby but we are getting used to it
B008NEVP1S|4.0|As usual, the songs take some listening to appreciate. Her sound is unchanged here, I do like some of the George Harrison guitar riffs. This is on my list of top albums of 2012. If only I can remember how to spell her first name, that would be good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|JUST HAD TO SEE THE WHOLE SEASON 2 AS SOON AS I FINISHED SEASON 1.  CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT SEASON!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|It's a mixure of rock, R&B, Motown, mixed in with a more modern sound. The Hendrix riffs are an addition here.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|TAKES ME FAR, FAR AWAY TO A SIMPLER MORE BEAUTIFUL TIME!!  I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT SEASON!  WONDERFUL!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm enjoyed it & am glad I read it, but I'm still not sure what all the hype was for.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What a great insight into a troubled genius!  The Apple story plus Steve Job's story weave a &#34;can't put down &#34;book!  Purchased this while in MOscow airport for a 10 hour layover.  Made the time fly by!  I suggest this to all.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone.  It absolutely was my favorite book this year.  The characters were so well drawn & I became invested in them and the story.  I didn't want it to end.
B000009ED0|5.0|was on time and in great sh ape word word word  word  word word  word  word  word  word  word  word
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|This app is a simple and fun way to learn the melodies of a lot of famous Christmas songs. I've been playing the piano for 15 years, but this app presented a challenge because you are not reading music, but pressing notes to a rhythm that is sometimes hard to determine. I'm using a kindle fire (first generation) which operates on a two-point multi-touch system, meaning that it can only register two pressure points on the screen at a time. This is a pretty severe issue for this app and others like it because most of the songs require you to play three note chords, which my kindle cannot do. If there were a &quot;chord toggle&quot; option to let you turn off the three note combinations and give you a two note equivalent, this app would be much better. The addition of a metronome or other rhythm/tempo signifier would also be fantastic so you know the pace of the song.<br /><br />In short, if you have a first generation kindle fire or other device that uses a two-point multi-touch, don't bother with this app unless you are willing to accept the poor scores you will receive on songs because you cannot play chords.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have a weak spot for good science fiction and this is good science fiction. If you enjoy reading something with a lot of gritty reality seen though the protagonist's tongue in cheek humor while avoiding his certain demise over and over, this will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you are a<br />sci-fi fan then this should be in your library. I thoroughly recommend it to you. Enjoy.
B008C20TDG|3.0|I disagree on some of the paleo principals and that is what this book is about. I think I lean more Vegan but if you are looking for a good solid paleo diet book, this would be a good choice.
1455523003|4.0|In 1995 Twelve, the publishing company that prints no more than twelve books a year, published, \\"The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice,\\" by the always iconoclastic Christopher Hitchens. \\"Missionary Position\\" is an attempt to unmask the real Teresa of Calcutta, and determine whether she was a saintly woman, a charlatan, or a well intentioned but ineffective do-good-er. In Hitchens' own words, \\"...I began the project of judging Mother Teresa's reputation by her actions and words rather than her actions and words by her reputation...\\" (103). Brilliant!<br /><br />As I sat down to read Hitchens' short book, I asked myself what I actually knew about Mother Teresa. All that I could say with certainty was that she was an Albanian nun, who built hospitals for the poor, received numerous honorary awards, and gained beatification under pope John Paul II.  Ask most people to list everything they know about her and I imagine not much could be added to my list except maybe that she was one of the greatest persons to ever live. After reading, \\"Missionary Position,\\" I'm not sure I share in the beatified view of Mother Teresa.<br /><br />Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, as she was nominated by pope John Paul, had a philosophy that suffering was good for the soul because therein one participated in the sufferings of Jesus Christ. This philosophy was pushed to the logical conclusion that the alleviation of one's suffering by means of modern medicine  was unwarranted because it removed the \\"passions\\" participation. In all of her hospitals Mother Teresa refused patients analgesia, including morphine to terminal cancer patients. Individuals with life threatening, final stage cancer would be given aspirin during cutting procedures. Morphine kills the experience of sharing in Christ's sufferings, and who wants that? Of course we are not surprised that when she was severely ill she went to the best hospitals money could buy to cure herself. There are numerous accounts like this and worse.<br /><br />Teresa also collected millions of dollars in charitable contributions (one account alone had $50 million), none of which were used to adequately cure the poor but instead used to build beds for them in hospitals. For Teresa the end of poverty was not a possibility because we need the poor. The money was a sign that God approved of her practices. She even publicly said that she would not help rich people, only the poor, yet she had no problem taking the money of the rich. She had the funds to cure the poor she \\"served\\" but instead she sought to cure the poor spiritually by promoting their poverty. There was even an occasion where she had to testify against a man who stole $252,000,000 from investors because she received $1,250,000 in contributions from the man; she never returned the money, even upon formal request.<br /><br />I'm not sure I completely agree with Hitchens when he concludes that she was a full on deceiver but I cannot accept the view I previously held that she was a saintly do-good-er. Her methods were medieval, and remind me of an individual seeking the stigmata. Perhaps Mother Munchausen would be a more appropriate title.ke this and worse.<br /><br />Teresa also collected millions of dollars in charitable contributions (one account alone had $50 million), none of which were used to adequately cure the poor but instead used to build beds for them in hospitals.

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This was a very good book. Frank Baum gives absolutely wonderful imagery, so reading the book is almost like watching a movie. I could barely put down the book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is great.  This is definitely one of the best zombie books written.  The concept alone is refreshing and takes the genre in yet another direction.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Emma stone, woody from cheers, And mark Zuckerberg.... They frolicked around the rest of the planet. I love it, very twist turn and heartwarming moment,
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The first half or so was disjointed and kept the viewer in the dark.  The story line was weak.  Not the quality of the other Bourne movies.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This is one dull & silly movie. Pointless & not worth watching. I had hoped for something a lot better.<br />.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This a great calendar. I use it to keep up with all my classes and all the events going on in college. It's really easy to use and everything can be color coded. Also, it's really easy to make event that occurs regularly for a certain time-span (i.e. every Monday at 2 from 1/3/13 to 3/4/13).<br />The only slight drawback is that it has to be hooked up to a gmail account (or something similar) and it seems like it could be self-contained. But this is such a small drawback that it doesn't even lose a star.
B008MZPVP4|3.0|Seems a little jam-based and less refined and focused as some of the other efforts.  Down 1 and 3 still their best.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is worth every penny. It is a good product. I would recommend to every one who needs a standard camera bag.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I demolished this book in under three days, despite a crushing work schedule, holiday shopping chaos and more. And I wish there was more--I couldn't get enough!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|What do you say about a fan or a mop.  This works, is easy to use AND is FREE.  Love it.
B009ZQGNPQ|3.0|...I can't help but feel manipulated when any Victoria era film about the British aristocracy fails to hold Britain accountable for the despicable manner in which those gargantuan fortunes were made--e.g., slave trading, the Boer atrocities and Opium Wars, not to mention the subjugation of India or the deportation of orphans and foster children to the colonies for exploitation.<br /><br />My ratings of all such British propaganda films will take these issues into consideration until there's an apology by the British Crown.
B009KZMFOA|1.0|The full orchestration overpowers Kaas and she sounds like she is singing in a cave.<br />If they just left her voice alone instead of adding reverb, and accompanied her with a guitar and piano<br />and accordian to make it seem like a cabaret atmosphere, it would be a more fitting tribute.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I keep running out of coins. then have to wait &amp;wait.  thinking about taking game off my kindle fire . unless you want to buy coins don't bother!!!!!!!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Gave this as a gift to a high school senior. Went over we'll with the whole family. No pieces to lose.
B007MDQW3W|4.0|I really like most of this album. However, as a big Regina fan, I was a little disappointed that the album wasn't longer after two years since her last album. Also a lot of the songs weren't really new, just unreleased. Either way, it's a nice album, and there was no way I wasn't going to buy it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was amazing.  The imagery and beautiful language with which the author paints what life was like for citizens of Germany during WW2 is breathtaking.  It is a perspective we don't often see in books about the war.  The narrator is Death but the story is about a little girl.  It is certainly not a book limited to young adults.  I will definately be loaning this book out.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|this is one of the best movies every made and i am so happy that i know own this movie.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|Saving this one for our son's bday in the summer but wanted to be sure it didn't go out of stock before we could purchase it.
B00555X8OA|5.0|nice, good an special book...i would definetely recommend this book to improve understanding about how we make decisions in the short and long term.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Our son still loves legos and he loves creating a town.  Such a great idea to have these buildings connect and the details in them are amazing!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I was so happy to get this on my kindle fire! ever since I got it ive been looking for toga boca and now its here!!!! it works great and it doesn't need wi-fi yay!! I love how you can curl and crimp now I just wish they would give you more characters to choose from and be able to do braids and ponytails. it is so worth the money so get it! get it now I say!!! Haha
B00005MKA1|5.0|This is one of the few CDs that every single song is fantastic. I could listen to this album over and over again and be happier every time. Definitely a must-have for any Bob Marley fan.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|Excellent new age blues artist. Good songs that combine elements of classic blues, rock,and r&b with new styles and fresh vocals
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am a Follett fan and have read al that he has written. I dont particulary appreciate his politics but taken with understanding that most authors are left leaning to the point of falling down i like his stories.  His research is impeccable.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie was okay.  Would have shut it off but wanted to see how it ended.  Was kind of long.
B002IW8V0E|5.0|with fun sing-along music and enough humor to make any one want to see it over again.  Better than the live version!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|We do a Polar Express unit at school and the kids love it.  They have so much fun.  It is a nice little Christmas.
0810994739|5.0|It was good! Minimal wear...just the corners worn down a bit but fully intact and the right price! Will have to get the rest of them now
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a little slow to get started, but kept reading. Many twists and turns.  I am going to download and read more of her books. She is a little twisted.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|This live album has the best versions of &#34;Hallelujah&#34; and &#34;Suzanne&#34;  A Terrific selection of songs.  There's some old favorites and some I hadn't heard before
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Amazing deal for the price.  I would have paid more for this item.  good quality protective case and it has a nice stand feature
B0067LY4WG|5.0|No one can turn a phrase like he can.  No one writes about love between a man and a woman like him.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great conclusion to the series. Made me cry so many times but I loved it. Loved the ending the most.
B00003CXD5|5.0|One of the best Huston ever directed, and also of Bogart's acting against type.  Huston's father was superb!  Both earned an Oscar, and this is also one of the best films ever made in my opinion.  A must see!
B0000TB050|5.0|The BEST live concert on CD ever!!!!  Everyone must see/have this!!!  I hope they make it in Blu Ray soon!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This came along with my D7000 kit purchase as a freebie. I preferred a backpack against a toolkit styled DSLR bag which becomes cumbersome to carry. I do not have a telephoto, but have tried to fit the D7k with two primes and two flashes and a travel tripod. None of the items inside juggled or moved out of their place after a long walk. I would have liked an extra strap for holding the body, but for the price I seriously have no complaints.
B000HZGCEG|5.0|It was a great story.  I had previously read the book.  It was very exciting.  Gerard Butler should have gotten top billing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great bible - really love all the different versions. Easy to search, find verses, I like the daily bible verse and study.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I was looking for a game that would challenge my brain but that was also fun and looked good.  This game definitely blew me away and went way beyond my expectations.  I played it through twice; once on easy and the second time on hard.  It was still a lot of fun on the second round through.  I hope that the next part is just as good and continues the great story line that I found in The Ghost of Maple Creek.  I have been hard pressed to find another game like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome you can get more bricks in the game but sutsh a high pride you can kill zombies in the game its not just for kids my sisters play it you can even join people to play the game
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Loved the plot line to this season and the surprise ending...great watch!! (And nothing beats Amazon Prime-the speed of the download and the quality)
0064431789|4.0|I love the illustrations in this book.  There are few words, but the pictures make up for it.  I think it is in every little boy to want to be the king of the wild things.  It's terrible and wonderful at the same time, but in the end it's better to just be a little boy whose mom takes care of him than the leader of a bunch of wild monsters.
0307949508|5.0|Enjoyed the entire trilogy.  Too bad Steig Larsson is gone.  Would have enjoyed more of his work.  Recommend reading this one.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Victor Hugo is brilliant in his portrayal of life.  His story is a wonderful classic.  I was introduced to the musical first, and reading the book is such a joy.  Love, loss, struggle - it's all there.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|The cover alone squicked me out.  I hate stupid books like this. There are too many pointless books that are free and not worth even that cost! I think I read maybe 10 pages before I gave up altogether. You might like this book if you are totally into corny romance.  It seems like every other book is about people getting married by accident.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I enjoy the way Jane Austen writes.  She develops her characters well and by the end I feel like I know each one personally.  Life is dramatic in her portrayal of it, much better than a soap opera!
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I bought this App based on reviews I read. I wish I hadn't, it freezes every time I type a word or want to go back to correct an error. It looks nice on the outside but it just takes too long getting used to.<br /><br />The free note book I downloaded, was much user friendly, I have gone back to it, as I found this one very frustrating. Yes there are Adverts in the free one but it doesn't take forever for me to finish a sentence!!Absolute waste of money, grrr!
B007GFDVEE|3.0|I purchased this as a christmas present for my cousin. It looks like what I expected and I hope he likes it!
B008K9UZY4|1.0|After 2 very long attempts at loading they both failed saying I still needed to free up more memory. I deleted 3 games and it still was not enough. This is just stupid to make any game use that much memory. I want my money back...thank God it was on sale for 99&cent; .
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I don't know about you but killing a bunch of people makes this movie more realistic don't know why people said it was bad I think it was one of the best Transformers movies yet...
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is a tear jerker, but an absolutely beautiful love story, definitely makes you believe in the one and only love lives and how we all have second regrets. It's a book of healing and shows the true power of love also.
B002ZG994U|5.0|The A-team is a must see if you like the old series Liam Neason was I think the best Hannible the guy that played BA Baracus might not have been the best choice but in the end the actors came thru hope they make more in the series or get these guys to  start a tv series maybe as the new A-Team series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i love  facebook  . its a wonderful resource to stay in touch with family and friends  i dont get to see very often
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Disc came with no scratches was perfect loved it watched all the alternate versions show was great think someone else would love it too.
145470246X|5.0|Ms Lippert's book has some beautiful projects. I like her design style, using crystals and seed beads. The illustrations are clear and easy to follow, as well asa the printed text.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Must see watch the Gods go after a kid for theft when the kid doesn't even think the gods are real seriously makes Zeus look like an Idiot...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A great read. This is the first time I have read this book, and I would recommend it highly. Of course the book is a little different from the movie, which is always the case.
B001HN697M|5.0|Must see if you love Vampire and Werewolf movies like all the Underworld movies this one is one of the best too see
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Everything seemed just fine with my purchase, it arrived one day ahead of schedule. However, when I played The Dark Knight Rises, there is a line that moves up and down the screen. I tried the disc in my computer, Xbox, and DVD player and on each one the line is there. Not only that, but the sound quality is pretty awful. The first two discs (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) were just fine. On The Dark Knight Rises disc, in one teeny tiny spot it looks as if the disc is damaged, I'm assuming that is why the sound/video quality is terrible. I give this three stars because it at least comes with copies that you can download to Flixster. So, even though it's a nuisance, I can hook my computer up to my TV and watch the downloaded version. Therefore, this purchase not a complete waste of my money.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Humor and Horror in perfect harmony. No other phrase can describe this film. I've become quite picky as I've gotten older on what movies I label as Great pieces of work, or just mere entertainment. This movie is GRRRRRREAT!
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Loved the product ..I will use this dealer in the future ...Hope ti buy more product as the CD was great
B002XTXG1G|5.0|If you thought you were a big Tom Hardy fan before catching this flick...you'll be an even bigger one after. BRILLIANT performance!! I couldn't stop enjoying the tremendous amount of dedication to such violence. Truly, a MONUMENTAL masterpiece!
B00006WUWN|5.0|I got my dvd of Austin powers quick and was very pleased. I love this movie and the price was unbeatable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book the details made me feel like in was in the arena with Katniss... I felt as if I was my own Katniss! Looking forward to reading the others!
B000063IPX|5.0|All the world should own this! Haven't listened in years and of course it is still as great as ever!!
B0050PYNN0|5.0|this movie is hilarious! did not expect what it was about at all... it was very entertaining to say the least! arrived very fast
B00332CWLW|1.0|I found the book disjointed and there was no real storyline.  I struggled to relate to the main characters and the book kept moving off in different directions with no apparent links to what had gone before.  in the end a vague connection is established between the disparate groups of people .  For me this made the book frustrating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could never have imagined the trip this book was going to take me on. I love the slammed series but this book leaves me hopelessly speachless
B00A31UXLW|3.0|The Black Box starts off fairly slowly and did not draw me in until about 1/3 of the way through the book.  Even then the pace did not pick up until the climax of the book but interest started to build.  Not the best Michael Connelly I have read.
0061091480|5.0|This is yet another very good book by Wayne Dyer. I read it after it first came out many years ago, and decided to review it when I saw it on Amazon. Unlike his later books, this is straightforward psychology, relatable and applicable to everyone and covering every aspect of life. I would highly recommend this book.
B0001FYPZU|1.0|This DVD doesn't work.  I need to contact the company, but I am still looking for the paperwork.  Hopefully I can get this resolved.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great I just love it soooo much it is truly amazing yep I do so should you lol I'm rotes serious
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Great heart as a cartoon. Showing that if you put your mind to it you can some time accomplish your goals even if you are ubaware of what they are at first.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is fun some games are hard I would recommend it though buy it your kids will like it<br />Gghh gghh ggh
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This is The Godfather of High School movies. Wasting extra words on this review is useless. Just go watch it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I try to read some of the classic must read novels every now and then and I have to admit that this book was challenging to read at start. I found the language and accents of some of the characters difficult to understand at first but as you read further into the book, it flows and the plot thickens. I thoroughly recommend reading this book, I won't give away the storyline but I think you should persevere if you find it difficult to take in at first.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|A classic book that  brings the true meaning of Christmas to your heart.  Considering the culture of the time period, Dickens reminds us that love is more important than money and that we have the power and awesome responsibility to make a difference for good in our individual circle of influence.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|Bought this book for my daughter on her Tablet and she just loves it!!!! Easy and fast transaction. No issues or problems at all!!!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This needs no review!  It;s a great movie all around!<br />Finally a super hero movie for adults!<br />A must see!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft may be pricey but it is so worth the payment. If you don't like it your not human your an alien from the boring planet. The game needs buckets,Redstone machinery,a switch that allows you to turn on herobrine,bigger world's,caverns and lastly but most wanted skin studio. People who want it to be exactly like the computer version stop asking it tack up a lot of room and its a lot of work also moaning would loss a lot of money and then no more minecraft. Beside that good job and like I said best game ever.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I absolutely love minecraft and it works fine on my kindle! but the update needs to happen soon! I hope there are: armor,  caves, buckets, the nether,  and redefine to be able to mine. but overall amazing game!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I was nervous about this movie at first Marvel has been doing a good job with their movies lately, but Thor was in my opinion a tough one. Marvel knocked it out of the park!! Good cast and story. This was a beautiful movie to watch. I though Chris Hemsworth did an outstanding job as Thor. I love the comics and i loved this movie. Nuff Said!!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|We have the book and we read it all the time the book is fantastic my kids love it.  As for the film adaptation our whole family loves it,  The Polar Express  is a true Christmas classic.  The animation is amazing but the only quip I would have at first is that the characters can be a little creepy (in a good way).  It takes some getting used to the first time you watch it.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Essentially a highly trained drug addict doing whatever it takes to get one more fix. Tying together footage from earlier movies in the franchise to stretch into a feature.
B004HW7JHE|4.0|But it is good drama. I bought every season on disc because many people rave about it. the main thing I don't like about this show is the fact they do not go back into Don's/Dick's history. I have also never like Peter Campbell. It is a good show, I had high expectations of this show since I love Breaking Bad.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Great price, fast shipping and great product.  We've been getting lego advent calendars for the past few years and the Star Wars theme this year was great.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|This is a great show. I absolutely love Under Pressure with Roger Taylor taking over David Bowie's vocals. Amazing show, you will not be disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Wool by Hugh Howey was interesting, well written and thought provoking.  Being a series of short stories, the characters and plot development kept you guessing and engrossed from novella to novella and it certainly did not end up (at the end of book 5) where I thought it was going to from the beginning of book 1.  I don't like that Amazon's 3 stars is only titled as \\"OK\\". That's why for Amazon I added the 1/2 star because it was better then OK, but just not my favorite. My one tiny complaint that kept this book from being a 4 star for me, was the lengthy descriptions.  Now, this is probably due to my MTV generation brain (does this reference even translate to the younger population) that needs scenes to flash by quickly, so I am totally willing to say that Wool might be a 4 to 5 star for most people.  I just felt that by the end of Wool: Book 4 The Unraveling and Wool: Book 5 The Stranded, some of the scenes were getting a little wordy, not bad if that's your bag, but I like my deep dark cold and spooky scenes wrapped up just a tad more swiftly.  Wool does have a mysterious quality that was intriguing and I love Howey's play on wool and knitting terms.  There is nothing offensive or weird or inappropriate here so the story can hold appeal for a wide variety of ages.  I think my Uncle Bill might like it.  There are several more in the series, so this is not the end.  The Omnibus was nominated on Goodreads for best Sci-Fi of 2012 and won 2nd place with 5,624 votes, therefore my review probably doesn't give it the justice it deserves.  But hey, this is just one middle-aged dame's opinion.
B008MEM24S|5.0|The game is so much fun that I feel bad for the people that don't have this game because it's so much fun!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was introduced to the Walking Dead by my brother.<br /><br />During my first viewing of the Pilot, i was unaware this was based on a comic book series.<br /><br />I have not been so hooked on a show since LOST was still on TV.  Great characters, great action, and an intriguing story line just keep the punches coming.  Can't wait for the Season 3 conclusion, as well as Season 4 to come later on.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Plot was weak, I feel movie was timed to embarrass Gov. Romney by naming the villain Bane. Christian Bale doesn't make a good batman either.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Good quality. Protective and snug fit. Would recommend. Pull out tab is a nice feature.  Don't need a screen protector with this case.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is epic... Mad max meets zombie land humor gore everything good and everything bad... It's a great show!
B0058YPL66|4.0|I just found this series on netflix, I hadn't seen it on tv. I LOVE it! I like any show that is clever and original, as this one is in its way, and the acting and characters are great. Yes it gets a little campy at times, but it's supposed to, it's a fairy tale! It is also an extremely welcome departure from all the reality shows and similar rubbish. The storybook costumes and sets are rich, it's just a beautiful thing to watch. I think Lana Parilla must just be having too much fun being evil as all get out and is superbly cast, Snow White looks like Snow White, except I don't like her too-short present day haircut, her hair should be longer, and is there anyone who could do Rumpelstiltskin and Mr Gold better? Whoever plays them was born to do so! Also, I have seen the episode with the child Snow and could that child look any MORE like her adult counterpart? I don't think so. It is my own bias/preference but everyone who is in the book should have dark hair! Blondes don't belong in fairy tales. The only actors who don't do it for me, in my opinion only, is Emma, who looks and acts like someone from the drug culture,and is blonde and looks nothing like Henry, and the boy who plays Henry is really know it all and annoying. If he is in a fairy tale, he shouldn't have a stupid haircut and that smug, irritating voice. I thought the boys who played Bae and Pinocchio fit the look and feel of the show much better. Also, I am not sure who Henry is supposed to be in the book?<br /><br />I was wondering how they were going to go on with the series, since I thought the endless evil doing by the Queen/Mayor and no one able to do anything to stop her was going to get old. Now I see, as Season 1 is ended, how more troubles are just beginning, as are mine, since I don't have tv and can't see the Season 2 episodes that are on now, and who knows when netflix will have them! Maybe I can make a deal with Mr. Gold...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is exciting, it keeps u wanting to keep reading and not lay it down. Can't wait for the next book!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I'd like to see it provide easier access to seeing all the words around the one I was looking up - like<br />being able to page thru it like my own hardcopy, page by page.
B007MJSQSK|2.0|Fairly mediocre and Tintin has the annoying quality where he has to narrate the whole story to the audience as it's occuring (just in case you were too stupid to understand). Obviously this is a children's movie but even as a kid I would have felt insulted.<br /><br />The story is pretty standard and the animation is fairly nice but probably not worth your time watching unless you're a fan of Tintin.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|The best comedy movie. But not one for the kids thats for sure. I would recommend this comedy to anyone without children.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Pretty good movie. Glad that Willis and Arnold were in this one more. Van Damme made a really good villian I thought. Blu ray looks good and I pre-ordered this and saved about $10. Great deal.
0811879542|5.0|Beat children/adult interaction book. No age can put it down. Thanks Mr. Tullet. I bought one for every family in my child care center for Christmas. They love it.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|Bought this as a gift. I'm not a huge fan of this movie but I remember watching it growing up. Decent price and shipped on time.
B0082EOJYE|5.0|This movie is amazing. I can't get enough. It's never dull for being a silent film and I actually prefer the lack of dialogue. It's perfect. Check it out if you have never seen it.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I really wanted to see this movie in the theater but just couldn't find time. So I preordered it because it looked good and I heard some good things about it and some bad. It's not a horrible movie but the deleted scenes do explain the story better. Blu ray looks good and a decent price for a decent movie.
B002GU605G|5.0|I bought this for my step dad, who is a pretty big fan of these guys. He says he loves this box set, so if you are a fan of this band and have a small collection of their work, buy it.
B004GYY714|3.0|This is an ok app.  However everytime I try to go to a local radio station it takes me to some radio syation in Scotland.  Some of the others do this too.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|Exactly what I expected from primus, Les Claypool never disappoints with anything ever plays a part in, he is a musical artist master,<br />Just a good classic primus sound.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love Susan's spirit. I was so thrilled when she absolutely stunned Simon Cowell. The CD consists of some of my favorites. I don't think anyone who loves show tunes will be disappointed.
B00000295A|5.0|More great funk/electonica music by the modern day funk masters. Great beats, rhythms,  and marvelous bass lines. Keep the soul alive guys!
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love everything that Il Divo does. Having seen them in person makes the CD even more impressive. I have all of their DVD's and CD  this white haired grandmother adores them  !
B005HSL626|5.0|great game. But a warning lots of adds for t-shirts and lunch boxes and all that other stuff .Other than that it is really fun game. I play it a lot.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|If you like SIMS and Scrat, you will be hooked on this game... Not for young kids but certainly good for entertainment.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|fun to hear all the classics used in the movie. A good fun listen. Easy download, my 1st one on amazon. Love the cloud service, great on my pc, tablet and phone.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book cuts through all the BS. it gives clear concise and easy to follow instructions. You will understand how and why exercises must be done and how to do them. The information in his book and all hiis other books will change the way you workout ,how you view nutrtion ,and your use of supplements forever. Not to mention a comprehensive plan that incorporates all three facets. I was one of those gym goers who knew just enough to be dangerous. this book chaged all that  Inow am only interested in gains in strength stamina and visual gains. Becaue in reality we all want to look better get this book look better . Thanks Mike
B005LAII08|5.0|Brave is another great Disney family film and our whole family really enjoyed it. The bluray looked amazing. The digital copy is a great addition.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Grea puzzle game! Challenges your mind and gives you a sense of accomplishment. 4 stars because the music needs to be enhanced.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|So scenes were too graphic, a little less reference to oral sex would have been better for a pg rating.  Uncomfortable at times
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A very witty and timeless story about Santa Claus with a little romance thrown in.  I've watched this movie every Christmas with my kids and still love it as a grandmother!
1451695195|5.0|This is a topic of interest to me so I was glad to get this author's perspective.  Have not read yet, but the delivery time and condition was excellent.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to my Led Zeppelin collection.  As an avid fan I can say I was not disappointed by their performance.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I have long been a fan of Louisa May Alcott and highly recommend Little Women be read to younger children as well as for teens. The engaging girls in this story are examined for their faults as well as their virtues. While it is an old fashioned tale, the message is timeless regarding choices that are made by young people. Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA.
B000I186FW|3.0|Decent movie, but the plot and story line a little weak.  Portman did a great job but overall its one of those movies that wont be so memorable you will be talking about it the next day.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is Sherlock set in modern day London. Benedict Cumberbatch is a brilliant Sherlock and Martin Freeman a perfect Watson as the foil to Sherlock. Cannot wait for more Sherlock stories to be remade by this duo. Make sure to watch the original pilot as it is very interesting how a show of 60 minutes is remade into a show for 90 minutes. Have watched many times and recommended to many friends. A must have!
B003MC5N28|4.0|This was recommended by a friend who is a school teacher.  I have already purchased another in the series.  I did find the book a bit troublling though so be prepared to have to think a little.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Excellent, and it just what I expected. This will be one of those CD that never gets put away. Recorded well.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I had never seen the other movies about these superheroes before watching this movie and have never been into comic books. After watching this movie I started going back and watching the individual characters' movies (Captain America, etc.). Great movie, lots of action, Robert Downey, Jr. Is funny & I would highly recommend. Battle scenes are not bloody or very violent - which was a nice surprise.
B008SVFX96|2.0|Richie sounded good when I heard him on Howard, but the CD sounds overproduced and too electronic. Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Loved this movie. Constant action from start to finish. Amazing stunts that I have never seen in a movie. I really hope this is not the last MI movie with Tom Cruise - this made me hope that more will be forthcoming - and soon!
B0053O89IS|3.0|I thought it was too short compared to other seasons. Only 13 episodes... And it has a lot of baby stuff... The rest is okay, but I thought they should have had at least 5 more episodes
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I would recommend the standard version of this movie. The movie its self is good but the 3D effects are minimal and far from impressive. It looks as though they put just enough in to get the 3D stamp. If you're looking for a movie to show off your 3D setup check out the Avengers 3D.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is fun but I didn't have any wifi. but then I got a signal then the game picture turned to the updated version but it didn't have any Christmas stuff please tell me how to update without losing anything
0345529057|5.0|If you've already seen the tv show, then the books might be kind of boring to read since the first one so far is pretty much identical to the show.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|These are the first few words of the amazon.com product description: \\"Equal parts weepy drama and soap opera\\". This is a profoundly shallow and stupid description of this film. Fire the reviewer, Amazon!<br />The story unfolds intelligently, the acting is believable and first class, and the overall effect is extremely moving. American movies should study this film. U.S. films, first of all, need to craft their stories instead of recycling the same old same old. I have the same advice regarding American casting: stop recycling the same old faces. Please!<br />This movie makes me feel there is hope for the art form of film. American film makers take note!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This series is really hitting it's stride...character development is great and seems to be improving. Sheldon simply gets funnier and quirkier! lol.....
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not one of my favorite Nickolas Sparks books, but it is suspenseful and a quick read. If you're one for a good love we story it's worth the read.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|If you are a child of the 80's...or just remember &#34;Over the Top&#34; with Sly Stallone.....you know what you are getting here. With the exception of a few &#34;Ugh&#34; moments from the kid (child actors typically annoy me lol)...it's a well written and acted summer-type flick.  I was able to find this on Amazon for ~$12 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday week so it was a nice buy. If you can find it for around that, or just want to round out your Hugh Jackman collection, pick this one up. It's cliche, but in a good way ;)
B0091REZMW|4.0|a little slow but good. its fun! I love hidden object games! thank you for the app I look toward to playing!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Easy read, read it in one day. Super fun to read. Loved it. Ha ha get it. Hands down awesome
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love this series. I have read all the books so far. Cant Waite for the next one to come out.
1593082045|5.0|Gotta have this in my mystery library with Chandler, Westlake Van Gulik, Hammett, Parker and many others. The Cl;assic tales that began the craze worl-wide
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fabulous... hones your hand eye coordination and ease of using a stylus on a touch screen... Loads of fun... al most addictive!!! Great for waiting rooms.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My kids love it. I have a 2 & 4 year old and they really liked it. Great family movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's so nice to watch these movies in Blu-ray, so much more clear and to have them all in one box is better yet. If you are a lover of these type of movies, this set is a must.
1608871517|5.0|I love it because I have always been impressed by his look.  Michael Jackson was unique in his style and it is very interested to see how the dressing has been conceived.  It is a fabulous book to have.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Nice app. Simple enough that kids can learn.  No special permissions and ad free. Feels like a game, while you are actually learning.  Good fun.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like the game but can't buy any of the Christmas decorations that pop up when you open the game. They are not in the store.<br />it will take me forever to get the hundreds of hearts I need for goals set by game but it is still fun.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is hysterical and well worth renting or picking up.  A teddy bear that stirs up trouble and swears. Whats funnier than that?
B005K17RU0|4.0|Ive seen better, like the WGN app, but its not available for the Kindle. Good 15 day fore cast, though.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a great adventure  I know people do these things for the reward of achievement in their lives.... This would be really tough and almost impossible ALONE!  For Cheryl it was a cleansing and for me enjoyment.  THANKS
159420411X|5.0|This is a fascinating and highly enjoyable read - it provides many insights on the overall enterprise of prediction and stats. As a data analyst myself, I greatly improved my skills and methods after reading Silver's lengthy blog updates and book.<br /><br />I absolutely don't understand all this ranting and negative reviews here; it can only be explained with jealousy. Don't listen to them and buy the book - you will learn a lot!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of the best written and diverse story's I have ever read.  It holds me totally in the story with shades that fit well in Christians character but I would NEVER choose to read normally BUT, as it did, this story controls and delights!
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this app after playing on a friend's iPad. It is very addictive! I was very pleased that it was available  for Kindle Fire HD and also it is free!!!!! I have only had Temple Run on my Kindle for about three weeks and I have already unlocked all six characters. If you like fast paced games, this is for you! I recommend this app to everyone!!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|This advent calendar was a fun way for my son to count down to Christmas. Each day was new Lego building fun for him.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|An enjoyable, fun addition to the Stone Sour library, although not as aggressive as their first. This album feels energetic and original, each track feels inspired.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to it from beginning to end. Something I don't find myself doing with most music these days.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|An absolute must read for those trying to understand the financial crisis in 2007-2008. Great read on a complex subject.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is a simple read for simple minds.  There is nothing to ponder.  It was written in a way that only considers the surface of the characters, even though it tries to discuss the psyche. Boring.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was pulled in by books 1 to 3 and loved reading them.  The concept of living in a bunker for generations was intriguing and the books were well written.<br /><br />But around the middle of book 4, the story started to loose it in terms of continuity and believability.  It was actually a chore to finish the series... (\\"oh come on... really\\")... just to find out what happened.  They really needed a better independant editor.<br /><br />I am glad I read the entire series.<br /><br />It does end on a happy and optimistic note. Reading some of those reviews could lead you to believe otherwise.  I am not sure those reviewers made it past the sloppy sections to actually read the ending.<br /><br />I probably will read more of his books in this series, tho now that he has his million dollars, I hope he hires a better editor for the remainder.<br /><br />What Hugh SHOULD do is take a page from George Lucas and rework books 4 and 5 and re-release the series somehow.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It's a great game and I do like it very much , however you can't really do much without spending real money constantly. In one day just to get anywhere in the game I had to spend  an amount equal to purchasing a full version game . Thats ridiculous!!!! It costs 1 energy to do anything in game so if you don't buy more you have to wait 3 minutes for 1 energy . Basically you play for 5 seconds and wait for 3 minutes to play again for 5 seconds and then wait again . Should be full versions of these games that people could purchase if they wish .
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Though  I bought the first book out of curiosity stoked by all the late night comic comments and main stream media remarks, i was hooked. I know they say it is housewife porn, but then I am a housewife! I've read all 3 books several times. Each reading brings stuff i missed the previous times. It is certainly better written than a lot of the romance books out there.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Great game and little better than Oregon Trail cost wise, but again it's setup in a way that makes it impossible not to spend an exsorbant amount of real money. I don't mind having to pay to get some extras but really people ?
B00000K3D4|5.0|I was a little girl when this came out and I loved it. I recently bought it again and I enjoyed watching it all over again. It is quite different to what I have watched before and it bought back so many memories. I would recommend this.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it was a great way of doing this book and I will be reading more of these ebooks
B000002A46|5.0|This is one of the best christmas albums I now own. She has an amazing voice and I would recommend getting this.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Listen, this isn't &#34;Ghandi&#34; or &#34;On Golden Pond&#34;, but if you accept it for what it is, you will laugh yourself silly.  Not only is the whole concept of this movie hilarious but Mark Walhberg and Ted are fantastic.  Mila Kunis also drops some hilariously timed f-bombs and one liners.  I think I find this so funny because of Ted and his strong Boston accent and the tie in to the movie Flash Gordon, which I remember loving as a kid myself.<br /><br />I loved it the first time I watched it and still laughed out loud when I watched it again on my iPad!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, but it is NOT FOR KIDS!!!
B000ASAEQW|5.0|This is Mozart's Magic Flute at its most brilliant form. In fact after seeing the Magic Flute at over 20 opera houses world wide, this production is rated the best ever. The singing is crisp, the acting is superb, Wolfgang Brendel is simply sublime.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Dark puzzle pieces are hard to identify and place on dark backgrounds. Causes a lot of eyestrain. Scrolling to find puzzle pieces often hangs causing you to have to continually reverse scroll.
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|Out standing story line.<br />of course Clint Eastwood, you can't go wrong.<br />Baseball and a father daughter plus new life changes.
0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is a great movie about the hardships of both the farmers and the roving Samurai.<br />A must see!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Beautiful music, brings back memories of the concerts we went to.  Nice to see a new album by Rod Stewart.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I like games that take a little time to figure out. Gives me a good brain workout. This game does that. Think the graphics could be better though.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Now, this is the best art game I've seen so far. Not only is it cheap, it's got realistic tools. You would probably get the same results it you used the same tools in real life. I'd recommend this to anyone who has plenty of creativity and artistic skills.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This Flight peaks with a crash-landing. It happens at the 25-minute mark. The plot descends into an extended epilogue from there, not as much about the airplane as it is about the pilot, nicknamed Whip. It was his technical know-how that saved 96 of the 102 \\"souls\\" on board, but, as far as the National Transportation Safety Board and a blood test are concerned, it could be his alcoholism that endangered their lives in the first place.<br /><br />Director Robert Zemeckis cues the legal drama movie music, scored by Alan Silvestri, and lets the story coast along. What Whip, played by a somber, if not sober, Denzel Washington, does at the end is an automatic nominee for stupidest movie character decisions ever. It seems highly unlikely that a real-life pilot in his position would do such a thing on the grounds of mere morality. But I'm with him, and the movie, up until that point.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00913DPW2|5.0|best adventure game out there! some of the puzzles were really hard but it took my daughter who  is nine and me awhile to finish the game. we cannot wait for Haunt 2!!!
B0026O475M|4.0|There's a great movie in Cast Away. The time in which a Fed Ex worker named Chuck Noland is stranded on an island, most of the movie, is a triumph in movie-making. It puts a single actor on what appears to be a single set for a long time with no real dialogue, other characters to interact with or cuts back to the normal world, and manages to stay both captivating and believable the whole time.<br /><br />Okay, there's one thing that isn't very believable. That has to do with a particular Fed Ex package, one of the few man-made items Chuck has at his disposal. There's also a volleyball, ice skates and not much else. This is a tale of survival in the truest sense. What almost ruins the experience is the epilogue, which lasts for too long and seems irrelevant in comparison to everything that came before it.<br /><br />marcellee.com
