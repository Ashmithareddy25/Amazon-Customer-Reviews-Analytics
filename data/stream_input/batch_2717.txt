B009EHDU7U|4.0|A blend of comedy, mystery and general mayhem.<br />Will make a good film.<br />I found this novel uplifting and definitely would read<br />it again.  It has at its essence a feel that everything is<br />possible.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is an awesome app and you don't even have to click on the thing to pin it, you just have to hold it and pick the board you want it on. To search for something you just have to slide it to the left. It also has<br />a ton of cool things.
075669812X|5.0|My son is 6 and cannot put this book down.  He loves to look at all the pictures, while some of the reading is a bit above his level, he will sit with his uncles and older friends and look through all the pages.  He loves telling people all about his Ninjagos and the the Green Ninjago that comes with it is his new best friend.  This was wroth every cent I paid from the amount of quite time I get with it.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Noomi Rapace wants revenge on a DUI driver who ruined her face (slightly) and Colin Farrell wants revenge on the crime boss who murdered his family - we've seen it all before but DMD gives us a brooding, European-style slant on the interaction between the characters that provides a slightly new angle, even though it's fairly predictable after the midpoint. The film never really consummates the promised romance but instead focuses on two fragile characters who find rare moments of sanity to hold onto to avoid completely falling off an emotional cliff.<br /><br />The casting is excellent and there's a solid chemistry between all the major parts with everyone turning in good performances. The production design shows us a view of New York's suburbs that you rarely see with some dark, Euro coloration and generally the style supports the brooding atmosphere cultivated throughout the first two thirds of the film. The pacing is tight although it arguably loses the mystery element of the story too quickly and by the time act 3 starts, it's pretty clear where it's going to go. This is another film where you should avoid watching the trailer since far too much of the final 20 minutes is included and it's laden with spoilers.<br /><br />Dead Man Down died horribly at the box office, presumably due to the dreadful title, unclear premise and a feeling that we've seen it all before. Still, it's a good flick to keep entertained for a couple of hours, though I doubt I would watch it a second time around. And they never did answer who Colin Farrell was strangling in his apartment.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, this book is great for all ages.  If you are looking for a book now that Harry Potter and Twilight is over... this is the book for you.  It's got magic, love, friends wanting to be more... but I find that the characters are in this book are more real then Twilight and a bit less winy.  I will be honest when you get to the end you might get mad, but keep up with the series and by the 3rd book you will be so glad you did.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I chose it because I saw the televised broadcast on KPBS and loved it.<br />There are no songs on it that I don't like.<br />I'd recommend it to everyone who loves Bocelli.
B00C7D3TRO|4.0|I loved the single that was out on the radio, listen to a few more of the songs on line and thought for the great price that Amazon had it listed for (5.99) couldn't go wrong and I was so right.  Every song is great and gets me moving.  I am so glad to have Fall Out Boy back!!
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|We've all had the same thought, \\"But, what about all that I do for you?\\" We're told that we don't love enough, give enough, BE enough for our partners. Why do they feel that way when we ourselves feel we can't give any more than we are giving? This book explains that, though, in a pretty simplistic way.<br /><br />We all speak different love languages - which really means that we have different expectations about what love means and how to receive it. Some people have to hear it. Some people need to receive gifts to feel love, etc. If you are in tune with your partner, you will be able to find out their language and start loving them the way they want.<br /><br />The place the book is lacking is dealing with the more broken relationships that are either on their last breath or beyond. How to fix once things have fallen off the precipice.
B001QJUX24|5.0|This is a great John Wayne movie and since I'm a big John Wayne fan, I would highly recommend this movie.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a great series. The costuming and scenery are well done, and the characters become your friends as you are transported back to that time. I really enjoy this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it deffinitly a must have. its almost like temple run except better runner and it has minions

B005LLSZNM|4.0|After the boondoggle that was season 3 chasing JAX's kid all over the world whom he lets go then by a poor and predictable plot twist gets back, season 4 got us back to good writing and story lines.
1451695195|3.0|I bought this book as a gift for my mother. It's about near death experiences. If you're interested in that kind of thing you might like it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Graphics are good. First thing in a while that has kept my attention for more than 5 minutes. Fast paced and fun game. I like the thumb controls better than tilt.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Had a discussion with my friend... about Ender's game... describing Cyberspace is like Ender's life in the game room!  Anyway, his recommendation was spot on!! lol Bring on the next book by Orson Scott!!
1476734941|3.0|Clearly if we each reduce our caloric intake  by about 22% (since you eat on the 2 Fast days, it is not 28%) you will lose weight, I have read about half of the book, much of which is just validating the premise, I do expect to use the method in conjunction with exercise.  My wife has read it all and we just need to get started.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|So great to have all the RAC recordings that I'd accumulated over the years in one cohesive collection, with fine sound quality, and a voncenient format.
B002AKPECW|4.0|Alastair Reynolds is becoming one of my favorite authors.  I still like the Revelation Space series best, but this is a very enjoyable novel.  The more I read of it, the better I liked it.
1609611543|1.0|This really sucks!  We spent about $20.00 buying ingredients for bread.  The bread had a stinky odor and tasted horrible.  I am left with ingredients that I will never use.

B005G5PPGS|2.0|Started well and then went into some directions that were not so aligned with state intent upfront. Didn't flow well and was a slow read. Has some interesting facts but i didn't get the sense of what makes these unusual choices work in professional baseball and life...
0385535147|5.0|Gave as a gift and recently heard that the individual is really enjoying the book. Sounds like a happy reader!
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|The developer needs to create a way to spin the tiles in 3D so you can see the \\"almost hidden\\" tiles.<br />In my opinion, this should have never been written for a phone because the tiles are too small (Samsung Galaxy SII), cannot accurately touch the almost hidden ones (or see them clearly to know what to select). Recommend for tablet, not phone.<br />If they could make it 3D-spin, then Yeah Baby! I like the Americanized Mahjong games, this one could be the best- not yet.
B005LAII12|4.0|This movie appeals to individuals with varying types of humor. Wait, was it any of those names with a -Lynn after it?
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I use it every day to know whether i want to venture out or not.<br />Love this ap. Works for my location as well as others that i have.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Beautifully written, with characters that grow throughout the book.  You won't be able to stop reading the last 100 pages
B005WUHAX8|5.0|IM IN LOVE WITH THIS CASE!!!!!!! its everything i've ever wanted! i've been looking for a cheap life proof and i found it!
B001RJTFP4|5.0|This movie was well done and mastered in HD with 5.1 surround. I would recommend this to any fans of Blade and who are vampire fans too.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Let me first say that I am a HUGE fan of Johns videos and books and a Nerdfighter, despite my being 12 and such.The book was great, and then hit a big lull where I found myself often thinking of better ways to have taken the story. But, after about the time that Ben (Who was by and far my favorite chracter) calls Q (while very drunk) from the party, I felt it start to pick back up, and I loved it! Uuuuupp until they found Margo, which I felt was a sell out, and could have been much better. All in all, I felt that this book was good, but not exactly up to the standards of Johns other work.<br />P.S Is the pink &#34;wine&#34; Q breifly mentions a reference to the Strawberry Hill in Looking for Alaska, the only thing that can stop the fox?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The new screens are attractive and very effective, but the best improvement is the new layers for the map. With the storm track layer, you can see the speed and direction of approaching storms as well as the type of storm.  MUCH better tnan waiting for the animation to load so you can guess wuich way the storm is moving.
B0026O475M|5.0|I ordered this movie one day and the next day it arrived!!! Thank You!!! Brand New Movie !!!<br />I will be back ! Thanks also for the free instant rental :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There is a lot of action, lots of different characters, different areas to go within the game, and is to easy to play.
0812993292|5.0|A pilgrimage of self discovery, with characters that are faulty in our immutable human way.  Not what I expected, but better.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game has a lot of options to play different worlds, create different things, and helps them work on their spelling.  I would recommend this game.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|great show...almost makes me want to pay for premium cable!  Thanks to amazon video I don't have too, I just have to be patient!
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|If you love Cinderella, then you will love this even more. TK definitely is super talented, and his wife backs him up on some tracks which are awesome. Great album!
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is a good series. Very happy with it. I like how it comes through on Amazon as well. Pleased.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've been using the product for a little over a week and I really like it. It charges both my iphone 5 and fm transmitter at the same time, and it charges at a decent pace.<br />Can't beat it for the price!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Easy read, some disturbing violence against kids in an orphanage. Overall it was an ok book. I enjoyed deciphering the Irish dialects.
B006FTCH2E|2.0|I don't understand the 4 stars this film got. It moves too slowly even for someone who likes foreign and independent film. The two seconds of intrigue at the end of the film are a long time in coming and I wish I hadn't spent the $3.99 renting it. It was both depressing and boring all at once.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great puzzle game. i just like to see how fast I can go. I recommend this game to all puzzlers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very realistic in the world of today. Highly erotic that takes you into a world of fantasy. not for the straight & narrow.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I just finished reading it. The book gives an amazing detail to the psyche of the ultramarathon runners. The receipies I will not try but it was very interesting to read them and I know that at least one of my friends wants to try them out. Vegan and raw food aspects I found interesting too. I missed a bit more detail about his wife-I am not surprised she divorced him as he was always running somewhere. The bits about unnerving the other runners and the 'historical and philosophical 'bits I was not sure about either.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|recommended only for women who have an open mindedness. Had a great story line and loved the characters. Took me down another world or perhaps, up !

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Nice to see the show has been so faithful to the source material. Just enough depth and exposition here to add a second layer of appreciation. On to book two!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was better before they recently changed it.  Why do people feel the need to fix  some thing that works.
0345803450|4.0|When I put Sweet Tooth on my Christmas list, I thought it was going to be a fast-paced novel. I wasn't expecting action-packed, obviously, but am I the only one who sees the words \\"secret mission\\" and clicks \\"add to cart\\"? That's all I need to know. I'll read it.<br /><br />I probably should've noticed, though, that \\"secret mission\\" was indeed in quotations even on the book jacket. But I was all, undercover! betrayal! intrigue! female spy! I read two chapters over Christmas break, got back to school, and four months later as I was packing up my dorm room, I found the book under my bed, untouched. I'm glad I picked it up again, because it's definitely worth the read.<br /><br />Serena Frome is a smart, confused, independent girl who attracts the attention of many gentlemen callers, including, during her senior year at Cambridge, an older man involved with the British Security Service. It's the Cold War era, the government is attempting to influence the cultural sphere, and that's how Serena ends up on her quote-secret mission-end quote: to form a liason between the Security Service and unsuspecting writer Tom Haley (that's where the romance and intrigue comes in). I'm not going to say anything else, because the best part of the novel is how it all unfolds.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about Sweet Tooth was reading Tom Haley's stories. Some of them are a little bit tedious, and (do I dare?) heavy-handed. But Ian McEwan knows how to end a novel, for sure, and sometimes a good ending makes it easy to forgive a few dull moments.<br /><br />This review was originally published on my blog, Bringing Paperback ([...]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and love horses . And I would love my kindle a lot more if they made an animal jam app
B0094BB4TW|4.0|...for several days the app has been saying there is a newer version available, but when I check the app store for updates it says there are none. Other android devices can get the update through the link provided by the app, but it won't work for the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I don't know if this is a problem with the app or the app store, but it's frustrating me.<br /><br />Other than that I have had absolutely no problems with this app, and I have been using it for about 4 months now.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I belong to a hang gliding club so it was just a given that I needed to buy this movie.  Love it!!!  My grandson loves it to....we watch it together.  Can't wait for Rio 2...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The conclusion for the Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy.  I enjoyed all three books and would recommend them to anyone.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Keeps your attention and keeps you wanting to see more.  Can't wait for the new season to begin.  Very well worth the time.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|this is like electro pop. pop with an 80's beat. has everything that I love in music. the lyrics are something you can relate ti also. ;) love every single song on the album.
1891252089|5.0|I have practiced ashtanga yoga, and this book is incredible. It is also very informative. I highly recommend it as it really explains why you need to be doing this or that, or why this certain thing is so important to do. I am hyper mobile in all of my joints so it's easy to injure myself during sports, and yoga too due to hyperextending joints. My instructor told me all about this and there are great DVD's that go along with this.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I really enjoyed watching and was so sad it only went for two seasons. The music was great and it also had a good side story. It was very believable but not to dramatic. Definitely worth the time!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Its hard to find a movie that everyone will like. This one was perfect! Exciting and interesting at the same time.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites. Being married 24 years myself, I could relate to this couple. Life happens and we all get in ruts. I watched with my husband and we both saw us in this couple. I laughed, I cried. Will keep watching for years to come. Great movie! Would recommend to everyone. Love it!!!!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Addicted... Charlie Hunnam is just an awesome actor actor among a great cast, a great show is all i gotta say...
B003K15IF8|5.0|A really fine, &#34;old-fashioned&#34; novel. By &#34;old-fashioned,&#34; I mean lucid writing with an emphasis on a clear narrative and character development. Academics (like me) may like this novel especially since there is a fair amount about academic life, but the satisfactions and frustrations described should resonate with anyone. Likewise, being older helps to identify with the main character, but I think anyone who reflects on the meaning of their lives will find this an enriching work of fiction.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Once I started this book, I was hooked.  Michael Connelly is one of the best authors I have ever read.  His novels flow so easily and the characters sre so believable.  Never am I disappointed!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This was an amazon free app of the day a month or so back.  It makes you think, not too much though, as you work through many many levels or puzzles.  If you get stuck and really want to know the answer to a particular puzzle, you can purchase the solution.  If you use your brain, and of course like puzzles, you cal solve all without buying a solution.  For 99 cents I would have purchased this game.  July 22, 2013.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Well written and thought provoking.  Who knew an over-production of corn could cause such consequences?<br />I plan to read more by Michael Pollan,.
0857680986|5.0|I am thrilled to see these books being reprinted. I have original, first editions of Creative Illustration and Figure Drawing For All It's Worth, given to me by my art mentor many years ago. These are wonderful instructional texts for anyone who is interested in life study and/or illustration, covering the essentials of perspective, composition, design, and so much more. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals, improve their skill, and train their \\"artist's eye\\".
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My last phone was dying, so my wife got me a new HTC ONE. I thought I lost all my music like my photos, but as I'm learning how to use this wonderful little computer/phone I found all my music in the cloud. Thank you Amazon MP3 geeks for being light-years ahead of me. I have 2 sons in their late 20's and early 30's whom are computer wizards but live 750 miles away, so I'm on my own. Amazon geeks rock!
0887081770|4.0|This was my daughter's second Eric Carle book and she instantly fell in love with it.  The words and flip-up pages were delightful.  But within the first hour, the big moon page showed tears where the paper creases.  The fact that it happened so quickly without any misuse, really disappointed me.  Maybe they should use a laminated page for this section or a different paper stock all together.  The story and illustrations were outstanding, I wish the production quality was of the same standard.
B0079NQZLE|2.0|this Horrible excuse for a film was terrible i watched it and it had little to 0 resemblence to the hunger games it is anti captilist and stupid the ending was even more stupid than anything else and worst of all nothing was explained and nothing was told so u assume everything about the movie terrible only good part was how cool the hacker dudes made those greandes but that was it I hate this movie don't buy it
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Aardman strikes again. A clever, entertaining and fun thing to watch. This series is really not just for children but for anyone with a sense or humor.
B004SIP7AS|1.0|No feeling, no substance. It does not do the book justice. There is so much more behind the story than some snobby rich girl trying to control a situation. Oh, and the accents are horrible, especially Paltrow, which surprised me because she pulled \\"Sliding Doors\\" off really well. Make it is because this is an era movie. Go for the \\"Emma\\" movie version with Kate Beckinsale. At least she is more believable rather than going through the motion.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Enjoyed the characters and story! Would recommend it to people who enjoyed Downton Abbey! Like the time period! Don't miss it!
B00BWTJ2WU|5.0|Great album from start to finish-- amazing musicianship coupled with great song writing.  Stands up well against other similarly 60's 70's inspired rock bands like Fleet Foxes.  Do yourself a favor ans pick this one up.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|Actually, haven't seen it yet-- What else can I say - will let you know when I see the movie
B00C75SQIO|5.0|I always have been looking for the OEM batteries and I have finally found this one it is the original Sony branded battery!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Thought provoking and nicely put together game. I think many people would like this kind of game it is so different.
B00197U0DU|3.0|It's surprising that Genesis, a band that garnered a reputation in the 70s for unrivaled scope and scale, was like that from well... their genesis. After all, what other band in any branch of music started off their career making an album based on the Bible? And not just \\"inspired by\\" the Bible but an actual musical adaptation on the Bible? No band to my knowledge has ever attempted something on such a dramatic scale at any point in their career, let alone on their debut album. Now of course, having a grand musical vision is one thing, bringing it to fruition and making it good is another. Did Genesis create a masterpiece with this album? No, not at all. But that doesn't mean it's a totally bad album.<br /><br />Now it is of note that this is not the Genesis many people remember from the early 70s. Steve Hackett and Phil Collins were each two albums away from joining the band to form it's timeless lineup at this point. Unfortunately, its immediately clear that their predecessors were quite inferior to their successors. Anthony Phillips is not a terrible guitarist, in fact in his own way he's quite good, but he replicates none of the aura and raw power of Steve's later contributions. I don't remember who their first drummer was, but he's enough to get the album through, nothing more. Of course, Peter Gabriel and Tony Banks are evident as the leading talents in this early Genesis, but even their first efforts pale in comparison to their later triumphs. For instance, Gabriel's voice is much softer and his trademark rasp is not nearly as evident as it is in his later Genesis and solo works. Tony Bank's keyboard work is good when it is employed, but in this album he only uses a grand piano and rarely at that. Sorry folks, no Mellotron or Hammonds here!<br /><br />Of course the main focus of criticism and praise for Genesis has always been on their lyrics, and on this album it is clear they have yet to master the formula for lyrical composition. The songs on this lyrically are usually mediocre. Some of them have some catchy hooks, notably the opening song When the Sour Turns to Sweet and In the Beginning, but they won't stick in your head for very long. Most of the songs are also written with a very pop sensibility in mind, mostly due to the demands of their record label, but even so they are simply not good pop tunes even by late 60s standards.<br /><br />So far it probably seems like there is little to like about this album, but what saves it for me is the music itself. Now I do understand that not all of it is the bands as it was intended, with a string orchestral overdub being done by their producers. But in this case, I think they had the right idea, as the overdubs enhance the songs enormously. By far the best song on the album is The Serpent, which aside from corny lyrics, is a powerful song with one of Genesis's catchiest riffs played on bass. The gentle acoustic guitar works well as an accent to the songs, as does the aforementioned keyboards. Sometimes it seems like they are recycling some of the main ideas of prior songs (The Conqueror being the main offender) but overall it's not terribly noticeable.<br /><br />In conclusion, From Genesis to Revelation has grand scale, and some genuinely good music. But for all the effort put into it, it tends to fall flat more often than not. I attribute this mostly to the inexperience of the musicians creating it. That being said, for a first effort it's quite good, and is indicative that the men behind Genesis do have quite a bit of talent, and are merely finding the right methods of combining and expressing it. Their early music has many flaws, but it is promising. Would I recommend this album to a casual Genesis fan? No, it's not really worth their time. To a hardcore fan who wants to hear the evolution of this brilliant band? Absolutely.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|This movie was acted and directed so beautifully!  I have read many many books about the holocaust. I have also seen a few movies. I hesistated for a long time to watch Schindler's List fearing it would be too painful to watch.  I must say that even though there were painful scenes, it was every bit as uplifting.  This wonderful man Oskar Schindler sacrficed so much of himself for a people who many people said were \\"not worthy to live\\". His courage and his love of people, recognizing they were of the same race he was \\"HUMAN\\" makes this movie MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!!!
1401937268|5.0|Very beautiful, inspiring and simple to understand. I loved the illustrations. I really would recommend this deck for beginners as for experts.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|this another of the books that I re-read, it is so sad that I had to put it down a few times<br />and come back an read a few more chapters.. The more I read of the things our government<br />inflicted in the name of progress the more I mistrust.
B005K17RU0|1.0|this used to be my favorite weather app. now 2 updates since I got it the app Sucks .if it loads it takes an average of 5 to 10 times to get a response. it does have the best radar I have seen, but it takes a lot of patience if you want to see it. time to shop for a new weather app.
B000FC146C|5.0|this is one of the books that I had to re-read. A wonderful book about a priest turned cardinal and the<br />family he befriended, the woman he loved and who loved him. A book you will always remember
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent book. First hand account of what really happened in training and in war!<br />It is almost as if you were right along with the &#34;team&#34;.
B00114RKT8|4.0|Just finished the book.  Just got Wi-Fi.  Would love to talk about watching my 1st movie on my 1st Kindle Fire, instead, the movie is superb.  Lots from the book left out, but got to SEE landscapes & architecture, fashion & how 18th century culture/politics must have been.  Much centering around Wilberforce's faith aborted, probably for pc reasons & that was disappointing.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I was looking for something to watch similar in action or storyline to Spartacus or Game of Thrones. While The Tudors was based on a real story and not as fantasy-like as the other two, I did enjoy it and watched all 4 seasons. Really good acting and storytelling.
0767821629|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for years.  It's one of my all time favorites.  I couldn't remember the title until a month ago during Church service.  The pastor was reminding us that what we see is not what is; what is, is what we don't see, and that's the gist of this movie.  While this is a secular movie, it has a spiritual connotation if you hath a spiritual eye.  For those who don't want to view the world from that paradigm, it's a great thriller.  Keeps your attention.

B008RXYOKY|1.0|While firewire with OS-X allowed setting up a network between two machines to share files, screens, etc this adapter doesn't permit this capability. With a little research it was found that OS-X produces malformed IP packets thus the problem is likely an OS-X driver. On the other hand if you are willing to reboot into target disk mode the adapter permits file transfers when the operating system is not booted (e.g. the adapter isn't the issue).<br /><br />Apple appears to think this will be used once to migrate files and then you throw the adapter in the trash. Or maybe you have legacy camera, AV gear or perhaps a hard drive. The former might work and the drive must be a low power consumer.<br /><br />Conclusion. Apple needs to fix OS-X but there appears to be higher priorities right now.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I love this app.  Compared very nicely to gTasks and other top Google Task synching apps. Very nice user interface put it over the top for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I admit I am drawn to period pieces, but this is one of the best series I have ever seen.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|My all-time favorite.  When I feel like a lift, I play the dvd and fast forward through some parts to get to the &#34;feel good&#34; parts.  I have recommended this movie to everyone I know.  Saw it in theaters 3x.
0316227706|5.0|My grandkids and I love this book.  Funny, entertaining, and just well done!  Saw this on Good Morning America and just had to have it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As always impecable story telling and this time important too. We live in peaceful times at the moment, but the bad sentiments in humans have survived that dreadful century and Follett intelligently reminds us of that while telling one hell of a story with all the necessary ingredients to make you read on and on during sleepless nights. Anyone who is remotely interested in history and politics will be thrilled
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|I had a great time listening to the music and watching the performances, but can't saw it was riveting or that I learned anything.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|One of my all time favorites.Great plot and has a lot of humor.Cary Grant is very good with both humor and being serious,Lots of suspense and twist and turns.I've watched it at least a hundred times and it never gets old!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|No issues with the app on my kindle fire. Can't seem to update it, but the old  version work  Just fine.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|Would have given this a five star rating if not for the movie slowing down and getting boring at times,Would watch again and would recommend.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Transcendent plot. Excellent characters, quality, themes, action. Unfortunately all is lost on the average consumer. The movie is slow paced and excessively complicated. More akin to the Godfather than the Avengers. I loved it.
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|One of my all time favorite Steve McQueen movies.Just goes to show that Steve was just as good in serious rolls as he was in westerns.Much better than the remake.I would highly recommend this movie.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good action film, and I had no problem with TC's performance. But, having read the books, I wouldn't have thought of him first. Jack is 6'4&#34; after all.
B008Y6OS64|3.0|Just ok.At times it gets to be boring and the story gets lost but then it gets back on track.
B002JODPSO|4.0|C'mon, its John McLane (Bruce Willis)!!! It was what I expected, and it did not disappoint. I'll probably be watching when he knocks the evil villain off the high rise with his walker.
B001GH5HN6|5.0|IT'S CREADANCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL that should be all that needs to be said about this album.  But it is great.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book it pulls you in gets your attention and entices you to read it. I am not a bug reader at all but I read this book in 3 days.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved these books. Hope you continue to write more like it. I highly recommended this series to everyone.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I chose this rating because I totally loved the book!<br />I did not want it to end, could not put it down.<br />Great characters!  Lots of twists and turns.
B0094M2TB8|4.0|I watched the newer version first. Its actually pretty decent and entertaining. It had good moments of tension. David Tennant was great as Peter Vincent. Shortly after, I watched the original; the newer one was more my cup of tea.  Some of the CGI in the new one was not well done but not really a deal breaker.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A great mobile app. Cheaper than buying the cards even if you unlock the full version. Fun multiplayer and single player. One drawback is that things are a bit small to see if you play on a phone. Recommend a tablet or phablet to play.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Watching Ghostbusters is a guilty pleasure for me. I've enjoyed this series since I was a kid, and it doesn't matter how many times I watch it, I always enjoy them. Very good CD quality. Always enjoyable.
B00947NAHU|5.0|This movie is good but too violent for immature audiences. Watch with extreme caution. Jamie Fox and DeCaprio were great as always.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This is classic Pet Shop Boys. It is truly complete singles collection; an excellent sample of how great this band is.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a great game, a good way to have fun with friends and family. Fantastic way to connect<br />A lot of fun.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Bought this for my Grandchild who just loved it and actual sat and watched the entire movie without getting up.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I like most anything with bruce willis in it, but REDS is great, action  packed and the co stars are excellent and funny. It the kind of movie that you hope they will make a second one.
1400031001|5.0|As described and fast shipping, would recommend. The book has a little scratch on the back cover (as described: used) but otherwise perfect.
B00DHNJGCU|2.0|The movie is too cerebral and seems to get caught up in it's own self-importance. Lots of gang related revenge which can become tedious to watch because it is always predictable.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Great show, a lot of funny moments.  If you have not seen it, watch it so you can understand all the references that are in every other show.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I'm intentionally delaying this season but the first 3 episodes are excellent.I am now an unofficial member of the &#34;Free Mr. Bates  Legal Team&#34; and proudly wear my &#34;Free Mr. Bates&#34; t-shirt to Wal-Mart, where virtually no one cares.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like it. Easy to play. Great picture. I would recommend this game to others who like horses. Give this a try!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It has a little bit of everything.  This show has great writers and actors, always looking forward to the next episode.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoyed game  but there were pop ups and sometime quiting the application was difficult but overall was good experience on kindle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was written very well, the story was spell binding and I would have rated it 5 stars had it not been for some vulgar language and sexual references that cropped up throughout the book.  Totally unnecessary in my opinion.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is so cool! This app helps with my art skills and has tons of cool camera features, too.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun game. It is fairly easy and always gives you a second chance if you run out of moves.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|An exceptionally fun mystery/thriller, and our first introduction to wisecracking detective John Corey (he stars in 6 other DeMille books as well). Combining bio weapons, piracy, seduction and Long Island wine, this is not anything that will be confused with deep literature, but DeMille's voice is clever and the narrative never flags. A great summer read - and to give away more would be obnoxious...
B009MYARIK|4.0|Always enjoy a Sophie Kinsella book. I can count on laughing out loud and wanting more. While I liked this book very much, I loved her prior works a little bit more.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|Love their music--it is neat to hear their rendition of some classics and show/TV tunes.  Listen to it over and over because it lifts my spirits.
076244911X|5.0|Knowing I'm a huge Kylie fan, my bf pre-ordered this book back before it was released. I live in America, so it was on back-order for 5 months(!).<br /><br />But it was definitely worth the wait. Kylie has such an amazing fashion sense. I love the earlier parts of the book, where Kylie wore her own clothes, did her own hair, and posed for photographers. Her commentary makes it so surreal. They're more than just the Kylie photos we've seen over the years... there's actual meaning to them... And the reminiscing aspect is just so cool. Different designers put their two cents in on working with Kylie, and Kylie dishes on exactly what some of the fashion and opportunities meant to her. It's a really personal look into her career and experiences... I absolutely love it!<br /><br />To any Kylie fan out there, GET THIS BOOK! It's amazing! <3
B003Y5H54W|1.0|There's not enough space or time to express just<br />how horrible this movie was/is, so all I can say is don't bother.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Longtime fan of The Smashing Pumpkins.  There is no reason to hem/haw over whether to buy this.  Buy it now.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game has a variety of boards that make it fun and interesting. I enjoy playing it because the tiles are easy to see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome,  it is worth buying for 6.99, especially that there is update every once in a while. try to get this app if you still don't have it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is an amazing and wonderful thing to see when you can be just as active with your animated horses as well as your &quot;in person&quot; horses.
B00AYB16EO|1.0|This is just a leg up from a college improv troop doing a film on a weekend.  It really is derivative in the worst sense.  Only thing good to say is that it's infinately better than the sequels.
B002NUULNG|5.0|The original GITS is my favorite anime, and one of my favorite movies. This update only enhanced and improved the original, giving the film a more futuristic feel. I would recommend it to anyone who has the original on DVD.
B000002GYN|5.0|One of the premier rock groups of my generation. Love the music and it never gets old. Love this stuff
B005K17RU0|2.0|The new update is terrible. The old version was a perfect weather app that was simple and easy to view. Now it is an confusing mess.
B00005OM4K|5.0|this guys were always the great group in the 60' an 70's they bring back lots of happy memories to me
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Excellent movie! It has a good plot and story theme! The Grand children really liked it and can hardly wait for #2
B000002GYW|5.0|Spent a lot of head phone time with this album. Super concept and super album. Miss the old days, try this!
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Great movie.  Great storyline.  Enjoyed it very much.  I must see for everyone.  Will be a plus to anyone's collection.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Not being a high budget film I had low expectation but was pleasantly surprise. Its a good movie for what it is but better yet, it's a great movie for any halo fan.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|This is way up there in my list of war stories I have read.Could not put this one down. A great insight into the German Airforce role.
006178480X|5.0|Intriguing journey that takes the SIGMA team into a realm that the reader has not seen before!  I like that Rollins is pulling the characters back to being more like every day people.  They actually fail to \\"immediately\\" understand every clue found.  The team struggles mentally and physically.  They're more human again.. with all of the frailties that most of us exhibit.<br /><br />The novel touches upon quite a few physic's hypotheses.  I love that Rollins is able to convey in every day language.. concepts that most had \\"somewhat\\" learned.. but, hadn't quite fully grasped.  Quantum entanglement.. Are we nothing more than holograms?<br /><br />I always love reading the historical tidbits that are injected into every Rollins novel!  This time.. it deals with Genghis Khan and his lost tomb.<br /><br />\\"Eye of God\\" is a fast-paced read.  One that all Rollins readers will enjoy!
B008Y6OS64|1.0|enough drug movies<br />see drugs and I just stop watching<br />I watch movies to be entertained not to be annoyed
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun game I play sometimes whenever I am bored  I have noting more to say  thank you
B009ZQP42E|5.0|Such a strange conglomeration but it works beautifully, not a false step anywhere.  Sweet and clever, no wonder they made a Broadway show out of it!
B0091REZMW|1.0|This game is impossiable to see with my eyes  It`s to dark and way to small I play on my pc to enjoy it
B000O14VAU|5.0|I am a huge fan of vampire, werewolf, dark side movies and this one has a great atmosphere and completes the story while leaving it open for the whole series.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|The film was awesome like I expected, but the music by Hans Zimmer always amazes me each soundtrack he does. It's beyond comparison, I love it!
B004HWYTP4|1.0|Easily the most predictable action plot I've seen in a while. If I can write it in my tiny peabrain, it's pretty piss poor writing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is incredibly awesome because if like coin games try this it. Is the best or just use b.g.e best game ever :)
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome game gotta play it I have been playing for a while now and it's so hard t o put the game down<br /><br />GET THE APP YOUR NOT WAITING ON IT ITS WAITING FOR YOU!!!!<br /><br />:)
0071766588|5.0|This book is pretty good . However, if only it can be charged at more lower price. Overall, the quality of this book is great.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Great movie, my son loved it. Although the quality is not very good in some parts, still good to watch. First time he was able to sit through a whole movie.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|its a john wayne classic that is not only entertaining but one of the best westerns of his long career
B00CWY76CC|5.0|To hold your interest without getting frustrated.  Highly recommend this to anyone that likes solving a mystery.  Graphics &amp; response excellent.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I access the site several times a day,  mostly to check the radar.  The Weather Channel is Moe accurate than the local TV station.  Site has always been up.  Good weather reporting.  Highly recommended.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I have been waiting for this for 3 years, I loved magic and am so happy to find it now as an app. This is amazing the only problem is the long download. But I am so happy to have found it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Use often but more options on my phone compared to tablet.  Would rate a 4 because of that.  I especially like the radar feature.
B00797MB0O|2.0|Charlize Theron does some good acting in this but the story line was not good in my opinion.  I would not recommend it.
B000Q67876|5.0|Many people watch this movie over and over again. Its message of hope and redemption, not  to mention sweet revenge, is timeless.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|The singing--I love the singing. It was great. I love the dancing. It's a great, fabulous movie.<br />Mirelle, age 7
B002E66C6E|5.0|This movie captures a critical event in WWII, capture and return of German U-Boat 505, to the US.  The Enigma Machine on board allowed US to decode German communications from that point on.  U-505 is on display in Chicago.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Like it all. Like my name.  This app is the biggest hands on violin for beginners. Lol this app is so cool. And a buffet .
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This basic protective case is better than some more expensive ones. I don't have to take it off to charge my phone or hook in headphones..works very well!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was my first escape the room game. The puzzles are logical and there is a real sense of accomplishment when you escape to the next room. It's a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This book, the second in the series, is written from a women's perspective and of course appeals to women! It contains elements of romance, time travel, and lots of historical characters! You will love the Outlander series! I read them again and again, I love visiting with the characters!
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I was afraid of being disappointed by this movie, but it is probably the best horror movie I have ever seen.  Absolutely disturbing and great gore.  I love it!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Fans of James Rollins, certainly \\"addicts\\" like me, will not be disappointed as the author rocks the Sigma Force and it's allies through a pulse-pounding end of the world scenario on a deadline! A master of mixing archeology, ancient lore, modern science that is usually \\"news to us - but factual\\" and Special Forces Ops, Rollins introduces a new member of the Sigma team...but alas, we lose some old friends - or do we? A surprise ending for Sigma fans, which has never been done by the author, makes you really think about the theories in this book. Furthermore, if you haven't read \\"Ice Hunt\\" you'll miss one of the funniest parts of the book, imo. Making this short to avoid potential spoilers, 5 stars! Don't miss, \\"The Eye of God\\"!!!!!
0679805273|5.0|This is a great book my daughter had me purchase for her little sisters pre school graduation. She wants to have all her K-12 grade teachers write something about her every year then present it to her on her high school graduation! The book is made of high quality materials and should stand up to the test of time! Another great purchase from Amazom
0375851569|5.0|Read these books to our kids when they were little and have now purchased them for our new granddaughter!!! I'm sure she will love them as much as her dad did!!!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series starts slow but you have to stick with it and get to know the unique characters like<br />The Pratt Sisters(hilarious) Queenie and her comical husband Twister. And there is Dorcas Lane the Postmistress and her zany maids. Plus the scenery is simply stunning. Step back in time and enjoy every minute of it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|My reading time is limited, and I'm really disappointed that I wasted precious time reading this book.  It's mish mashed together, hard to follow, and like other reviewers have stated, I can't believe it actually got published with an ending like that.  Don't waste your time, seriously.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|Very authentic. Captures the period and the mountain well. Totally engrossing. Tragic story. Appreciate the historical accuracy. German language with english subtitles.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game in app store its worth the price and being able to play with others in a world is awesome!!!!!!!! &lt;3 this game
B00860YICC|4.0|This was a moving story, of a child born on a ship who grew up there and couldn't leave.  it has an unhappy ending, but still a good movie to see
B004W1GCQO|5.0|It's like following History in England...a greater understanding of England always delights me....go back in time and enjoy  this series
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I understand that gameloft needs to make money.  I would have rather paid a dollar  for the game instead of having towait 20 minutes every 10 minutes i play.  Great game, but either make it easy to make dollars and use energy, or lose them from the game.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|My son is 9 and watched this for the first time a month ago and just loved it!  I am glad I got to share it with him.  As far as video quality for Amazon Instant Video it streamed without difficulty and had good picture quality.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun and easy to navigate.  Mahjong is my favorite game.  The Kindle gives you a large enough screen to really enjoy the games.
B00C1C0WCQ|5.0|My son is 9 and watched this for the first time a month ago and just loved it!  I am glad I got to share it with him.  As far as video quality for Amazon Instant Video it streamed without difficulty and had good picture quality.
0770435726|5.0|I found this to be a wonderful read - suspenseful but also well written.  Thriller type books are often \\"all action\\" with nothing to interest me beyond that or are basically romance novels with a thriller like plot.  Yes the plot of this book was not something that was totally realistic, nor were the characters, but they were close enough that I could read right along with interest and not anger.  I could identify with the main female character - even though I've never been an operative nor do I have interest in being one. Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Thanks, Amazon, for offering this wonderful show with an Amazon Prime membership. It's the perfect way to catch up for those of us who missed Downton Abbey the first time around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hey this app was great one of the best ever. It was like real life but a game that s why it's awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just have to say that is a fun game.  Helps me to relax at the end of a long day.
B000HL2J0G|2.0|The reason I gave it only two stars is that it is NOT closed captioned/subtitled. As a hard of hearing person, I only watch that which is<br />closed captioned or subtitled otherwise it would have been rated much higher..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  The plot (teenagers dying of cancer) is a bit tragic, but the characters are so real and FUNNY(!).  It is truly touching.  LOVED this book!
B000SW2ER2|4.0|I love space movies with a metaphysical undertone.  This movie had it.  I had not seen it before and did not know why.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is similar to subway surfers. It is just as fun and I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to keep their children entertained.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Expands on the belief that as a man sows, so shall he reap.  The exercises are great to drive this point home.
0670014893|5.0|I have followed Le Carre's novels since a student in the 1950's. I have enjoyed all (perhaps to  varying degrees), although the octane power has been a little diluted in the last decade or so. But... &#34;A Delicate Truth&#34; had me sitting up all night, agog, as when I first read &#34;Tinker, Taylor&#34;!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Well written and engaging. You think that it will follow a certain path but it doesn't . Sad but satisfying in its unpredictable nature. Heart of family generations of pain. To stop with this generation
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I now have all 5 seasons, and look forward to the 6th. I find this series, funny, disturbing, unexpected plot twists, and lots of eye candy. Very entertaining, and have recommended it to many of my friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This product is amazing i am soooooooo addicted to it. It is the best game ever made in game history.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I really enjoy the mix of personalities and would really enjoy just sitting in the studio setting to observe the acting.  I can tell they must start laughing  a lot when they should be serious in a  scene.  But a day will come when they will have to retire the show.
B0000DYKET|2.0|The style of these sandals is great, they have excellent arch support, and they are waterproof!  So why are they only getting two stars?  It all has to do with the gap between the two straps that are closest to the toe on the outside of you foot.  This gap is in just the right spot to rub your little toes raw in short order!  I ordered both the leather Newports and the synthetic Newport H2's (from a different vendor) and both versions of the sandal have this same problem.  Ordering a size smaller did not help.  I had a pair of the now discontinued Keen Venice H2 sandals a few years back that did not have this problem.  They were essentially the same shoe with a slightly different strap pattern.  Unfortunately my Venice H2's were destroyed by a puppy a few years ago, and was hoping the Newports would replace them.  I really wanted to like these sandals, however might baby toes were screaming at me to send them back!
B000P407K4|5.0|A forever true story about mendacity, stupidity, guile, ignorance, and irrational fears found in the human spirit.  It is timeless and every young person should look at it while in school.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app is awesome!! You receive emails fast after they are sent, and it works great. Very convenient. Easy to use and works well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book was easy to read and entertaining.  It kept my interest throughout.  I am glad that I read it.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I grew up having this read to me, now I have  it to read to my son. What great memories!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a very entertaining read.  It was well written and well plotted.  I am sure people like these exist all around us.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|For a free application I'm not bombarded by ads. Game is addictive and fun. I recommend giving it a try.
0880796863|5.0|I like the cards print is clear good one it does the job for someone starting with the cards . Good
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is really good it actually teaches people to care for animals and not to hunt or poach them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a masterfully told story. It kept raveling and unraveling and it complexity didn't reveal until you were in eyesight of the conclusion.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Loved the book......until the ending, where it went &#34;thunk&#34;.<br />I needed more information  to fill in the missing time.<br />I needed to grab Molly's past too.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A nice end to the Trilogy. A very artful story that continued a mystery throughout. You were there witnessing the events as they unfolded.
B00CRW2066|4.0|Like many other reviewers here, I couldn't get into High Violet as much as Alligator and Boxer, and this album is very similar (though different enough to stand on it's own). No terrible songs, but no songs that really stand out in my mind.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I've enjoyed this book very much.  I got it because we used to live in Nigeria so I'm interested in books about this culture.  She's got a very good story line, however the book does go on and on at some parts.  I've yet to finish it, but will to find out how it ends.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|This taut, well-acted and complex tale of Washington politics is riveting, aided by the narrative asides of Kevin Spacey. If one has any interest in politics, this is the series to see.
B0042U2HLY|5.0|I alway though thought that listening to Bruckner was like watching paint  drying,too long and what a bore.I have listened to Karajan and Jochum complete symphonies without making any sense.The sound is like riding a roller coaster,going up and down.When I retired from work and I decided to listen again to my new purchase of Gunter wand version of his complete symphonies on Sony and decided be patient without being judgrmental.I started with symphony 8 and listen it couple of times.What a revealation and my ears  work open to the glorious sound and melody. Now I am addicted to Bruckner symphonies and been listening to his symphonies for the past months.What I have been missing and regret  for not being patient.To listen to Bruckner symphony and appreciate we must be patient and it is not an instant fix. It is not instant coffee but rahter like a percofating coffe that take time and what a taste.Highly recommend this set for opening my heart and ers to Bruckner symphonies.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|One of the best Lego products I have ever seen! Great fun and beautiful once completed. My teenage son enjoyed the process.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|Clark Kent was a little wooden. And I didn't appreciate the not-so-subtle messianic father/son references. But a great movie otherwise.
B005R32L66|3.0|Was able to download skype on my device but I couldn't use it for video chat because it wasn't supported. Other than that I could use it to make calls.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Was working perfectly until this morning when suddenly said' &quot;you don't own this app&quot;!!!! No idea what happened and nothing I try is working to fix it. It's a shame, my kids are so addicted but may have to uninstall it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was excited when I saw the kindle app on my device. I started downloading books and began reading and it was amazing and exciting.
B00CM9JKQM|1.0|Without Geoff Tate There is no Queensryche. He should own the name not the band. It shows in this album. This guy doesn't even come close. And for you people that think so,your not a true Queensryche fan. Or have you really listened to the group much at all. Geoff Tate is top 3 all time hard rock vocals . This new clown is just that, a clown.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|It was fascinating to see the inner workings of how the CIA and most of all this one person, a woman, was so determined to put an end to this terrorist. I loved it, I believed it and I was enthralled by it!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally addictive series:)  And I never watched soaps in my lifetime.  Can't believe how the final  episode ended  Now we have to wait how long until Season 4 ???
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I gave this watch to my husband and it was literally love at first sight!!  I did good on this!!  The watch is easy to use, it gorgeous and is exactly what my husband was looking for!
B0063IH60K|3.0|solitaire is solitaire If you enjoy playing solitaire this is easy because it deals all the cards out a lot easier than using a deck of cards
B000FC146C|5.0|McCullough is up there with some of the best and this book proves it.  I just loved it.  Superb! Great!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It starts off very easy but gets much more difficult as you advance. gets your brain working. Good luck everyone
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Being and Ernest Hemingway fan of fans it's one of his best.  What a wonderful way to spend a few hours!!
B003YOSXH6|5.0|I turned down lots of other grammar books because I did not have time to pore over long, detailed manuals.  This book was a fast read but strengthened my grammar skills noticeably.  It was actually fun, too.  I recommend it highly.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It is my opinion that the way the Weather Channel was before this change WAS BETTER!!!!!  Easier to read.  Maps gave better information and it was more user friendly.  Sorry . . . . Just saying!!!!!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This app gets used all the time, between the 4 and 6 year old. They both love music so for them to be able to play keys. Keeps them both ocupied.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is great! There are great graphics and no ads at all. The only thing i dislike avout the game is the amount of time they give you...you have to EARN the time and i often end up playing for 20 seconds or something. But overall, it's a fun mario kart styled game :)
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great overall movie that the whole family could enjoy. Between the whole plot and punch lines throughout the movie. Greatly enjoyed movie!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is a challenging game. I would like it if the directions were a little clearer. Although perhaps that's part of the challenge. Overall I do recommend this game.Not for young children.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|A Wonderful performance, great quality and wonderful picture.  Many of my friends ended up buying one for themselves!  Incredible deal!
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I am rather a Baz Luhrmann fanatic--especially his soundtracks. This one does not disappoint.<br />Lots of contrasts in mood, with the usual depth and a bit of fun too.<br />Powerful and cool...listen and see!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|The app only worked once on my Acer Galaxy tablet. Has not worked since. I deleted it. No use taking up space.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Like I said, not completely in love with the movie... Video quality was great and streaming worked just fine.....the end
B004GFN11A|4.0|This app makes wordpress super easy to use, but I saw a few drawbacks...I couldn't catergorize anything and it was kind of hard for me to navigate around to find the exact things I needed sometimes.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Like another reviewer, I wish this app would show what pieces have been captured. The difficulty level is set by a continuous slider, which allows for a lot of fine-tuning. The one star reviews of this app leave me wondering about the reviewers.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I thought this could have been a little more interactive for my kids.  My oldest is 6 and even she lost interest pretty quick, but was totally digging it for the first hour or so.
1433537419|5.0|I bought several of these for graduating seniors.  They were not too big and not too small.  For a study Bible, this one is a winner.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app was super easy to navigate and very easy to navigate.  I use it on my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly and makes it super easy to pin things from other sites.
B007SGM084|4.0|I will definitely recommend it to my friends.  The sex was a bit much but necessary for the book to make sense.  The characters were well developed and seemed very real.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I loved this game and I have to play after my kids and husband go to sleep because they are always on it!  I used this on my kindle fire.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This book was very hard to put down. It was raw, inspiring and seemed very honest. Should be on every high school book list as a compulsory read!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Great movie with lots of action, however i think having storm, jean grey or cyclops in it would have made for much better action. And it kind of confused me as to how the german guy who was with the younger Erik went from being middle aged looking to a lot younger look to him. But overall I liked it alot would watch it again
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game needs some new classes like a fragger. Also it could really use some more maps. And last of all, and above all more vehicles. And could u at least try name the guns better, i see alot of guns i know the name to and its not named right it really bothers some people. Other than that this game is flipping awesome and im addictied along with two of my other friends
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished it in one day. Very satisfying! Surprised how much I love it after watching the movie first. Ready for the next book.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A typical King book that starts out great , then just gets sillier and sillier...it is not one of Stephen King's best.
B007EC27QM|2.0|Its okay if you need a simple calculator but the is no square root function so it is not of much use to me.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|As a huge fan of Nat King Cole, I play and accompany many singers who sing Nat's songs  This album is WONDERFUL.  In an online interview, George Benson said it was not an easy CD to record, since George has a tenor voice, and Nat had a bass voice.  The album is wonderfully recorded.  The arrangements are superb.  Anyone who loves songs from the Great American Song Book should love it.  I hope some of our younger generation will buy the CD and learn what&#34; great&#34; music is all about  June Dunaphant
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I was unable to attend the movies when it finally arrived in my town. Therefore, I had to buy it, as it produced the drama and excitement of a &#34;true story.&#34; I was drawn into it, without any problems. A truly remarkable movie, and one that I am happy to have in my movie gallery.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|It was so fun to watch this old classic from my high school days -- bring more seasons to Prime!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|i bought this film because Nathan Fillion is in it,watch it if you like not to serious sifi.entertaining enjoyable good film
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Great looking watch and keeps very good time. Stylish but not over the top. The date/day may be easier to see on a different face color. Or maybe not.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|There's not really a point to the game, but it's fun and addicting, but after you complete all of the objectives they get next to impossible for people with no patience like myself.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is about more than just a movie.  It's a statement.<br />An excellent film taking a look at itself, at celebrity, at values. Two thumbs way up.
B00BX50UEC|5.0|I get very fast considering other disk requests I asked a few months ago, I hope you always keep it running well, the songs, the recording and presentation are great.
B005VR9328|5.0|It's hard to find gifts for my younger brother. I thought I'd introduce him to The Roots. He was surprisingly into the album. I love this album!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book. It was so good plus the cliffhanger at the end! Can't wait for the next book!
B00008G8M4|5.0|I bought this movie for my 12 year old grandson.  He wanted a &#34;grown up&#34; movie, and I wanted a movie that would interest him, but not scare him into nightmares. This fit the bill perfectly!  He invites friends over to watch it on movie night and they all enjoy it.
0307476073|5.0|Recomended if you enjoy the outdoors at all, hiking, camping or any kind of outdoor activity.<br />here are four words
B009MYARIK|2.0|Took me about a day to read.<br /><br />Overall, the book was predictable.  However for a summer beach read, it kept me wanting to read more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A real period piece. A close look at British aristocracy in the early 20th century. Well done, but many Americans won't believe it is authentic.
B00DU74U74|5.0|it was a great movie start nothing like the twilite books but ok don't think there will be a follow up though
B006GWO5NE|2.0|Of the three I purchased, only one works properly with my Kindle Fire and my Kindle Fire HD, and it charges rapidly every time. Of the other two: 1 won't charge either Kindle device, at all; 1 charges VERY slowly and I get a \\"low power charger\\" alert with the Fire HD. Essentially I spent $30 on three devices that are supposed to charge Kindles, and can only use one of them. I'd say I'm pretty dissatisfied.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game, wish sessions lasted longer though before asking for money, but great that u can wait to get some free credit.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Weather.com upgraded so I did the same.  There upgrade put me in a cloudy mood but then I found AccuWeather.com and now I see clearly again.  I'm sorry I didn't switch a long time ago.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I LOVE Criminal Minds. I like how this show allows each team member to have a deeper story than what is just seen at work. Can't wait to watch season 8 and 9!
B008EEB4TA|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best albums I've ever purchased. Although I prefer the acoustic versions of some of her songs, these pop-soaked versions are fun and the songwriting is excellent.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries work great and last a long time!! Just as good as the &#34;expensive&#34; batteries! Will buy more of these when needed.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Sensational. Heart-warming yet credible, marvellous acting, hilarious moments and all based on a true story.  Unforgettable. Not to be missed.
B008M721MS|1.0|I recently downloaded this app to try and stay in touch with my brother and now my kindle will not connect to the internet.  It is connected to my home wifi like always, but when I click the web tab, it shows a blank screen.  I'm going to try and restore to factory defaults to see if that will fix it.  Do not download this app unless you want to destroy your kindle!!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I bought the book because of the movie...and think both (although almost entirely different) are well done.  I think the book ultimately \\"wins\\" because the author does such a good job of pretending to be so many characters...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never read such a sweet, heartbreaking love story! I was glued to this book! Colleen Hoover, you ripped my heart out! Only to mend it and put it back! This story has real issues that make your heart ache! But with Holder's love for Sky,she is stronger than ever!! READ THIS BOOK! And have plenty of tissue handy!
B00CKYIENY|5.0|A classic love story by Jane Austen.  Filled with drama of the time--the upper class looking down on the common class, misjudgments about how people feel and act, family embarrassments.  If you enjoyed the Keira Sedgwick movie, reading the book helps you understand parts of the movie that were unclear.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 8 year old son. And he loves this game.  Funny little guys.  Easy to play.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Difficult, realistic subject but fun to read as you tried to figure out the inevitable surprise ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool game and photo are all very much like it is real solution for my relax and enjoy the fun of it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best Masterpiece Theater (Classics) series by far! Love the costumes, the settings, the depiction of a bygone era.
B000Q4RJWW|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, but never get tired of it.<br /><br />Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford are awesome.<br /><br />Special effects just don't get any better.......great story!
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|I didn't do more than skim this book for new ideas, but I have to say that after traveling Europe extensively for the past 8 years (including almost 4 years living in Amsterdam), I wouldn't have put sitting in Vondelpark among the top 40 amazing experiences.  In fact, it's not even in my personal list of the top 20 things to do in Amsterdam.  That made the rest of the list in this book suspect, and I must admit that I then stopped reading further.
1897299214|5.0|Those people who have visited the Korean  DMZ will appreciate the wry, dry, grim humour of this comic book novel.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  Akthough I gave up on the television show, I love the music.  The writing (of the songs), the arranging, the acompanyment,  the singing, everything is fantastic.  I am a big country music fan, and this ranks with the best.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I started reading and could not stop. Nicholas Sparks is such a great writer. He make me want to start visiting all the great places in the south.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I was not to sure what to expect, but made for a great Sunday Afternoon laugh. It covers all the basis that so many people just think of, but would never act on.  I love the characters and well thought out story.  Would recommend!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is I prefer continues play and you don't get that because you get a number of lives.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once I figured it out, it was a lot of fun.<br />I got excited when I found the tools. It kept me interested.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I downloaded this because the weather channel app changed and is terrible now.  This one is marginally better; at least it doesn't force close as much.  I am not impressed though--may try other weather apps before deciding.
1400049628|5.0|I'm ready for the Zombie Horde!!!!! This book prepared you for every scenario, from the beginning to end can't put down!!!! LOL !!
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|It's crazy this really happened to someone! But what a great story! A definite must watch. The story line is great and James Franco played the part really good.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|A great book.  Just gets better with each page. The plot is masterfully conceived and pulls at you from multiple directions .  It is harder and harder to put down the more you progress through the story.
B003XRELEI|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut is one of the best writers, but i don't think at the level of tolstoy or dostoevsky.  this book shows the reality of midwestern life, particularly indianapolis and probably adjacent speedway.  of course, alcohol is a drug and, in a sense, a martini is a loser's drink.  no one believes that the champions ate wheaties, an unpalatable cereal.  the athlete's foot fungus suggests that athlete's foot was a problem at shortridge during his time as it was later.  the overwhelming theme, to me, is the dysfunctional nature of the characters even when appearing successful.  the conversations reflect the frustrations, inadequacies and bigotry of the characters - accurate descriptions of &#34;midwestern&#34; behavior.  as with slaughterhouse 5, repeat reading will be helpful.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a very fun game!!!. It's pass the time away for a free game love it when I win. It calms me down after work.
1400067820|5.0|After much thought I finally found some minutes to convey something on the spirit of the book. Lots of people do write reviews for books with two or three stars, but its much better to write barbell reviews, only for books that totally suck or that totally rule. I smelled this flaw even with university professors who review conference papers with two or three lines but are not antifragile enough to be able to read the papers on the ABC conjecture from Shinichi Mochizuki. To help my narrative I show you this table:<br /><br />  Antifragile     Fragile<br />  ----------------------------------<br />  shedding leaves   forever green<br />  diarrhea   constipation<br />  correlation     false causation<br />  spirits     ghosts<br />  letters     numbers<br />  Ardbeg     Bowmore<br />  sweat     urine<br />  fat tail     fat trunk<br /><br />There is of course no cherry picking in my examples, I don't even like cherries because they have been artificially sweetened over only the last few centuries, so that just can't be good. We all know that glaciers have been around much longer and are much more antifragile than say the pyramids, \\"merda constat variat altitudo\\".<br /><br />And for your inspiration: [...]
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I have an MSc in Medieval History so I was feeling somewhat timid about watching this series. Fortunately the powers that be have done, for the greater part, a fantastic job of keeping close to the history of this time and place. There are, of course, pieces that have been placed in it for its cinematic and engaging benefit; but overall I believe it has been quite well done. I am looking forward very much to Season 2.
B004VFK5LO|5.0|I have watched this serial killer film many times primarily because it is so well done and beautifully acted by Sigorney Weaver , Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulrooney.  The whole cast is quite impressive.  Weaver steals the movie and Holly Hunter is lovely and so good as a detective on this awful case.  It's been around for 18 years and I've probably watched it once a year.  The &#34;bad guys&#34; are played really well and are extremely scary and believable.  Try not to watch this too late at night.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Bette r than the first movie. Story was good but the action was even better. Here is hoping they make a third.
B000001FSP|5.0|I've been an appreciator of her work since &#34;As Tears Go By.&#34; I have all her records. I've been listening to her since I was 15 years old, I think it was 1964 or '65. I wanted this CD so I could listen to her in my car.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, Khalid Hosseini weaves a wonderful tale on love, family and wasted moments in time. He is brilliant a taking the reader into a world we've never known and making us feel comfortable, yet not, in that world. Once I started reading this story I couldn't put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have to read the next book! Can't stop here I have to know how it all ends. Great series to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love downton abbey. season 3 was a great mix of sad and happy moments for the residents of downton abbey. my only complaint is the how the season finale ended....why???? makes me sad.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|I was encouraged to read this book by my companies Human Synergistics facilitator. I have a team of mostly senior women whom I am trying to lead. This book has started my journey into helping them become the leaders they want and need to be.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|lots of action innovative yet implausible and sometimes impossible effects such as the gunpowder blowing a prison door lock  and again by setting it off by whacking it with the gun butt... But on the whole entertaining just needed a plausibility filter applied rigorously to the writer & director...
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I love it, my 14 year old granddaughter is now hooked, it might not be a family show but for older family's it a good show
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The first few levels were fairly easy but as with any good game, the higher the level yhe more challenging it gets. Looking forward to more levels to come
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great game. I love the easy option. For beginners like me. I hope to advance in speed and skill. Recommend this game to all old and young alike.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|At 425 pounds, I realized I had to do something drastic. A good friend of mine knew someone on the &#34;slow-carb&#34; diet that is outlined in this book, and he had lost 100 pounds in a year. I bought the book, thought about it a lot, wondered if I could do this long-term...and decided I could. Here I am, less than 1.5 years later, and I've lost almost 150 pounds. There's no special food to buy, no mandatory supplements, no added costs other than the book. There are tons of online resources to augment what's outlined in the chapters. I can't even begin to tell you how much this has changed and continues to change my life. I'm so greatful to Tim Ferriss and Amazon for providing this book.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 2.5 years, I lost 250 pounds. While no plan/lifestyle change is right for everyone, this worked very well for me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really liked the ending, and that's the main reason I have this book a 5 star rating. I don't think that this book was as good as the hunger games or catching fire in the beginning, but I'm glad it has a happy ending.
0887081770|2.0|My little girl did not like this one she was expecting that the book was a little bigger so if she is not happy  I'm not happy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I need to cheat I have it cheat can be telling his his mom and dad dad is going to be happy with yuh ain't sewn
B00ADII8YE|5.0|I had not watched any of The Walking Dead until about three weeks ago. I checked it out on Netflix, and I was quickly hooked. I was a bit squeamish during those first few shows, but soon realized that all I had to do was avoid heavy meals immediately before or during the episodes and I was good to go. All of the skull crushing and brain splattering took some getting used to for me.<br /><br />I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and then picked up the third on Amazon. I came to most respect the acting. All of the actors were great. The direction was outstanding. The writing was brilliant. As others have pointed out, this show is really about these diverse people interacting in desperate times. The walkers provide the horrifying background. Through the third season, my favorite performers were Merle (Lose a hand, gain a blade), Michonne (My best friend is a sword), and The Governor (You can trust me).
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I haven't seen a good horror movie in a long time. Evil dead was amazingly scary, with a good story.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|Very dissapointing. I am a huge fan of Phil, he has a lot of talent but this is pure noise. The guy is a great singer and he showed this in Pantera, Down, and even in Superjoint Ritual. The songs just aren't there. If you like screaming/noise, this is your cup of tea. If you like well-written songs, with melody and good vocals, stick with old Pantera and anything from Down. If anything this sounds like a second-rate Superjoint Record and that's not saying much.<br /><br />I do give the guy credit though, he certainly has not mellowed with age.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Absolutely love the game. The picture is super clear, well done. Anyone who enjoys the movie will be hooked to this game.
B003Y5H4YI|5.0|This was a captivating movie from start to finish. All of the actors were superb and the story was fabulous. I think that I would give the nod to this movie over Munich.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun I can't stop playing..it's 3in the morning<br />And I'm still playing.so it's worth it, so download it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  And after reading The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I'm glad to see that Khaled Hosseini is able to use the same story writing formula, but adapt it to other situations without loss of interest.
B007XF4J70|4.0|It's an easy 5 star classic film.  I gave it 4 because I was slightly disappointed in the video quality, especially when others are raving about it.  Don't get me wrong, the video quality is very good, generally speaking very sharp.  I watched this and then The Maltese Falcon bluray back to back, and I must admit that The Maltese Falcon's video quality is sharper and clearer.  The let down in Casablanca, as some others have noted, is in the close-ups of Ingrid Bergman.  The video quality goes from sharp to soft in a second.  On a smaller TV, you would probably never notice.  It could be from filters used, make-up, etc.. that is just the way they used to film it.  However, the contrast between sharp and soft is really noticeable on a hd big screen television.  On standard film way back when, I'm sure the video projection at the theatre was just all soft.  They weren't into Hi def in the 1940's!  I will compare the Bluray  to my regular dvd later and see how much better the Bluray is.  Still, it didn't really take much away from the movie itself.  This is one of my favorites.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|We're old DCD fans and weren't sure we'd like the new offering but this turned out to be a very nice addition to our collection and we are soooo happy they are back!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works perfect on my Kindle Fire. No issues at all. Best weather app I found so far. You won't be disappointed.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I love being able to go to YouTube and watch viedo that people have posted, but it doesn't play Vevo videos. I had to download a separate application for that. Works beautifully.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|As usual, the movie wasn't anywhere near as good a the book, but all in all it was still a good movie.  Personally I think since they left out of the movie so much from the book, that to understand some of the subtle things the actors say, you should read the book first and then see the movie.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I love when all of the comic books come together in a movie and work together. The cinematography in this movie is amazing.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|very entertaining game, never get tired of playing it,  my teenage son likes too, hours of great fun,  i recommended 100 percent.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My favorite show ever in history. I've watched the seasons in real time but am purchasing the episodes for a friend.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved the ease of renting and watching Red. Looking forward to issuing Amazon instant video again. Price was right too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've enjoyed solitare for a long time and find this game very enjoyable. For me it's a relaxing game. I highly recommend!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best free game app ever. I can't stop playing this game over and over again. Easy to play, easy to get addicted to.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game has a simple but challenging central gameplay mechanic. It has solid immediate rewards, as well as an enduring sense of progress that cultivates long periods of play.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|very intimate music that grabs you and holds your attention until the end, after which you are left with a longing for more!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're reading this right now, then you obviously have some idea of what this show is about, or at least a passing interest in quality science fiction. Make no mistake, while this show was short-lived, it is one of the greatest achievements of western-sci-fi storytelling ever achieved, and not likely to be surpassed anytime soon. And if you like this, be sure to pick up the movie, Serenity as well, as it picks up where the season long show ended.
B000FJGWBC|1.0|I bought a couple of films about diving or so I thought.<br />Any aspiring diver had better not watch this film, or he/she will soon be an ex-diver.
B009MJU9QU|5.0|He is so cute and totally perfect!  Really quite heart warming, it just brightens up any space!  The ultimate in inspiration!  A real source of joy.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|i got this as part of a deal on amazon, it fits my little point and shoot canon just fine and has room for a few extras if you need to take them with you.....nice little bag
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best temple run game yet. In my opinion, this game isn't the WORST game I've ever played, that one is the original temple run.
B000SW2F8K|5.0|What a surprise. I watched this put of sheer boredom e and don't expect to like it at all. This movie was so much fun!  Going to look for the sound track as the music was soooooo good. I highly recommend this movie.  Now, I want to go to Brazil.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel has a channel on tv and a website weather.com. The best weather app is the weather channel. Get the app today!
B00BB8Q13A|4.0|one of the best movie deals on Prime - Rush and Paltrow portray their characters so well the story is believable from the onset. Wonderful direction and settings put you there in the 1500s and hold your interests until the very end..
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds doesn't feel fun anymore. Don't or do get it. Sometimes it's fun, but not all the time anymore. Dont get it.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Mirrormask is an extremely creative movie, heavily focused on the dream-like art of one young girl. This story will carry you through the adventures of her mind.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja free is a fun fruit chopping game there is. Fruit Ninja free has more versions of the game. People reading this review, get the app today!
B008GODP04|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  Edith Hope the main character is interesting - brave and intelligent. definitely recommend this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is like temple run and despicable me minion rush are mostly the same. But it's more fun then them. In my opinion, Ilike all of those games.
1451695195|2.0|Non believable and not a good read in my opinion. Would not recommend. Way better after life experience books out there for the money
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Toca Boca Hair Salon 2 and toca kitchen are the only two games on the kindle. All of toca boca games are on Apple products. Hair games are fun, and you don't need experience to play it. It's one of the best hair games there is.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another excellent book from Hosseini.  He paints word pictures of life in Arab countries that take you there.  Can't wait for the next one.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|From guitars to Ipads and from Blankets to some mattresses. Ebay has got it all. Electronics, Automobiles, and a lot more. People reading this, get the app create an account and sell the things you don't want.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|GREAT PERIOD FILM. BEAUTIFUL SCENERY AND LOCATIONS. VERY REALISTIC DIALOGUE AND SETS.<br /> PROBLEMS OF THE RICH ARE JUST AS COMMON AS IN THE POORER FOLKS!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Loved it.  It is so funny and entertaining.  Ifbi have the time, i will watch it over and over again
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|If you like history, you will like this. Between this and Hatfield's and Mccoy's, I think History is doing an excellent job with original programming. Being a game of thrones fan, I also enjoyed a similar themed show that was based in real history. I really enjoy the character's of Ragnar and Rollo. But this show means even more to me because these were my ancestors, and I am very proud of my Viking and Scandinavian heritage. Plus, there is nothing wrong with a little Viking courage and bravery when we play football or our troops have to go into battle.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie is much better than the reviews it has received from the experts.  It shows some of the mistreatment of blacks in the deep south which continued long after the civil war but throws in humor to make it bearable. It opens one's eyes.  It is a shame this treatment existed in such a great country.  Great movie!
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Earlier I'm so bored then when I searched gameloft and I saw that Gangstar Vegas is AVAILABLE on Amazon app store I was thrilled and bought it right away. The graphics is amazing, the controls are fantastic. I'm really really loving this game. Also this one is much better than Gangstar Rio. It's really smooth and I haven't notice any problems with it. Thanks Gameloft for another great game.  I'll update more later if anything changes.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The best movie (musical in decades!  We should have more of these made for us to watch. Too much talent to be described here............it needs to be SEEN!
B005544V6A|5.0|I love the interaction between the characters in this series.  The story lines aren't so compelling as the draw of the characters.  I think the actors in this series do a great job of making us like them.  Fun series to watch.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|We use this now instead of our GPS system.  It works great on my Samsung Galaxy 3.  It didn't work as well on my old phone because the GPS on that phone was almost garbage, but that was a problem with my phone, not the app.
0446530573|5.0|After the shocking news of the death of James Gandolfini, purchasing this cookbook for my son who is a chef, was something that will keep the &#34;Soprano&#34; tradition of family cooking alive.  The book is well worth the money, and the stories, antidotes, pictures, and comments are priceless.  I am ready for him to try one of Artie's recipes on me!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel app works great! I love it because I can check my area's weather. We do not have cable right now, so this is perfect!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I just learned about this series from my 2 millennium sons, one of which is a first year lawyer.  I managed to catch up on the first 2 seasons in a matter of 5 days.  I love the actors, the quick witty dialogue between the various characters and the constant friction in each story line.  I miss this kind of tv programming and for the most part don't watch today's reality tv.  Can't wait to get into season 3 to see how things develop from here.  If season 3 is anything like 1 & 2, this should be fun.
B008Q0D9DG|4.0|It's really interesting to see how the stars of this movies have aged today. Anyway, it's a fun movie with a feel good ending.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is a classic movie, a must see by anyone. I love this movie and I think others will to.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Life is Beautiful. I appreciate this life. I truly appreciate what I have. It's 2013 and this is my first viewing of the film. It couldn't have come at a better time. Don't wait, life is now. \\"The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem\\". Love and gratitude -James
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great puzzle solving game! very challenging! its fun trying to tie all the clues to open other parts of the puzzle.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|If you love jazz this album is for you.  Gregory Porter takes us back in time with a nostalgic sound and his modern voice.  I love every single track!!!!!<br /><br />I have it on heavy rotation.  Great music for the mature music lover.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a good way to teach responsibly to all ages. I also like the graphics. I only wish it had more to do.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|Loved this disc. Beautiful music. His voice is interesting but still conveys so much emotion. Highly recommend this disc to anyone.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The author can really paint a picture of the story. I would totally recomend this to a friend. Great read.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Not his best possible film but a good attempt to entertain. With lots of action. ..like watching grandpa with his oldtimer friends in a weekend adventure...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am only level 6 and I already love this game! Awesome graphics, you don't need to spend real money to play, and you never have to worry about energy in this game. You can play as long or as little as you want! I highly recommend this game for people of all ages.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The best game ever this game is lots of fun..you will enjoying playing it...<br />Your children will love to play ....
B005LJITS0|5.0|The Green Latern was a fantastic movie to watch especially at home.  It was exciting, funny, thrilling and a fun movie to watch with family.  I like the ability to rent it quickly at Amazon and the price is fantastic.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book. Completely captivating. A quick read because you don't want to put it down. Enjoyed how the story unfolded.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I selected this book because I like magical realism, and the book was well written, but it was basically a horror story, so I didn't like it.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Expected this film to bad but entertaining. But it was just bad and offensive. Like the use of term Haji in the movie which was originally meant as \\"Generally expanded to be a derogitory term to anybody from India or Pakistan. \\" But apparently now its just a derogatory term from the area Americans perceive as the Middle East, which I guess is anything east of Europe. Its nice when a film propagate both racism and ignorance at the same time.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I had no idea that this one recording studio was the home of so many important recordings and was responsible for such creativity largely because of a very special Neve recording desk.  It produced such a great, warm sound that just screams ANALOG SOUND and spurs creativity!
B005544V6A|5.0|I usualy like series that has character, shows internal conflict and smart remarks and of coaurse good acting this series keeps you in suspense for what to come and captures your attention and you live the moment even there is a big lie you want to shout out and protect mike
B005LAIHEA|5.0|This movie was so funny great to watch by yourself  girlfriends or with your guy.  You laugh and hope for the best as each attempt to be perfect fails
B00BF11STU|4.0|Zero Dark Thirty-Jessica Chastain  Let's just say the everything in this movie about the killing of Osama bin Laden is true.  If so, it is interesting to see how it all played out. I am surprised that the US security community would allow insight into how we found out information, but surely they had edit rights????
034580404X|5.0|Great writing.  Held my interest ther whole time. I kept camparing my boyfriend to Mr. Grey.  He was my Mr.Grey except for the S&M.  AWesome
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Quartet-Maggie Smith  I liked Maggie Smith even before Downton Abbey.  This is another good movie for an evening in.  It is on the order of Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  Easy entertainment.
B006LSZECO|3.0|In the beginning, I enjoyed the story but by the end I was saying, &#34;NO!&#34; Why did it end that way?.. Either do a sequel or an optional ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft - Pocket Edition  - Young boys love playing this game.  It promotes problem-solving and is not gross or profane.
B0009OIDLA|4.0|McLintock is hysterical.  John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are in their element.  I got this as a gift and have not seen &#34;Angel and the Badman&#34;
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read the first two books by Hosseint, I enjoyed them more than this novel.<br />There was a lot of jumping around subjects.  This was confussing at times.
0762445262|5.0|Got this for my son for his bday and he loves. He uses every night as a night light!!!! Thank you!!!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Not quite up to par for Tarrantino.  Fairly violent but plot line entirely too predictable and weak.  Save your money.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Were I to stranded in the wilderness somewhere, with this knife and a fire steel, I would feel set.  In some ways this knife feels more like a small sword.  Meaning it an incredibly sturdy knife.  There is a lot of steel on this blade. I suspect it can survive all kinds of abuse.  If you need to chop, it feels like it was made for chopping.  If you need to hammer, it has a lot weight to it so I can see it hammering very easily.  Batoning should not be an issue with the knife in the least, again considering the weight.  This knife is not made of stainless steel so it needs the occasional application of mineral oil, but I have some handmade knifes that require the same care and they are worth it for the quality.  Knife is also very well balanced and easy to handle.<br /><br />This knife is just plain awesome.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I  like that I don't have to go online first to go to youtube. The videos played quickly and easily.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Moving. Are we better in our purest form, youth, or, are we smarter, wiser with more experience under our belts, older. This is a story about experience using its wisdom to employ youth to save the world. But at what cost? What is really the wisest path?
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|Watched this series when it was originally broadcast and loved it. Have been sick the last few days and have enjoyed watching it again.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Its a great read that is about more than just food.  Pollan brings in other literature, cultural, social aspects of the human endeavor as influenced by food or as food influences the other human dynamics.  Pollan is a gifted author whose word crafting skills are top drawer.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It was about what I expected CGI wise.  Well executed.  An enjoyable and fun escape into a well known story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Even though its based on history and you think you know what's  coming next, the plot twists are awesome!  I didn't want it to end!
0143118706|5.0|Elizabeth's Gilbert's voice has matured since Eat, Pray, Love, and I appreciate the research on marriage that she has done.  She interweaves that research with her own personal story.  Find out why marriage is a subversive activity!
B00181JGI2|5.0|Not for everyone but the story, the characters, the cast and the acting make it one of the classics.  I buy it for $5 whenever I see it, then I give it away for others to enjoy over and over.
B0043URV5U|4.0|I have enjoyed this disc, if you like Bob Seger, and do not have these songs you will like this disc.
B0085OELXK|5.0|The acting of all the major characters are excellent...and the movie has enough twists and turns to be a real thriller,  No matter what Ripley ends up doing, one hopes he will be successful as the result of the way he has been treated.  He's a real mastermind!
1118109791|5.0|I would like to get an MBA and I think the GMAT Guide is an option in order to be ready for my test.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Wonderful story about the young queen and how she became a great queen.  It shows her true love for Albert and how she must have truly loved him until his untimely death.  Players are awesome, especially Emily Blunt who is so beautiful.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love the game its what ive been wanting to play but I must suggest that the dragons have one more evolution form
B0000TB01Y|5.0|They say the music and story is awesome - sent my kids to NYC to see it on the stage so bought this to prepare them and they loved it.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Our son is trying to get in the US Naval Academy. This book scared the bozookers out of me. Adam reminded me so much of our son who also is named Adam. It really brought to life what these men are doing to preserve America\\"s freedom.  It also showed me the emotions their wives and children go through. I just want to praise and thank each one of them!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|everyone should get this got it like a year ago and is still not boring BEST GAME EVER OMG SO AWESOME
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, and it turned out to be one of my favorites.  The story is so unbelievable that you have to believe it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book reads like a bunch of short stories, but they are all connected to a main storyline.  I have never felt the importance of how relationships develop over time and how each generation influence the next in such unexpected ways until I had read this book.  It gave me a profound sense of interconnectedness and a more sympathetic outlook on the poor and downtrodden people of the middle east, who overcome a lot of obstacles to make their way.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Great app for those looking for an outlet to listen to everything and anything. As well as getting to know new artistic, selfhelp, political, philosophical or comical personalitiesas well as an opportunity to get yourself known as well
B006RXPUR2|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  A lot of good actors.  Didn't guess the ending until the very end. Well worth renting.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I had been waiting for the release of this album for a long time. One Republic's music is intelligent with thoughtful lyrics and a unique sound. Going to see them perform live soon. Can 't wait!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the suspense, not predictable like other scifi.<br />I wish they had continued the show.<br />The characters were very believable.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've been going to the gym more or less regularly for the last 3 years, with little to no progress at all.  I hit a roadblock a year in, and really just kept on going for health reasons 2 to 3 times a week, feeling exhausted after grueling 1h30-2h workouts which included at least half an hour of cardio work.  It just didn't feel good going anymore and I just kept on doing it because I am quite disciplined.<br /><br />This book changed everything, to my erroneous preconceived notions on how to workout and eat right (it completely destroys what the average joe thinks he knows about eating and working out right), to the way I plan, think ahead and work around my schedule to actually make time for the healthy, great looking body I deserve.  But the most important part is that it actually brought FUN back into my workouts ! I am know looking forward lifting at the end of the day after work with boatloads more of energy than I used to have, and just feel so much better on a general basis (I now go 5 times a week and it's super enjoyable !).<br /><br />I've been tracking my progress on each exercises through a spreadsheet, lost 4 kgs, developed a pronounced V shape and all of this in just two weeks following what's in this book !  I really can't thank the author enough and highly recommend this book to anyone who's tired of the BS and just want to make progress and have a healthier, better looking body. Of course there's no miracle though, you'll have to put in time and effort, and it will take some strong willpower to start counting your calories, your fat/carbs/protein proportions and going out there and giving it your all during workouts (I think the book could have used a chapter on willpower and discipline.  Although I have no problem with this, having practiced various martial arts all my life, some other people might want to work on this to get the maximum out of this book).<br /><br />But if you're tired, but still motivated enough to really want to change, then this is the perfect place to start.  This book was inspiring.<br /><br />PS:  Better get The Shredded Chef from the same author as well though, because you'll run out of meal ideas fast without it !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What actors!  What sets!  What Costumes!  What a story!  Need I say more?  All the best comes together in this great series.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  There are so many teachable moments.  It was great to be able to get the season on disc because I was not always able to see it on the tube.  It was especially nice to have it without the commercials.  This is the best show on tv, so authentic, so funny, and it leaves you on edge.  The cost was nearly a $10 savings ordering from Amazon.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I was looking forward to another book by Khaled Hesseini as I had really enjoyed his previous work. In this new book he has used  a different theme while maintaining the Afghanistan  connection. Insight was gained in reading this story of the pre, during and after effects of the revolutions. The story was sad, confronting and exhilarating . Some of the latter chapters were predictable and this took some gloss from the read. It is well worth reading and for most, this book will be very well written.
0807014273|4.0|read this in high school  but i keep buying ones for friends<br />and their children going to college. find it well thought out, his<br />last part of book is open to discussing. overall i like it.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Enjoyed it very much. The actors did a great job portraying the original cast. You do not need to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is the second time around watching all of the new Doctor Who seasons and once again I'm going through the episodes like mad. Christopher Eccleston is such a great person to fill in as the doctor and this season is a must watch as it sets the ideas of what the doctor believes in as well as the adversaries that will be faced that make the next seasons so great. The writing is great and  there is always references to past episodes throughout all of the Doctor Who seasons so it allows you to be part of the ride!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I cant whait for the next update I herd they are going to add lots of new features and mobs<br />I cant whakt
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Maybe it's been awhile since Daft Punk has released an album (besides the Tron soundtrack) but I'm not sure if they were trying to do their own thing as well as please the people who have grown accustomed to needing vocals on each track but there seems to be a divide on the album between mainstream songs with vocal and what would be older Daft Punk with a 70's twist. Funny enough, the tracks with the vocals are the best ones on the CD (except for Touch; it sounds like the song from the original Willy Wonka when they are going through the tunnel. Creepy.)<br />Pharrell Williams and Julian Casablancas come through with obviously the most catchy songs on the album.<br /><br />It's not really like their older stuff that would get you ready to go out. I play it more on a Saturday/Sunday morning when I'm getting over a hangover and need something chill to listen to.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why this series was ever cancelled is beyond me. It is well written, well cast, and the acting is very good. I own it and rewatch it.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I am a big Tinkerbell fan and my nieces loved the fact that the sisters found each other and were able to help all the faeries. For a third installment, it was a great addition to our collection.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|The first in the parody series of four movies (so far) this is a pretty good start. There are two of the numerous Wayon's clan in here and they are funny. Anna Faris is good and overall the acting is decent. There several scenes that some will consider gross but they are grossly funny. Sophomoric yes, funny yes.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my dad's birthday, who loves a lot of classic rock and is a huge Eagles fan. I love them too, but even I got sucked in to most of this film. So many details, so much history, so many songs that I will listen to differently now, knowing more about them and the members of this band. If you're a die-hard Eagles fan, you'll want to add this to your collection, and perhaps watch multiple times. Great price for what I got out of it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|super fun game not too hard or too easy multiple stages lots of fun I really suggest it and plus it is free
0857685627|5.0|I'm one of the biggest Halo fans I know. I've been a fan since I was 10, back when Halo: Combat Evolved first released. It's been one hell of a journey. I don't collect many things, and though my most expensive hobby is definitely my love for cars, Halo might be second on that list. So, when I found this product on amazon, it didn't take much time for me to add it to my cart, along with a few other Halo books/art books.<br /><br />And I was so glad I did. I can't really go into detail about it. If you're reading this, it is likely you're a big Halo fan, and the only question in your mind is &#34;is this worth $25?&#34;<br /><br />To me, the answer is unabashedly yes. But I'm an admitted Halo-fanboy. I love the art, the music, the characters, the story, the gameplay, the canon, the history. This book is just another cherry on the lovely Halo cake. And I love cherries!
B00B5JVXYC|4.0|I am enjoying this game. It is not a pushover and I am still at the beginning level!<br />Lovely that it is free! Thank you.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Ordered this on advice from a friend. We've been looking for a microphone to pair-up with our GoPro cameras that we mainly use to record while we go driving in our cars. The camera itself has a rather terrible sound quality, and I didn't want to spend a lot to rectify that problem.<br /><br />Well, I found the solution: this microphone! Not only does it do a rather good job at sound quality for something it wasn't exactly intended (loud exhaust and inevitable wind noise is a far cry from a person talking, yeah?), but the long cord and clip made it practical, too. I could clip the mic to my license plate, near the exhaust, and route the cord into the cabin and connect it to the GoPro, no problem. Even in an open spot like that, wind noise was very minimal, and the sound was almost perfect. Certainly, for 20 bucks, I can't complain one bit.<br /><br />I'd say there would be no point in buying a more expensive microphone unless you simply needed wireless, or were at such a professional level of recording/transmitting a sound, that this mic would simply be the weak link in your production. But at that level, you can afford a 100 dollar mic. Everyone else can get this one, and spend the extra 80 on whatever!
B003ODHOA4|3.0|Great book enjoy learning . This force review by kindle is silly and waste if time. 谢谢 thank you 2013
1781163243|5.0|The graphical style and images of Halo 4 is perhaps my favorite aspect of Halo 4 itself. So it should be no surprise that I bought this with little question as to whether I would like it or not.<br /><br />I like it. A lot. I like looking through it, I like it on my Halo shelf. Not much else to say. If you love Halo, how can you not love the one thing about Halo 4 that almost everyone agrees on: that it looked stunning!?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Have not stopped playing this game since I downloaded it. This game is brilliant with great graphics. Love the challenge`s and all the minions. Would recommend this game to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you saw the movie this one is for you ! They must have had a great time making this game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game that I play all the time. I have played it on trips and while waiting for a appointment. Highly recommend.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Though Amazon's header info is non-specific, I believe this was specifically in reference to the single streaming episode of Operation--Annihilate.  In any case the quality of the video streaming was excellent and this episode one of my favorites.  None better to showcase the friendship of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.<br /><br />Star Trek was and always shall be one of the most quotable shows in TV history.  No one has ever come close to the brilliance of the original.
B00DAKW7Q2|5.0|Awesome CD.... always has been...  awesome download...  great quality.... would recommend it to anyone looking for a great classic album to add to their classic rock collection....
B006LXQID8|5.0|I've lost count how many times I've seen this.  It's beautiful, it's romantic, it's funny, it's quirky and when it's over you'll want to do one of three things:<br /><br />1) go to Paris<br />2) go to a photo booth<br />3) buy a yard gnome
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Well first the slender man is awesome  and as close u can get to real slender. The graphics are pretty good and the maps are awesome. I suggest this to any slender fans
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of activities to do, great for kids who have a horse obsession. I have not come across any errors or problems.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I was hesitant with this Reacher offering.  I've read all the others and really, really enjoyed them.  This one seemed off, but true to Lee Child form, it's worth the read.  Love the dialogue and switching back and forth between Agent Sorenson and Reacher.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It was a little short.  The abyss and another one about a lost person was better and more of a challenge.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn/Mitch Rapp do not disappoint! Spent a lot of time on the edge of my seat. A great read!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked, I watched the whole season in two nights! Then on to season 3 and half way through that!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I liked playing this game, but there are not enough levels available.  When you get to the highest level allowed (10 I think) that is the end.  It tells you that you will be notified when more levels become available, but that has not happened after nearly a month.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Would you rather your kids be rich or happy? Happiness is the key to success in every area of your life. Shawn Achor is funny and brilliant in making it possible to change your brain to think happiness no matter what your past. This book will change your life for the better!
B000SKNIWE|4.0|What's not to like?  Great content, that is well done.  Hyper-real audio and HD video make for an engaging experience.
B0088WLEL6|5.0|Stargate Universe was and is an outstanding sci-fi show.  It follows the adventures of a human crew that is trapped aboard the Destiny, a starship built by The Ancients nearly a million years ago.  Much darker than prior entries in the Stargate series, it was far more realistic, gritty, and frankly interesting than its compatriots.  The characters, the story, the acting, all of these come together in a beautiful mélange.  This show should NEVER have been cancelled by &#34;SyFy&#34; especially mid-story arc.  Fortunately the writers were able to leave the show in a bit of a &#34;holding pattern&#34; if you will rather than just have a terrible ending.  The current cliff hanger leaves hope that perhaps someday, somehow, a Gate could be opened back to the Destiny and the show could continue (hint hint Amazon:  If you were to pick it up as a show and created news seasons, I will continue my &#34;Prime&#34; account without question :) )
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|The blot lot was a little tired, but entertaining for the most part.  I would rent, it isn't anything you need to own.
B0014D6PCO|3.0|Christian Bale is a very good actor. Loved him in the Prestige, but this movie wasn't his best performance. I didn't care for some of the cheesy come back lines.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|We really enjoyed it. Seeing that era and how they dressed. Also the class system. Everyone in their place. Or maybe not. Very entertaining. We're hoping for a fourth season.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|The title says it all. I have always loved match three games and this one is Awesome. It keeps you on your toes and thinking fast. Wish it would let you go back and re play for better scores.  If you like &quot;Treasures of Montezuma&quot; then you will like this game also.
0345525558|5.0|This was a wonderful story and I totally enjoyed it - all of it.  It's a joy to read and a keeper.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Just OK. Wants you to write reviews to give you points. Post to face book for points. Like in Facebook for points. Points can be purchased, etc
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Well written and inspiring. I read it twice and got as much out of the second reading as I did the first. An eye-opening account of the coming of age in life as well as in the political world of Barack Obama as well as a moving story of a son's search for his missing father's legacy..

B0056BU3I2|3.0|I bought this one because I have tokyo drift in B/R which is imo the best one because it has the most races out of all of them if I wanted to see an action movie I would of bought a die hard movie this movie deserves a 3 out of 5 because the whole movie is based on a heist and not even about racing which is what gave birth to this franchise<br /><br />The only race in this movie is a drag and its with COP CARS!! how stupid is that? they were running from the cops in the first one now theyre racing them? dumb if you asked me<br /><br />I let my friend borrow it and I didnt even bother asking for it back

B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I was extremely happy with this game until 1 week into it when it crashed. Somehow i was lucky enough that i restarted my Kindle and all was resumed. 2 days later however, i waited for the game to upload and was given a message telling me that the contents of the game may have been illegally obtained?! thus, the game could not be played any further.<br />I am at a loss as to how this can have been \\"illegally obtained\\" when the purchase was made directly through Amazon.<br />As i was curious, i read through some of the reviews and the further down i went, the more negative they became.<br />As a precaution for anything happening to my Kindle, i have now deleted the game. Such a shame as the game & the graphics were great!

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Richard Castle and his Nikki Heat stories are going to make history.<br />This was my second one and, as a writer myself, I tend to see how dialogue is handled, how plots develop and whether I can see flaws that will (maybe) bring down the star count... but this one is as good as Naked Heat.<br />What starts with the death of a real estate tycoon and art collector,  and soon develops into a full-fledged well plotted mystery.  Jameson and Nikki make a good team and I like their sweet flirting and hot lovemaking.<br />A must for all libraries.  Once more... I don't care who Richard Castle really is.  He could be the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, or the man in the moon:  HE CAN SURE WRITE!!

0312944926|1.0|\\"Dreadful\\" does not encompass this story.  The characters are one dimensional and the dialog wooden. The premise of the book demonstrates that the author has not done his research on the internet or encryption.  For example, a key plot element early in the book is that an internet retransmission site - one that retransmits your e-mails with an anonymous address so as to maintain the sender's privacy - takes HOURS to execute.  Dan, these things are done by computers, right?  Brown invents a supercomputer that can crack the code on 150 e-mail messages a day - 150 out of a few hundred million, Dan, is the loss of that capability really the \\"end of intelligence gathering\\" as you depict it?  Dan has the deputy head of the NSA fly a university professor out to Spain to pick up the belongings of a dead American - like, there is no embassy to do that?  Like, the CIA has no local people in Europe that could do this?  The story, the circumstances, and the plot is so silly in incredible (as in, \\"Not Credible\\") I could not finish the dross.  The author makes points of huge drama out of the most obvious developments, how can he tell me \\"this is exciting\\" when I am bored to death.  The bottom line is that I feel cheated of my money, and write this as a warning to others.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Why would you play any other game when you can play this????!!!!!??!?? Best game even cant stop playing its sooooooooooooooooooooo addicting in a good way get it now I'm not kidding around!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I was really impressed! Great action scenes with a tough-as-nails female lead in Gretel and the dry humor ass-kicker in Hansel. This isn't for the kiddies, folks. There's a great twist to it all, too. Watch this movie!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is a fantastic time-travel (and historical-fiction) novel written by the talented and acclaimed Stephen King. This book has just about everything you could want in a time-travel novel (or any novel for that matter). It is loaded with interesting unique and colorful characters, i.e., some appealing and some despicable. It provides the reader with \\"edge of their seat\\" life-threatening action, yet it also offers many tender moments, including a love affair. It provides a uniquely structured time-travel process that transports the traveler through a \\"rabbit-hole\\" at a specific location in Maine, always depositing them back in time at eleven fifty-eight on the morning of September ninth, 1958. Also, no matter how long the traveler stays in the \\"Land of Ago\\" (the past), their return to the present is always two minutes after they began their trip to the past. If the traveler makes more than one trip to the past, each new time-travel trip is their first, as if they had never traveled back in time previously. Every repeat visit to the past by the same person negates all their actions and accomplishments that took place during their previous trip, i.e., a complete reset occurs. The main character in this book, Jake Epping, journeys from 2011 through the \\"rabbit-hole\\" to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. He enters the \\"Land of Ago\\" in 1958 and spends almost five years there developing his plan to stop Oswald. During those years he also tries to continue and semi-normal life in the past. Eventually he gets a job as a teacher in a small town near Dallas. He meets many nice people and enjoys that part of his life as much as possible, but he doesn't neglect his primary objective of stopping the JFK assassination. He also fixes some other wrongs along the way. Mr. King presents a very complex story which reveals his incredibly exhaustive research on the Kennedy assassination, the people involved in it, and the overall culture and lives of ordinary people during the late 1950s and early 1960s in the US. Mr. King is very adept at keeping the reader involved, surprised and often shocked by events in his stories. He certainly accomplished that in this book for me. I was completely captivated and mesmerized by this story, and repeatedly surprised and shocked by unanticipated violence, actions, and turns of plot. The ending was not what I expected, but I found it to be completely satisfying. The protagonist, and many others, in this book strive to do good and the reader becomes invested in their welfare. However, \\"... the past doesn't want to be changed. It fights back when you try. And the bigger the potential change, the harder it fights.\\" This is a wonderful book, which I strongly recommend to anyone, but especially to those who want to believe time-travel is possible.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love Baldacci's writing. His tales take place in Virginia near my sister's home. This story is another worth the read, good character development, believable story line, enough suspense to keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Several couples have babies in a variety of ways -- everything from overseas adoption to mother almost dying during delivery.  The characters are so-so.  The acting marginal.  It's just not a great movie.

B00847KFDS|5.0|There are few times I've ever been disappointed with any song John Fogerty wrote of performs.  He's done a great job producing this album, getting great performances from all the artists.  (I finally got to see a live Fogerty performance a few years ago, and he really puts everything into it.  What a talent.)  His songs never lose their appeal over the years, to me, like so many other old hits do.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Star Wars the original trilogy is by far the best and most exciting for all audiences to watch its a great addition to any collection and the new movies are highly anticipated.
B001UW58YK|3.0|I was expecting the stereo digital output to be at least 96kb sample rate and 24 bit from what I have been reading about blu ray audio.  But when I ran the digital output from my Oppo BDP 83SE player to my Cambridge Audio DAC Magic, the DAC lit up the 48 kb sample rate light.  That is barely more than a standard CD's 44 kb.  And listening confirmed that the sound quality was nothing special.<br /><br />I did enjoy Michael Buble's performance, although some of the banter with the audience seemed too put on for my taste.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|Band has great depth and range.  Their singer -- first rate.  Great drummer, too.  They got all the pieces plus material worthy of showcasing . . . hardly a weak song on the whole album.  Highly recommended.

B0084IG8TM|2.0|The Hunger Games (Gary Ross, 2012)<br /><br />Terence Malick's desecration of James Jones' greatest novel, The Thin Red Line, sits at #4 on my list of the one hundred worst movies of all time. While the catalog of faults there are to be found with the film is approximately the length of the average encyclopedia, there's one glaring problem with the thing that always stands out in my head: it ends halfway through the book. Well, almost. That truncated speech George Clooney shows up to give five minutes before the end of the movie? That is the exact halfway point of the novel. They compressed the entire second half of a six-hundred-plus page novel into five minutes of screen time. Now, given that, what do you expect I'm going to say about The Hunger Games? I grant you, the compression wasn't that drastic, but you're talking about a movie that runs over two hours (and, it should be noted--this may be considered a spoiler alert, but I don't give a damn--the last eight minutes of the movie are credits. Eight minutes of end credits.), and Katniss and Peeta don't find that cave until there's less than forty minutes of movie left (and eight minutes of that are end credits)? Doubleyou-tee-eff, Gary Ross and Suzanne Collins?<br /><br />For this paragraph, you can simply cut and paste everything I wrote in my review of the novel re: how similar it is to Battle Royale, though the movie highlighted a key point in the difference between the two I hadn't really considered before: one of the reasons Takami Koshoun's book is so successful at what it does is the razor-sharp satire. The film adaptation of it, while not nearly as successful as the book, takes the satire and jacks it up a few notches, to the point where portions of the movie are flat-out comedy. (That first scene in the abandoned classroom? That's an exercise in tension in the book. In the movie, it's comedy gold--it's the movie's best scene.) Collins' novel certainly has satirical qualities, but she traded most of the satire to go the dystopian-fiction route. This is neither a surprise, in today's YA literary culture, nor necessarily a bad thing; I thought it worked well in the novel. In this adaptation, by comparison, all of the satire has been leached out. This thing is serious as a heart attack. Even Haymitch is clean and well-coiffed throughout, which is kinda ridiculous if you're the town drunk. And the dead-flat seriousness serves to highlight the superiority of BR. This is SENSITIVE DYSTOPIAN FICTION DAMMIT, PAY ATTENTION. Oh, for the love of pete. Give it a rest. If you don't know people are watching this movie for the sheer joy of watching teenagers beat on one another, you've kind of missed the entire point.<br /><br />I'm blaming that one solely on Collins, because Ross, once he got behind the camera and started directing this silly thing, obviously did not forget that, and as a result the movie's main strengths are its action sequences. This is not necessarily a surprise (Seabiscuit, anyone?). That first scene at the Cornucopia... but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />NOTE: the plot summary may be construed to contain spoilers based on how the novel unfolds, but they were things mentioned up front in the movie (I am assuming the script was written based on \\"everyone who's going to go see this already read the book, so...\\"); if you have done neither, you may want to do one or the other before reading and/or skip the next paragraph.<br /><br />Plot: Panem is a post-apocalyptic America that, since an uprising almost seventy-five years ago, has been separated into twelve districts. The higher the number, the poorer the district. Katniss Everdeen (Winter's Bone's Jennifer Lawrence) lives with the remains of her family in District 12 (in modern-day America, this is the rural Appalachians), whose main function in Panem is the mining of coal. Katniss' father was a coal miner; he died in an industrial accident years before the opening of the film, which sent her mother (Tombstone's Paula Malcomson) spiralling into a depression from which she has never emerged, leaving Katniss and her younger sister Primrose (Beyond the Blackboard's Willow Shields, whom I believe has the distinction of being the first actor I have ever named in a review to have been born in the 2000s) to care for her. Katniss makes her living as a hunter beyond the bounds of the District. It's forbidden, and if she and her hunting partner Gale (Knowing's Liam Hemsworth) ever get caught they'll be in dutch, but no one who actually lives there cares; Katniss is well-known for being willing to barter her excess meat, and in fact the town's mayor is one of her best customers. All of which is minor details, really, as Panem, every year, holds the Hunger Games, a countrywide battle royale to which each district sends one male and one female according to a lottery with a complex system of entries. To make a long story short (the movie sure did), Primrose is chosen, and Katniss volunteers in her place. Peeta Mellark (Bridge to Terabithia's Josh Hutcherson) (and I don't have a copy of the book close to hand, but I swear that last name was spelled \\"Malark\\" in the book) is her male counterpart, and the two of them are whisked off to District One, the capital city. (In the book, it is obvious this is in the Rocky Mountains; I always assumed it was Denver, for some reason.) They're being coached, somewhat, by Haymitch (Now You See Me's Woody Harrelson), the last person from District 12 to win the Hunger Games, and now the town roustabout. He doesn't often come up with good advice, but the two of them learn quickly that when he does, it's very wise to heed. For soon, they and twenty-two other teenagers are going to be sent into a coliseum, and only one can emerge alive.<br /><br />...and thus, back to the action sequences. The entire second half of the movie, really, is one long action sequence with a few lulls, but there are a few pieces that really stick out. The opening sequence at the Cornucopia I mentioned up top may actually be the best scene in the movie, though Ross, unsurprisingly, glosses and soft-focuses a good deal of the violence therein; The Hunger Games was mandated as PG-13 rather than the hard-R of Battle Royale (or, more amusingly, 2010's Tomorrow, When the War Began--which is also based on a teen dystopian-fiction novel). There's a riot, which IMDB's trivia section notes was shot by \\"second unit director Steven Soderbergh\\", and when's the last time you heard that phrase?, that punctuates things nicely as well. Granted, you will get more out of these scenes if you've read the book, especially the climax. I'm tempted to offer the hypothesis that if you haven't read the book, in fact, the climax will seem a bit on the senseless side--they removed a lot of the context from the second half of the novel that gives the climax the punch it has in print.<br /><br />As for the acting, well, I just gave you the tip of the iceberg, though what a tip it is; Jennifer Lawrence can seemingly do anything. (I mean, she made The House at the End of the Street almost bearable.) And she holds her own against a case that also includes Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Alexander Ludwig, Stanley Tucci, and Jacqueline Emerson, among others. (You don't know that last name yet. You will.) To be succinct, which I haven't done too well in this review so far, everyone does the best with what they were given, really. The problem is, what they were given is so much less than it could have been. **Tombstone's Paula Malcomson) spiralling into a depression from which she has never emerged, leaving Katniss and her younger sister Primrose (Beyond the Blackboard's Willow Shields, whom I believe has the distinction of being the first actor I have ever named in a review to have been born in the 2000s) to care for her.

B003QSOFFO|5.0|Pocahontas was one of my childhood favorites! I always loved the songs and the characters! I believe that this is one of disney s better movies(and more ethical than any other before 1995.) This movie gives kids a look into history, and also teaches them about believing in them selves. It however displays mild discrimination by Governor Radcliffe. He and his crew (besides John Smith) call the Indians savages and copper skins. In pocahontas there is few deaths but all are extremely capeable of watching (if you are squeamish.) Other characters include: a inspiring willow tree, A love able but snotty pug, and Pocahontas' playful, adorable, and hilarious raccoon Meeko!<br />  So if you are looking for a nice movie for a rainy day, I suggest Disney's Pocahontas!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I downloaded this game for my niece because it was FREE &amp; she wanted a  PRINCESS MAKEUP game. After download did this &quot;free&quot; game say that she can't play this game because I didn't purchase the full version which cost $2.99. Dont say the game is free when it'd not! My niece couldn't play the game.... that's a fraud!!

B00CF34B2I|5.0|Just as good as the console/pc versions for 2012 and 2013, but I think is improved by the touch screen interface.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Not much to say here that hasn't already been said. The title of the album is very apt, as the band continues to put out great albums like clockwork. Probably not as good as SOFTD, which, let's face it, they'll never top. I'd put it 2nd, right there with Rated R.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Even if I don't end up making a aquaponic system (which I really want to do), this book gave me a lot to think about as far as sustainability. I found the author to write well and to be interesting. I would recemmend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in aquaponics.

B000H2L8AC|5.0|This is an enjoyable movie for the science fiction buff.  While all the actors do a great job, I especially like Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of a physicist.  His delivery is sharp and effective.  Liev Schrieber is excellent in a supporting role, and Queen Latiffa is excellent in anything she does.

B004T6IBNY|2.0|Graphics are very well done, however, I have found that this game has one MAJOR flaw. The flippers do not work when you need them. This could be a programming issue. What bothers me is that this was released to the public without being thoroughly tested. For that reason, I give it 2 stars.

I know several people that could not get through the first book because of that but I was able to see the &#34;thing behind the thing&#34;.
0553328255|5.0|Books are in perfect condition. Flawless almost. great books. Love Sherlock Holmes novels from sir Conan Doyle. great author and hoping to be a sherlockian. :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the variety of items, information, subjects, etc that you can find on the App.  I would recommend this app to everyone.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This show is one of those that makes you yearn for the next week to come quicker. Watching it from season one straight through the end of season three is a amazing way to pass a rainy day and you always discover something new each time. Well worth the money and bring on season 4!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|See my review on Angry Birds Seasons as it is basically the same for this game too. Need 3 more words....
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I had to watch this movie in anticipation of the opening of Red 2.  And it did not disappoint!  I recommend watching this.  It is a great movie!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I go back and forth with the Angry Birds games.  When I begin to get frustrated w/ the game then I quit for a while.  I also get annoyed with the pop up adds but that's the price I pay for getting a free game!  I get that.  In general I like playing the game.
068484267X|4.0|I personally just love books! My teacher recommended this for me to read ( well really the whole class and I was the one who bought it) and it was a slow read but funny and interesting.
B009WUBERW|1.0|this movie just like the first sucks horribly, dramatic exaggeration after dramatic exaggeration, I was only able to finish watching it by getting kicks out of criticizing it.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This is a very nice game, it is a little hard until you figure out what it needs you to do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's awesome !!!!!!!!! My daughter totally loves it !!!!  is there a pc version  that I can download to my personal computer ,not just my kindle?
B005EHQGTS|5.0|In the end I guess your functionality is limited because of visual real estate and the bandwidth that you are working on. The streaming feature is a good idea in theory but its very choppy even on Wifi. Regardless for most other stuff the app is great and a great step in an awesome direction. I was waiting for something like this to come along.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app keeps me very informed about the present weather, any weather alerts, and the upcoming several days.  it's a very<br />good to excellent  app.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I never played the original.but I enjoy this version. Its quite inventive and forces me to think out of the box. I like graphic based puzzle games and I would hazard that this is the best one I've come across  thus far.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Good book.  The language is difficult to understand, but it was very enjoyable.  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow!  I don't think any book has made me cry so hard.  I'm an oncology nurse, you would think I'd get used to this kind of thing......wrong!  I knew where this story was going, but still I read on like a masochist.<br /><br />This story is beautifully written and poignant, but be ready to go through a box of tissues.  The characters are well developed and I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel Grace.  I can't stop thinking about them.  This story is easily one of my all time favorites.  However, I will find it hard to recommend to everyone.  It is not for the faint of heart or for those who don't like a sad story or want the HEA ending.  You have been warned.  Just read the first couple paragraphs and you will find out right away this is a story of a 16 year old girl with terminal cancer.  But ultimately, it is about life, love, and dying.<br /><br />I only give 5 stars to stories good enough for me to want to read again.  I read a lot, too many books in my \\"to read\\" pile.  So, for me to want to read it again at a later date, speaks volumes.  This story has good writing, a good story, and makes a lasting impression.  Bravo John!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Sharp, classy show.  Characters are lively and always exciting to watch.  Visually beautiful camera work.  Excellent writing.  Fun and smart.  Thanks to producers for this gem.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Everything I love about the PSB is in this album! Good catchy tunes with great 'Vocal&#34;s It's so hard pick a favorite here, I like them all so much. This album is the Pet Shop Boys doing what they do  best!!!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A masterful work, brilliantly told about a wonderful creature which evolved from wolves and became far superior, the dog named Buck.
B006LSZECO|3.0|read it fast, hard to put down, good summertime beach reading perhaps.  fell apart at the end for me. I hate to say this, but the author comes across a little like her characters -- he writing maybe a little too smug and not likely to admit her flaws.  meow!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|realistic picture of his mental health struggle and how it affects his family. I wish they would have developed the mother's character just a bit more. Very good!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|so i got about 30% of the way through, so I can't review it honestly. but the writing was so poor I just couldn't go through with it.  Please see my review of Junot Diaz &#34;This is How You Lose Her&#34; to see how it compares.  I don't know what to say, but the writing was unimaginative and even the sex was boring. It sounded like what a bored housewife thinks good sex would be like.<br /><br />Is there something less than two dimensions when it comes to characters? What does a one dimensional character look like? Oh yeah, Christian Grey.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|CD case and CD was in perfect condition. Bought it a while ago and just now writing review, this group is great, shipping was fast.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|the interview technique with changes of interview subject is interesting, but it lacks dramatic climax because the story cannot build.  This was the first book where I thought the movie was better.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Action packed & funny inserts that keep the movie light. Stallone is in awesome shape & so are all those &#34;old&#34; guys!  A must see!
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I couldn't stop thinking about KStew and Twilight. She didn't fit the part. And Charlese wasn't very convincing as a evil queen. They tried but i just didn't get the effect.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of my favorite books, I have read this summer! I did not want to put this book down until I was finished!!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Not as good as the first one. Moriarty character was dissappointing. Not evil enough. The storyline seemed uninteresting and predictable. Something missing.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Wife and I can't wait for the next season. We have enjoyed this program and await the next to see if it continues to be grest
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Johnny was great but the villaness was boring. Not evil enough. The whole movie was campy of course but something was missing.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Action, macabre violence, dragons, magic, plot twists, nudity, surprises - this series has it all. A little darker than I would have liked, which is why I give it 4/5 stars, although others will most certainly disagree. It is an interesting jaunt into a darker world where good men and women who make noble choices do not always win. In fact, they usually end up dead in a most gruesome manner. I would say this is likely the most realistic representation of power struggles and the extents to which the powerful are willing to go to secure their &#34;rightful place&#34; in their world.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|The movie was interesting and scary. Done well. Unpredicable. Amusing and thought provoking. The actors were good even though unknown.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book . It was so detailed and well presented. It gasps some romance some action and some murder
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am so glad I questioned all the negative reviews.  This book was great.  I loved the multiple plot twist and the different story lines. Frankly I couldn't put it down, and can't wait until the next book. I just hope we don't have to wait too long!
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|I started reading this to my older children and had to stop. I have been told this is one of the greatest American classics ever written. I have to disagree with the language that is used in this book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Got my Kindle Fire in Jan. 2013. The Weather Channel was great. It's been changed &amp; I don't like it as well. Go back to the old way, if you can. H. Van
037571457X|5.0|Persepolis describes the daily life in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. It is told by Satrapi while she is six to fourteen years old. The memoir is sincere of heart and also very political. What made this graphic memoir work so well for me was Marjane's family could have easily been my own if forced to live under a repressive government run by religious wingnuts. It was emotionally compelling and funny. Highly recommended!
B00B5HQL50|4.0|We see Daniel Craig happy to let &#34;M&#34; make the grand final curtain.   I was so upset to lose her I panned the entire production every way I could - and I apologize.  The film was &#34;topstuff&#34; as always.        The poem she quotes says it - the mature and clear-eyed awareness of our own limitations does not end, but rather empowers us to our best work and a chance to &#34;finish with a flourish&#34; - and an epitaph that is less unfortunate a report.     I always think:   Too much brawn and not enough brains - and the mystery and espionage pathways suppressed by the noise and muscle, and evil for evil's sake.  The whole dumb world is having too much fun making unhappy stories when we need creative plots that create good old-fashioned passion for the chase, and find and share a sense of worth and patriotism.  Not more sickening noir.  Sadism and pleasure in murder???  The original books and stories share the message of good winning over evil in an oddly-wholesome and healthy way and with appreciation that the battlefields are in offices, casinos, and even on lovely ocean-going vessels.    I thought the Bond Film makers would understand that , above all, and not  just give in to the trend of selling the idea of a dystopian mess , getting worse every day.    The glam and seductions were there , but  almost ZERO moments of delight, surprize , happiness, fun with discovery of neat new things in the world. MY PLEA IS TO BOND FANS ( like me , since the 60s ) TO MAKE A CAUSE OF THIS MATTER to the makers, to rediscover and share the better lights in the thing that we need.      OKay..Iove Ralph Finnes - but God Bless Dame Dench and long may she live.   The books had fun with &#34;M&#34; - and Bond called the man &#34;Mother&#34; with the unspoken toast to him, in his role as supervisor over his agents.  I just went thru all my dvds , but find no such reference in the filmsz - ( Lotte Lenya falls down - a blooper in &#34;From Russia with Love&#34;  she pops rightback up and regains here Rosa Klebb military bearing and dignity and no one gives her even a glance over it - cool)  BondJamesBond.  Lookforward to the newest upcoming.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest CD's I have ever owned.  I have loved the music in the Phantom of the Opera since I first show the live performance in 1996.
B009MYAQOA|4.0|An interesting look at  the very pompous  Frank L. Wright and his life with Mamah Borthwick. Fiction based on fact, this novel is  based on a unique and unusual relationship between these two, as they justify  fulfillment of their own selfish needs at the detriment of their own families. This was a good read with lots of  information about the famous architect.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well done. Very a entertaining series. Story line takes many twists and turns while revealing the complex interaction between aristocratic families and their serving staff.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|This is very cute. My grandkids thought so too. I would say it is for kids 6 and under. But I liked it too.
B0063B2C5G|4.0|I am a huge fan of Bones, but I will never buy a DVD boxed set of a tv series.  I only ever watch an episode once.  The reason I watched this one on Amazon was that Netflix was out of episodes.  Amazon is a bit pricey when you look at the cost per episode, but it works and it's available.<br />If you haven't watched Bones, go start with the first season.  I warn you, it is very graphic and you *will* see nasty dead bodies.  I love how Bones is an anthropologist (that's what I studied), and her being socially awkward brings humor to the series.  Give it a try!
0307387178|4.0|I read this book in freshman year of college. Fast shipping, but it's a great book that leaves you with an eerie lingering feeling about the wild.<br /><br />Very attention-grabbing and a page turner. Never read another book quite like it.
B0000696I0|5.0|I loved these movies when I has a kid, and now my kids love them, too! You can't go wrong, really.  It doesn't have a lot of the inappropriate stuff I dislike in modern kids' shows.  The DVD is great, and I recommend it for your kids, too!
B002W7H3EA|5.0|One of the best Alfred Hitchcock Movies ever made. Suspenseful, funny, romantic and  thrilling all in one. A must see
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is a great series depicting the era of the early 10th century.  It is riveting and hard to stop watching.  Highly recommended!
B001Q7JD3Q|4.0|I rented this recently to introduce it to the kids. This movie is visually stunning with some of the best CGI I've ever seen. I love the story of the giant ape Kong falling in love with the hot blonde, and Peter Jackson does it very well. The reason I can only give this film 4 stars instead of 5, is that it's just too dang long. This is the &#34;Extended Version&#34;, and if you thought the theatrical release was long you would do well to steer clear of this one. There isn't anything extra in this version that adds to the story, just more dinosaur/giant insect fight scenes, which frankly get old after awhile.
1592537251|5.0|Love referring to this book when getting ideas for drawing and journal projects; for inspiration on sketching on the go. And just some beautiful drawings of great places around the world.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was much more fun than I thought it would be and would recommend it for a good brain tease!! I do wish more of it was available for free though!!!
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Flynn creates another unconventional character.  Constantly wrestling with: like her or hate her? Do we sympathize with her or admire her? Keeps you guessing, but not as much as Gone Girl.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I love, love, loved the old Weather Channel app.  Quick, accurate weather info. without needing to wade through a lot of distracting graphics.  The new update is terrible; too busy, no animated maps...just a big mess.  Have uninstalled the Weather Channel app and installed Radar Express which does what I need it to do.  Listen up Weather Channel, new is not improved!
0439023491|5.0|Purchased this for my nephew's birthday.  I read it before the purchase so I knew it was a great story and would be something he would enjoy as an 11 year old.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Big fan of Neil Gaiman. The only disappointing thing about this book was when it ended...It definitely has a short-story type feel to it, but it was a very fun read.
0439023513|5.0|Purchased this for my nephew's birthday.  I read it before the purchase so I knew it was a great story and would be something he would enjoy as an 11 year old.
0525478817|5.0|My twelve year old daughter wanted to rate it higher than five stars and can't wait to read more books by John Green
1400067820|3.0|This latest Taleb's volume can be summed in three distinct ideas: (1) things may gain from some amount of disorder (2) there are implications to convexity and concavity shapes of the outcome distributions and (3) some civil servants are in the business of cashing bonuses in exchange for the long-term risks they pass to others.<br /><br />Although such ideas can be interesting and even provoking, they are also far from the \\"groundbreaking\\" quality the author implies.<br /><br />For one example, earthquakes inherently have the non-linear property as at some shock level any building will crumble. But the engineering question is not whether to build an indestructible house but how much  to protect it against stress - with respect to which question Taleb offers no useful advice. According to him, the unknown dangers are inherently unknowable and hence any guesses about fat tails are futile. As smart as this sounds in the aftermath of a major earthquake, millions of square foot of real estate are built to approximations and will be too expensive or impossible to build otherwise. As much as Taleb wants every building to look like Egyptian Pyramid, it just won't happen.<br /><br />For another example, Taleb is quick and bitter to criticize the scandalous payoff schemes to the senior management of the failed companies, but he never proposes a viable alternative. The only suggestion from Dr. Taleb is to establish the causal relation between management performance and the subsequent financial fate of the enterprise - which can be hard to do, if not outright utopian.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Taleb often does not notice the apparent contradiction between different levels of his own advice, such as in case of societal/individual tradeoff. By extension of Taleb's societal logic, losing one nuclear plant (out of 150 or so on Earth) to an accident looks only bad when considering radioactive contamination, but may well prove okay relative to the alternatives like ruining theenvironment with thousands of coal-powered stations. Further, nuclear incidents themselves may fit into the very definition of \\"beneficial disorder\\" as every accident is well-investigated. Just to add to the fray, some comments that Taleb makes on this subject appear to be blatantly incorrect (for those interested, Chernobyl incident had little to do with equipment and much to do with the personnel).<br /><br />Nonetheless, if \\"Antifragile\\" would limit itself to discourse on uncertainty, fat tails and manifestations of Jensen't inequality, I would be inclined to give it 4-4.5 stars. It stimulates thinking and has about 200 pages of reasonable conjectures. Unfortunately, Taleb does not stop there and fills about the remaining half of the book with guru-like advice of the dubious quality.<br /><br />Quite ironically, most of fluff are precisely the  non-falsifiable \\"via positiva\\" nuggets that Taleb keeps complaining about. In his version of Tony Robbins' gurudom, Taleb insists that it's best to eat fatty steaks and lift stones (read: no planned exercise) rather than run a treadmill or eat grains and apples. It's also unadvisable to bike, smoke and skydive. And of course, it's foolish to embark onto packaged vacations and cruise ships, but somehow also unreasonable to climb mountains or go by train to Siberia (go figure). In short, everything Taleb does himself is great, but everything he does not do sucks. And if you happen to be richer than Taleb, have a good-looking girlfriend or have won a Nobel prize, you may win a honorary \\"sucker\\" label several times. In his version of nutritional consultancy, Dr. Taleb recommends \\"caveman's diet\\" and staying off anything that was not on the table of ancestors for at least ten thousand years (so say goodbye to corn, potatoes, tomatoes, cheese and just about everything else).<br /><br />In conclusion this book is good in the sections where Dr. Taleb keeps to his quant knitting and degrades when he tries to project an image of a fearless athletic hero who instills fear and loathing into hoards of enemies and pesky taxi drivers while reciting memorable lectures to awed audiences. So take it with a grain of salt and it may be a decent reading.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|It allows me to record and save, since I have a kindle it took me a minute to find the files though
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the characters and brilliant repartee.  One of those shows you may have to watch twice to catch all the subtle dialog and twists of the plot.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|You can't argue with my review's title. If you do, you're already wrong. Being wrong is not right. Grabthar with smash you for it. He's got this hammer, you see. Not even the man Bruce Campbell could have made this movie any more awesome. Okay, wait. That's stretching it. Bruce makes everything more awesome.<br /><br />NTE-3120. It stands for (N)ot (T)he (E)nterprise. Come on, what more do you need?<br /><br />NEVER GIVE UP! NEVER SURRENDER!<br /><br />NEVER NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show...interesting characters and story lines.  All the female characters seem to wear their clothes a size too small but great clothes and accessories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush! It's fun, creative, totally despicable, cute and awesome! If I could, I would play this always!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Thanks for a very interesting story line!  It was a pleasure to read, and very imaginative!  I had a hard time putting it down!
B00BLB6R1S|4.0|Over the years, I've become a big Rusty Young fan.  When I think of Poco, I think of Mr. Young--and that's not to begrudge the many great classics and contributions along the way from the various talented members.  I also remember seeing Jack Sundrud touring as part of the band too many years ago (I still remember his song, \\"Rhythm of Love,\\" and kept waiting for it to be recorded--but, alas, no such luck).  That led me to Great Plains and his solo work.  So, a second Poco album with Mr. Sundrud's contributions is great.<br />Now, about this album.  In many ways, it's a throwback to the early days of Poco.  Notwithstanding Mr. Webb's contributions (more traditional rock and a whole lot less country), many of Mr. Young's tracks here would be nicely at home on Poco's first ten albums--\\"All Fired Up,\\" \\"A Little Rain,\\" and \\"Pucky Huddle Stomp\\" (the later could fit right in on the \\"Crazy Eyes\\" album).  If you're a fan of Mr. Sundrud's work, then you'll definitely like his four contributions.  And \\"Regret\\" certainly stands among Mr. Young's best slower songs (but do not expect \\"Crazy Love\\" or \\"Shoot for the Moon\\"--this has more of an edge).  So, what about Mr. Webb's contributions?  Honestly, I felt like they were generic rock on the first few listens, and wondered what they were doing on a Poco album.  After additional listens, I feel better about them.  Now, make no mistake--they will not make my playlist of favorite Poco songs of all time--but that's a tough list to make. And others who have listened to the songs without knowing that they're from the newest Poco disc like them.  So, I suspect its the juxtaposition that partially explains my initial visceral reaction, and the reaction of others.<br />My bottom line:  If you've liked Poco in the past, you'll like this.  And, if you've not really been familiar with Poco, well, this album will whet your appetite for more.<br />My only complaint:  I'd love more new Poco a bit more frequently, shall we say?  And, about thoseChristmas recordings that show up on the band's website, what a great release they'd make later this year as part of a Poco Christmas album.<br />Finally, if you're looking to buy this disc, given that Amazon is offering only through third-party sellers, please note you can get a better price at the band's website, with your choice of extras.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very interesting story and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Thank you!  I also enjoyed the writing style very much.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I thought it might be just a fun teen movie.. but it was much more than that. Very surprising. Will recommend.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read MItch Albom before, so this book title caught my eye.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking story.  Thank you!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Its not fresh in my mind but i find his writing thoughtful and profound. Some day i will read again, as the kite runner.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I really enjoy this game and the cool graphics. This is a fun Solitaire game, with a twist (the gopher and the commentator).  However, it takes up way too much space on my Kindle Fire HD, and sometimes I have a problem with it loading.  For this reason, I haven't played it lately.  If it would work without these problems, I would give it a much higher rating!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love this file explorer!  I have yet to find something I can not do with it. (...I'm only a moderately experienced android user, but I imagine it would do a lot more than I can make it do....)
B005544V6A|5.0|I was really interested in this show when it debuted, but never saw it. I was up late one night, logged in and now I am ADDICTED.  The quick wit and demeanor of Harvey as well as the smarts of the female partner keep me riveted. The clothes and the good looking men don't hurt either.
B00B10DZQE|4.0|This is one of the better surfing movies on the market.  The surf scenes are good and there is a positive message.  Nice family movie, too!
B004GBFF5Y|5.0|So impressed with this movie.  Parents and grandparents could all benefit from this story.  Well acted and produced. Came upon this movie by chance.  So glad we  watched it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Say what you like regarding the Star Trek \\"Arbrams-verse\\", when it all comes down to it:  This is a GREAT movie.  We have tons of action, ultra high quality production values, a story that holds up, great acting, character moments and an ending that keeps us wanting more.  Some may argue that Iron Man 3 is the better movie but I have to say, Into Darkness delivered the kind of action I expect in a summer popcorn movie.  I can't wait to see what he does with Star Wars.
0553801473|5.0|I'm one of those people who can often see what's coming in books, TV shows or movies - but not here! Even in the 5th book, Martin's series still manages to shock me. I love it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|As always, Neil Gaiman writes a &#34;small&#34; story which has all kinds of complex possibilities.  I find myself thinking about the various patterns and interrupted patterns and possibilities of the people and the wrinkles in the world we perceive or not.  The slip and slide of time, memory and reality is thought provoking and fascinating.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love Books and this app definitly delivers.  I will use this alot and noticed the prices of books are much cheaper...
B000FBFN1U|3.0|Needs 200-300 pages cut out of the middle and even then it would still be flat.  Not what you expect for the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app... Great graphics.. I never could own my own horse.. Too many allergies!!!Thanks for the opportunity to have one now..
B00A44HRG2|1.0|What's the point of watching absolutely nothing?It doesn't matter what time of day it is or what country or city,all I seem to see was night time cameras,plus every street or park or whatever had no activity at all.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|Some have said that this game is boring.  I don't understand that.  Sure, it's a little strange that, after solving any level, you have to sit there and wait for 5 ships to navigate around the screen.  (Why 5?  If one ship makes it, they'll all follow.  OK, so there's an added chance of crashing with multiple ships, but that's it.)<br /><br />In any case, it's a fun game.  The controls for setting up the &#34;fans&#34; are a little tricky.  It takes a while to get used to the 3D perspective.  And it makes a HUGE difference to solving some of the puzzles, if you have rotated the scene around so that you can see better what you are doing.<br /><br />All in all, this game provides quite a bit of fun.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I can't wait for the next book!  Highly addictive series..  If you love Fifty Shades of Grey you will love this.
B000068CNX|2.0|When i received my order 1 of the discs was out of the holder,the case was damaged. Otherwise it would've been a great purchase. The discs play. If you don't mind a bad case,PURCHASE IT
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I know how to play these games, but I  hate the ones that just say &#34;find the objects&#34;. It is so much more than that. You must open drawers, refrigerators, etc. Do you need to go back a floor to find an object? What happens when you can't figure out what still needs to be found. I've clicked on everything in the room and can't find the key. What does this pipe do?
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is one of those books that catches your interest, keeps your interest, and is hard to put down!  I would recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the World by Ken Follett<br /><br />My rating: 4 of 5 stars<br /><br />I originally got this book from the library when it first came out, but only read the first few chapters before I had to return it, and I finally got around to re-requesting & reading it over the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy the book, but definitely not as much as the first one.<br /><br />There are too many characters to keep track of, and that was a huge turn off for me. Yes, there's a cheat sheet, but if there are so many characters in the book that the author feels there's a need for a cheat sheet, then that should have been his first clue that there are TOO many characters! Because there were so many \\"main\\" characters in the book, I felt like I didn't really get to know any of them & really didn't upset when any of them would get killed off (instead I felt relief that it was one less character). The book jumps from character to character (and as such, from different parts of the world) and was just one more thing to keep track of in this large volume (which for the record, I'm a HUGE fan of big books / big series).<br /><br />Another turn off for me is that WWII events that the average American knows about - such as Pearl Harbor and the Holocaust - are barely mentioned in the book. This actually wasn't as big a turn off for me once I thought about it - I wouldn't have wanted to read a book that spent 100 pages on Pearl Harbor when I know a decent amount about Pearl Harbor. Instead Follett does a great job writing about the world's involvement in the war in general - which is exactly the point of this series, isn't it? So what started as a turn off ended up a positive.<br /><br />A \\"neutral\\" point I'd like to make is that Follett does NOT do a lot of rehashing of the first book like most series books do. Usually there's a little brief mention of a plot point or a little reminder of who the character is, and he doesn't do this. Usually that's a good thing, but again see my first point - there's a LOT of characters to keep track of, and a little bit of reminding would have helped. Not that you can't figure out who everyone is fast enough - the first mention of Maud made me go \\"who?\\" but within a sentence or two I remembered who she was, who she married & why she was living in a country that wasn't her own.<br /><br />So what's good about the book? Well... this book quite neatly talks about so so many events & ties them together realistically. Yes, a few plot points you are going to see happening - which I won't give an example of for spoiling the book. But it's a historical fiction book & anyone who knows their history is going to see some of these plots happening. Follett is such an excellent author - and quite frankly one of my top ten favorite authors - that you want to read the next page, and the next, and the next.t again see my first point - there's a LOT of characters to keep track of, and a little bit of reminding would have helped.

0399226907|5.0|this is my 3 1/2 yr old's favorite book right now. after about a week she seems to know all the words before i read them.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a great app - totally addicting. There are so many different shapes, I never get bored.  Some are easier than others - and that is perfect for when I don't have much time. I enjoy it very much!!
159463176X|3.0|After reading the Kite Runner and Splendid Suns I expected Hosseini to deliver a novel filled with mystery and excitement. Instead, I was introduced to different characters at the turn of a page and found it difficult to connect to the book as a characters story was never completed. Well written just not the usual impact I get from Hosseini.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Good special effects is why I give it 3 stars.  The acting is bad and as an adult, I just didn't care for the movie.  However, I think its not suitable for small children, so I'm confused on just who this movie is made for.
1451650728|5.0|This book was well written and worth the time to read. Can't wait to get the next book. A must read for any Star Trek fan.
0810994739|5.0|I originally bought 3 of the series for my 12 yr old but I've ended up reading all of them as well. Book idea is very original and story line quite humorous. Thoroughly enjoyed them all. Well done Jeff!
0007217099|5.0|What can I say, It's David Eddings!!  This is the best book he ever wrote and well worth anybody's time to read.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I like chess but I don't like the computer smearing me after 6 moves.  This game allows you to set levels and have a decent chance.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of the better CGI movies to date. It is very well animated, the story is fun for everyone, and the characters are a hoot! This one is a must see.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The whole package.  A greatest hits collection and a tribute album all in one [made while Fogerty is still allive and kickin' it].  Excellent collection of collaborating artists.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first Gillian Flynn novel that I've read, and it is a great one. The overall suspense and tone of the story are impeccable. The author is very skilled at revealing slowly the action and plot. It is very difficult to put this one down.
B003VANOFY|1.0|From the first second i turned it on and tried to use it, the headset would cut out and come back. After a few months of this happening, it got more and more frequent. Every 6 seconds it cuts out. Now after 5 months i hear a louch screeching noise everytime it cuts out, then i hear a beep when it comes back. Now the mic doesnt even work anymore even though it says the microphone is working properly in control panel.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I loved this exercise, it didn't make me lose much weight, as I was already fit when I first started it, but it helped me shape my body even more. I've started it again after a two week break and I intend to buy other products after I'm done with the 30 days.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|We used this for our hiking in Yosemite...kept camera safe and was easy to carry on the strenuous hikes. We did not want to miss the spectacular photos but needed good protection for our camera while hiking and this pack performed perfectly.  We really like that the interior compartments can be adjusted to fit each piece of equipment...portability is such a good thing.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very nice little series, I like the story and the actors, it was very nice to run into it on Amazon.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This show is unique and something that would never be made in the US. However it's entertaining, engaging and fun! Keep it up BBC!
B000EHSVSC|5.0|I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE BUY, AND RECCOMEND ANYONE TO SEE IT AS  A &#34; REAL VIEW &#34; IF YOU WILL ,FROM BOTH SIDES OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SO LONG AGO NOW..
0425263991|5.0|I love Nalini Singh book especially this series. I must say that after Hawke's story, I didn't think any other book will grab my attention and I almost made a mistake of not reading this one. Wow, what a book !!! Loved the book, loved the characters...everything Bout this story and characters resonated with me. Love the way the story fits in with the series and what I read from the glimpse of the main character from previous books.<br />Now I have to go back and start reading the rest of the series to get more glimpses of Kaleb :-)
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The story is fast paced, action-packed, and fun, without taking itself too seriously. If you like action adventure mixed with the old west, science fiction, fantasy and the good guy doing the right thing, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Added bonuses are pretty cool aliens and a very cool alien dog named, Woola, who is created with a bit of old Disney magic that makes this loyal sidekick really shine.<br />Enjoy.
1615470158|5.0|Superb. Rob takes a difficult technical subject and makes it interesting. He is a great communicator.  I'm waiting for his next book with anticipation.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie was done a couple years after the conclusion of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but Peter Jackson didn't miss a beat. This first installment of the Hobbit trilogy was excellent. Yes, the orcs look different. Yes, you're basically just watching a bunch of Gimlis run around on a quest. But they've definitely set up the trilogy well for The Desolation of Smaug and The War of Seven Armies. I'd recommend keeping up with this trilogy to anyone who enjoys a good adventure.
0375714839|5.0|Honest and straight-forward. Satrapi has caught the essence of what it was like to experience that kind of revolutionary experience in clear, precise prose and simple drawings. The simplicity of the execution allows the reader to focus on the depth of the experience.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this game after playing the demo, and I can honestly say it is fantastic.  More of a universally adaptable, spiritual game than a typical linear story-based game, Journey allows the player to derive their own meaning from the events that take place in Journey rather than explicitly portraying a single story-based perspective from the developer to the player.  Furthermore, the player can use their imagination to embrace Journey's atmosphere by perceiving the end-point of Journey as an allusion to the player's goals in reality.  Then, once the player reaches the end of the game, they will feel motivated to do what is necessary to accomplish those goals in reality so they can experience the satisfaction of achieving those goals in reality.  Once the player makes their goals become a reality, they can reminisce about playing Journey.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works OK, but I use the plain Yahoo! as I can also use it to access my calendar.  It's OK
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a really hard time putting the book down and just when i thought i new where it was going it gave me another twist!
B005UDD1R6|3.0|A nice basic player, it did not solve my problem of playing flash on a Samsung (like Apple it won't).
B0036EH3WK|1.0|I am one of those die hard fans who loved every single episode of LOST especially the ending. There's nothing I can add that could be more eloquent than what others have said or make people love it more. However, the creators of the show do a huge disservice to anybody who doesn't speak English and who bought this box set thinking that all 6 seasons were in Spanish, French, etc. Why provide the additional soundtracks for seasons 1-5 but not season 6? I can't imagine how somebody who has invested over a hundred hours watching this box set only to find out that the 6th and final season only has an English soundtrack available once they pop in the first season 6 disc felt. Even the subtitles, which provide translations for up to 17 different languages are gone in the season 6 set. What a classless move by the people who brought us the most intense series on television ever.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it and play it when I want to just relax and challenge my mind a different way -
0811879542|5.0|My 4 year old read it at the library and laughed out loud.  He thought that it was so funny that the next pages were a direct result from the actions that he did on the previous page.  He could read the whole book himself so it was easy for him to read and follow the directions.  My husband read it to him that night and my son told him that he wasn't pressing hard enough.  It was entertaining for him and he really enjoyed it.  I think that there is an age range where this book is perfect and many kids maybe too young or past it.  If you have a beginning reader that loves to follow directions, this is the perfect book for you to try out.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I really like all the Angry Birds programs I have tried.  It is a lot of fun and hits the seasons.
B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderful details about the history of medical research along with an interesting story about a women and her family that lived during that time period. If you like medical novels and historical novels you will enjoy this book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Well, so far, twice and will watch it again.  Once when it aired on HBO and then again just before Season 3 aired,  This is a GREAT series.  And I loved the extras on the DVD.  Especially when the characters did their back stories.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I got this movie because I like the actors that are on the front of the dvd box..  The movie is ok.. I wouldn't buy it again or if I had watched it for free I wouldn't have bought it.. I like it but its a one time movie.. Nothing I would watch again..  Its not a bad movie and it has a fairly interesting plot.. To me it lacked imagination on the witch's domains and power and stuff..But that's just me..  The weapons used by the dynamic duo lacked real gusto or slamming power too..
B00632HWOG|4.0|Recently, I have been aware of the changes that Yahoo Mail has made.. Love the apps that you can get just<br />for your mail only, no stories, no new highlights, and items of that kind.  I have this and would recommend this app to anyone just wanting to check their mail box only....<br />Thanks for you time to read my review.
B002DEZXOE|4.0|The history of the events leading up to and through Woodstock is great.  Did not give 5 stars because the DVD skips in several places.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Sorry, honestly I didn't have the time to strt or complete this.<br />Therefore, I am unable to give a recommendation of any kind regarding this! Again sorry.  Sort of played out<br />with these games
B000AP04FG|5.0|Mr and Mrs Smith.  None of that damsel in distress.  What you will get is a lot of sexy, kick-ass comedy.  I never cease to be surprised  by the range of Brad Pitt's acting.  He is waaaay more than a pretty face.  I just saw him in &#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34;.  SO hard to believe it is the same person!!  Great comic timing and a terrific ability to work as part of a team.  He gives until it hurts!!!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|As I said this is fun. Kind of mindless but is entertaining when you just want to relax. Wold tell my friends.
0316044695|4.0|Excellent book and great story of courage and bravery. However, I took offense at Luttrell comparing the bravery of his comrades to that of Audie Murphy. Murphy would have never put himself in this position by allowing the sheep herders the chance to leave. That sealed the fate of this crew and botched the mission. Murphy was also alone when he won the medal of honor. To compare one action or one soldier to another is \\"to erase what a hero accomplished\\".  Murphy single handedly fought off over 200 Germans and six tanks for over an hour on a burning tank destroyer loaded with explosives and about to blow up. YOU cannot compare the bravery of one soldier to another. Except for that one issue, I think this is an excellent book. I was surprised at Luttrell bringing up Murphy and comparing, especially since he is a Texan. Maybe he should attend \\"Audie Murphy Day\\" in Greenville, TX. some year.
1449389627|5.0|Though you may admire the brain power of Newton, Edison, Jobs, or Gates, it's clear that discovery comes from hard work, risk and sacrifice, not some divine epiphany. Furthermore, innovation does not have a straight-line trajectory, nor does it happen overnight. In fact, many inventors aren't seen as geniuses until after they die. Reporters try to find the \\"eureka\\" magical moment that is never really there. The inventions of the radio, the TV, the laser, and the computer were an accumulation of ideas and efforts. Small insights lead to big breakthroughs. The epiphany is really much more like putting a puzzle together. When you put the last piece in place, it just \\"feels\\" like magic.<br /><br />Steve Gladis Leadership Partners
B00196YNWU|5.0|Still love this classic movie. Enjoyed watching again with my 6 year old daughter. She was totally engrossed the entire time. Great picture quality streaming from Amazon.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|how long before we get the game for the kindle .......we do not just want a help guide......<br /><br />this is a great mind game.....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is a spectacular book.  I laughed out loud and cried, neither of which is a common occurrence for me while reading.  You will not be disappointed.  READ. IT.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show with lots of twits and turns. engaging, excellent character development. Love watching how each episode is going to play out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|great story. good character development. plot twists. really likable characters. emotional roller coaster which was expected but not in the way that it ended.
B00CHILW64|3.0|OK movie. I was expecting to be more emotionally pulled into the movie... That didn't happen. Especially since it got great reviews. That didn't happen for me... oh well
B003H4I4JU|5.0|What an interesting concept to actually have a &#34;Speaker for the Dead&#34; that travels throughout the universe, when requested, to speak about an individual. Telling all things - both good and bad - and the reasoning behind both. Once again, I enjoyed a well-written novel by Card.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It was good movie and kids were fantastic! it had an intriguing<br />story line.  Makes you want to watch it again.<br /> I did NOT like the violence but thats in all movies i guess
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I always take books in our rv to read when we camp.  I was thinking of buying the kindle fire, but now I don't need to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game I recommend. it if you like virtual animal games easy for children also my two year old brother can play
0312430000|5.0|A must read, puts into perspective many ideas about decreasing errors.<br />An expansion of his original New Yorker article. Very helpful with reference to the WHO project.
B00821OX98|4.0|This has been pretty good. I've enjoyed watching it with my girlfriend. It's a bit slow for me and people keep doing really stupid things, but it's fine. A fun sci-if show.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|As I began reading this, I imagined it as more of an story. Which, of course, it is. But more than that, it's a piece of the truth. Truth that isn't found just anywhere. This book is brilliant.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|The rangefinder meet expectation. No problems that I have read have come up yet. Shipping was on time and I would recommend others to buy as we'll if this is what your looking for
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hi I am osiel I like meeting new people I like girl's who can keep a conversation going so kick me at messi2591
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I will watch this series over and over and learn something new everyday from it.  great characters, stories and brain exercise! one of the greatest shows ever made.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a very cool interesting book<br />I likened it a lot I really like the part the characters plays in the book
B0081336FO|5.0|The main reason I started to watch the series was Benedict Cumberbatch. His performance in Star Trek 2 was intense and laser-sharp<br />The reason I continued is because the ret of the cast I awesome<br />The plots and story lines are interesting and keep your attention<br />The only episode I didn't care for was the one based on the &#34;Hounds of Bakerville&#34;<br />The cast and acting were great but the story line was kinda boring nothing new was added or hanged to making it interesting
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is like subway surfer but 10x better. It is more challenging and has more that adds to the gameplay :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Gives me Gr8 information about the weather tell me what to expect and how to dress for the day ahead.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|If you like to bird watch then this movie is for you.  I never would have believed that looking for birds could be competitive. Some very funny moments.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Game keeps you involved. You just want to keep playing. Recommend this game. My kid's like this game also.<br />Awesome Game.
B000FC146C|4.0|Engaging story with many details that made me feel like I had been living with the characters.  Read it a out one and a half days, thought of classic tales I used to read when I was younger
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I rented this because my wife wanted to see it. I thought it was actually really good. Was a bit slow at the beginning, but in a good way.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved this app in its previous incarnation for a year and then with the new auto update I was presented with the new interface and I HATE IT! Why so busy? Not user friendly!
B009GX69RK|5.0|I watched season 1 on Netflix and could not wait for season 2 so I purchased on amazon. This show is really funny
B00CDT41RY|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie; entertaining, fast moving and wonderfully acted.  Recommended for a fun evening away from the TV.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It has be come one of my new favorite movies! So creative how the power circuit is Game Central Station!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Didn't know what to expect based on the title, however we thoroughly enjoyed movie.  Recommend the whole family watch together.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It is stupid and good....it is crashing my kindle fire HD right when I got it!!! It is a fun games because it is minecraft duh....
B007TR1R1I|1.0|I just couldn't see the movie because the PQ is very bad !!! I think a movie can be made about a period of the history but the tecnical footage can be MODERN !!! What a bad Blu-ray!!!
0316247545|5.0|Everything I could've possibly wanted, and a little more. Had some nice fandom shout-outs, and plenty of hidden info (possibly some of it hinting at season 4+).
B000002PCS|5.0|I love this soundtrack! Somewhere in Time is one of my favorite movies and the music is equally as amazing...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought this game was a pretty good puzzler. I did not find the levels extremely difficult, though. The game is simple and neat.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. So hilarious and, I read it hearing your voice in my head. When I went to get some water due to the current dry atmosphere if Colorado, I heard, \\"What are you doing? Sit your butt back down and finish!\\"  Needless to say, I didn't get my water....
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|In today's movie market there are not many that I can rate 5 stars. This IS a movie I am happy to give 5 stars. It is well written, well acted, well cast, and it carries a message. I hope you find it so as well.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Fun movie great for airplanes and no think time  I like movies like this when I travel just pure fun
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I am hoping we get another book in this weries so we know what happened at the end.  I hope Mr Archer is not done with this series I would enjoy one more book
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love this book. The author totally gets how kids think and act. He gets into their headspace while telling a very original and almost haunting story. It is one of those stories that stick with you .
B004I8WD6E|5.0|got this case as a gift for a friend. now a days people change phone cases/ covers like socks, so its a good addition to the mix. I have prime so it was lovely to get it in less the 2 buss. days
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game for when your travelling compete friends and unlock cool characters. Travel around the world with subway surfers world tour,unlock rare characters and surf boards!!!!!
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|I downloaded this on a bit of a whim, and found myself absolutely loving it. I very much enjoyed PSBs back in the day, and listening to this makes me feel like we've just picked up the conversation after an unusually long hiatus.  They're totally on form again!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Superlatively funny! Great for the whole family! We especially loved the little minions and their goofiness and silliness! Great story!
B0014JKJJI|4.0|For the price and an understanding that I'll be replacing my shoes three times a year. I prefer these over many other chef shoes. I have worn these as my everyday work shoe in the kitchen for over two years. I'll replace them after 3-4 sometimes 5 months. I also couple these with the Dr. Shoals orthopedic inserts and the Combo is more preferred than a $100+ pair of shoes.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Once you finish one book, you can't wait for the next. I'm so happy I bought the series this way. Use this with the audiobooks and it is a tremendous experience! I only recently found this series after hearing about the HBO series. Now I am hooked into the story and characters. There are so many engaging back stories and characters! Just when you think you know what is happening, it completely changes it the craziest way. Some parts are so sad and horrifying while others are hilarious! I've never been a reader of this genre, so I was pleasantly surprised.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is TOO fun !!!!  Very easy to get started.  I like the different obstacles that are used.  The change in views takes a bit to get used to.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|This was an easy movie to watch.  It helped me appreciate the human spirit that comes alive in a time of crisis and rekindled my  faith in the human race.  At times, we face elements that are out of our control.  This one is not about blaming someone else, instead it's about using inner strength to overcome forces we have no control over.  It gave me something to think about regarding my own preparation if a disaster struck.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is the classic Jane Austin story... Pride and Prejudice. Very nicely done but with all movies based on books, it does not follow the book exactly. But it was a very good movie.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Gena Rowlands, James Garner and Ryan Gosling lifted this fine story above a weepy melodrama which it might have become without their believable performances.  Young and old in the audience find it easy to relate to Sparks' memorable characters in this terrific adaptation of his novel.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I purchased Toy Stories 3 for my granddaughter.  she loves these movies.  I would recommend this movie because it presents good moral values as well as fun viewing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have to admit to having become a fan of this series.<br />My wife and I watch it together and are beginning to wonder what we'll do when we get caught up.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|I love some of the philosophies in this book -- &#34;scratch your own itch&#34; for example.<br /><br />I am reading it for the 3rd time!<br /><br />Rework is a great read -- no, a must -- for anyone who wants to succeed in business<br /><br />Nick
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It follows the generations of a small family in Afghanistan and as time passes and cultures change the members of each generation adapt and thrive in their new environments. The characters remain aware of their heritage and wish to stay in touch.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Artistically beautiful from each opening scene, the acting, editing, direction, and writing are also stunning. I felt high just watching this .
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|This movie is the epitome of what a movie should be. It stirs your spirit,  and inspires you to fight for freedom and justice.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I travel all over Europe and America so I need a variety of weather forecast. This so has been extremely accurate no matter where I am. No more guessing on how to dress for the weather.
B0000004V2|3.0|Had never heard of this band until recently.  Listened to it on iTunes and really liked it, but that was a remastered version.  The original CD sounds much rougher.  Some may like that.  I didn't.
B00005UNCL|5.0|I bought  this movie so I could watch whenever I want. I wish it came in 3D, but I will watch it again and again.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I have a 3D tv and this worked well with the technology.it could have been better in the 3D part,but it is after all a remake into 3D.
B00B1EGP44|5.0|I love the Jurassic movies no matter what anyone says. They can be funny and suspenseful and a lot of gore,but that is what makes them so good.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case has saved me time and time again when i drop my phone, it is fantastic and i'm so glad that i got it!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I did not enjoy this book until I was 50% finished. I found it slow, didn't enjoy the characters, the I did not find the robbery to be interesting at all.I would not recommend this book to others.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like how you have the bingo and slots both. Also its not confusing like some u have no idea how to use the coins. I look forward to play every day. Thank you
B004OO4UFY|5.0|* This is a great, well balanced album.  Yes, one or two of these songs will sound familiar, but I have found myself humming almost all of the songs at one time or another.<br /><br />* This album is on the high rotation area of my collection, and it has been so for quite a while.  &#34;The Heavy&#34; seems to wear very well, at least between my ears.<br /><br />* The music is, quite simply, fun to listen to.
030758836X|3.0|Gripping, fascinating stuff for the first 75% but, alas, sputtered to a weak ending. Five stars for the first part, 1.5 for the rest. That said, except for the end, I don't think I've ever enjoyed a book so much with two such unlikable protagonists. Kept me turning the pages .. until the story died.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The material has a unique origin for the age old battle against vampires and werewolves, demons in general.  The character development and defining of the world is what pulls you in and leaves you wanting to know more.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My kids are thrilled to have then entire Dark Knight trilogy on BluRay.  I'm thrilled because this deal couldn't be better for the price I paid.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Great review and new take on change and how it happens. It was helpful that they used a variety of examples to view how change occurs.
B00CRJSWBQ|3.0|The first board I got had a problem with the memory controller. After I got everything set up I got an error code of 00 05 on the onboard LCD display. The manual listed that as a &#34;no RAM present&#34;-type error but I had installed a full 32 GBs. In the end, the A1 & A2 bank for the DDR3 chips would not recognize any combination of chips I inserted. ASUS's technical support, however, was quick to respond to my questions about ways to test the problems it seemed to be having and after only three exchanges admitted it was probably NOT a compatibility issue, but a defective memory controller and advised me to return the board.<br /><br />In the end with two of the 4 RAM chips working, though. . .I was able to test the rest of the system and even install Windows 8 before I got the last email from ASUS advising me to return the board. NOTE: The Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR3 2400 MHz (PC3-19200) chips I put into the B1 and B2 bank registered as 1333 MHz when the system finally recognized them. I had to use the MemOK! button to make that happen. It worked like a charm. Then, inside the CMOS (the fancy new one they've got) I set the unit to recognize them as OC-capable chips and the system was FAST!!! Very impressed.<br /><br />I'll do a follow-up once I get the new board.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Story, that takes you back in time. I started watching this as part or the Prime program as a lark and who knew. I highly recommend.
B003E74B06|5.0|I started reading Belgarath right after finishing for n-time the Mallorean and I loved it. I like the style and Belgarath has always been my favorite character of the saga.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I do not like the whole points thing. The map when it first comes up doesn't show your home location. The storm forcast bubble has never been right on the time.  Overall disappointed.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Played this after can you escape and was a bit disappointed.  Didn't seem as well thought out and intricately designed.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I play this a lot keeps your interest and graphics are very good. The adventure is the one I have played not torment because my reflexes is not so fast any more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was my first time playing a floor escape game so I had a ball figuring out all the ins and outs.  I found this one to be challenging and engaging and it worked very well on my kindle...highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is good. the graphics are fast and crisp. you do not have to buy the add ons to have fun.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I enjoy. The way he writes. This was a quick read and kept my interest.  I would definitely recommend this book to true grisham lovers.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is another favorite of mine of the Miyazaki films. It's a 'growing up' sort of story where a somewhat bratty girl learns about hard work, fear, loyalty, and love. I really liked all the different characters and the overall story in this movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Just finished watching this movie with my family for our family movie night.  It was POWERFUL.  It combined humour and action with very positive values. It dealt with real family issues like unemployment, death of a loved one, absentee fathers and also with issues like gangs and gang membership.  We need more movies like this in the world - movies that influence people to act positively, even when it is difficult to do so; movies that boldly proclaim God and Jesus Christ as the source of any strength that we can ever have to make the right decisions under difficult circumstances.  Five star rating!
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|This is a tale of a girl who is pretty much the savior of her village and anyone she comes into contact with. She doesn't really seem to ever go through any struggles which, for me, kind of made her character a little too good. However, the story is alright and I didn't find the movie particularly distasteful. It was still enjoyable, though not one of my favorites from Miyazaki.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|A great show even though it is old. Every episode is a brand new adventure! The episode are about 45 minutes long and I love every minute of them. Anyone who likes science fiction or would like to see the origin of a great universe will enjoy STAR TREK!!!
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|I didn't particularly care for this movie and its story line. The animation was great and the overall idea for the story was definitely Miyazaki style. I just didn't fall in love with this movie as I did with some of his others.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|A great show even though it is old. Every episode is a brand new adventure! The episode are about 45 minutes long and I love every minute of them.
B00003CXBK|3.0|I think this is probably my least favorite of the Miyazaki films. The protagonist doesn't show much emotion and the overall story was pretty morbid.
1907590099|5.0|An amazing book for a thinker/philosopher, Aldous Huxely is an amazing writer with the potential to talk you through all his pathways of an intellectual man.<br /><br />This book touches on so many subjects, there are so many references to people that inspired him. Huxley brings so much knowledge aside from taking mescaline.<br /><br />He describes the oneness and mind at large in this experience. What a fantastic book. I recommened this to anyone who thinks deep and is a modern philosopher, peace
0345525558|1.0|About 3/4 through the book I couldn't wait any longer for the main character, Victoria, to redeem herself and get over her self-pity and self-destructive behavior.  I know she had a tough childhood, but as an adult many people reached out to help her.  Just when I thought Victoria was going to turn herself around, she spiraled down into another episode of self loathing.  I am too frustrated with the main character to care any longer about what happens to her and will go on to another book.  Can't understand how this book got so many 5 Star reviews.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this was a practical and useful way to get the weather info you need before the last update. now it it is just another crap app. will be getting my weather from wyff4 and deletinng this monstrosity. too bad. I liked it a lot before it turned to, ........,
B0098VXE50|4.0|I really liked this version of Snow White.  It definitely is not a kids fairy tale movie.  Exciting and action packed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I will state here that after reading the reviews I borrowed the book. I was disappointed in the last two books but normally would purchase the final one to have the whole series. I do believe that an author is entitled to write the story she wants but in a context that ties in with the rest of the series. I am an entitled reader. I am entitled to a well written book which follows the premise set out in the beginning of the series. I am entitled to have a series where the author has consistency throughout the series. Don't change the world rules to fit the author's preferred ending. I don't watch True Blood so no influence there in my reading. I just plain didn't like the book,for me it didn't make sense. I am not sure that I would like any book that accepts slavery for one of it's characters.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Unique story, predictable a points, pacing is a little slow at points.  Overall good book, but could have been great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Carries the story along extremely well maintaining the great writing and acting represented in seasons 1 & 2.<br /><br />Watching any episode out of sequence is not recommended.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Lots of levels. I got it free and it has a lot for free. Yes, it does ask for money, but it's not required. A good time waster lol :) I thought it was addicting. My 4 year old likes it too!
6301390725|4.0|Dame Lansbury brings her stage presents to the silver screen once again. Bedknobs brings you the sparkle and magic of Mary Poppins/ Disney 60's movie. Non- Violent with slapstick baffoonary that makes you laugh. A movie that your kids can watch without parental supervision.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Good story telling, great casting. Love Julianne Hough in anything and she was very convincing in her role as Katie. Very enjoyable with enough tension to get the heart pounding.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|There is no where enough of the product that is free.  Always asking to purchase the full product which is frustrating
0738711500|5.0|The cards are very pretty! The book is helpful and relatable, not too technical or overwhelming or anything like that. It's a lot of fun and the price is right! I recommend to anyone who is curious about tarot reading.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The producers of this show have done an excellent job of taking the \\"four-color campiness\\" out of DC Comics Green Arrow hero, and giving him an interesting back story told via flashbacks to Oliver Queen's time stranded on an (allegedly) deserted island.  While the show does not strive to model the real world, it does not take liberties with the overuse of flashy special effects that ultimately detract from the story.  Both the main story and flashback sequences tie in other DC Comics characters in a way that shows that heroes are not created in a vacuum and they have to learn their skills one way or another, usually from a mentor.  Speaking of vacuums, the characters and settings are not isolated from the rest of the world - there are references to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the impact those conflicts have had on the shows characters.<br /><br />The only thing negative about the series is not about the TV show itself, but is a problem underlying the Green Arrow comic.  The Green Arrow (and his side-kick Speedy) were created as a spin-off Batman and Robin in 1941 in order to capitalize on the Dynamic Duo's success.  There are times when watching the show, it gets a certain \\"Batman-esque\\" feel that creeps up on you and (thankfully) fades away just as fast as it appeared - Arrow stands as a work of its own.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|If you are a Simon Pegg fan you'll love this movie.  It's got humor, action and a mystery.  There are quite a few nods to previous Pegg movies - most notably the Shaun of the Dead 'jumping over the fence'.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I like this app because you can used like a word doc on a PC.  I like the way it opens up on my Kindle.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was a great starting point for what I feel will be a huge franchise with these super hero's.<br /><br />Nice good vs. evil movie to watch with your kids.<br /><br />Wood see again and again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Difficult to get into.  Not a book that I can't put down.  Very interesting history of the 50's in Afganistan.
B004P8A7J2|1.0|Don't waste your time! No redeeming quality in this movie.  Druggies,  immorality, abuse of people by people who are addicted.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I did not expect to like this movie considering I am not interested in bird watching, and really hate juvenile comedies, which I was afraid this might be.  But it is not really a laugh a minute comedy, there are many funny moments, and I enjoyed seeing Owen Wilson in a role where he is not so likeable.  This movie has a nice message, and this is one of Jack Black's better movies (I am a jack Black fan, just not a fan of every movie he has done).
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I am a big fan of Hunger Games, Divergent, etc.  This book fits right in, and yet, has its own unique spin.  At first I wasn't so sure if I liked the idea of describing love as a disease but the author does a great job of explaining the history and events that led up to the current state of society.  I thought it was well written, good characters, kept me interested and wanting more.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie with an all star cast.  A must see for anyone that likes a touch of comedy in their action movies.  Bruce Willis never disappoints!
B00A992W9Y|3.0|As with most of the music coming out of the industry, you get one or two keepers, and the rest is filler.  I bought this with an Amazon Local coupon, which didn't apply itself.  Why Amazon doesn't just pool the regular gift credits with the Amazon MP3 ones is puzzling.
B000002MK8|5.0|Rod Stewart at his best.  Great music to make you feel like singing, dancing and smiling ear to ear.  Love it.
1401308201|4.0|This book is fascinating and detailed...almost too much information in some instances, but the cover and appearance make it look like a collector's item found in an attic treasure box or something. Mesmorizing.....
0061906220|5.0|Pete is adorable and the song is catchy.  My third grade students loved the song (which you can download online)  and the book is funny.  We wrote some Pete situations after reading the book.
0780626494|5.0|High concept, fun movie!  Actors make it fun and believable--A real laugh!  One of those movies you want to watch again and again!  Especially love the amazing dance sequence at the club with Brenden Fraser and two female admirers he picked up there. Smiles!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Loved this book even though many of my friends thought it was just ok.  I guess I really liked that he expressed his emotions and thoughts in a very raw way.  If you play guitar, you will enjoy his bantering about chords, writing.  If you love the music of the times, this may be an eye opener.  All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed Keith's memoir.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|This is another great addition to Beatles collections!  Some things on here I had never heard, so it was wonderful!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I love to do art and although you cannot really do real art on this, you can still create some interesting pictures and designs.  It also allows children to create their own pictures instead of all the games they usually play.  I like that it allows you to use different media such as colored pencils, crayons and paint.  Kids like the stickers and stamps and such.  For kids I would give it 5 stars but since it is on my Kindle Fire and I would like a little more control for fine lines and better blending and shading, I only give it 4 stars.
B000007MVD|5.0|I really enjoyed this because I had not heard these recorded versions before. A nice addition to my Beatles collection!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found this engrossing & probably one of SK's best books. Couldn't put it down-wanted to get to the end, then didn't want it to end.
B000U6BT40|4.0|This is an interesting concept for a series and is intriguing to watch.  Fun TV for science fiction fans and others....
B006GH6IS4|5.0|I really enjoyed this blu ray. I really wish I could have had the pleasure of seeing Queen as I'm sure it would have been amazing! So much music and talent. They were great and I will treasure this for many years to come!!
142311339X|5.0|This author writes compelling action-adventure-fantasy stories for young people, that adults will enjoy reading as well.  Highly recommended along with his several other series--including Percy Jackson (& the Olympians) and the Kane Chronicles.  Happy to see the Olympians' world expanded with this series that starts with the Lost Hero!  Keep 'em coming!
B0025WX2YW|4.0|it's ok...I like the story line and the characters.  As with most English movies it hard to understand all the conversations
1596912863|5.0|I liked the way the &#34;Austen&#34; themes are woven into modern day life in this very fun and sweet story!
0345803493|5.0|I had to purchase this book as soon I started to read the first. I was glued to it at work, home, anytime I needed more of these two.  This book made me laugh, anxious, cry and eager to read the next....then I purchased more corsets, a mask, and  riding crop! Go lol LATERS BABY.....  : )
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Have loved all his other books and this one is no different. Sad story of love, war and loss. Very powerful.
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|Nice contemplative composition.  This is the 1st &#34;BOC&#34; I have purchased and I like it!!  Will be purchasing others in the near future.
B00CFA222M|5.0|Kids and I loved the action and visuals of this movie.  Very interesting take on an old but classic story line.
1608871452|3.0|This book is awesome. Full of interactive set pieces, excellent photography, spot-on episode summations and many other nifty surprises, I have had much fun reading this wonderful book. However, I only give it 3 stars for the cheap way in which it is bound. It has already started falling apart and I am very careful with books, being a bibliophile. Books are treasures to me and I take great care with them. I have perused this book, carefully avoiding opening it to its full breadth because from the start, it was obvious that the binding is inferior, especially since this book contains various interactive sidebars that would require a binding strong enough to contain this book when opened or closed. Therefore, in spite of the obvious love with which Mr. Knight has assembled this book editorially, its actual construction is inferior. I can only give it 3 stars.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Had seen part of this movie on TV and ordered it for the full story line.  Very funny and kept me laughing the whole movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it. Except for killing off Mathew. Played well on TV most of the time. Paused on its own and then re started. Pause was to long as the connection reset itself. Otherwise excellent.
B0009P42S2|4.0|Bought this without knowing anything about it.  Kids and I watched it and were surprised at how much action it had and it held our full attention for the full movie.
0307279189|5.0|I had no idea this book would be so educational, entertaining and humorous. I learned a lot from it about foot/leg health, and had been suffering from knee pain for 2-3 months already. I decided to remove some arch supports from my shoes and this did the trick.  Amazing. The author's writing was exceptionally witty and funny.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I had heard a lot of great things about this book. I have even heard some people find similarities between it and the 50 Shades (which is by no means even close to a YA book). Or at least the two books used in the same sentence. Now, I haven't made it past the first 50 Shades book, but I don't think this book is anything like it. For one, it is extremely well written.<br /><br />Maybe it is the co-dependency aspect? There were, at times, in this book, that Travis became really creepy to me when it came to that. But I do think that is the point. He is this extremely hot guy who feels nothing for no one, uses people for his own means/pleasure and now finds himself feeling something very deeply for someone else, and he just doesn't want to let her go. To the point of obsessiveness. But she is so totally in love with him that it didn't faze her. Even when they found themselves apart, they were still technically together.<br /><br />And there were a lot of weird things thrown in, like gambling, Vegas, mobsters and underground college fighting circles. But it is written in a way that makes it all fall in place. Although, a bunch of college kids just jetting off to Vegas for a weekend, makes you wonder where they get their funds. Well, at least you know where two of them get them, at least. Some of it anyway.<br /><br />Was this book perfect? No. Were there flaws? Yes. Does it matter? Not one bit.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is the perfect title for this book.<br /><br />I got emotional many times throughout the book, happy, sad, crying, angry, every facet of emotions I could go through. And I could not put this book down. It is the first book in a long time that I read so quickly, to the point of putting off things that needed done so I could get it finished. And even now I still find myself thinking about it. I want to go back to certain parts of the book and reread them. This book has implanted itself into my brain, and will most likely be there for a while to come.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great action and story. I'm already looking forward to the next one.  Just like all of the other Marvel character movies this one does not disappoint.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and addicting.  A great way to kill some time while waiting in line.  Makes you think and plan while playing.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|i watched only a small part of the movie but to me it had alot of swearing in it but other than that it was ok.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you love to read you can't beat kindle.  Tremendous selection of books and magazines.  Easy to use no bugs or problems.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|The movie is enjoyable. It is interesting to see the characters change and grow, a little,  It does not match up to Before Midnight because the characters are far less real in this one.
B009NY43NY|1.0|How can everything that can go wrong, go wrong in all the other books but the entire series ends like this?? How about a last book explaining everyone's lives and happily since all others were a bit troublesome for all. Disappointed in the ending
B00BBW16HW|5.0|See it !  see it ! see it !  it will leave you thinking, and feeling and wondering.  It is worth your time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|worth playing (: everyone would definitely fall in love with this game its fabulous. the graphics are good and its challenging yet fun. it takes time to over up and the gems are hard to earn but still really well done
0761169431|5.0|Bought this for my son who is into origami big time.  He loves the Star Wars theme.  Bought it for Christmas and he still brings it out, 7 months later.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Highly recommend it even though the subject matter makes it hard to say how good it was.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Funny, cute and pretty unique.  Watched it with my family and was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as my son.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Was this book written by a 5th grader? I was trying to force myself to finish it because i paid for it, but it was way too bad. Wish i could have given it less than 1 star!!!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Touch sensation is not that good. It might be better if the movement is based on tilting of the phone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|u really need to get this game its so awesome the only question I have is that there is this girl named meana u have to beat and she wasn't in the movie other than that the best game of the year :)
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My son who is almost 5 loves this app and playing with Ben. Very interactive. A good app for kids.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I  loved Gone Girl, but this one was disappointing.  It just dragged on and on with an unsympathetic narrator.  Flynn is a good writer, but this one was just too strong in unpleasantness and the ending was not satisfying.
1439156816|5.0|A must read for any aspiring writer who loves to do their research--which is reading!  A great blend crafted to motivate any writer.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|It was great. Instant is the best. Also loved I could watch it on here before netflix! The show itself was pretty good.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I kept reading even through the slow parts in hopes the story would get to a climactic point. The book ended more with a slow drawing of the curtain than with a big ending. While I was drawn in to continue reading, I was not so captivated that I feel inexorably drawn to the third installment of the trilogy. Rothfuss is a good writer, and he cleverly names things like songs, cities, people, non-human creatures and so on. It is his compelling writing that kept me involved. I felt the story line was a bit long and drawn out with too many pages for the story as it turned out. So if you like Rothfuss, go ahead and read Day Two. There are some interesting developments in Kvothe's story. In that sense you will not be disappointed. Just do not expect a sweeping epic fantasy tale.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|It was a good movie. I would recommend it. It did leave it as there were going to be other shows. Seems weird to end it the way it did then have nothing to follow it up. They should not have left it so open for another and maybe wrapped it up better.
B009JZVT70|5.0|We watched the first season on Netflix after it had been out for a year or so and fell in love.  It is a very good series with good messages and the plot it well done.<br /><br />The second season has lived up to our expectations for sure!  They through in a few characters you wouldn't think should be there but they make it work.  We had to buy it because we couldn't wait even for a week to watch the next episodes!<br /><br />A very good buy!!! and well worth your time
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|It was just what you thought it was going to be. Very cute. Funny and romantic. Id recommend it. Good watch.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|terrible the app will not install if you are reading my reveiw than take my advice and do not get this app
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think what I did up there its also fun and you help the cute green pigs (not the king)
B0089LOG02|5.0|Had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Turned out to be better than expected and I couldn't put it down
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Outstanding. Hope this will be an ongoing series. The real inside story of our corrupt political system. Netflix has a winner.
B004DWKO8Y|4.0|Mr Big's &#34;What If&#34; is a non-stop ride of grooving riffs, driving bass lines and pounding drums.  If you're a lover of hard rocking classic rock this is one CD you need to own.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Despite the other reviews saying this game was confusing and hard to play, it was the FAOTD, so I gave it a shot.  I am very glad that I did! It took me less than a minute into the first game to figure out how to play... and I was hooked. I haven't lost a game yet, but I am only playing against the computer.<br /><br />After the first game it did ask me if I wanted to post and share with Facebook. I said no, and told it not to ask me again, and it hasn't. I don't see that as an issue, as so many games connect via social media these days. This app asked once, and once I said no and to not ask again, it hasn't, so it isn't bothersome or intrusive.<br /><br />All in all, I am really glad that I ignored the more negative reviews, and got this game while it was FAOTD.  I am totally hooked, and spending way more time playing than I should be. Knowing how much fun this game is, and the strategy needed to win, I would totally buy it again, at full price.
147674355X|5.0|I read Hopeless by Colleen Hoover in e book form & absolutely was entranced with the story! after finishing in an emotional 2 days, I knew I had to have paper copies to give as gifts.  My friends range an age from 22 to 65 & all that I have invied to read,  loved this beautiful, emotional story of Holder & Sky.  Not just one twist & turn, but a few with an ending that will have your heart wrung dry & filled with amazement.  Her  follow up - &#34;Finding Hope&#34; has just been released & I will be inhaling that soon!!  It is written from Holder's point of view.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another awesome Sigma novel, very smart and twisty!  I can't wait for the next one!  The science behind these novels is frightening!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|My wife Gloria and I rented this movie for one of our &#34;dinner and a movie&#34; nights.  Entertaining, well done, action packed, with a surprise at the end.<br /><br />Adele's Skyfall song is great.<br /><br />The movie is long, so make sure you allow enough time to see the whole thing.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|My grandson is so excited that he can now take his favorite game with him wherever he goes. I have to assign a quota of how much time he can spend on his MP3 playing Angry Birds.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|All of the fast chases, fast driving and drama you could want.  Fast Five still has everyone being chased by the police but there is a nice twist in this one.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Huge fan of books 1 & 2 - book 3 of course I'm enjoying already, 20% of the way in.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I had been putting off buying this book and Amazon kept throwing it out there so I finally ordered it on my kindle and am I glad I did......This book is so well written that I almost felt like I was in the courtroom at the trial.  Not to give anything away but I  could not sleep well after all was over......
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I don't want to get involved in purchasing video games for my grandchildren to play when they come visit me, but having games loaded on my Kindle solves the problem.  It keeps them occupied in the car and if I need to take them with me to an appointment.  I don't know one game from the other, but they know what they like and Jewels Star is one of them!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|amazing album. perfect blend of classic storytelling hip hop and modern day beats. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis does a fantastic job modernizing very classic style and sound
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This season of the Doctor gives a different look at the Doctor, because the Doctor and Donna have a very different relationship. The brother sister vibe is far more entertaining to watch than the pining companion of seasons past. Donna questions the Doctor from the beginning in a way that isn’t done in any other season. Excellent!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved Season 2 and waiting on Season 3!  Loved the setting so much!  Having been to England years ago, it was great to see all the different locations!  Superb acting!!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A MTV production movie that was alright. I had hoped for a little more but alas it was only okay.
B002G1YPH0|2.0|I was very excited when I received this only to find out it did not fit inside my CPU case. Returns were very easy thru Amazon.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I rented this movie and I could not finish it.<br /><br />I may not have been in the right mood or right state of mind to watch such a movie but I have not wanted to go back and try watching this again at all.<br /><br />The acting was sub par and I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks and Holly Berry and the story was week. Just not a movie for me.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I really liked the challenge of having to collect objects to get you through the levels but I'm completely stuck on level 6 or 7, the one with the red car & it's driving me crazy. I really wish they would give you small hints as to where or what to do when you're stumped.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch had some decent action and (not to spoil anything) I feel that Mr. Sparks stepped outside of his usual writing style and added a VERY interesting twist at the end. Bravo!
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was a good book I liked it ! It was long but I liked it<br /><br />I liked that it easy to read and a little hard
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is so good. It has so much more action them the first book. LOVED more then th www first! Amazing services
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love Country music. Florida Georiga Line is my favorite country band ever. Going to see them this summer and I can't for that.:)
B000001GXE|5.0|What more can one say? Well, smooth, expressive, and well-recorded though dated, an excellent addition to the collection. Glad I bought it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. Realistic graphics and the motions of my the horses is incredible. I definitely recommend this game to any horse lovers and anyone that likes these kinds of games. :D
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It is a great pleasure to have the bible available on my device. The different versions at your finger tips is amazing and inspiring.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I believe this movie is the best drama movie Ive seen for some time.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was packed with action and changes had an excellent storyline and never in the course of the movie did I get bored.  I chose it because the review sounded good and I would recommend it to anyone who doesnt like drawn out boring hard to follow story lilnes but who does like lots of action and a good story line.
B00AZF131U|3.0|I saw this when it first came out & was impressed at 21 but after watching it again at 35 it's not as interesting. Of course it's a bit dated but the acting & plot development still hold value.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|no bugs no lags but u need some real software to run the app right great job game loft. . .
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I am a weather nerd. I have a weather station by my bed, and by my chair in the living room. Before the Weather Channel became the Anything But Weather Channel, it was my default TV station. I have 3 other weather apps at the front of my carousel on my Kindle. When this one came up on sale last week, I decided to actually pay real money for it based on the reviews. (I am also a financial nerd).<br /><br />Several reviewers noted it took them 20 minutes or so to figure out the app, which by my standards, is pretty good. I took about 25 minutes because there really is a lot of information stuffed into this app! Others have gone into great detail about the weather tools found within so I don't think it is necessary to do it again. However, it is nice to have every detail I want in one place now. And I mean every single detail!<br /><br />I particularly love the map, which not only tells you the time information contained in it was put on the map (if you scroll the map down or over or up depending on where you live and the direction your storms, etc., generally come from, the time is stamped over the area the information they got to put on the map - awesome!!), but is automatically moving about 5 seconds after it loads. I like the amount of information and how it is set up. If a storm is approaching (as one is currently in my area), there is a separate bar just for the air pressure which I need because of a particular chronic illness I suffer which is very affected by changes in air pressure, which extends 24 hour into the future.<br /><br />What I also really like is that it has an earthquake map!! The map has all earthquakes from all over the world placed with a yellow dot which is sized by the earthquakes intensity. You just tap on a dot and it tells you where exactly the earthquake happened, the intensity and best of all, how deep it occurred. To get to this information, on the bottom of the main weather page are a bunch of buttons (or widgets?). The earthquake information is the center right button. Push it and a list of all earthquakes over .5 in the past 12 hours are listed. The map comes up if you tap on one that looks interesting.<br /><br />There are two weather maps you can reach by tapping center left buttons at the bottom of the page, and a more inclusive map with ocean temps and more specific storm information. There are two buttons next to each other.<br /><br />When I first opened this app and started the map, my Kindle froze only once and hasn't done so since (and I have checked it several times since I downloaded it). I'm afraid my most recent go to weather app is now lying dormant as I get to know more and more about this app. And I definitely agree with many of you in here - GET A BETTER NAME!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this app even if you aren't a weather nerd. They have made it very easy to use. I love the weather clock - they give you alternative ways to get to the same information which is good for those who are not rocket scientists when it comes to learning new apps (like me)! A good deal for a great weather app! I see this app has gone back to its original price - this app is so good, I would pay the extra money for it. This is an update to my original review (today's date is 10/10/2013) so I've had more time to tinker with this app. It is still my favorite weather app and I could write a whole lot more about what information it contains, but I'll leave that fun for you! As I said, I would pay today's price for this app, so obviously I encourage you to not let the price put you off! Excellent app for weather nerds and easy app to get all the weather info you need for those not so into weather!rmation is the center right button.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Starting a few years after the show's debut and catching up now. Entertaining without the usual violence/sex draws to gain viewers.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|They reboot the Hulk when Ang Lees was suitable.. they reboot Spiderman a few years after a 3 movie run..now this..... I thought Superman Returns was adequate -- how do they expect a franchise to blossom if they keep switching actors and won't let people settle in? Apparently if it doesn't make a billion dollar profit it's a flop. Man of Steel is a very tepid movie. i save a lot of money by actually going to the theater, admittedly we hop and see 2 movies for 1 price but I will definitely be skipping this as a purchase.... as bland and uninspired as Ive seen in quite awhile (fantastic 4?) amazing Spider-man killed this mess.<br /><br />IMO, i'd also add stars of the caliber of Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins actually take away from these movies.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|this was a great movie to rent , I'm glad I did not pay the move rate however, good entertainment
B005LAIIN0|3.0|World War Z. The ONE thing that drew me into this was the fact Brad Pitt is in a zombie movie -- so almost by default the script MUST contain something \\"different\\" in terms of a zombie flick - right? Well, largely no. The end (spoiler free) had a different ring I suppose but the movie played out like bullet points of a zombie flick, complete with generic military installations. The characters were dull, and while there were a couple of \\"big moments\\" (you'll see) it's not quite enough to make up for the lifeless characters and been there done that script. I still don't see what made Brad Pitt do this movie. 6.5 out of 10 (will not purchase on Blu Ray)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app really use full easy to use and has some really great features like how long it takes to charge and other things
1594204217|5.0|When I first saw this book publicized I thought it would be a repeat of Richard Wrangham's \\"Catching Fire\\" but MP immediately describes that book as well as others along the historical route towards current thinking about cooking and its importance for us, so that there is no repetition at all. Instead, it is follow through on that argument. Doing what he does so well MP takes us on a personalized tour of the topic - this time breaking the topic up into Fire, Water, Air, Earth - the last of which I thought was going to touch on our Microbiome that Rosamond Rhodes discusses in bioethics. But it really stresses how important it is to ferment foods and drink. In cooking we learn a lot about southern Barbeque but I am not sure this is something everyone should try on their front lawn. In fact, I am pretty sure in my neighborhood I would be arrested. But I may try looking up a local joint that comes as close as possible to see what the skeen really tastes like. If not something local I will keep it in mind the next time I visit the south. With water perhaps Hermione Granger might learn a lesson or two in how to make the best potions, even the moste potente ones. By the way, there are recipes in the back of the book! Umami is a topic of discussion here as it was in \\"Catching Fire\\" but here MP adds the exciting new information for me that breast milk is loaded with it. A lot of what is important in cooking is what you do with yourself while all this cooking is going on. Here we have an important criticism of individual meals cooked by factories. No time for conversation. Bread requires air and we have already moved towards sourdough breads though we do not make or bake at home. At least not often. in short, this is another very interesting read. At least this time it doesn't leave me feeling oppressed by grass taking over the world or thinking of myself as a corn chip.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! for home work garden projects how toos ;  it is just perfect to save pics for projects and learn to make your own. things

0553801473|5.0|These books are AMAZING.  If you love the HBO series, then you will love these books.  They have so much more in them and explain things even better than what you will see from the series. Must have!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is not just a love story but its also about a courageous women that values herself and respects herself to make the decisions she made.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love this series and the shows are just amazing to watch over and over again.  Went through them so fast and enjoyed every minute.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is a must see for those who like a fast moving anti terrorism series, somewhat similar to &#34;24&#34;, but with the twist of the FBI agent, the main star of the show, being a female. This show kept me and my husband extremely interested and now we can't wait to see the upcoming episodes. All this and from the comfort of our home, great!!!
0345529057|5.0|These books are AMAZING.  If you love the HBO series, then you will love these books.  They have so much more in them and explain things even better than what you will see from the series. Must have!
B004SDEP38|1.0|could not get it to open up in my tablet. Deleted it. Not worth a flip I have Kingsoft and it works!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game minion rush if you give it less than 5 stars your crazy. I have a totally cool costume for my minion. I love the game I think its totally rad . if you are thinking about deleteing it your crazy. you should give the game a second chance. if you still don't like the game keep it for a rainy day . minion rush is a great game for if your board if you like it so much upgrade it. sometimes I play minion rush for hours I play it in the car in restraints almost any wear I can. I looked at others reviews wear the highest rating was a 3 I thought their crazy. this is all I have to say about minion rush .
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I like that this app updates there weapons it may take a little time but they will add new guns.  Also the guns are functionally correct and correct to the period. Highly recommend.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This movie was perfect as I am expecting my 4th child. I love the cast and it is on point about pregnancy. Everyone is different! Will watch again & highly recommended!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyes science fiction television series. Hope to see season 3 soon.
0385344333|4.0|After reading the previous Child Book, I was frustrated that I could not write to him immediately to applaud the fact that he has always, unlike some of my favorite authors, maintained the quality of his writing well after establishing a loyal fan base.  I was a little disappointed in A WANTED MAN, and hope this one is not an example of books to come.  For those who have never read his stuff, know that he is well worth reading, is, as a matter of fact, still my absolute favorite author.  He writes with clarity, is never predictable, is always engaging, and  Jack Reacher never fails to astound.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is amazing and Gone Girl has kept me up at night. I LOVE the characters and all the twists and turns in the plot. This is my second Gillian Flynn novel and I'm eager to start reading the third. Keep writing Gillian! You have a growing flan club out here!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not a game.  Thought it was a game, but is actually nothing.  I have candy crush on my I pad and have been enjoying it until it started to crash when you go to levels, this is the reason I put it on my kindle, but it is not the same thing.<br /><br />Is there anyway I can remove this app?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is one original writer. Characters are fascinating and dimensional Nobody else like her. I will be reading everything this woman writes!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have enjoyed angry birds and have enjoyed watching my grandchildren play it. They range in age 4 to 9.  Good game for all ages.
6305428387|5.0|Cool Runnings is a wonderful film.  So enjoyable to watch.  Our grandson who is 14 really laughed and laughed as so did I.  So glad to watch a &#34;good&#34; movie
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I loved this show growing up. And watching it again is so much fun. He proves that science can be fun..and useful in everyday life. He also shows that our kids should be given and know how to use a swiss army knife.....
B000002J6F|5.0|This was the 3rd copy of this album I've purchased.  Gifts for folks I love, gift for me!!!  Great music!!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Their craziness can get on your nerves after awhile, but the ending is beautiful and the cast is fantastic. It was a movie that I could only watch once, but enjoyed the story line enough to recommend it to others.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|My app keeps on stopping ill open it click on a vid and it will say vyoutube has stoped<br /><br />.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a good book. It is an interesting topic. The author did a good job identifying the characters. It was not the best written book but definitely a good book to read and with lots to think about.<br /><br />We did it for our book club and had so much to talk about. The characters were very interesting. They were real people in real family situations. The book makes you think about topics that you don't really know how you would react.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is so cute and both of my kiddos love it!  Rated G and got a good deal on it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The story is great for both kids and adults. I liked the movie's twist on Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum, as they are the names of some of the giants and is not the dialogue of one particular giant. Hope they make a sequel....&#34;Fum's Revenge&#34; LOL
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My kiddos both love this movie and it is so cute.  Rated G and they love the story line of the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great app for the reader that reads a ton of books. does what its suppose to do and not crash or force close.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Probably the best role Ran Gosling has ever played since he hardly says a word! Its like a John Wayne type deal. The more silent he is the better the acts! He starts talking and ruins most of the fun.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|This book was an amazing adventure romance novel that has so many great messages. Colin's search to find who he is is quite inspiring. John Green did an awesome job on this book!!
B0031R5K68|5.0|No time to stop once he winds you up. A bit of esoteric rambling at the end but a bloody good read.
B00CIS1OKW|5.0|Classic story set to Jack and the Bean Stalk saga.  The poor common farmboy unsuspectingly wins the king's daughter heart and in the process became the hero over the caniving, trusted right-hand man of the king.  The story is told in bright spectular colors, suspenseful scenes and a great story line.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is fun to watch but is totally unbelievable. No real law firm would keep on an unqualified person on as a lawyer.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book.  Marcus takes the reader to the front line.  He said it like it is.  We as a country let politics interfere with what our brave troops need to do to protect themselves while they protect our country.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The book is a subtle reminder that there is a creative genius in all of us. and through the example of Tesla it makes us aware of the fact that if creativity is allowed to run wild creation of new and innovative inventions is simple.<br /><br />The 4 star rating is meant to give this book, as a  must read to students from age 11-14, and can be accessed by individuals of all ages.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she is too busy to read it.  I have it on my Kindle and don't like the idea of not being able to put markers with the page number in the book.<br /><br />HOWEVER, my library has the audio and I know that will be better.  If Amazon wants to give me an audio, I would be so please to rate it as &#34;excellent.&#34;<br /><br />It's very deep and takes a lot of concentration.  I do have two other friends reading it, one on their Kindle.  I think for the summer, we had to take a break from serious discussions and enjoy the lighter fare for the season.<br /><br />I think, however, that it's an important book for our century, giving our daughters a focus for what they can achieve and ways they can achieve them.  My daughter doesn't feel that she can make use of the suggestions, though because she works for the Government and they just move you upwards in a regular course as long as you do the job well.  She does need to speak up about the nature of the responsibilities that she is trying to balance, like having to work hard like she thinks will get here somewhere when men can easily be promoted for not working that hard.  There is also no reason she needs an MBA, however, because she is someone who is a self made woman with the skills and know how to make decisions that would help her product line and the Government in general.<br /><br />I hope she reads this soon, though she was not excited to get it.  I think this is the case especially with me knowing the author has come from a high economic status with a husband with money to begin with. It's different for myself and others who are divorced with no supports to take the chance in this economy to lose a job when asking for more money. It happened to me and it's been hard to find another job for the money I was making.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Present for my son for his tenth birthday.  Very cool puzzle that the whole family has enjoyed.  We have yet to beat it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The packaging was very good and glad of it because I had to give it as a substitute that I lost for our local library collection!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down. I love this triology and would love for there to be more books to this series.
006029129X|5.0|A while ago I reviewed \\"Not A Box\\"  and commented on how it reminded me of \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\". I liked \\"Not A Box\\" because the genderless rabbit could be male or female and therefore could appeal to a boy or a girl. I love \\"Harold\\", though, because he reminds me of my fair-haired, toddling son.<br /><br />Not only that, \\"Harold\\" is about a child's imagination, which I think is an excellent subject for a children's book, especially a clever child's imagination.<br /><br />The illustrations are simple; the colors are few, although purple does play a prominent role; and the result is perfection in illustration.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't read books in a while, but this are very enticing and I loved every turn of the page.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|very hard to watch this movie thru Amazon.  I think they have a bad file or something as other movies I have rented on Amazon were fine.  would like to get my money back.
B000SP1SEO|5.0|All of Guy Ritchie's films are great. Watch them all. High paced, fun, and full of surprises. And the cast is the best in every movie.
B005I548B4|5.0|I chose the rating of 5 stars because I couldn't put the book down.  From the minute it starts I could relate to the characters, in many cases thinking of people in my life that were just like those in the book.<br /><br />The story unfolds in such a way that I found myself willing the ending to be a certain way and being totally stumped that it didn't go the way I wanted!  However, the ending was still good and not something I could have seen coming earlier on.<br /><br />You will like this if you generally like 'chick-lit' but appreciate a bit more grunt. This is not just romance, this is more 'thinking-chick-lit'!  Enjoy.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|This movie is visually stunning, epic, and above all; confusing. I did some research before watching the movie the first time in theaters and still had very little idea what was actually going on. Recently I decided to go back and try to appreciate the story, not just the visual aspect, but failed again. I'm sure many will catch on better and or faster than I but I just wish that there was more on the side of explanations and less on the side of assumptions. Still fun to watch, except for the glowing blue genitals throughout the duration.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|I Think this game is the most fun of all the games I've purchased from Amazon.  There are several selections of types of pinball machines to choose from which adds variety to the game.  I showed this to my husband and I can hardly get my kindle away from him.  We both love this game!
B0034G4ORC|1.0|Not even a B movie.  Boring. You know anything with Michelle Rodriguez in it is going to stink. This is one of those movies where I was hoping all of the characters were going to die.  What a waste of time.  Terrible special effects.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I heard wonderful things about the movie. However it was from people who had not trudged trough this novel. Mental illness handled poorly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome. challenging but not impossible and super addicting! Both my mom and I loved it. Looking forward to more levels!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Sometimes it's hard to grab the pieces, but otherwise it's a fun app with plenty to offer. The game includes many options and puzzles to solve.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I thought it would be good but it was better than I imagined, I really liked the underlying theme of the movie
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Love this game. I enjoy games that you build a city or rebuild as you play levels.  The higher the level the more difficult the game, but at least it's not impossible.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put it down for even a second. A sad story that somehow leaves you feeling hopeful in the end.
B00AKO93JK|1.0|If I didn't care much for traditional exercise prior to downloading it, this app is sure NOT to motivate me any further!!!  Boring beyond belief, no music, no action..... it is now certainly deleted from my device...
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I just like all the medical terms (as I am a nurse) and it has a well rounded story behind each character
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had seen Gone Girl mentioned as a must read, but didn't know anything about it before I picked it up.  It is a thriller - you will not want to put it down.  A little dark, it will make you think and keep you wanting more.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Can't wait for season 5 to be available on Amazon Prime.  I started watching this series a little late but am glad I gave it a try.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|A fun, light, quick read.  Tina Fey will make you laugh out loud.  Perfect for a summer vacation or trip.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|The music is just gorgeous. Listen to it all the time.  The CD creates different songs. All beautiful, you can either relax or use it for steppin it up.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am always skeptical after reading one amazing book that the author can meet expectations with the next one.  Hosseini does just that - he writes in a way that makes you become invested in the story.  You'll love the characters and finding out how they are all connected.  Great book - highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the minions! Game is so much fun. It's never the same twice! Keeps you coming back again and again!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|If you're a dog lover, you will really enjoy movie based upon the true story of Hachi - it's a 2 kleenex movie, but the dog gives a great performance.  The cast, including Richard Gere are really secondary to the dog.
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Great price, excellent collection of CDs, and listen to it all the time.  And, I used to HATE John Mayer...
B00969PR18|4.0|Really like the format. Haven't had a chance to use it \\"on the road\\" yet but am  confident it will perform well. Was amazingly accurate locating our house in a tiny town in South Dakota.
0345529057|4.0|I ordered this on behalf of my daughter. A good buy for the price but I have to bundle it with another book to get he free shipping for $25 dollar limit.
B00B9E29CI|4.0|Good for anyone working with kids of all ages. Some great insights. Go out and buy it. It's a ripper
0142418471|4.0|I ordered this on behalf of my daughter. A good buy for the price but I have to bundle it with another book to get he free shipping for $25 dollar limit.
B0041VT6HW|1.0|A lesser remake of 'Wild Wild West' featuring some of the laziest production I've seen in a film of it's budget. Actors either throw themselves futily at the misshapen script or visibly put in no effort to coast their way to easy paychecks. The script, written by 'Crank' filmmakers Neveldine/Taylor, might have worked under their hyperactive vulgar direction, but handed off to the next guy on the studio list their ideas come off as either bewildering or featureless. Completely devoid of energy and creativity it's one of the foulest pieces of generic big-budgeted excrement Hollywood has seen fit to release for general consumption.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OKAY. THIS. SERIES. WAS. AMAZING. I'm so sad to be finished... it took me 3 days to finish it because of how hooked I was. I can't WAIT for the movies.. (First one - August 1st, 2014) I'm hoping Alexis bladel and Matt bomer play the roles... they're perfect. The ending made me cry and I was very entertained reading the beginning of the book in christain's point of view. Yum... ;*
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was really expecting an exciting, gripping story - what I got was somewhat different.  The story was rather disjoined and although initially sympathetic to the main female character, I disliked her more and more as I read.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I just love sitting back and enjoying the genius in the details. What a great job on movement, colors, sounds, and overall depiction of the video game world
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Jeffrey Archer always writes well - but I didn't find this book as good as the first two in the series and there looks as though there will be at least another book to find out which 'son' has died.<br /><br />Disappointing read.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|only thing is that in comparison to the LOTR series this one has a lot more computer animated stuff. just wanted a little more hard work on the set like LOTR
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love this game. the only problem is that when it was updated they changed the controls.  I hope in the next update that is fixed.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this is a great app. I think I'm even going to buy the pro version shortly. thank you for putting this together. I especially like the color version how you can have colored flashlights.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Some of my favorite actors are in this comedy/action flick. It's a little on the ridiculous side in terms of the stunts but it's a good movie to watch when you don't want to take the world too seriously.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Keeps me on the edge of my seat the entire time I am watching it. I can't wait for the next season to begin!
0762451319|3.0|As the other review stated this box set of items is fairly - well - \\"meh\\".<br /><br />It comes with a very small book containing screenshots of the film and quotes from the script. This idea might have made for an interesting poster book of screenshots from the film were the book bigger than two inches high.<br /><br />The magnets are actually quite nice and the tattoos are as well but like the book they are also quite small.<br /><br />The one thing that I was really looking forward to in this box set was actually the necklace but the chain ended up being so short that I can't even fasten it around my neck so until I find another chain for it the (well made) pendant that came in this set is sadly unwearable.
B008Y73940|5.0|Keeps you hooked the whole time from the start to the end. A must see Action packed and funny too.
B0007C9DR2|1.0|Received soft cover copy. Wanted the hard cover edition.DID NOT GET WHAT I PAID FOR. tHEY MESSED UP A SIMPLE ORDER.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Thought provoking, densely packed,well written...enjoyed the story and seeing the tale unravel the past.  Looking to start the next in the series.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|A wonderful story of personal integrity, both good and bad and the consequences of each; an unusual story of independence of thought and ideals; a different kind of love story all intertwined into a masterpiece of writing.<br /><br />My one criticism was the excessive suspense of revealed and expected events while the author expounded her conservative political beliefs.
B004SDEP38|1.0|i didnt even use it, it was free to download but not free to use..... this was not helpful what so ever.
1932735410|5.0|I like the straight shooter attitude in Rita's approach.  You really have to understand the science of project management to be able to pass the test.  It's not about memorizing definitions at ALL!  This book along with the PMBOK side by side; chapter by chapter was the key to my success in passing all areas of the PMP exam.
B007T7MIR0|3.0|I am a  student and wanted to be able to download or access my powerpoint slides on my kindle fire. I downloaded this app to be able to do that with ease but ended up having to make several other accounts to even use the program. It was a huge waste of my time. Ill just go buy an iPad.
B0092D1V5Y|2.0|This &#34;APP&#34; didn't provide any usable passwords, as such i was not able to log into any wireless sites identified.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 8 year old has watched these 2 movies several times since receiving it for her birthday.  Great purchase for the price!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I didn't read the book and I don't think it's necessary to. Given the subject and given the character I give this film two thumbs up!
B001AG52AG|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie.  She wanted it for her birthday and she was very happy to receive it.  Wish they would come out with a sequel!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This book was the most exciting book I've read in a long time. I couldn't put it down.The ending was specatular
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a free app that allows you to read books and other media on your phone. It is easy to use and convenient. There is no reason not to get this app.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I really like this cover for my Kindle Fire. It's fits perfectly! I feel it is very secure since it clicks in place versus some other cases I have seen which just have elastic straps over the corners. I also am glad it has an elastic strap to keep the flap in place. My only complaint is that the edges seem to be turning black from the flap of the cover, but overall I am satisfied with my purchase.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show just keeps getting better with times. The ending was a surprise and cannot wait for the next season
0425263924|1.0|I loved the first two books of the Crossfire Trilogy...oh wait scratch that since it is no longer a trilogy.  This book started out very poorly written and overly cheesy.  Could Gideon call her \\"angel\\" one more time and could she state \\"I love you\\" anymore??? Way to to drag out a series for money Sylvia Day.  This book was drawn out, slow, and highly irritates me that I have two more books to go if I want to know how it ends.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really liked this season. The (spoiler!!) death of the daughter really shocked me. I was also surprised at financial troubles of Downton. I can't wait till the next season!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|First thing my son downloaded to my Kindle and I'm hooked its easy to play and my kids love it just as much as me :)
B0064X7FVE|1.0|liked the oldformat better,  going to use another weather program<br />please try to improve or bring back the old format
B00BDAP66E|2.0|I write fan fiction and i post it on pictures. But i cant even see my photos it just takes me to my profile. Also i cant see the news feed. So yea its sucks
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Fun to play version.  like the auto reset option, if there no tiles you can play.  Timing to get stars is challenging, but not overwhelming.  My wife has another Mah Jong app that does not have a pause feature, this one does, and it easy to pause and return.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I only have two words for you.....<br />Unbelievably Awesome<br />This is perfect for kids, teens, and adults XD.<br />I discovered this game by pretty much all my friends!!!<br />I can't wait to see the movie :)
B009Y2L3G0|5.0|(This is about the reissue.)<br /><br />Free is one of my favorite groups. Lots of other later groups imitated them, but none were as good. Most people only know a few of their songs, All Right Now being the one you'd have heard if you'd heard nothing else, but there is so much in their catalog. This is from 1970 so some of the later material such as Wishing Well doesn't appear, but what's here is great.<br /><br />Live they really just pull out the stops. There's so much aural space in their music already, especially the earlier stuff, so the fact that they play live doesn't mean the arrangements drop out and the energy goes with. Exactly the opposite, they turned up the energy level as any good live act would do and the fact that our ears are so used to the sonic space and dynamics means that nothing feels off. Simon Kirke and Andy Fraser would step up when Kos soloed, and really lay back during the verses or the quiet moments. Fraser would sometimes drop out completely, which meant that when he reappeared you would really feel it. This is exactly how a good live act should work and something that is all to often absent from modern music.<br /><br />It's also hard to realize that they were still teenagers or early twentysomethings when they recorded this stuff. Andy Fraser's bass and Simon Kirke's drums anchor the whole thing while Kos and Paul fly high over the top. To me, Fraser is one of the great unsungs of the bass world. He played so well, so adventurously, and tastefully, to say nothing of all the great writing he did, but hardly anyone knows who he is.<br /><br />The recording is mixed like a live stage, so Fraser is mostly left, Kirke and Rodgers center, and Kos right. The remastering sounds pretty good to me, too, and the extra tracks on the reissue are most welcome, although there are a few duplicates (Mr. Big, All Right Now, Get Where I Belong).<br /><br />Highlights: Moonshine (Kos!), Be My Friend, Mr. Big, the second version of All Right Now where Kos just goes into space for a while. But really, all of it!
B00000099Y|5.0|If you're not already a Tool fan, or are unsure Tool is for you, you MUST listen to this entire CD before deciding for yourself. In my opinion, this is their most poetic CD made. Not only do you get to hear the bands energy, but you also feel the emotions associated with the lyrics. Great band, great album, all art and poetry. This is my fourth copy I have bought of this album and have been listening to it since it came out when I was 12. If you haven't already, listen to it!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|very entertaining,. Malkovich played the paranoid very well, funny as always..  Rest of the cast were entertaining as well.  Worth the rental price!
0345803450|1.0|Ian McEwan writing as a novice novelist with redemption in the last 15 pages.  It is only after you have read 95% of the book that you understand why the usually astute McEwan has failed to adequately portray the voice of a young woman in her early twenties.  Were other anomalies deliberate?  It is 1972, and a minor and transient character is a former computer salesman.
034580404X|5.0|I brought this for my wife's birthday and thought it was going to come two days after and it actually came a day before making it the perfect timing and a perfect birthday. Thanks a lot Amazon you guys sure know how to treat a customer.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This has been a wonderful series and a wonderful story. My husband I are so grateful to have it on our TV programs as well on Nefflicks.
B005K17RU0|2.0|A former good app which is now a poor one. Need to redo this one. Look at old app and use it to guidance.
B0092W2GSG|4.0|I've seen Calexico play live twice and they are one of the best live acts I've ever seen. The latest show was a lot of Algiers material and it was incredible live. I wish they could capture the live experience on disc...perhaps a video would be even better than the compact disc. Still, this is a very good collection of songs that deserves your attention. There is world music here, twang without country music sound, lots going on while much that seems stripped down. Calexico is nothing if not an anomaly. Splitter trundles along like a train in Texas, Dead Moon is a Clint Eastwood film, Algiers (the song) is tango aboard the deck of a cruise ship under a harvest moon, cruising just offshore from Puerto Vallarta, wordlessly. Some of it is achingly slow, some breathless. All of it is of a mood that is entirely worth feeling.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is a good read- it helps readers think about life beyond themselves as we watch two teens, and their parents, struggle with cancer and sickness. All this in the midst of finding friendship and love. The Author is not very religious and so the story is left a little flat for me, compared to more hopeful books... but it still has it's own kind of hope - in having been loved and remembered by some. I realize that this quality will make it even more attractive to some readers, and there is definitely room in the book for many different kinds of faith (which are portrayed)... I just can't shake my own belief that there is even more to life than the conclusion the teens came to. But, they struggled with more than I currently have, so really, who am I to say?<br /><br />What I loved about it, and something that will stick with me forever, was the idea that your unique love and friendship with someone dies with them. For example... my husband and I share a million inside jokes between each other that no one else would or could ever possibly understand or laugh in the same way we do. I watched as one of the characters struggles at the memorial service for the other because he/she felt people didn't truly understand what they shared together, or who that person actually and truly was. The struggle with death wasn't over-glamorized, yet the book isn't a total downer either. I definitely appreciate the one-of-a-kind love I share with my husband a little more after reading this book, and realize that each relationship I am lucky to have is unique and individual.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed the 3rd season of Downton Abbey!  The only problem is I can't wait for season 4! If you're a fan you'll definitely enjoy it!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|this was a very potent soa and man the third season is off the chain as well.  Can't wait to get the other seasons as when you watch them in this style versus TV it's more understanding.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of the old missle defence game back in the 80's.<br />It will come in handy when I fly to Singapore next month.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Tried to watch these movies on the regualr TV but no they were cut up too bad so I got my own dvd and they are great.
B00687Q0VC|5.0|This is a great series for anyone wanting to know more of the establishment of our republic.  Acting is terrific and the historical accuracy is outstanding.  Well worth the money!
B001BYLFE4|5.0|Yes the uncut version with no commercials in it was great I enjoyed these movies a lot betterthey are more in depth and better able to follow along
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is a life affirmation that brings one's life before the mirror.  The Kingdom of God is within you dear Alchemist.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I expected to see what happened before they got to the second season but no they jsut went into battling aliens and had flashback moments.  It was okay but felt season two where I had came into this series at was quite efficient.
B0040HO16S|5.0|This series will warm your heart. You will fall in love with the characters.<br /><br />Each episode is more or less connected to other episodes, so you can watch them in series, or watch a single episode.<br /><br />Really could not be any better.
B00005JPO1|5.0|Yes Indiana Jones is fantastic in this movie but then you really don't expecti harrison Ford to suck.  Great action<br />great ending almost 20 years late
B000003CM9|4.0|This early Allman Brothers album created a solid foundation for the band. Duane was still alive when this album was recorded. It is my personal opinion that all contemporary blues fans came to that art form through one of three classic rock bands; The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and/or the Allman Brothers. I know that flies in the face of popular mythology but I stand with conviction.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Fun for the whole family.  Do the truffle shuffle!  Four more words required.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Not great but it didn't suck out loud. Cool effects & fighting & Brucw Willis, it just is what it is.
0425263916|5.0|Bared to You was my first Crossfire novel and I enjoyed it so much.  Then, I started reading this book and I thought, &#34;WOW, I like this one even better.  Sylvia Day has now become one of my favorite writers.  She develops individual characters and weaves them into a plot that keeps you enthralled and trying to guess the outcome.  I highly recommend this book to those who prefer to read erotica with a well drawn out plot.
B000066744|5.0|I love this movie, I first saw it on TV and was so happy to be able to purchase it for my own, I have watched it several times I am quit sastified with my purchase, and delivery time
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Must read, excellent book :) I would definitely recommend. Want to read more about the characters. First time reading a Neil Gaiman story and will read more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a much better vesion of temple run..... the games are more fun and you can challenge your friends and family through facebook..... it would however be better if you could interact with friends through email as i have no facebook......
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is addictive but it requires friends to further on the quests and I don't have any that uses this game and it has crashed like five times on my kindle fire I.e. music won't shut off as I am exiting the game. Apart from these faults it is good.
B002QS1O36|5.0|Phenomenal film!! A wonderful version of one of my very favourite musicals. Emmy Rossum's fragile beauty embodies Christine perfectly, and her voice, while possibly a bit pinched in her upper register, is nearly flawless in my opinion and VERY impressive for 17. Gerard Butler gives the Phantom his usual &#34;stranger-danger&#34; creepiness, while injecting romance and a heart-felt love for Christine into his character. And, besides that starnge haircut, Patrick Wilson is wonderful as Raoul (not to mention extremely handsome). There are so many great things about this movie that I can't really sum them all up without having to write a novel! Would not recommend for young children because there are some rather vivid death scenes and a somewhat graphic flashback to the Phantom's childhood. Other than that, sit back and enjoy one of theatre's best-ever romantic musicals!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Afew sections were great brain teasers. Very imaginative.  Kept me busy on a long flight home. Good game, sorry it ended.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New update is horrible!!! I used to love this app so much. It was super accessible and user-friendly; easy to read at a glance; great up-to-date weather info. Now it's a wreck. The new (unasked for) update has totally ruined it. On the main page in the beginning the information is almost always unable to read because it's up against an annoying picture background and the font doesn't show. The locations feature, which was one of my favourite things, has been utterly destroyed. No longer can you see the weather for any other places without a hassle. All of the maps take AGES to load and are of bad quality. And the whole &quot;M-points&quot; thing really ticks me off. Every single time I go on to check the weather it wants me to do stupid things like complete surveys about intrusive and completely weather-unrelated things!! Please get rid of this annoying update and go back to the old, much better, dearly-loved-by-all-users version!!!
6310292196|4.0|That clearly exposes all the different personalities beyond the layers of mannerisms and obsessions with money and marriage.  This is a period film in which false perceptions and mixed motives are not telegraphed in advance.  Good casting allows you to slowly digest the strengths and weaknesses of each character.  It also avoids the common error of dwelling too long on particular scenes or conversations.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I definitely recommend the Deluxe 2 disc package, 2nd disc is full of wonderful RT. Don't wait, get it now.
193700788X|2.0|I was so excited for this book, and it was such a letdown. I really hate to see the series end like this. Oh well.
B00CFA222M|5.0|Really enjoyed Jack the Giant Slayer.  Bought it for my grand kid but was surprised to find we enjoyed it.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Kept cutting off, not able to sit and watch film.<br />Film was not received correctly from amazon .com.<br /><br />I would enjoy watching film instead of it cutting off, booting back up, cutting off etc
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I have a new Smart TV from Samsung and I wanted to test the 3D capabilities.  This 3D DVD has to be one of the best ever produced.  The 3D was excellent, and the content was over the top.  I haven't even looked at the other 2 discs as yet.  Anyone wanting a quality 3D product should definitely add this product to their collection.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Though I enjoyed the book, there were parts not too well thought out. It seemed to skip things and time.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|The most creative and interesting game of solitaire I have ever played. Once you begin playing, you can't stop. Good job big fish.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very enjoyable additive game. I loved every level,  some puzzles are challenging but they make you think,  I'm excited when I get to the next levels
B000O8OTNC|5.0|After trying one of these, I ordered 3 more so I would have one handy just about anywhere I might need it.  I haven't needed the heavy carbide sharpener yet and have only needed to use the fine sharpening ceramic slot.  For a knife that already has a fair edge on it, 8 or 10 swipes in the ceramic slot and it is slicing paper easily.  For the harder stainless steel blades, it takes slightly longer, but the result is the same.  Very convenient.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus,this a great book that all American's should read for a better understanding of what it takes to be a Seal! If more of us had  the attitudes displayed<br />by you and the Seals  you served with, this would be a much better world! This book&#34;had me&#34; from the start....I was with you as you faced unbelievable<br />hardship and refused to give up. I have read many, many books and this is one of the best I have read!!<br /><br />You are a great American Hero!!!!!
0345529057|4.0|This is a review of the physical books themselves not the story. I just recieved the books today and haven't found time to begin reading yet so i'm not qualified to judge the writing yet but if they're anything like the HBO series then the story will be fine. I'm not sure if everyone's box set is like this but my box set cover came with dented corners and 2 really noticably dented corners (looks like it was dropped a few times) The package it came in was reinforced so i'm guessing it isn't amazon's  or UPS's fault but the seller's. Though this isn't too big of an issue with me. Also my second book \\"A Feast For Crows\\" has a little bit of damage to top of the spine but all the other books look in great condition. Like i said i haven't read the books yet so if i read into it and find missing or damaged pages i'll come back a edit this review but for now it's 4/5 stars because of the small damage to the box set cover and book. If you've read all this consider hitting the helpful button if i've helped you decide whether or not to get this box set. Thank you.
B00CHILW64|4.0|This movie proves the value of learning to swim....and holding your breath.  Acutally, an interesting look at a tragic event.  Gives you some feeling for what people went through in the tsunami and the aftermah.
B00BU18U82|5.0|Great game for those with fine motor skills and patience :-)  My son is 5 and LOVES this!  He wants to play it all of the time.  I think it's difficult, but he has figured it out.  He loves plowing the fields, harvesting, selling, and buying more implements for his tractor.  He can't do all of the things the game offers, but it doesn't bother him.  We just skip the market and buying and selling.  I'm sure adults would enjoy this part.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|The story wasn't great, the acting was decent.. but I got scared. Ethan Hawke was the only above average actor.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|I guess you can say that I'm a bit of a Murakami fan girl.  I devour everything Murakami (although I don't necessary like all) and Kafka is my favorite of all his works.  I cannot say that his writing is particularly polished because his plots are often obscure and confusing.  Nonetheless, I always find myself entranced by his work regardless of how seemingly ordinary and passive his main protagonists are.  Kafka is Murakami at his finest.  I would say it is a departure of sorts from the usual Murakami.  The protagonist, Kafka Tamura, is far from the middle aged 30 something jazz type men that Murakami often writes about.  The weird urgency of this novel comes from the preoccupation of internal struggles, one you can imagine as a drama acted out within a single psyche. In each self lies broken pieces that must be put back together.  Lives that are held in suspended animation, stalled and must, by all means be relaunched into the painful but necessary process of change. Reconciling these stories in our minds is a necessity that has been done for humanity since the beginning of time.  Dreams do a good job at simulating this experience for us. But while anyone can tell a story that resembles a dream, it is the rare artist, like Murakami, who can make us feel that we are dreaming it ourselves.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|Not real sure about this book.  I think I was unconfortable reading about someone's reasons for committing suicide.  Not what I would consider a good book.  Stopped reading at over half way through.  Not sure if I will finish.
0307352153|5.0|I feel like the author got inside my head and wrote a book about me. It explained everything from why I had no interest in after school activities as a child to why I've had enough after about an hour at even a good party. I recommended it to my co-workers, friends, and my children. If you are an introvert or are baffled by us, read this book!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This adventurous series is hugely educational and entertaining about a dynamic culture that has been ignored for its impact on cultures and histories from Russia to Turkey and beyond, all the way to the New Worlds shores.  Learning about these people makes me proud of my own heritage,mostly German & Brit with a dab of Irish.
B0030B624E|5.0|Great info to prepare for the zombie apocalypse.Learn the rules and you should survive. Provides a new appreciation for twinkies. Glad the twinkie is alive and well.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Very entertaining and fun to watch. A bit slow in some parts but very much worth watching for the price. Jeremy Irons makes any movie he's in well worth the time and money spent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just in time to make the kids want to go watch the movie even more............... It's fun for all and every one
B009YP9L7U|5.0|For such an inexpensive book, I didn't expect much but thought I would try it anyway.  I am really glad I did.  It was very well-written, with strong main characters amd a great plot.  Wonderful find!  I hope this author does well.<br /><br />HB<br />Colorado
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I have already recommended this book to all of my girlfriends who are either avid readers or have been touched by someone with Alzheimer's or dementia.  It gave me a new perspective, from that of the individual with the disease, and not the caregiver.  I am over fifty, and Alzheimer's runs on both sides of my family.  Most of my friends and work colleagues are presently dealing with their aging parents. This book deals with more than just the disease, but with family dynamics, healing relationships, and what really matters in life.  I plan to read all of her books!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just wondering why I hadn't heard of it earlier. Smart, funny, touching,  and very relevant to real life in many ways.  Great characters all around
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I bought this product after seeing a strong blue tent while recording last year in St. Tomas while scuba diving.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to use! It just snaps on to your go pro hero 3 case.<br />- Corrects color flawlessly and is a must if you plan to go scuba diving!<br />- Is on the outside of the case which allows you to take it off with ease even if the case is submerged in water. (Also can be a con)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Its literally a $30 red peace of thin plastic. It probably cost less than a couple dollars to make. So yes, it is a little expensive for what you are ordering<br />- Potential for air bubbles and dirt to get between the case and the snap on red filter. What happened to me was while scuba diving I held that case above me, and while breathing out of my regulator I believe an air bubble some how got in-between it. This made a little spec in all my video during the dive. Eventually it worked its way out, but there was about 30 minutes of messed up footage.<br /><br />With all of this said, I am still rating this product a 5 out of 5 because it worked as expected and made the video look amazing even from 100 feet below the surface! Typically the videos and photos from that depth are more blue than they should be, and this product reversed that issue by adding red.<br /><br />Edit: Only use this product when going deeper than 15 feet. Its made mainly for diving. That being said, if you were not very deep it will overcompensate for the blue and turn all your video and pictures red.<br /><br />All in all, I would purchase this again and recommend it to any divers who use a Go Pro to record video.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|This is probably my favorite album of the summer. If you enjoy listening to experimental rock music, this is for you.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I did not  enjoy reading this book! The continuity was difficult to follow, particulary the middle section of the story
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so cool!!!! People out there need to play it-  you see I lost my iPod and I have an iPad I can play games on and I downloaded it and it was awesome!!
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Watch the free trailer if you absolutely must see it. Don't waste your time seeing the whole movie. Wow 20 words really. The movie wasn't worth any words.
