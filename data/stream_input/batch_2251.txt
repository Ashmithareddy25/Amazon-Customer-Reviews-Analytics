B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I love Seth MacFarland's movie.  It was cute & funny.  I'm a big fan of all his work & hope he comes out with another movie soon!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This was the first app I bought when I got my Note 2 and I haven't used another keyboard since!
B007REV4YI|5.0|great combo with blu-ray, DVD and digital copy. Loved the movie because of the great action. interesting to see Javier Bardem as a blonde ..
B005I6EVUG|5.0|There is nothing I dont like about this case.  The pattern and color was just like in the picture, the straps hold the kindle snuggly and it does not shift or move. I chose this case because of the pattern and I am very pleased.  I would definately recommend.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Simple,fun,captivating read! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and greatly look forward to more, from this talented author. Completely worth the time!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, because it gives us unspeakable hope, for all of our tomorrows.  There are many things that may happen to each of us, that give us no conclusive explanation.  For me, this book has answered many unanswered questions, that I have asked, and no one else has been able to give a viable explanation.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Temple Run Oz is cool and really fun. The only thing that bothers me about it is that you can't change your character. The game also always takes my coins.  I had 10,563 and it took a lot of them. When I checked, it said I only have 1,687. That's  just my opinion though.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie even though it was AS scarey as we thought it would be. It kept u thinking and has our family interacting with one another as we try to put together the clues in the movie. Worth the $.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game overall i enjoyed playin it through out the whole game. It only takes a few hours to complete. Very good stroy line
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Perfect for reading by the pool or on a rainy day. Nothing too heavy or heart wrenching. Predictable but worth reading.
0547884591|3.0|I can't decide whether I love this book or hate it! I love it because Ferriss is VERY generous with his information and telling you EXACTLY how to do things so they work. His first book, \\"The 4 Hour Work Week,\\" was jammed packed with good ideas as is this book. But...<br /><br />First of all, the book weighs a TON. Good quality paper and binding of over 650 pages makes for a very heavy tome. As an e-book, it might make sense but for cookbooks I will admit to being biased against an e-book format: I need to be able to easily flip back and forth to various parts of a cookbook but that's just me.<br /><br />Secondly, although the title of this book is \\"The 4 Hour Chef\\", the sub-title - \\"The simple path to cooking like a pro, learning anything, and living the good life\\" - says it all: it's really a book about learning anything in the minimum amount of time...which Ferriss admits up-front. The main topic for this book just happens to be cooking...<br /><br />...which leads to my dilemma of whether I love it or hate it. There are useful nuggets of info strewn all over the book about different subjects (swimming, chess, languages, and I love those) but if you haven't put a bookmark in those places, it's almost impossible to find them again (arrgh) - which is the part I hate because they're not in any particular order that makes sense to find them.<br /><br />There are interesting recipes but again they're all over the map: from a simple omelet to turbacon - a turducken stuffed into a medium sized pig!<br /><br />And then there are entire sections that personally I would skip - how to catch a pigeon (!), gut a deer, kill a chicken, etc.<br /><br />Bottom line - I'm sticking with my 3 stars because I don't hate the book but I also don't love it. :)
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I ended up loving it.  Great read with cliffhangrrs at the end of every chapter.  Glad I read because now I cant wait for the movie to come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an addicting and fun game that keeps me coming back. It is very challenging and gets harder as you play. Quick response time is needed.  It keeps you on your toes. Embrace the challenge.

B004XQYBA2|4.0|A good, basic sudoku game. It's easy to use, has nice big numbers and a clear screen. I like it.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I'll try to keep this brief, because my reviews tend to be unnecessarily long and I don't really think that's necessary. I just wanted to share my opinion about the album because it is not only an excellent album but it has changed the way I view Taylor and her music.<br /><br />Until now, I've never been much of a Taylor Swift fan. I liked Love Story and jammed to that for a while when it was new, and I'm sure there are some other songs I could sing along to, but I was never really interested in her music very much. With this album, I find myself being drawn in and becoming obsessed with much of the material in the same way I am with my favorite music. I'm not exactly Taylor's target demographic, either. I'm a 30 year old man and I tend to favor dance, pop and hip hop. Taylor's country flair has never appealed to me but this album is the beginning of something amazing with her sound as she ventures into new musical territory.<br /><br />I started becoming more interested when We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together started getting popular. It's a very catchy song, and that's one thing I'm a sucker for: pop production bliss. I listened to that song at least five times a day for weeks and weeks. Then one night my friend made me listen to I Knew You Were Trouble and 22. At first I was a little skeptical, because it's much more heavy into pop and rock than she's ever done before. But as the days went by and I listened a few more times, I realized that they are great pop songs and that I was loving them more and more every time I heard them. At this point, I started giving the whole album a chance and realized that almost every single song is fantastic on this album. I have a CD player at work (I know, so old school! Where's my iPhone?!) and I burned a copy so I could turn it on and just let it play. I don't find myself skipping any songs, and I even enjoy the ballads -- which says a lot about the quality of the music, because I generally listen to mostly uptempo music.<br /><br />I obsess, I tear up, I laugh, and I see clips of a movie starring Taylor Swift playing in my head... this album is absolutely phenomenal and has made a total Taylor Swift fan out of me! Like other reviews have stated, there's something for everyone here... a little indie pop, a little country, a little rock, and plenty of pop woven in between. I've mentioned to others on their reviews that I think this album showcases some of Taylor's finest work to date, and really highlights her talent with storytelling and songwriting. Plus, if you've ever seen her live performances, you know that voice is real. I'm sure it's smoothed over with a little auto-tune, but she's got a great voice!<br /><br />If you haven't already, give this album a chance! I promise you won't be sorry!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|It's a movie you can enjoy from time to time, again and again, and pass on to the next generation, and next generation...
B00AV68GOA|5.0|If you want to know what happened in the first season of  Downtown Abbey then is a great book to read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I changed phones and didn't know if my paid for version was &quot;transferable&quot;.  I email the developers and for a quick answer.. Happy happy happy.  I don't pay for apps,  but this one was soooooo worth it!  Thank you!
B009AP2G26|5.0|Cute show.....worked well streaming with amazon on demand.  Watched many episodes over two days and it worked flawlessly.  The show has a big heart.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is intellectually challenging and fun.  I highly recommend it.  I saw someone playing the game on the train and knew that it wad an app for me.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie first ..it made the book come alive! But even more the book added so much more depth. Loved it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is such an addicting game!!!!! I cant stop playing it!!! My friend told me about it and we have such a blast creating a plague to kill everyone.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A refreshing take on issues and truths we experience everyday. I encourage all men and women to read and share with others.
B0098460O4|4.0|Excellent young singers - runners up in Britain's Got Talent.  She is 16.  He is 17.  They have an excellent future.
B008QOH1NG|2.0|In my opinion, Stryper should move forward with songs from their new albums.  They have been back long enough now to wear out the greatness of their old songs.  On this video, they seem tired; thus the music is not that great.  Michael Sweet avoids hitting the high notes and rarely belts out those high-energy screams that we really enjoy.  They rely on their &#34;Celebrity&#34; status to carry this product because the quality is not there.  I love Stryper, but they should have prepared a better concert or concert setting where they could have put in at least 100%.
0142420891|5.0|Doesn't happen that often, but I actually liked the sequal better. A very fast paced, touching conclusion to the story.

B009UX2YAC|2.0|Subway Surfers is such a fun game me and my sister are having a bet on who can get all the girls first and so far I'm winning I have 138,495.
1849381178|5.0|I've always been an Oasis fanatic, and being a musician I've learned many Oasis songs over the years.  I've mostly learned them by ear or by watching live footage of Noel playing them.  Rarely have I relied on tab unless that was the absolute last resort.  However, with this songbook, all the chords are spot-on and even mentions the occasional capo or alternate tuning. I'm very pleased with the purchase and this book will always come in handy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a great read for anyone interested in a major recent historical event. The author has a great way out illustrating what it takes to be a SEAL and what sacrifices are made every day by these men. I would highly recommend this book.
B0091Q3254|5.0|Being an Oasis fan, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds is definitely up to par with Noel's legacy. My fiancee and I even drove from Houston, TX to Atlanta, GA to have the experience of seeing NGHFB live and it was well worth the trip. I never had the chance to see Oasis live so this was a very close second. When I read that this DVD was going to be released and have all the extras such as the &#34;Ride the Tiger&#34; video trilogy, and demos for every track from the album plus &#34;The Good Rebel,&#34; &#34;I'd Pick You Every Time,&#34; and &#34;Freaky Teeth,&#34; I knew I had to have it in my collection. My fiancee is also just as huge of a NGHFB and Oasis fan as I am (if not more), so I got this for her for Valentine's Day.  We both watched it that night and enjoyed every second of it. I even had the demo CD in my car for a couple weeks. For any Oasis/NGHFB fan, this is a must-have!
B004JK61K0|5.0|This app lets me delete emails from the server, which the one that came with my Android doesn't do.  For that alone, i give it accolades,  Otherwise, it does its job well, combining all my email accounts in one place, and I have had no bad issues with it at all.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I only got to use this app for about 10 minutes before my BRAND NEW Kindle fire HD 4G LTE began to smoulder and develop a serious hotspot in one corner of the screen (total usage time, about 70 minutes), but it was pretty nifty. It gives the option between full featured and mobile versions of the site, and all of the features for each seemed to be in place and functioning smoothly. I'm not an incredibly avid Facebook user, so there may have been some features or shortcuts that were missing, but everything I use was included and seemed easy enough to access.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I'm not a fan of fractions but this is an easy way to calculate and double check your child's work
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The beginning was tough to watch, very intense and scary. Since I was not really in the mood for \\"that type of movie\\" I considered turning it off. But then some humorous scenes cropped adding a great balance to the movie. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are great,adding lightness but not silliness. (Mr. Goodman, please lose some weight. I am worried about you!)  Good combination thriller, political commentary, with humor thrown in. I recommend it.  Good on you Mr. Affleck.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've been watching Supernatural since season one and I love this show.  I can never wait to see what the next chapter is going to be for Sam and Dean.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|This is kick ass! I enjoyed it immensely! After reading some of the reviews I think people need to differentiate between two things.<br /><br />1. Analog sounds better.  It has to since that's how you hear things in real life. Digital takes the natural analog waveform and takes bits and pieces and compresses it, hence you can carry around thousands of songs right in your pocket.  Convenient? Yup. Sound better? Not. These are physics people.. You can't argue with the waveform.<br /><br />2. Making music collaboratively is better.  Not just better for the music, but also for the people who make it.  They evolve and grow and share and learn. The people get better and hence the music gets better! Round and round...<br /><br />Long live VINYL!!
B007V9N5R8|5.0|I've put off getting a monitor calibration tool for years because like a lot of hobby photographers, I was more interested in acquiring gear (GAS) like camera bodies and lenses.  There's nothing sexy about getting calibration tools.<br /><br />As I progress with my photography, I wanted to get more dialed in on the post production side of things.  Part of that is having accurate colors.  I started looking at the ColorChecker Passport, but found this bundle and pulled the trigger.<br /><br />The ColorMunki Display is super dead simple to set up and use. I really love the ColorChecker Passport because I can create custom color profiles in Lightroom and I can calibrate my Sekonic light meter with it.<br /><br />Great buy!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I ordered a used copy and got it within a week.  In good shape and we have enjoyed it very much.  It has a good story line and is easy to watch over and over with the great grand girl.  She loves it because of the little girl that is in it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|What can I say? This is now my favorite show. I'm just sorry I got on the band-wagon so late.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Again, i ordered a used copy and received it quickly.  good product in original packaging.  We have played this one over and over.  Great grand baby loves the song that is in te special effects and she dances all over the place whenever I play it.  Thanks to Amazing Amazon!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my great nephew pick it out he loves this  .he plays it all the time<br />he cant put it down once he starts
B002RKXO6S|3.0|I gotta say \\"learn to love\\" is my favorite Track on the album. Such a beautiful song that only Bon Jovi and Desmond Child could create.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|thought I was buying a pogo product.  disappointed but I do love playing mahjong - just not well pleased with this version
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|This album seriously needs more DESMOND CHILD.  The songs are catchy but they just dont have the desmond Child touch.  To me, not having Desmond Child is like Elton John not having Bernie Taupin, it just doesnt work. Only one Song co-written by Desmond Child and it is \\"army of one\\" and not a very memorable song either. My favorite songs on this album are \\"Im with you\\", \\"pictures of you\\" and \\"amen\\" and \\"Not running any more\\".  I'm sorry but songs like \\"what about now\\" and \\"Thats what the water made me\\"are tiresome and just plain boring. I love Bon Jovi and I appreciate his optimism in his songs but at times I wish he would write about something else. By the way If you get a chance get the Bonus edition that has the song \\"not running anymore\\" its a really great song.
B008N9AASC|5.0|I just watched it for the first time on a copy I borrowed from my local library. Was so impressed with the imagery and the music that I felt I was in a meditative state. Since I used to work in photography, years ago, and am still keen on meditation on the transience of everything in life, this film was just the kind of unusual experience that I could relate to.<br /><br />Makes you wonder about life patterns and lifestyles. All that rushing traffic, moving endlessly, like ants scurrying to and fro. That display of the chicken warehouse with hens being swept up by this motorized gadget that plowed through the edge of the mass made me think again about even eating poultry, which I do. Then the images of the cows being fed for slaughter, the young piglets suckling on giant sows lying on their sides, hardly able to move! Factory farming! Almost makes you think of the factory efficiency of the concentration camps of the Nazis.<br /><br />And the sight of all those guns being manufactured...the cartridges being mass produced, the family of 3 standing there proudly with their rifles, like people trying so hard to look strong but just looking belligerent(even the daughter with the pink stock).<br /><br />Words weren't necessary. We can all supply our own interpretations.<br /><br />If you're a mature person given to reflection or meditation, don't miss this! But if you're a teen who cares only for the X-Men or the Transformers, don't waste your time, or you'll just come here and moan that \\"it stinks!\\"<br /><br />But I've got to own this one!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Decided to read it due to its popularity, I am glad I read it. This book made me smile, laugh, feel sexual, dream, and even cry. I have been through an emotional rollercoaster and can't wait to start reading book two.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|my grandkids didn't get what to do. actually, neither did I! either i'm dense or this is just boring! will delete it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|There are no instructions or help of any kind to get you started. Just sticks you in the game with blocks to build with and no way to get back to the beginning. Paid and then couldn't play.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|The album is such a great pop album! A must have for pop and music lovers! I will be buy more Xtina albums from now on!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The central character is a young female \\"speed reading\\" consumer of books, who has a lot to learn about the real world. (And, from her principle lover, about how to read.) She happens to work in a low level job in MI5. Comparing this book with LeCarre (\\"Spy books\\") makes about as much sense as comparing the character with Mattie in Lessing's early books. Or dragging in Fowles for nested plot comparisons. This is not a spy book. It is not a self-absorbed study of a young woman. And it is not a clever literary artifice.<br /><br />A better comparison would be with a very expensive and very fine dry sherry. Refined, subtle and perfectly balanced plot lines to be savoured from start to finish.<br /><br />The story has been summarized many times already. I love the way McEwan draws in so many strands of sensibility, disposition, inter personal artifice, and all set so well in and of its time with such sparse writing. He even provides some clues on how we might read his book. Speed read for narrative line and plot, or savour particular phrasing for its poetry - for the underlying emotion and feeling it is meant to convey. The writing is elegant. He is a master of his craft.<br /><br />Life, like this book, is not always how it appears on the surface. We are all spies, in some sense, trying to sneak a peak at what's really going on. The nice thing about this book is that, in the end, McEwan is kind enough to let us in on the mystery(s)
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Inspiring story of this looked-over folk singer.  I love the tunes!!!!  It sounds like an early Dylan album.  I wish I had known his stuff before.
B0017MQIX8|5.0|Just scanned the other reviews. Really not much to add. I've lived with Walcha's Bach Organ Music my entire life and have heard many outstanding alternative players and organs. Walcha is definitive. Don't want to get technical here. Just this: No one carries the musical line more consistently; separates the individual lines on the different registers more cleanly; understands the importance of the space between each note with more profound understanding. His stop choices are unique to Walcha and may seem odd on first hearing, for someone coming from contemporary and/or academic (\\"authentic\\")performances. They grow on one!<br /><br />Two last points. In Germany he is still revered as the great Bach organist. Not \\"romantic\\", not \\"academic\\" - just pure music. And, I guess, it is the essential musicality of his playing that is so affecting.<br /><br />WOnderful!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|&#34;Sugar Man&#34;, &#34;Crucify Your Mind&#34;, &#34;I Wonder&#34;, &#34;Like Janis&#34; and &#34;This Is Not a Song, It's an Outburst&#34; are a few of my favorite Rodriguez songs from this and other albums.  A great addition to any collection that includes Dylan, Janis, and any other influential 60's folk.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|A friend recommended this book, prior to her actually reading it. I read it before she did; and actually sent her a copy. Nonetheless, this book is concise, and straight to the point! The information in this book, is easily applicable to one's everyday life. Check out The Compound Effect!
B002NXSRVG|1.0|There is no excuse for a movie this bad to ever be praised. It's terrible, just like the squeal will be. i would love to sit in the room when someone is pitching this script as a movie just to see who agrees with them. This inst the GI Joe i watched as a kid. Take away the name and the movie would flop, just like Michael Bay and HIS transformers.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wish the movie was as good as the books. I'm holding out hope for the last two! The end

B00B1OWEVC|5.0|As a fully-realized work, this first album by HTDA is as effective as a Reznor project since the colossal 'Downward Spiral'.  It is the apotheosis of sonic elements and approaches Reznor and Co. has been experimenting with for at least the past five years, since 2008's 'Ghosts I-IV'.<br /><br />But, when you call yourself 'How To Destroy Angels' you better be bad-ass or risk looking silly.  So there is enough doom, gloom, and repudiation of religion to fit the bill on this album, so don't you worry.  Reznor & Co. are staying aloof, laying down the advanced electronic approaches of modern 'rock'.  Hiding behind the pixellations and the muffling filters. Cranking out the glitch.  Making mistakes on purpose.<br /><br />The arc of 'Welcome Oblivion' explores big themes: Eternity. Cycles of creation and destruction. Impermanence. The tension between loneliness and introversion. As well as the familiar themes of destruction, apocalypse and hate.<br /><br />Within the familiarity, Reznor & Co. do break new ground.  The song that strays most from Reznor's orthodoxy is 'How long?' which is really the only fully realized 'song' in the pop sense.  It features a bass line that could have been played by Peter Hook. It's a back to the future 80s moment taking us to an alternate reality where Sascha Konietzko replaces Bernard Sumner in New Order. In a sense, this is exactly what he was trying to achieve with his debut album, Pretty Hate Machine.<br /><br />It's this song where the masks come off, or more like around 'Too Late, All Gone'. The album builds up to these tracks and tapers off gradually, and they even announce it in the track 'We Fade Away'.  The gloves are off.  We're seeing the artist staring us in the eyes showing us his tricks.  But we're bitten anyway. It's a series of strings and attractors leading us from one track to another. We find ourselves at the destination with golden ticket in hand, but... sadly the factory is shuttered and Dr. Frankenstein is busy insidereplacing Wonka's brain with drum machine innards.<br /><br />Reznor has always been known to take a sonic scalpel to slice songs to bits, reassemble them and mesh layers of elements like some industrial-pop mad professor. His recent collaborations have proven fruitful as he has loosened his work style to include other perspectives.  The advancement is evident here, as the tracks have a natural flow and mature development.  More organic.  Less exercises of dominance and submission.<br /><br />Reznor has cultivated a strong artistic integrity and thematic consistency that is not moved by fashion. With HTDA he's brought in the closest of collaborators and others who share his vision.  As such, this is a very strong album.  Compare this work to Atoms for Peace's recently released first album, another vision of apocalypse, and a collaborative album by a 90s survivor, and you can hear the difference between amateur-ish wannabe, bleep and bloop artists and true purveyors of fine electronic music.
B007MDB548|5.0|Very good movie for my girls. They are big Tinkerbell fans to begin with, so I knew they would love this one. The 3d is good, if you have the TV/Blu-Ray to play it. You'll never regret buying a Tinkerbell movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its a great app if u have low charge and want to know how much time u have left . i recomend this app
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Heard Radioactive on Pandora and was instantly hooked.  I only bought this a couple weeks ago and can't even tell you how many times I've listened to it.  I would give you song favorites, but it's basically all of them!
B00846REIS|5.0|I am really enjoying this book! I seem an ad that said move over 50 shades! This book does compare!  I have not finished reading it yet, but it does keep you in suspense.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was much better then expected. It's not a silly animated flick, great for kids and grown ups alike. 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book is slow in the first couple of chapters but it speeds up when they get in the game so I would say it was a good book.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I probably started backwards with this author, I read Hopeless first- which is still a book I think about often. Slammed is a good book, great characters, altho I'm not sure the plot is all that believeable- would a mother rreally make the choices that Julia did? Anyway- it's a good read, I'm onto Point of Retreat now...Happy reading!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|All I need - Love it! Handy for everyday needs such as shopping, dining out, etc. and especially when one is on the run.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SUCH A GREAT ENDING TO A,GREAT TRILOGY!  So happy I read them. Love reading  again. A great read. Will dead more of hears
0810993139|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old as her first chapter book and she really enjoys it!! It's cute and funny-perfect just for her!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book left me on edge the entire time, I long for Ana to muster up the strength to tell Grey how she felt sooner. But if course she did not which ultimately left her heartbroken
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The last of the four books. The perfect ending for the saga. The books are way better than the movies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is ridiculously relatable. Well written in letter form and I just can't get over how great it is! Everyone should read this book. It gives hope when u need it most.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is the best game ever! When you get a long run and can go up several levels in a row - without running out of coins - is worth the times when you run out of coins.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoy this clever game. It keeps you guessing and the graphics are great. I enjoy the mood of the game as well. Spooky !
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I loved it in every way.and recommend it to those who love period piece dramas with history thrown in and fine acting with beautiful costumes.
B00846WWVM|3.0|The game is fun and it, and the graphics are smooth.. but I do not like how you move the head of the fire hose. It is hard to get the head to turn 180 degrees which is needed to advance.
B00797MB0O|4.0|I really enjoyed this and especially because I love Charlize Theron as an actress and I love her looks. It made me sad especially seeing how people use drugs alcohol and sex to deaden their feelings to hide from themselves their empty and unlived lives. Also made me realize how a lot of people have no respect for marriage, their own and others and in this day and age it seems to be open season.  Sad lives that people live and also shows that beauty does not bring happiness unless you also have morals and ethics to go along with it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A wonderful script and excellent acting defines this movie.  John Hawkes and Hellen Hunt take a difficult theme and make it come alive.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|This season kept me watching for hours. It's well written, and full of suspense. Can't wait to see the next season.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I waited a while to tackle the Hunger Games trilogy. One, because I tend not to read a trend when it is hot, and two, I wasn't sure I wanted to read a book where everyone dies.<br /><br />Thankfully everyone doesn't die, but go in prepared that no one is safe and people you care about will die. You will be saddened by the deaths while Suzanne's expert hand keeps you turning the pages to find out who is safe and who is not.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Though somewhat implausible, waking up married was a delightfully distracting read. Having been my first exploration of the genre, I was pleasantly surprised at my ensnarement
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is definitely worth having. When you play this make sure you have plenty of time as it is very addicting. It is for all ages and user friendly. You can even connect it to your Facebook account and try to beat friend's high scores.
0143120530|4.0|The book succeeded as a memoir of the author's entry into and successes in the world of memory competitions. I found the historical, psychological, and philosophical asides to be superficial at best and frankly found the conflation of having a robust memory with intelligence cringeworthy. Nonetheless, I found the book to be a fascinating glimpse into the world of self-described mental athletes.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Just pure genius! Amazing music, excellent musicians! Must have in your music collection! Do not compare to PT or Blackfield.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Nice mix of Harry and Haller. It's the inevitable story with them working together. Nice read, predictable ending. I didn't find it quite as good as his stories of them separately, but enjoyable nonetheless.
B007EC27QM|5.0|My tax program has a calculator but disappears once it is used. i keep my Kindle close<br />by to use the Calculator Plus. It works great and is easy to use for all my math issues.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this app, and i find it highly addictive, however, i have this issue where i get it in the store, and its installed, and then it only works for a few hours..then i have to delete it and re-install it, and end up doing this many times, so its a good game, i suggest getting it, but just know that this is likely to happen...
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Fabulous!!! Best movie I've seen in a long time!! Ben Affleck did a marvelous job directing (and acting, as usual).  I'd see it again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A very good twist on an amazing story... I couldn't put it down. Suzanne Collins writes like no other. Great book
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Well thought out story line- has been planned from first season unlike most shows that &#34;wing it&#34; as they go along.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|A clever movie full of heart and soul! A must-see for everyone! I love the homages to classic horror flicks which makes it all the more fun to watch.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very good, would be a bit better if worked off line as well though. However, it is still a good download.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|I love all of this man's movies. What a HOOT! Sure it's a little slapstick sometimes but it fun and makes you laugh. With this character you're never disapointed. Fun for everyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's super fun and awesome but the new update is weird because I don't know how to get it. I really want the update but I don't know how to get it
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I just reread Canada by Richard Ford and was intrigued by the subtle masterwork of the novel.  The novel, whose iconic first sentence is too well known to repeat, is all about crossing borders: from societally accepted 'right' to 'wrong', from ordinary normalcy to extraordinary low key insanity.  Then we have our narrator crossing the border to Canada, which seems the same, but is so different. We see Dell Parsons, a 15-year-old crossing from adolescent to adulthood and we see the lines that tie him and his twin sister and those that separate them for a life time. This is a poignant examination of what is normal and what one can no longer accept as normal. It is a discussion on how to live and what we can live with, in order to survive. As for the plot - spoiler alert - you'll have to read the novel. This is one that will have you asking yourself questions - taking your own pulse - not a bad thing to do once in a while!
B0080M3OGW|5.0|real live of a real people. good acting. DE Niro very young and Meryl Streep is beautiful. really good movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|sweet game just wish gems were easier to acquire.  would like to see more items to purchase such as a pony or different saddlery.  also would like it more if items didn't cost so much....the expense takes the innocence out of the game for the little horse lover
B003JYOFIW|4.0|.....O.K. thumbnail version.....<br />If you like post Ohio Devo this cd is as good as any.Some good (What We Do...Step Up) & some weak ones.My one gripe is that its short,and the \\"Bonus\\" tracks should have been included on the cd(trust me, I bought the mp3's)<br />Still, no matter what it's good to have the Spud Boys back in action at a time when it seems Devolution is not so ironic anymore.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is great! It is a great time waster and its free! I think it is one of the best games I've ever played. The only thing is you have to get used to the controls but after that it is really really fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows available in recent history, my opinion.<br />I can't wait to watch new episodes every week. The characters are well developed and plots are interesting.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love the game and easy enough for my kids to play. just wish kindle version updated along with ipod version...the kids get sad that they can't trade for gems or go on quests like mom...good fun!
B003W77TPC|5.0|I first came across this musical gem while in college at Tulane University in New Orleans in the early 1960s. I bought and still have the 33rpm vinyl disc. I also have the cassette version and now fully enjoy the CD version and have added this to Google's My Play to listen via my Droid phone.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|It is a very short read but full of love, loss, and family!  It's definitely worth the read!  I really enjoyed it and wanted to know Mia's decision.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|This is a very, VERY SLOW-Moving picture!  It does, of course, provide still another medium for Depp's extraordinary versatility.<br />(Joline could have been a cardboard poster, as &#34;looks&#34; are her only attribute).<br />It does sort of twist & turn in a lower-version of a Hitchcock story.<br />It was ok, but doubt I'd see it again.
B0091MW50G|3.0|great sample of Verdi opera&#34;s but need to pay much higher price to get the complete works.  still a good value,
0547564651|5.0|I am a member of our community school district's school board and this book has changed my understanding and perspective on the work still needed by our community to assure each child's potential.  This is not a &#34;how to&#34; book for local school district governance; it is a &#34;you should know this before you consider any programs, policies or other questions regarding education, children and cognitive learning&#34;.  This is without question a seminal piece of work that should be required reading for all persons considering parenthood or finding themselves compelled into such a state.  I someday hope to meet Mr. Tough in person and thank him personally for this endeavor.  I am running for re-election to my local school board and this book has not only inspired me to serve my community better, but to endeavor to provide each child in the district the opportunity to learn and grow to their full potential.  I'd give this book 10 stars if possible.
B004BSFC6Y|4.0|I really liked these socks but they were very tight on my grandson's legs and feet. When he could no longer wear them we put them on his stuffed toy.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I don't know how anyone can say this is a fun game. It takes gold (that you have to purchase) to do anything.<br />Unless you want to wait 7-8 HOURS for each step which is irritating then be my guest. They are trying to get money out of you. Same deal with every game created by this company but this is the most irritating one.<br /><br />Basically after twenty minutes this is what you have to do if you don't want to spend your paycheck on this game. You hit a wall right away..<br />1 sign in before you go to work or school to put an egg in the nest or breed ( it takes eight hours to do anything, even to expand a lousy inch).<br /><br />Sign back on when you get home and then to go forward a step. After you feed your dragons, if you want to evolve them to make them bigger, expand or breed again, do this before you go to bed, its another huge wait. Even for new buildings or food same deal,... huge wait.<br />They want you to purchase gold for every step. This is not a game, it's a scam.<br /><br />I would rather purchase a game like the old days and really PLAY<br /><br />Your kids are going to end up begging you for money every single day.
1451695195|4.0|I've always been fascinated by tales of Near Death Experiences (NDE).  I suppose this and a natural curiosity is what drew me to `Proof of Heaven' by Dr. Eben Alexander.<br /><br />The author is a neurosurgeon and also the victim of an extraordinarily rare spontaneous e. coli infection that nearly killed him.  `Proof of Heaven' is his cathartic missive that chronicles what he encountered as he lay comatose and near death for a week.<br /><br />This is an interesting story particularly because of the scientific background of the author.  Who, by his own admission, had a very difficult time in the belief of a God or life after death.  His NDE was transformational.<br /><br />First, there is the fact that Dr. Alexander is regarded in the scientific literature as a medical miracle. Given the severity of his illness the chances of his simple survival were slim to none.  Were he to survive the anticipated outcome was life in a persistent vegetative state. However, he not only survived but against all odds made a seemingly full recovery.<br /><br />While in coma, the author was present in body only. One that remained unresponsive as the e. coli ate away at his neo-cortex.  However, outside of the spacial-temporal world that defines material consciousness, Dr. Alexander was on the journey of his life.  By his account he traveled beyond an earthly existence to a place better defined by levels of increasing spiritual awareness and enlightenment. Unconditional love was at the core of this state-of-being.<br /><br />This physician, against years of academic and clinic training and application of scientific method now believes that true health can only be achieved when one realizes that God and the soul are real.  Too, death is not an end of personal existence, but rather a transition.<br /><br />This is a story that is difficult to ignore and a book I would highly recommend for those with even a cursory interest in the subject matter.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Great at first, then they update the game to add dinosaurs and its a freaking mess. Will not open or load half the time now.<br />Don't purchase any coins or dollars, it erases your progress unlike others.<br />Also noticing glitches, not getting my experience after completing tasks.<br /><br />Hello game designers.. how about a patch now genius?
B008OOYALE|5.0|K? I luff dis game. Neatest game but its hard to lvl. up. Great and lvl@&amp;?!- th gvyvh. hgvhb hghcg h.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book, and I bought this first.  You should read this first.  And then, her book, The Magic, and then, The Power.  In that order.  Say what you will, but if you are a person that believes in karma and being good to the world and that will come back to you, this is along those lines.  This has changed my life.  It's just so good for any one, if you let it and if you believe in it.  Now I understand why my Grandpa always said, &#34;count your blessings&#34; or &#34;be thankful for what you have&#34;.  All of this falls under this book and its practices.  I am so glad I discovered Rhonda and her books.  It taught me to be thankful for what I have, truly grateful and stop and look at what good things are right here, for me.  While some information may be things you probably already knew, it's an awesome reminder and exercise to point it out again, and make you stop and think, and live by it.  Eternally grateful for this.
B002GAR3AM|5.0|All the videos worked with out any problem. I really Love the accessibility. I give it a five star rating!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. I read the 50 shades books and I feel like this was more down to earth and I could relate better. I did not realize however when I first started reading it that it was a series though and I'm waiting for the next one to come out.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Had no inkling of what this movie was about but really enjoyed this true life story and the music. Left me with a smile and a warm feeling.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This app is Very entertaining. i play this all the time.  I highly recommend this game !  Easy to play and understand.  Good graphics.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I think any new series takes time to get its groove on but once it does, it really does.  The cases are great, multi-layered and the cast fits like hand in glove.  A great series.  I hope it goes on and on and on!
B008476HBM|5.0|Who cannot fall in love with such an innocent story. Only the dullest of us all. Time never fades Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. They will forever be.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Any of the cast albums of the musical are better, but this was a gift for a person who only wanted the movie version.  Very few of the voices can hold a candle to the voices on the various cast albums.  And one of the most important songs was left out.<br /><br />AJ
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and challenging. Why is there 1 stars? Oh I don't know probably some people are stupid enough to even try the game. And it's free!!! I gave it 5 stars but I wish there were 100 $tars
B008I3RARW|4.0|It looks ok. I had to change the control to buttons because the tilting didn't feel right. Other than that, it's a racing game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This a good game which is enjoyable for a variety of age groups<br />It is worth downloading it you should definitely download it as it is fun and is good to spend some time on
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I really love this app.  The graphics are great and so colorful.  The reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because, although I was able to download it on my Kindle Fire HD, I was not able to download it to my daughter's Kindle Fire.  Amazon needs to fix this problem.  Why should you need the newer HD version of Kindle to enjoy this really fun app.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I think this dictionary is the best thing that was ever invented. You can find all the words you need to find in this dictionary.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|This book began well, but about halfway in I found myself sincerely disliking Lena.  She came across as so self absorbed and selfish.  She lied to Ethan, kept secrets, and in general had a self loathing pity party.  She was so busy worrying about hurting Ethan in the future that she couldn't see the damage she was causing in the present.  After a while, it was actually kind of annoying.  I'll try not to spoil it, but I was disappointed in the ending.  I am so done with this self involved character that I probably won't finish the series.  I just can't get past her actions.  I'm so frustrated with her that I don't even care how it ends because in order find out what happens to Ethan, Liv, Ridley, and Link I will have to read about her.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I really enjoyed it - would highly recommend it.  I hadn't heard much about it, but it was very entertaining.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|So let me just go on record saying the movie itself is excellent. It has a great storyline and good cast. However I bought this product from Go Hastings and the quality was awful. I don't understand why anyone would sell a movie that is all scratched and doesn't even play properly. Ultimately, the movie is worth buying, just be careful who you buy it from. :(
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|In this final book of the trilogy there are several twists that make the story carry on.  The psychological impact of the story portrays the struggle when forced into unwanted situations.  the ending shows the long lasting effects of trauma.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was never a Batman fan until these movies came out. I already owned Dark Knight. When I saw what a great price this was and it came with preorder price guarantee I knew I needed to grab it. I recommend it to any Batman fan!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|interesting story.  makes you want to keep reading. blends action with the deeper emotional aspects of being forced into this kind of situation.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love the game I'm addicted lol it helps kill time and I love the challenges it has, I got my mom hooked too. lol
B00BHMF578|3.0|movie falls flat. I think the writers were trying for intense concentration throughout, but instead of being on the edge of my seat I was on the edge of boredom. Would recommend it for the historical value...seems pretty honest about its factual accuracy. It paints Iranians as strange and fanatic people--which of course, they are.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book to be frustrating to read because the storyline was weak and it was poorly written. I felt like I was reading a teenager's diary.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|terrible application.  I use lInkedin all the time on a PC and the functionality of the mobile app is a fraction of what is available. It is a waste of time to use this version
B00006AW2J|5.0|If you do not have this in you collection ,,,, you should.  At the time of the recording were some of the best<br />time for the Rolling Stones.  Buy it and enjoy as much as I do.
B00425S1H8|4.0|No comments it worked like it was supposed tl work i do not have any thing else to say about it
B00BP29SAA|5.0|So far, my soon to be five year old son has liked the Dr.Panda apps the best since we got our Kindle Fire in December! I have tested so many apps for him and these take the cake! He loves the &quot;so&quot; cute animal characters and truly enjoys the great learning mini games. I will buy him every new Dr.Panda app that becomes accessible because these are the types of apps I want my son playing and he absolutely loved to play them! Thanks for another great app! All young children apps should follow your example when making apps. Characters, graphics, gameplay: it's all perfect!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Ok. So here's the deal. Yep, still a great movie. And yep, the 3D looks good too. The only down side is that there are ZERO special features. So if you're torn between the 3D version and the DVD version that's all pumped full of special features and extra scenes and what not, just know that the 2012 3D blu-ray has nothing extra. It's just the movie (oh... and some sort of PSA in the settings menue that I didn't bother to watch...).
B000000W9Z|5.0|The art-ritual murder of Baby Grace Blue<br />The Nathan Adler Diaries: A hyper cycle - a non-linear Gothic Drama<br /><br />1 Leon Takes Us Outside<br />And he counts down the dates, March, October, January, October 13th, Wednesday, Martin Luther King Day, afternoon... reading from his detective's log book. The stage is set, we have come upon a mystery of epic proportions, and we are immediately drawn in by the weirdness of it all.<br /><br />2 Outside<br />Now. Not tomorrow, it's happening now. The crazed in the hot-zone. The mental and diva's hands. The feasting of life. Punishing, unyielding. The rock here is hard, unforgiving. Industrial rock, machined by hand.<br /><br />3 The Hearts Filthy Lesson<br /> Sitting in the Laugh Motel. With her hundred miles to hell. Oh, Ramona - if there was only something between us. Other than our clothes. As this album is being smashed into your head, it is clear now, that is going to be rough, gritty, dirty, and unwashed.<br /><br />4 A Small Plot Of Land<br /> Poor dunce. He's less than within us. The brains talk. But the will to live is dead. It is getting weirder now, with odd musical arrangements, psychotic piano, drums breaking out on their own. Nothing commercial here.<br /><br />5 Segue - Baby Grace<br />Test, testing, testing<br />This, hmmm, Grace is my name<br />And and I was...um...<br />It was that phot... a fading photograph of<br />A patch, a patchwork quilt.<br />And they've put me on these<br />Ramona put me on these interest drugs<br />So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain hatch<br />And, ah, they won't let me see anybody<br />If I want to sometimes and I ask<br />I can still hear some pop...popular musics<br />And aftershocks. (Ahhh-choo)<br />See I've been watching a television of, um... in the homelands<br />That's the new homelands and, um, that's all I can remember<br />And now they just want me to be quiet<br />And I think something is going to be horrid<br /><br />6 Hallo Spaceboy<br />Spaceboy, you're sleepy now, don't you want to be free? This chaos is killing me. Bye bye love.<br />This is the song that brought Bowie back into prominence as an artist. And it kicks butt. Brutal power among a sea of brutal songs.<br /><br />7 The Motel<br />A sort of peace sets in for once. A safety zone for those trying to stay afloat amid the turmoil. It's not Eden, but it's no sham. There is no hell like an old Hell. And it's lights out boys. The calm does not last, as the voice becomes frantic, guitars blast, drums roll, all is exposed.<br /><br />8 I Have Not Been To Oxford Town<br />The prison priest are decent. My attorney seems sincere. I fear my days are numbered. Lord get me out of here. If I had not met Ramona. If I had only paid my bill. This is my bunk with two sheets. This is my food though fowl. Toll the bell. Pay the private eye. Perhaps Ramona's prison is in Oxford?<br /><br />9 No Control<br />Sit tight in your corner. Stay away from the future. Don't tell God your plans. It's all deranged. No control. Dense layers of music define the everyday life of Ramona's inmates.<br /><br />10 Segue- Algeria Touchshriek<br />My name is Mr. Touchshriek<br />Of Touchshriek, Mail Order and Fantasy<br />My shop sells egg shells off the she sores<br />And empty females<br /><br />I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop<br />To a Mr. Walloff Domburg<br />A reject from the world wide internet<br />He's a broken man, I'm also a broken man<br /><br />It would be nice to have company<br />We could have great conversations<br />Lookin' through windows for demons<br />Watchin' the young advance in all electric<br /><br />Some of the houses 'round here still have inhabitants in them<br />I'm not sure if they're from this country or not<br />I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing<br />If I had another broken man, oh, I dream of something like that<br /><br />11 The Voyeur Of Utter destruction<br />The screw, is a tightening atrocity. I shake, forthe reeking flesh, is as romantic as hell. This rock is pumping, spewing out fast guitar and piano, one of his best.<br /><br />12 Segue - Ramona A Stone<br />I was Ramona A Stone<br />I started with no enemies of my own<br />I was an Are Teast!<br />In a tunnel<br />But I've been having a midi life crisis<br />And I've been dreaming of sleep<br />And ape man with metal parts<br />I've spat upon deeply felt age<br />I've put my heart's in<br />And I hate the honey colored English<br />We'll creep together you and I<br />For I know who the small friends are<br />I am with name<br /><br />13 Wishful Beginnings<br />We had such wishful beginnings, but we lived unbearable lives. Things slow down a whole lot here. I am not even sure why this track made the album, as musically it does nothing. And with the album clocking in at 70 minutes it seems unnecessary.<br /><br />14 We Prick You<br />Per Bowie, P = F. I'd rather be inside you. I want to be screwing when the nightmare comes. I want to come quick then die. Where have all the flowers gone? Even if you disagree, mutual respect. Tell the truth.

The clutch of life and the fist of love, over your head. Like David Lynch on a Lost Highway, this one is out there. Some of these songs bear out the \\"hyper cycle\\" idea, and this is one of them.

B000JMKTLO|3.0|Fairly predictable, not an extreme page turner. Did like that it was pretty straightforward and the main character wasn't a &#34;all around good person&#34; so she was a lot more relatable.

B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Right after I bought the Kindle Fire HD, I asked myself if this device  has a camera function since it only has a front camera for skype. Through a customer's review online, I learned that I should need to download the ES Files app in order to get the camera function. I did it and was able to take pictures; the picture, of course, was successfully taken on what's in front of the device's screen only. Recently I happened to spot the myCamera HD app on Amazone store online and downloaded it. So awesome, not only can it take pictures , it also takes video in high quality, as well. At least it  gives you chances to record some freshly inspired moments of yourself, your loved ones and the natural surrounding in front of the device's screen. That's why I truly love it.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Still photographer Bert Stern is perhaps best known for Smirnoff ads, Marilyn Monroe nude shots and the iconic poster from Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film, \\"Lolita.\\"  This his one and only movie, co-directed by Aram Avakian, has landed a place in the National Film Registery.  In 1958, the Newport Jazz Festival was still in its infancy and coincided with the trials for The Americas Cup sailing race.<br /><br />Stern had thought about making a traditional film but gave up early on for lack of a story.  Instead he turned to a documentary featuring the musicians, but perhaps more importantly, the audience.  He presents full length songs performed by the best known musicians at the time all in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Mostly jazz but interestingly enough, two non-jazz greats make perhaps the biggest impact.  More on than in a minute.<br /><br />What makes this film more than a straight music concert or a traditional documentary with bits and pieces of music is how Stern and his editor weave back and forth between the performers and the audience.  The audience is always in synch with the right song, even flubbing the lyrics as we are all prone to do.  The audience is mostly wealthy white people but there is a large contingent of black folk sprinkled throughout the flock.  All seems good with the world.  While it's pre-Civil Rights 1958, its Rhode Island not Alabama.<br /><br />The music is excellent but it was a bit shocking to see a youngish Chuck Berry duckwalking across the stage singing \\"Sweet Little 16\\" in front of a traditional jazz band, all of whom were smiling with surprise.  Even though a couple audience members seemed befuddled, most were having a great time, especially the younger members in the crowd.  Rock `n roll was here to stay.<br /><br />The other surprise was the great gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who like Berry was a little out of place, but brought the house down with a trio of songs to end the show.  This little movie is a gem.<br /><br />Here is a list of performers:<br /><br />Jimmy Giuffre 3: Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim Hall<br />Thelonious Monk Trio: Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Roy Haynes<br />Sonny Stitt and Sal Salvador<br />Anita O'Day<br />George Shearing<br />Dinah Washington<br />Gerry Mulligan Quartet with Art Farmer<br />Big Maybelle<br />Chuck Berry<br />Chico Hamilton Quintet<br />Louis Armstrong and his All-Stars: Trummy Young, Danny Barcelona, and Jack Teagarden<br />Mahalia Jacksonperformers:<br /><br />Jimmy Giuffre 3: Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim Hall<br />Thelonious Monk Trio: Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Roy Haynes<br />Sonny Stitt and Sal Salvador<br />Anita O'Day<br />George Shearing<br />Dinah Washington<br />Gerry Mulligan Quartet with Art Farmer<br />Big Maybelle<br />Chuck Berry<br />Chico Hamilton Quintet<br />Louis Armstrong and his All-Stars: Trummy Young, Danny Barcelona, and Jack Teagarden<br />Mahalia Jackson

0385536828|5.0|Ian McEwan's prose is effortless, silky. He can get a big story up and running as easily as flipping a switch. He moves from big picture to small detail seamlessly.<br /><br />I listened to \\"Sweet Tooth\\" on audio CD, narrated by Juliet Stevenson. Stevenson's reading is terrific and gives even more atmosphere to a series of terribly British scenes. And since McEwan is writing across gender--all of \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is told from first-person female point of view--Stevenson makes this story delectable<br /><br />In \\"Sweet Tooth,\\" McEwan put us inside the head of one Serena Frome, a speed-reading fan of both pulp fiction and challenging literature. We're in the late 1960's and early 1970's and Serena is drawn or sucked or seduced into the world of British Security Service.<br /><br />We follow Frome quickly through her youth and she is a bit of a drifter, not exactly in charge of her life. The second half of \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is a just a bit protracted--will she or won't she reveal to the fish on her hook that she is not what she appears to be? There is much wine drinking and love-making and maneuvering and pondering and wondering and then we reach the moment, a moment foreshadowed in the opening sentence, when all comes unraveled and all that's left to find out is who knew what. And when. For me, the stakes weren't very high. Since Frome has told us the outcome, the only question, really, is the \\"how.\\"<br /><br />The ending is one of the best stories-within-a-story endings I've read in a book in a long time. Neat, deft, sure. Tidy. \\"Sweet Tooth\\" hits the spot.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the computer version and I thought this would be a cheap knockoff. I was so wrong! I can go all day building things!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this on a whim, not really knowing anything about it. I was just looking for a change of pace from a really long series I'd bee trudging through, and this turned up on a suggested reading list. It sounded good, so I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm very glad I did. What stands out to me most is how well executed the book is. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the story, it had me on edge and reading more chapters than I'd ever intended to in most sittings just to see what would happen next. However the precise wording, the excellent use of prose, the execution of the wordcraft itself really struck me throughout as a breath of fresh air. That doesn't mean academic, stuffy, or pretentious. In fact, it was filled with lots of colorful vernacular, but it was done so very precisely and very appropriately. As this was my fist taste of this author's work, I really found it a welcome aspect and something to look forward to as I explore his writing further.<br /><br />The plot was fascinating, at first a little abrupt to be dropped into, with my head trying to make connections. Was this the real world, was this the past, was this the future. I think another nice compliment to the author was that I had to stop myself occasionally and remind myself that this was a relatively contemporary piece. A nice part of legendary writing that spans the test of time, is that there's rarely a lot of dated references that would tell you exactly when it was written. This could have been written yesterday or fifty years ago.<br /><br />The book deals with a society that's completely self-contained. Presumably, the only survivors of some global cataclysm are now living in a sealed silo deep underground, the world outside a ravaged, toxic wasteland. They've been this way for hundreds of years, and the sense of societal isolation, coupled with the necessary little quirks of societal evolution that would take place are so well done, it really ads such a layer of verisimilitude. This isn't just a book that transplants people underground, we come to this place after there have been hundreds of years for people to get used to such a lifestyle. Religion, philosophy, the economy, resource management, population, breeding, all the little ticks that make society work are present but have become modified to make such a lifestyle work. These little touches of detail really made the book shine, in my opinion. Anyone can write a book about something happening to people in an extraordinary environment, but to make that environment live and breathe on its own is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />There's lots of moral ambiguity as things start to unravel. Is the bad guy really so bad, is making sacrifices for the good of the community, when the community really represents the last vestiges of the human race such a bad thing? At what cost truth, is a strong theme throughout and also at what price truth. A lot of questions are answered, but a lot more are opened up here, and the first thing I did when closing this book was to purchase the Shift Omnibus, if that's any indication.<br /><br />I came to this book with very middling expectations, and just was looking for a diversionary piece of escapist literature, but what I've found might be a series that sticks with me for a good long time to come.isn't just a book that transplants people underground, we come to this place after there have been hundreds of years for people to get used to such a lifestyle.

B00BF2RTO2|1.0|I am sure this is another great item coming from Iron Maiden. But, c'mon boys stop bleeding our wallets (your fans).Seriously where do you draw the line. How many of these have they put out now? I'm sure this one is of better quality has more songs, is from some concert you or  I may have been to, better production , re-mastered, dolby sound, bonus dvd, yada,  yada , yada. Seriously, what is the count for a release similar to this? By that I mean not a new studio release, (not re-mastered) ? C'mon give me a count. Since Amazon asked me  to review this after I foolishly pre-ordered, this is my review. Wallet bled
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. i enjoy the great picture. the horses are life like and fun to play with. i would have given it 5 stars but it has been freezing a lot when
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|As the headline states, the graphics are very nice, the music is, at times, serene, and the &#34;get bigger to eat bigger things&#34; mechanic is interesting. At first, your goal is to hunt out lifeforms smaller than and absorb them, in order to then absorb the larger ones. Movement is accomplished by ejecting mass, so getting from point A to point B adds a puzzle element because you need to make sure that you're still bigger than your target when you arrive to absorb it.<br /><br />The problem that later arrives is this mechanic doesn't hold up for the game's 72 levels. While it tries to throw in elements such as gravity and absorbing other &#34;smart&#34; beings to keep things fresh, it still involves the same thing: absorb something smaller to get bigger. Rinse and repeat. Later levels often turn into a race, requiring some trial-and-error in order to plot the perfect path just so you don't fall behind... and even if you are doing perfectly, one small mistake is all it takes for an instant death.
B009178OQA|3.0|I really liked the movie but didn't rate it higher because it is not a movie that most people are likely to see.  I love sushi and would love to eat at this restaurant; you can get sushi where I live but I don't believe it's made by real sushi chefs.  I also took a class in sushi but would not attempt to make it unless you are near a really good fish market

This does not mean that the CableJive adapter is defective - it could be that the Sony Boombox is trying to communicate with an Apple device on the other end, and not finding it.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|If you saw this at the theater,as we did, you'll still want to buy this.  Having the BluRay is so nice to complete our collection of this series starring Christian Bale.

B006QPX7UI|3.0|This meticulous reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, made I suspect with the help of numerous members of that counterculture of obsessive history buffs known as Civil War reenactors, is very educational because of its painstaking recreation of this complex battle. If you are thinking of watching this movie, you have to reset your expectations and forget about seeing a good movie in any conventional sense. The acting is stiff, the production values are middling at best, the dialogue often clumsy (and sometimes laughably so). There is little in the way of dramatic tension, pacing, or artistry in the direction and editing. Martin Sheen is a dud as Robert E. Lee.  I don't know what Robert E. Lee was really like, but I wasn't buying what Martin was selling.  And the movie is excrutiatingly long and slow. But I watched it before visiting Gettysburg and found it pretty educational.  I got the sense that it is pretty accurate, which is certainly a rarity for movies based on historical events.

B00846WWVM|2.0|Liked the graphics and the concept but it becomes very difficult quickly.  Takes the fun right out of it.  Controls don't help the game either; for the limited amount of time you have to solve the puzzle you waste too much time attempting to aim.<br />If you want to kill 5 minutes then it's OK.  I already removed it.
1451695195|4.0|Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife by Eben Alexander III, M.D., we are invited to listen to the journey of a highly regarded doctor's near death experience (NDE) during a seven day coma from a very rare illness. He paints a very detailed landscape of a world of complete awareness in an atmosphere of love in the company of God, or as he refers to as OM. Words are not necessary and knowledge is simply present, no need to reach for it.<br /><br />I have always been fascinated by the thought of NDE, Heaven, reincarnation, and where we travel to beyond our dreams. This book certainly spark my imagination and reaffirmed my belief that there is far more to life that what we see in front of us. Clearly, Dr. Alexander's intellectual foundation was shaken and his eyes were opened to a new horizon.<br /><br />There are some reviews of this book that criticize it for not actually proving that Heaven exists. I don't know that was the doctor's intention; I believe he simply wanted to share his profound experience to connect with others and open up our thoughts to new ideas. The proof was for him, the opportunity for self inquiry is for the reader.
B000P0J09M|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie.  Couldn't ask for a better cast.  If you like action films, this should be on your top 10 list.
1451627297|5.0|I really liked this story. Granted, I haven't read many of the SK books from about mid-2000's. I have always been a little obsessed with JFK, also, so this book was especially interesting to me. I like the exploration of time travel and fighting \\"fate\\". As usual King style, there is a part of the story that gets a little hard to stay interested while the character explores or King familiarizes the reader with the situation or back story. But once the story gets going, as usual, it was really hard to put the bookmark in and go to sleep each night. Almost like a yearning to know what will happen next.<br /><br />Still love King, even through the duds. But this book is not a dud. I am now looking for Under the Dome...gotta read it before it is a tv mini-series this summer!!

I lost my original 3ds  and I bought a new one the xl but I needed that CPP for re: revelations and the upcoming monster hunter 3 ultimate. Anyway it works great with my NA region 3ds xl, no problems what so ever if you have the original CPP then its the same thing just bigger and if you don't its real easy to setup and use.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|Kurt Russell plays a stunt man named Mike who gets his thrills by violently killing young women with his car. This car is \\"death proof\\" if you're sitting in the driver's seat, and allows the stunt man to mow down his victims without mortally wounding himself.<br /><br />Death Proof contains some great writing and some great twists, but it's weighed down by Mr. Tarantino's excessive self indulgence in dialog and foot shots. The movie would have benefited greatly by cutting down on the chatter and focusing on driving the plot forward. And while I'm indifferent to feet, there are so many shots that focus on them that its distracting. When Stunt Man Mike licks his hand and touches one of the girl's feet, I couldn't help but think of Mr. Tarantino's fetish - I shouldn't be thinking about that while watching a movie.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, the twist and change in tone that happens in the middle of the movie is brilliant. It shakes you awake and takes you totally by surprise. Unfortunately the movie slows down again and you're left rather bored until the last 15 minutes.<br /><br />Overall I cannot recommend this movie to non-Tarantino fans. The slow parts are too slow, and the good parts are too brief. Had around 20 minutes of dialog been cut and had the chatter focused more on driving the plot forward, this movie  could have been up there with Jackie Brown or Kill Bill, but as it is, it's a flawed work with some great moments. If you're a Tarantino fan this is worth a watch, but everyone else should look to other areas of his filmography first.

B001KT6JPA|4.0|not as amazing as Silence of the Lambs, but still a great movie to watch. Have to admit, I like the movie's ending over the book's ending. Highly recommended, as well as the other Hannibal films.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The amazing characters of Downton Abbey continue to develop and grow.  I love the addition of Shirley MacLaine to the cast and am looking forward to seeing more of her in Season 4.  This season does an excellent job of bringing closure to many things and just when you think that the luck is turning around at Downton, the final episode of the season leaves you wondering what will happen next.
B007VYDFMS|3.0|The documentary seemed a bit one-dimensional of Marley.  So much praise and not a lot of depth.  The filmmaker should not crucify Bob Marley but there should have been more critical analysis of his role as father, philanderer, and how he navigated Rastafarianism personally and not simply politically.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Colin Firth does an amazing job and the other actors are also topnotch. The little known story is also very touching.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game. My first time playing it  but so far I can`t wait to play again. A real fun game.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|This is NOT a two-star app. I would give it 5 stars, but the Kindle Fire version is a mess! It's missing a button to allow me to submit the new characters I have proposed. I stumped the genie twice and couldn't submit any information. The text is too small and the speech bubble is too big, and it crashed twice when I messed with the appearance settings. Amazing app, but set it up properly for the Fire!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|One of the best hard science and engineering books I have ever read!<br />Very enjoyable and well told.<br />Great storyline and characters!
B00797MB0O|4.0|Charlize did a fanstastic job acting, IMHO.  The story flowed well and I appreciated the honesty while cruel and selfish perspective of the cool girls.  The filming was well done, no exruciating pointless slow scenes..kept me interested.  This movie is not a politically correct, everyone wins type of movie...it is real life.  It shows the merits of the both sides of life, the cool, glamorous hip crowd, the steady grounded, the unnoticed human beings forgotten in the shadows....I am hard to please...and this was worth watching..no regrets.<br /><br />I saw the bad reviews and all I can think is that people are not basing their reviews on the story but how they felt to be part of that uncool ordinary crowd.  I am not saying that I was part of the cool crowd, I am saying this is an honest movie with great acting, creating a character, you love to hate and hope something bad happens to her.  The fact that she goes on to live her live must have disappointed some but this is real life people.  It also shows how everyone has their own definition for happiness...also that being cool is not really being truly happy.<br /><br />Great intelligent movie.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Unlike Girl Gone I wasn't hooked immediately.  It wasn't until about half way that I decided I needed to know more.  Gillian Flynn is a genius.  I plan to read her other books.

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|There are experiments to do at the end of each chapter. I wanted to give the experiments my all but I couldn't put the book down. So, I cannot report on the experiments just yet.<br />The book was easy to read. The stories told kept me engaged and that isn't easy to do...I lose interst in most books before I'm half way through. I would recommend this book because if we all had this understanding of the world around us we might take a little better care at how we use our energy.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I loved this book just as much as the first. I did find myself getting a little bored in the middle but it completely turned around in the end where I couldn't put it down!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good time waster... Good for horse lover's. A mindless game, you don't have to think much to play it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this was a terrific book and written with all the style that only Stephen King can do.  I couldn't stop reading it.
B004NOH9LC|2.0|This was a typical romantic comedy- but not as romantic and not as funny. I will probably never watch it again, but it wasn't unwatchable so I gave it a 2
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Once again George R R Martin has led us into a fantasy world of kings, dragons, love, betrayal, and honor.  A fantastic read full of amazing adventure, with plot twists that keep you turning page after page.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is just everything I can dream a book can be. It's a little sappy on the romance side but we need that in a good book!!!!
030758836X|2.0|If you read the back-flap,it's all praise, of course, duh. But \\"...best and most frightening portraits of psychopathy\\" and \\"I can't say this urgently enough: you have to read Gone Girl.\\"  If you're really bored, I'd say, yes, read it, but it's nothing to freak over.  I'm almost tempted to say one must have fairly low standards to rave about it.  It's trendy and entertaining. I can even see it making a decent movie (starring Charlize Theron as Amy), but it's not an awesome Thriller.  In all fairness, I've probably been spoiled by John Katzenbach. He's one tough act to follow. You wanna be thrilled or get insight into psyche?  Read John Katzenbach!  Any of 'em.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|can't wait for the next season! Please keep the UK version, it's the best! Please keep the UK version, it's the best!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Not difficult, good graphics, fun to play, and you don't have to spend real money to really enjoy the game.
0142420891|4.0|Most YA books today end with a happily ever after, and I actually really appreciated finding out from this book that \\"If I Stay\\" did not. \\"Where She Went\\" approaches \\"after\\" from a realistic viewpoint while somehow managing not to be too depressing. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the minor characters are seriously lacking. In the first book, we got a great look at Mia's quirky family. This book, we get vague mentions of Adam's band but they just fall short for me. Other than that, though, it is a great follow-up novel.

B00AF6B22E|3.0|I gave it Three Stars out of respect for Denzel!  I would NOT buy it again!<br /><br />I liked the Flying Upside Down and Surviving The Crash parts, but NOT the Alcoholic Pilot parts.  Most of the rest of the movie was sort of boring and depressing.  As you can see, I'm not much of a Movie Reviewer, so there you go....
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun and addicting. My friend told me to get this game because it was fun. She wasn't lying when she said it was fun. I can't wait to move on to leps world 2!!

What' wrong with me?<br /><br />I'm not much of a Movie Reviewer so I don't have much to say other than I enjoyed it immensely.  So there you go....

B00992CF6W|5.0|VERSION 0.6.1 alpha<br /><br />  As we all know, Minecraft is a popular game. $26.95 on the PC. This is $6.99. I decided to get this. I wanted to find a way of playing Minecraft without paying the money for the PC edition. I have a friend who has pocket edition on his iPad and iPod. He made me want to get it.<br /><br />I got it on my kindle fire hd. The major difference between the PC edition and the pocket edition is the crafting table.<br /><br />When you go to the crafting table, it has a different format. The PC has the 3x3 boxes to place items in and craft. This pocket edition has a whole MENU. It took me awhile to get used to it, but it's not the same.<br /><br />The gameplay is excellent. Better than a laggy computer.<br /><br />The only thing I have to complain about is the updates. Waaayyy less updated than the PC. It mainly has the basics.<br /><br />Local Wi-Fi gaming is fun, I have played with many friends.<br /><br />*I've heard that version 0.7.0 will have online multiplayer!*<br /><br />Minecraft is fun, with little to complain about.<br /><br />HAVE A NICE LITTLE DAY
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I received my wand as a gift this Christmas and I was ecstatic! However, after about a month of use, it stopped working. My first thought was, \\"Oh great, now I get to deal with the hassle of trying to contact someone and jump through a bunch of hoops to have a chance at getting a replacement\\". This was not the case at all!! After sending an email to the company (which was actually very easy to find compared to other customer service contact information from other companies), they promptly got back to me with some troubleshooting help. After that didn't work, they told me to ship my wand to them and they would offer a new replacement free of charge! They even refunded me for the return shipping postage!! The customer service rep. who helped me was extremely patient and understanding! They were completely supportive and they express shipped my new wand to me less than two days after they received the faulty wand. My wand works wonderfully now and my whole experience with the Wand Company has been amazing! It is nice to know that there is a company out there who still is interested in their product's performance and the happiness of their customer, even after they've gotten money out of them. I would recommend this wand to everyone! The Wand Company is a truly wonderful company and one of the best I have had the pleasure dealing with!

B0085FF55W|4.0|This is a great album.  I received this very quickly- a few days early. I would recommend this to friends.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I know this movie was royally panned when it came out. In fact, it came out in general release and disappeared shortly thereafter. Fortunately, I got to see it before it disappeared from theaters.<br />The focus if this story is the making of Hitchcock's Psycho. Even for the Master of Macabre this film was viewed as a horrific mistake from inception. No one thought it would make much of a movie and that sentiment was shared by Hitchcock's biggest supporter former film editor Alma Reville/Mrs. Hitchcock. Eventually, his wife did come around to share his vision.<br />As a lover of film and a one-time seven year old whose Grandma took her to see Psycho first run, I thought this was a wonderful premise for a movie. While I had already read the book on which this movie was based, I thought this movie might have better explained the challenges Hitchcock faced while attempting to make Psycho. However, what impressed me was Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hitchcock. While that might have evolved into a parody of the original, Hopkins really stood up to the task of being Hitchcock. The subtle nuances and the gait were there. Hopkins did a remarkable job of transforming himself into the character. Helen Mirren, based on all reports re: Alma, was excellent as the skeptical spouse who bought into her husband's vision which became his obsession.<br />I enjoyed this film a lot. It was an interesting story that was engaging and witty without getting silly or trite.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this adaptation of Emma.  Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller are fantastic as Emma Woodhouse and Mr. Knightly.

030758836X|5.0|I can't recall the last time I enjoyed reading a thriller/mystery story this much. The plot revolves around Nick and his wife,Amy-on the morning of their 5th wedding anniversary Amy disappears. There's blood and sign of a struggle at the couples home-police suspect foul play so of course-their prime suspect is the husband. The story is told from Nick and Amy's perspective (Amy's by way of diary entries). Amy is the only child of 2 psychologists who made their living writing a children's book series \\"amazing Amy\\",each book involves some moral battle that amazing Amy conquers (play nice,don't bully etc) but the \\"real\\" Amy has spent her life trying to meet the expectations of \\"amazing Amy\\". Nick,on the other hand comes from a rather broken home-abusive father and a mom who \\"baby's\\" her kids-especially Nick to try and make up for her lousy husband. Nick and Amy should be good together right??? But if I'd had Sherlock Holmes beside me-I believe I still couldn't have predicted the many twists and turns this story takes. This is a \\"I'll just read to end of the chapter and I'll stop for a bit\\"but,dang here comes a twist/turn/cliffhanger! You have to read on-what will happen next?? I can't say more without giving away the plot. All is not what is seems - neither couple is blameless in regards to marital mistakes. But I assure you-you will not see the end coming-you could not guess how twisted things become. Beautifully written and very,very clever. I will cherish this read for a long while! And thanks to Amazon I have Miss Boyles other 2 novels to read-I just have to be sure to start them when I know I have at least 2 days free.  Read this book! Stay up all night to figure out what will happen next!! What a gem!
0385349947|1.0|A feminist who is a men-hater<br /><br />This book is telling actually just 2 clear things, underlined and repeated over and over again:<br /><br />EVERYTHING that a women does is RIGHT. No matter what.<br /><br />EVERYTHING that a masculine man does is WRONG and he is GUILTY for being born a man.<br /><br />Things are simple, without any other shades of grey, for her<br /><br />she can not make a bad decision about anything. Punishing or criticizing a woman for her life choices will be abolished.<br /><br />Name one thing right now that a feminist would criticize their gender for doing. I'll save you the mental effort: there's nothing. There is absolutely nothing that a girl can do that would get hate from feminists. For example:<br /><br />  Girl has no willpower and is 50 pounds overweight? Not her fault. She's beautiful. Social constructs need to be changed.<br />  Girl sluts around with 100 guys without condoms? Not her fault. She's empowered and strong.<br />  Girl is irresponsible with sex and has five abortions in her 20s? It's her body and she can do whatever she wants. A fetus inside her is not a living entity.<br />  Girl is making less money than men? The patriarchy is holding her down.<br />  Girl gets drunk in a guy's house and has sex with him? He took advantage of her. She was raped.<br />  Girl studies stupid major in college and can't get a job? The 1% owes her a marketing manager position.<br />  Girl sleeps with her college professor in exchange for a better grade? She was a victim.

0770435726|3.0|I read this after seeing that it had been an Edgar nominee.  The overall plot is somewhat interesting, and in the beginning, kept me going, anxious to find out what happens next.  But it becomes so repetitive - the main character, Kate telling us that she doesn't know if she can trust her husband, or giving hints of a big secret in her past.  By the time I was halfway through the book, I wanted to shout \\"We get it!  You don't have to keep telling us!\\"  It may have been a device to keep us dangling and anxious to speed ahead, but I felt like the book needed a better editor.  Also, Kate keeps making serious errors in digging into her husband's and another couple's pasts, while trying to find out the truth about them.  I knew she was being stupid, and I'm not an ex-CIA operative as she is.  I wondered if the book was written more like something aspiring to be turned into a movie (hence all the repetition that seems to be a device to keep you on edge).  But that's no excuse.

0143120581|3.0|I would not recommend the book, in fact I gave it away right after the Book Club!  The birthday card episode in the middle of the book was my limit with this self centered, cruel woman.

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|With songs that clock at eight and nine minutes, this album actually goes for grand and epic rather than dark and twisted. But it's all the same in the fantastical world of Kanye West, grown from a mere College kid to one of the brightest stars modern pop music has to offer. Conventional verses and choruses aren't enough. These songs, laced with some of his most ambitious beats yet, are in no way bound by the rules of standard rap music.<br /><br />There are choruses and bridges where you don't expect them to be, rhapsodic alterations in the arrangement of the music itself, guest artists squeezed-in just for the hell of it, and... what's with all these lo-fi effects on Kanye West's voice? I don't know. But, unlike the Autotune vocoder abuse happening on the 808s And Heartbreak album, it works, giving the album a refreshingly raw and unpolished demo-session type of feel.<br /><br />It's the old-school hip-hop drums that may never go out of style and it's Kanye West's rap skills that keep things interesting between all the singing. I'd rather not hear Rihanna's dry whiny voice, Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross should be limited to one song each, the two interludes should be tracked with the songs they go with, Power is weak to me, and the nickname \\"Yeezy\\" sounds gay, but this still might be the best Kanye West album so far.<br /><br />The annoying skits are long gone, so a good chunk of the album, which includes only eleven actual songs, is consistently on-point. That streak starts with a three-headed Monster, featuring mentor Jay-Z. He can also be heard on the next song, So Appalled, where Wu-Tang's Rza makes a pleasantly surprising feature. Then it's on to the Devil In A New Dress, a hot chick whose 1970s-inspired theme sounds like vintage Kanye West.<br /><br />Perhaps the most endearing part of this Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, an album title that is either brilliant or stupid, comes at the end of The Blame Game, in which a semi-funny Chris Rock engages in a dialogue with what is supposed to be his girlfriend. She sounds either awkwardly copy-and-pasted, retarded or drugged out of her mind, but it's cute how she says what she says and the background piano music is indeed beautiful.<br /><br />marcellee.comwith what is supposed to be his girlfriend.

B005WFUZTE|5.0|The album is a adrenaline thrill ride and I especially like public enemy no 1.MEGADETH is finally on a role with end game and then this since symphony of destruction and a few bits and pieces in between.
0307712508|5.0|For those of you involved in any medical illness, especially cancer, please take the time to listen to the remarkable story.  It will tell you about the medical world and how it treats those who were once ill, poor, weak and helpless.  Insightful, truthful and it will awaken your senses.
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|I haven't read anything about this film, but I'm guessing it was a first effort for the director and most of the actors. I'm not saying that because they were bad, I'm saying that because the movie and acting was so fresh and different it just doesn't seem to have come from the mind of a \\"Hollywoodized\\" director.<br /><br />Anyhow, the blurb will tell you that teens acquire some super powers and then experience troubles while exploring their new powers. This is a pretty standard premise (Heroes immediately comes to mind) but the execution of the story is way more thoughtful and interesting than anything else I've seen.<br /><br />The most surprising part of the movie was how great the special effects were. I'm NOT a big fan of CGI films like Spiderman. I like my action a bit more authentic looking, and I thought that the depiction of the super powers in this film was incredibly realistic.<br /><br />If you like this kind of concept and are willing to enjoy a slower and more thoughtful pace of movie making, I think you will enjoy this film.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Classic Hendrix..!!! The Blues numbers on this CD/Album are Slammin`, as are All the Rest of this CD...! Great Jimi..!
B0001I55NS|2.0|I didn't realize I was purchasing a previously owned/used product.<br />It functions but I'm disappointed it wasn't clear that this was not new.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|I love both characters she is a sweetie and he is a doll... and can relate to her being uncomfortable with love.... at times aint we all?
B0007VCZ50|5.0|This is one of the greatest works of the 80s, and still very influential today. Sting and all the other band members demand respect, and they get it. I could sit around and watch is over and over for days and never get enough.<br />I played it as background music at a party and at one point found about 20% of the guests sitting there staring at the screen, enthralled in its every moment.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I can't say I really expected to enjoy this nearly as much as I did. I bought it because based upon the reviews, but the story description really didn't seem like something I would like. But I'm very glad I gave The Martian a chance, as it was a perfect mix of humor and well crafted storytelling. The only minor disapointment I had with the book was that I felt the ending was a bit abrupt. Not that the story wasn't complete, but more that I had invested so much time in the minute details of his life, that I would have enjoyed a little extra back on earth.<br />But overall, its a solid 5 star read.
B004TPJMLA|5.0|One of Paul Simon's greatest albums, with great percussion lines and incredible stories to tell.<br />Whenever I need a pick up, I just put it in the player, and can't crank up the volume enough for those beginning beats!
B0001I55OC|5.0|There are a few small scientific problems with this movie and its timeline, but all in all, it's enjoyable.  Gerard Butler first came to my attention in this movie, and he's a total hottie these days.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is fantastic for giving spot on weather information for my area.  The app will call for snow or rain, when other local stations are not.  Accuweather is always right and it is refreshing!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Glad this finally came out in an affordable package.  The cover's holographic image adds a nice bonus for collectors and if you're into 3D, what better movie to immerse yourself into?!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I am not sure why this book is so popular. I am halfway through it and have struggled to read this much. I find it boring and the gruesome details of animals killing and being killed by one another is a bit much. Reading about live goats being fed to tigers to make a point, a zebra being eaten alive and suffering for days or a hyena ripping off the head of an orangutan is not my idea of enjoyable reading.
6305428042|5.0|Let go of logic and character analysis and acting styles, and just enjoy this movie.  It's as if the director said to the actresses, &#34;Who cares - just have fun!&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game rocks! I like the unicorns and my 450 diamonds! ITS the best game  I play! And I have a lot of games!
B000X1YDCM|3.0|This is by far the greatest live performance I have ever seen in my entire life.  But the dvd does not work in my dvd player, only my computer! Ba humbug
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would go and buy this game. I like the fact that you can get friends to play with. The horses  cost a bit much to get, but I think that it is worthwhile.
B007SPPANM|5.0|This movie deserves 5 stars because it is the greatest movie known to man kind. It bring tears of joy and pain all at once! It is amazing!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Has all the features you need in a basic alarm clock. Multiple alarms, snooze feature and even a weather display so you don't need to pick up a second device or go outside to see if it's snowing lol. Wish this version allowed my music, but honestly how much more can you expect for free.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith has done it yet again.  There is nothing more heart warming than a father and son movie, and this one is by far my favorite of its kind
0738711500|5.0|this item was just fabulous, the art work on the cards is just fantastic. the book is easy to read so you won't feel confused while reading it and the book is packed full of good advice and examples not to mention all the information on each card i truly recommend you buy this product if your thinking about it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is always a pleasure when a book keeps you guessing and has you think about the characters - even when you aren't reading the book!  This is an exciting book and I recommend it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After seeing the Liam Neeson movies and more recently the big screen musical, I have been enthralled by this story. Only after reading Victor Hugo's novel, did all the pieces fall into place. It is beautifully written and my respect for Hugo has turned into awe.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a die hard sci fi and apocalypse fan.  But for the review last week in the Wall Street Journal, I never would have heard about this highly original and well written thriller.  I will look forward to reading all of Howey's books.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This story is the best batman story I've ever read. Dare I say better than the Dark Knight Returns. The joker at his most insane level. The story rivals Death in the family. They just don't make comics this good anymore. Four big stars. It's a must read for comic and batman fans. Classic book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game, you go no love it, better version than previous version.<br />Kids also love it. Improve Brian coordination as well.
B004Z8ZFAI|5.0|I LOOOOOOOOVE this movie!!! the arrival was bery fast so i got to enjoy this movie right away!!! and my nephews love the little dance session on the bounus dvd!!! it was a great purchase!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is fantastic! Loved the story line and was well worth the money! I would definitely recommend this game to everyone!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is awesome I like how the added more features for example instead of buying the resurection you can use the gems.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was just blown away by this series, and immediately loved the stories, characters, and excellence in production!  We both enjoyed the extra features included.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I expected to enjoy great cinematography, but was delighted by the heady story line. 6 more words are required, really?
B00AHSINKO|3.0|Tommy isnt the right guy for this his portayal was good of a typical american family id say.  Merel was great.  These people are my could be anyones family to a tee.  Very interesting dynamic.
0671449028|4.0|My daughter loves this book.  We had bought it before and lost it when we went on vacation.  The book I received isn't the same as the one pictured.  The pictures in the book are different than the blue covered book.  The book we received is yellow.  It is still a great story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love playing this game and so does my daughter. I love how real the horses look. My only complaint would be having to wait if you dont want to spend actual money.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is fun. I like it. I wish I can get more.free game or free Paid game. Any paid free Android game is.cool & good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very colorful, easy to learn, fun for anybody and everybody.  Not too challenging up to 7x7, but the larger screens definitely require some thought.  Great great game !
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Good to play. Like to play. Will play more. This game is fun. I like it. I wish I can get more.free game or free Paid game. Any paid free Android game is.cool & good.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|It make transferring data between cameras, digital devices and the like so very much easier than having to purchase individual cords for the fit.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is fun. I like it. I wish I can get more.free game or free Paid game. Any paid free Android game is.cool & good.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I got this for my youngest who is no doubt a Dr. Who fan. This is a great item that he really likes. However, the UV pen attachment does not stay on. That is the only downfall. It was for his birthday and refuses to let me return it for another one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I used to have horses n this app gives me something to do when I have nothing to do and I'm thinking about my horses
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My middle school son bought this movie.  It has inspired him to get into hiking.  He is now studying books on hiking, too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I find the second book as intriging as the first.  It is not all about the sex but the personal growth and commitment they make and stumble and try again in  their relationship.  the find what works for them abd it is not all about the sex but the sex is a growth tool.
B0013D6LEM|3.0|The producer did a good job on this album.  Was fantastic when it was released but sounds very dated now
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In the beginning, I was very uncertain but my motto is to finish any book I start because you never know.  Well this is very definitely one of those books.  I'm not about casual, kinky sex.  But as I focused more on the two people and there needs and flaws and the way they expressed them to each other AND listened and learned, were vulnerable and willing I realised that this book is not all about sex but the growth of two peple in a committed relationship along with it's problems but their ability to see each other for who they are, accept them but also be willing to change for the better.  Very well written.
B000J233SK|5.0|Heard this CD in a store as background music and had to have it. Enjoyed all of the songs very moody at times but easy to listen to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Much controvery over this book but if you really look into it and follow the relationship aspect and the personal growth the two people have and what they are willing to give for each other....there is a story line not just sex in this book.  I do recommend it to a mature audience only you can read beyond the sex.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle reading app is just like what is on my wife's kindle.  I really like the way it works on my tab.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I bought this Cd for my Son to add to his collection of his favorite bamd from Germany he has been listening to the band many years
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Words can't describe how much I LOVE Phillip...I saw the raw talent in this guy when the first song came outta his mouth during auditions on American Idol...after that he just got better and it was a joy watching him perform week after week...the right guy won!  This album is a 9 out of 10, but that's only because he didn't include the song &#34;Volcano&#34; on there (which he sang on Idol, he should've asked for the rights to it). That's ok though, he has a song on there which sounds close to it but aside from that, he did an amazing job on his first album...I got the deluxe version (wouldn't have it any other way, lol) and love all the songs...only one I could do without (sorry Phillip), is &#34;Thriller&#34;..didn't like it when he performed it on Idol and wish he had put Volcano on there instead!  I wish nothing but the best for this very humble and talented guy who has a similar sound to Dave Matthews band and Mumford & Sons..although I like Phillip's music better than the latter.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I bought this CD for My son he likes the music by this group from Germany.This Is a great album
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This book kept me intrigued and entertained all the way through, I loved the way it jumped from the the 1940s to the current day, the  different personalities and lifestyles of all the characters was very really interesting, looking into the lives of people in the turbulent times around the 2nd world war was fascinating as was the very different lives of the current family members, I found this book hard to put down and the ending was so unexpected, I didn't see it coming....should a huge family secret be shared by everyone involved or left a secret known only by two????? a terrific read.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Loved the demo of this game rocks, but leaves you wanting more. Had to get the full version to really see the depth of the game.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Just what I wanted. Just wish had deleted the old and new version on there. Came in very good condition. Just hope my son will start watching them
B007N31ZLA|5.0|After their success in &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,&#34; Paul Newman and Robert Redford made &#34;The Sting,&#34; and the chemistry was still there.  The movie is smart and funny, touching and surprising.  It still works even after you've seen it a few times.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor
B00B5HQL50|4.0|skyfall was new and exciting to watch while keeping faith with the character created by Ian Fleming.  Great story line.  .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book had everything, suspense, drama, sex, love, mystery!! I stayed up to 2:00 am reading this when I get up at 5:00 am to go to work.  Just captivating!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this show!!<br />I couldn't stop watching from start to finish!<br />I highly recommend all 3 seasons.<br />Wonderful
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Fun and educational.  Beautiful graphics, entertaining.  A little bit if a learning curve required on how to move the piece without throwing yourself across the universe,  but fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Being a part of the brony community, I naturally love this, and my sister does too! P.S...Derpy is included. It's a truely wonderfull way to spend your spare time! I reccomend.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Much rougher than his other books.  Tormented characters and he writes about domestic violence as if you are the victim.  Would of given it 5 stars except ending questionable.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|My 11 year olds like to play this game but it makes you buy levels after completing the first one
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|i like blueberry pie it is so amazing just like this game i give it a million stars if i could but sadly i cant
B00992CF6W|5.0|The app is so awsome I play it almost every day! And if I could make mods for it I would.<br />:)
6304708483|5.0|i would recommend this version to everyone. by far the best one out there. dont go with the miramax one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun game the Rome upgrade is even better I love when you get the jet rocket
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was the best book i have read in a long time. What can i say? Characters are developed well and you grow to care for the people going through the games. If you seen the movie and liked it. then you are going to love this book. i finished it in about 3 days cause i couldn't stop reading. GET IT!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Very well written, exceptonnally well documented. Fascinating story. Atmosphere of the time and situation successfully recreated. It makes veru fluent reading
B009KNPM9W|5.0|This is arguably Marvin Gaye's greatest album. You may think that's impossible since it's largely instrumental, but one listen will make you a true believer. I've had a vinyl copy for 40 years that remains one of the treasures of my collection. The bonus cuts and the original film cues in particular just heighten the listening experience.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Great actors forced to act in a badly scripted supposed to be comedy that isn't funny, and the drama is contrived and painstakingly going really nowhere after such a long, slow trip.  I would have turned it off after thirty minutes, but it's Meryl and Tommy Lee, two exuberantly awesome actors in either comedy or drama, who sadly had to work with a script that was neither.  Skip it.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Very cute love story with some fun poetry mixed in. Lighter reading and a little predictable, but really enjoyed the book.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Everything a film should be, an example of why we used to love movies.  This one has it all - a great story, a feel good ending, suspense, moments of hilarity. (Alan Arkin and John Goodman are priceless, why no supporting actor nominations there?)  The back drop of what the other hostages were going through and the original news reels of the events was a very interesting technique to keep us on edge, but not in a contrived way.  I've seldom as a movie goer felt invested or really involved in the story like I did here.  This story is too entertaining to be true.  Some other fun things are just the perfect continuity of the costumes & sets - in 1980 there weren't computers in offices, but typewriters, period glasses & hair; they just really covered the bases there.
B004SYP5WC|1.0|When I opened this app today I found I had to accept a new user agreement to get to my information.  So I accepted, and was appalled when I opened the app that all my info was gone-everything that I had entered in the past 2 years.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This camera app allows me to get in the picture with my family and friends - I love it! Great!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I felt like I was back in the time of slavery.  This book kept me on the edge of my seat. It was an amazing page turner!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I really love this case I ordered to of them one for me and one for my son. Love the features it has. the only problem we have with the case is that after a couple weeks of using it in the standing position is that is does not want to stay in place and will slide flat. this is a little annoying but over all a good case and did not add too much weight to the Kindle Fire HD.
0385344228|4.0|This book was a story about a horrible tragedy, unfortunately, this story is reality that takes place everyday, we just don't hear about it! This is a parent's worst nightmare and the reality of your child being involved in a horrible crime and how the outcome can effect your family, how your life can be turned up side down and how stress can take its toll. I did go into reading this book having heard (somewhere) that Jacob's character was Autistic, which I learned not to be true, however, her did have other personality issues.<br /><br />I have read no other books by this Author and I must say I couldn't put this book down.<br /><br />The end, to me, was shocking and surprising!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a fantastic game, I enjoyed it a lot. The hint button helped when I needed it. The story line was very interesting also. Great graphics, it kept my attention.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It sharpens fairly well. Not great. Is rather difficult to hold onto. You have to really squeeze your thumb and forefinger to control it. In my opinion it could possibly slip and cause injury. And it's very small.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I like it very much i would tell friends to buy it..The sound is so good and loving you can chill out .
B000LTAY1U|5.0|In my young adulthood I wore a dress Seiko watch everyday for about 20 years in my professional work.  As styles changed I migrated with my watches to casual designs.  I was surprised to come across this model, since I had never noticed one in the Seiko line.  As far as watch function and reliability, I always favored Seiko over other brands.  Now I enjoy the best of both worlds with this watch.  I highly recommend it to you!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is fun to play, but it crashes on me a lot and I had to delete it from my kindle fire two times so far. Other than that though it is a blast to play even since there is a zip line in this one
B007HACDLK|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this on my Kindle.  Enjoyed the action and character development.  Vince Flynn seems to be a master at story telling.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|One of the best games I have played! I really love the graphics but the game does need a update.I think the storyline is awesome!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is really fun, but, I played this once then it stopped working the next day. With so many good reviews this might get over looked but this is a problem.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Suspenseful enough, but rather too long. . .<br /><br />(Was it really sensible to endanger the Canadian personnel and a CIA operative to<br />extract six US nationals while leaving over 40 hostages behind? The solution to such cases must be political and economic, not military or covert.)
B0026IWNZ4|4.0|Great movie for toddlers and parents to watch together. Toddlers will ask questions, and this is the perfect time to give age appropriate answers.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have it on my kindle fire and its just so pretty I can c it from very far away with out getting closer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The only draw back is once you get so many prizes it will give you the prize even if it falls off the side. Still a very cool game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun game really enjoy playing with the family and the little ones. keep up the good work. and the updates
B00AREIAI8|3.0|fun, but thins cost too much. even a treat cost coins or gems. i can not see me playing it much.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham + my kindle are going to = divorce!  My husband honestly can tell me what I am reading if it's a John Graham book.  I  hear little jabs like, \\"haven't you read all his books yet?  How long until I can talk to you and expect dinner again?\\"  Oh well, I could give him reason to whine but really how can he be jealous because I  love John Grisham books? This one was worth the fight!!!!!
B007C4E1R0|5.0|I loved this book. the book was really addicting once you start to read it. I would recommend reading the book.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|This movie contains some of the best acting ever. It's powerful, stark, unrelenting. It should have won multi awards. Left me breathless .
0385751532|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that likes history and can handle a sad story. this was a very good book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a very good app. I recmend you trying this app out.you will love this app it is the best app ever
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I came on amazon on a whim and thought to look this up, so glad I did. I've wanted this movie for a long time, and bluray prime is the way to go!
1416550550|5.0|Writing: 5<br />Story: 5<br />Satisfaction: 5+<br /><br />My first ever library late charge is on this book. I completely intended to return it. In fact, I was on the bus to the library with the book in my lap on the day that it was due. My reading list had gotten away from me and sadly I wasn't able to get to it in time and there still is a pretty long waiting list for it. Bored on the bus, I started flipping through it and figured I might as well read the first few pages. Friends, half an hour later I was on the bus going back home with my nose still in the book and now I can tell you that this 10 cent library late charge might be the best dime that I've ever spent.<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden starts off a little confusing. The view point changes per chapter with the first being from a 4-year-old girl who we soon know is on a boat coming to port in Australia with no guardian in sight. She is found by the dockmaster of the port and she doesn't know who what her name is, who's coming for her, or what she's even doing there. The dockmaster brings her home to his wife and after no one comes looking or comes to claim her, they name her Nell and raise her. She grows up happily until she finds out the truth of how she came to be with them.<br /><br />The other viewpoints are from an adult Nell, searching for her past, from her granddaughter Cassandra who picks up the quest after her grandmother's death and from Rose and Eliza, women from the past who are closely connected to a book of fairytales that is the only clue that Nell has to her past.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a location and a date and until the reader has read far enough to really nail down the personalities of each character, it gets a little confusing to switch from point of view to point of view. Luckily Morton's characters have so much depth that the familiarity soon catches hold.<br /><br />Morton writes beautifully and the structure of this book is wonderful. With the benefit of the \\"first hand experience,\\" the reader catches on to things faster than the protagonist would and it's frustrating at times thinking, \\"that's so obvious, why can't she see it?\\" and there are times when she seems to not connect some large dots but it's consistent with the shocking situation she's found herself in.<br /><br />There are plenty of characters to love, characters to hate, characters to wish death on and they're all fleshed out so beautifully that even though the story is so incredibly tragic, you wish for just a little bit that the story might be real so that there might be something to come back to after that last page. Anyone who's ever gotten lost in fairy tales, even as a child, will find something magical in The Forgotten Garden.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Just like I remember their songs as a young teen! Old time tunes with a memorable beat and rhythm. Yes!
B0014QABX0|5.0|Great cd have been looking for the right one for a long time that had a song I love.Did not know from which cd it was on,love the<br />whole cd
B009WO7NQO|1.0|We played the first 3 levels of Tatooine, but when the 2nd movie is supposed to play, the game stalls and closes. Tried deleting and downloading again, with the same results.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I have just starting to listen to Rihhana,my niece got me hooked and could not wait until I got this cd ,play it all the time.
0949551147|5.0|This is a complete yoga manual, including meditation, nasal cleansing, variations of yoga moves, and meanings of words and their roots. It's practical for beginners and advanced practitioners. You don't need any other manual, unless you like colored pictures.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Adele is great and so cool that she did  a song for 007 movie,but never heard it play on radio and was getting frustrated<br />and was pleased it had a single ,but not in stores,so was thrilled to find one after all.Very cool song
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Really great to have a multifaceted calculator with a slick user interface. Super convenient.<br /><br />Only request would be to support 64-bit values in programmer's calculator.
B006W33UC4|5.0|You will be dancing while you drive or what ever you may be doing when you listen to this collection. Also the insert was a great read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|... on every device and PC I own! Evernote is one of the first apps I install when setting up a new device. It's very useful to make some note, save some bookmark or pic and be able to access it whenever you need it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was not what I thought it'd be at all.  It started out okay, the characters are good, you're not sure where the story is going...then when it gets to the main &#34;issue&#34; and whole reason behind everything...I felt it was unbelievably sad, and it seemed like every time I thought it couldn't get worse, it did.  It wasn't a horrible book, but if you don't want to read about real life monsters and the horrible shells of people that they leave behind, I don't recommend this, it definitely leaves you feeling &#34;hopeless&#34;.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I bought this game since it was specific to the Kindle. I was expecting it to work. We have 3 stars on every level but it no longer lets us progress in the game. There are little videos you watch and then it should unlock the new level but this is not happening. So we are stuck with only a few playable levels and are very disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun I enjoy this game so much I play it evrey day.  thank you creaters of temple run games
0062238868|5.0|Definitely would recommend to others.  Great book, Chris Kyle was and will always be an American Hero.<br />Loved this book!
B008Y6Y1RA|5.0|I watched this with my teenage daughter and we both laughed throughout the movie.  It gave us lots to talk about and even an opening to discuss how parents aren't perfect either.....<br />This romantic comedy is a classic and shows enough skin to keep guys interested in the movie as well.<br />Highly recommended - for ages 13 and up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to download and play.  I play it all the time.  And its free!!  Ok I think I have said enough 20 minimum.
B00AFEYUVG|3.0|I heard rave reviews for weeks before reading the book.... and had high expectations (love Emma Watson).  However, I can only rate this movie as 'ok'.  It doesn't stay with you after you watch it and is even boring in parts of th emovie.<br />bottom line:  disappointing - rent it and don't buy it.  Should have only opted for the $1.99 redbox rental.
B004SIP71M|4.0|While the book may be better than the movie, the book didn't star Meryl Streep. \\"Doubt\\" is a sharp, riveting performance piece that showcases the talents of its four main players: Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. The storyline is simply a lightning rod that harnesses the electric bravura of these stars, and if, perhaps, someday the plot stales this film will lose none of its potency thanks to its actors.<br /><br />It's a tremendous film that builds to a crisp, crackling finale between Sister Aloysius, played by the redoubtable Streep, and Father Flynn, played by Hoffman. Only the first twenty minutes sputter and kick and never achieve the power of the original play. Those familiar with Shanley's script will remember its tight unity of place, time, and action as the story revolves around a series of claustrophobic exchanges between four characters; the writing is sparse, expert, clean. In order to \\"open up\\" the script for the film version, Shanley spreads out the first scene between Sister Aloysius and Sister James into multiple encounters while filling in the gaps with new characters and narrative penumbra. As a result, the start is loose and a tad blunted in comparison to the glorious rest of the film. The moment Sister Aloysius and Sister James enter the eighth grade classroom and squabble over ballpoint pens does the film recover its focus.<br /><br />True, the extra characters and scenes satisfy the \\"movie-going experience\\" and give the audience glimpses into the world of the story. Roger Deakins, celebrated cinematographer, provides ample chiaroscuro to actors' faces and allows each room to glow with a soft focus. There's even ancillary material in the movie that humanizes Sister Aloysius--her concern for aging Sister Veronica helps viewers sympathize with her character more than in the stage play. Nevertheless, the added material lacks the acuteness of its source and may even reveal Shanley's hesitancy toward it.<br /><br />Nowadays, to say Streep gives a powerful performance is akin to saying fire is hot; it's common knowledge that she is one of our finest actresses. In \\"Doubt,\\" I believe she gives one of her most memorable performances. Regardless of who ended up with the Academy Award in 2009, this was Streep's year, and Sister Aloysius was the reason. Davis is equally brilliant; she needed only twelve minutes of screen time to steal the entire show. As Mrs. Miller, mother of the boy thought to have been seduced by Father Flynn, Davis is like a controlled explosion: contained, for the most part, on the surface but betrays her outer calm with every glance and nervous gesture. Watch her when she tells Sister Aloysius, \\"Do I ask the man why he's good to my son?\\" Ebert said it best when he described the scene between Streep and Davis as a matching of equals.<br /><br />Overall, a great film the benefits from Streep's unparalleled and uncompromising dedication to the role. Her voice, her expressions, her movements are all Sister Aloysius--the actress has given us a singular and seminal character. Thanks to this, along with Davis and Deakins, this may have been the most deserving film of 2009.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This is one you can watch over and over, seeing and sensing a newness each time of his devotion and determination to love this one now so without memory of their past. Well done.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Upon my boyfriend's assistance, and against my better judgment, I watched Ted last night. Although I did laugh at times, overall I found it very juvenile. The humor relied upon vulgarity & crude sex jokes, instead of the on-the-edge humor, double entndres, sarcasm and intelligence of Family Guy.<br />Since the story failed to keep my interest, I found myself wondering if Seth was that lonely, little boy, who so badly wanted a friend, he created an imaginary one. I hope this has exorcised those childhood demons, and Seth will, in his next project, produce adult humor, instead of putting the fantasies of a rejected pre-teen on screen.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Even ignoring the problems with physics in the flying (it's a movie, so that's forgivable), this is just not well written. Love Denzel's acting abilities, but he could not save this badly written script and silly direction.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. Good acting and the plot was intricate enough to keep our interest and not be so predictable.
B004GKMV16|4.0|Anyone with a love of history would have to love his books . It is a great way of reading a historical novel and have  fun and knowledge at the same time . He really makes his characters come alive . Recommend highly . Long reads though .
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Stopped watching this because I value my time. Wow, what a ridiculous movie. Was awkwardly forced feeling in the acting too......kind of amateurish.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I'm a huge Jurassic park fan, and I love the idea of running it own park. It's one of my favorite games, the only thing that I might change would be to add mini games to it. That way you can earn money or food while u wait for it dinos to earn u coins.
B008OGJXJ6|2.0|There will be Dylan fans who will jump up and down and rave about Tempest being a fine piece of work...<br />And those faithful fans will like anything Dylan pumps out even if it's not worth listening to.<br />I've been a Dylan head since the early 60's and watched Bob Zimmerman go through all sorts of phases including his Jews for Jesus kick.  I know Dylan may have said:  &#34;Don't listen to my voice. listen my words&#34;.  Which was rather profound for the '70's.  But the Tempest Album is less than.  Some of the tracks are almost unintelligible.<br />It  sounds like he took a swig of Listerine mouth wash and is &#34;gargling with his tongue on fire&#34;.  I liked Dylan better when he would recite his poetry.... like in:  &#34;It's alright Ma (I'm only bleeding).  &#34;While one who sings with his tongue on fire, gargles in the rat race choir, bent out of shape from society's pliers, cares not to come up any higher, but rather get you down in the hole he's in&#34;  After listening to Tempest,  I agree with Dylan's much earlier prose... Is there a hole for me to get sick in?
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I played it for a day then it blacked out on me and I can't play it anymore. I liked it when I could play it.
B001CVMD4M|5.0|Is a good concert. Spice Girls rules. They are amazing. And this is an awesome concert that nobody can miss it
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is an amazing sequel to the first cant wait for the third. It kept me enthralled throughout the entire book
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am continually impressed by the writers and actors of this wonderful series. It's also refreshing that it is a new story and concept. It is neither a recreation, nor is it an adaptation. It is, however, a new and fresh story within the context of British, European, and world history.<br />Twists, turns, and intrigue keep one captivated by the continuing series.<br />I highly recommend this DVD. Purchase and enjoy!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was one of the best books i have ever read. I would ask anyone to start this series. Amazing
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Fun story line of family entertainment. Fun characters. Too cute!<br />I wish the little girl was real so I could find her and squeeze her.<br />See it!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It would be really really great if we had more time we only have like 20min. I'm just saying  WE  NEED MORE TIME!!
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Once again, Meryl Streep captures the character she portrays. Acting is truly her calling.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this drama. However, to be honest, my friends and family were not as enthusiastic as I.<br />I would still recommend it because there are so many little things that I was not aware of, as well as many things that I did not<br />know because I am not English or British.<br />Perhaps not everything is accurate....like her scenes with her late husband that happened in her imagination. However, I love poetic license.<br />Still, I think the movie was kind to Dame Thatcher. In short, I liked it...if that means anything.<br />Try it---you'll like it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just when you think you've figured out a character something happens to make you doubt your assessment.  Lots of back and forth with each main character telling their side.  It keeps you turning the pages but becomes tedious at the end.  The actual ending is so abrupt and unsatisfying.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book had very few characters.  This allowed the author time to properly develop each one and their feelings.<br /><br />It was an easy read and I had to know how it was going to end.

B006CHML4I|1.0|I recieved my watch yesterday. I took it out from the box & when I went to set the time the \\"stem\\" pulled right out of the watch ? I managed to get it back into the watch. I set the time and date on the watch however It did NOT come with any instructions as to how to set the day. I now realize what they meant by \\"gray market\\". Today is Saturday  3/16/13. While the watch keeps an accurate time & date it's showing the day as Monday? I have to say, I like the look of this watch and it seems to be able to keep and display the proper date as well. The \\"stem pulling right out of the watch is NOT very impressive :(  I'll try and send it back for either replacement or repair. I will NOT reccomend this to my friends. Save your $$ until you save enough to purchase a good watch.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love Josh Groban's voice. Even if I cannot understand the words in some of his songs, his voice is so relaxing.
0061703087|4.0|Michael Crichton always had the uncanny ability to take a technology that seems on its face to be a remarkably amazing breakthrough and then turn it sinister. In his novel Prey, that technology is nanocomputers, and the results are quite terrifying. Crichton writes about the science and technology like an expert, and unfolds the novel with suspense, intrigue, and thrills like only a master storyteller can.
B008I3RARW|1.0|I installed the app and it said that it was not<br />  Working so I forced stopped the app and the screen went black so I uninstalled the app
B00008S7KC|5.0|Throughly injoyed the live performance of Echoes. Of course Gilmour and Wright were fantastic, but to me this really showcased Nick Mason for a change. I find I like this version as much or more than the orignal.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game is fun but there is no multiplayer anymore I am all lonely lol there is the option but no people at least not when I play
B0000AOV85|5.0|I'm a bid Floyd fan and really liked this DVD. The comments by the band members were enlighting and heard some new sounds in the original recording that I missed before hearing them here. I watched on 1080p 27&#34; monitor and found the video quality to be fine. The blending of the single tracks into the album was cool!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The love story which develops gently, but inevitably, lends a grown woman like me to once again believe in 'happily ever afters'.

B0022W6L6G|5.0|Nice memories, when music was real music. no the crap people listen now in days. Lyrics with meaning, and feelings.
B000002KDZ|5.0|Love this cd - I have the album from long ago, but I no longer have a turntable to play it on. Love this music.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|Giving this album a 5 star rating is probably a bit much considering I'm bias to this group. But I've heared all of their recordings and I've never heard a bad song from them. As to what they sound like, I would call them the metal version of Bad Company. So, who I would recommend this album to would be fans of Bad Company or .38 Special that would like something a tad bit heavier.
1936608898|4.0|It breaks down how food works within the organs and simply how to address functional needs in simple, typical ways. Nothing extreme.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|Same humor, wonderful characters and a great storyline.  Loved that we found out how the team came about.  Worth watching just for the special effects.

B0038ZITIE|5.0|exactly what we wanted!  THANKS!  The Best Flash Gordon due to QUEEN'S music.  Made a campy science fiction movie one of the best ever!
0785125965|3.0|If you enjoy Hulk, this is a no-brainer. While not the biggest fan of the big lug, from time to time I enjoy reading some excessive violence and WWH certainly delivers that. I was slightly dissapointed that the fight with the X-Men (which I read before) wasn't here. Oh well.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|good show  the streaming messed up once which of course was aggrivating but the show was good.  a bit Corney but interesting.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I've used Magic Puzzles for a couple of weeks and have found it to be full of bugs. (Music continues to play after shutting down, blank screen at start up, puzzle suddenly disappears, pieces freeze, et cetera.) It is very frustrating to almost have a puzzle completed only to have one of the bugs force you to start over. Magic Puzzels is simply too buggy for me to keep it installed.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Adult series...not for children...holds your interest and keeps you wanting more...Bryan Cranston is great as George...my husband and I have passed on some of our favorite shows to watch the next episode

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am so glad my cousin told me to read this book.... I couldn't put it down... I laughed and cried through out the book, It was like I was there with Sky and Holder..... this is a must read book
B0030MM68O|4.0|I never, ever watch war movies, but something told me to try \\"The Hurt Locker\\" one night. In my opinion, the film was a study of the fine line between bravery and insanity, love and hate under a cloud of unimaginable stress. I will never think of combat in the middle east in the same way.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie was amazing.  Whole thing is a musical, and i love musicals so it was great.  I cry every time i watch this movie.  This movie makes you reflect on your life.  And shows how lucky we are to be where we are; unlike most people in the world.  This movie definitely gives perspective.  Excellent.

B005ETANC2|5.0|This is definitely one of the &#34;old greats&#34; that you just can't miss. Even my younger children love the old sci-fi's.  They can watch the &#34;scary&#34; movies, but not be exposed to extreme violence, gore, sex, drugs, etc. We watched it 8 times over when we first got it. This company ships fast. Thank you so much! I'm looking forward to more.
B008I3RARW|2.0|There is nothing interesting as well.<br /><br />Simple, very basic, repetitive...nothing holds the interest for long.<br /><br />But there are some good things there. ..decent graphics, decent response, but after tweaking controls..<br /><br />What is not there is, options, upgrades, competition..<br /><br />Heck you can stop, go get a coffee and still finish 1st if you increase the lap, opponent is that slow...<br /><br />The bad thing to note here is..how low Amazon's FAOTD has gone. They are giving out craps...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it :) because it's really a lesson and a game at the same time and the more I play more the faster it gets

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is better than temple run by far 3instead of 1 totally better with more options best game ever!<br />The trains are cool and they move! It is amazing totally get this app for your entertainment!
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Like Thornbirds and other epic novels, Shantarum pulls you through years of time and continents of geography. Loves and friends keep the reader glued. My one problem is the novel's length -- could it have been broken into two or more separate books; perhaps, a trilogy?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses but live in town and can't have one and since this app was free I downloaded it....it is addicting the graphics are great and the whole game itself is awesome you feed, name , treat ,compete and groom your horse. I recommend you buy this!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is ridiculously good. I'm super obsessed with Temple Run and now I'm even more obsessed with this game! I love the graphic and its really fast paced so you have to strategize.I would recommend this game to anyone.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I have seen this film time and time again, and it does not get old. The three key elements of Pixar magic are evident in this masterpiece: a great story (essential for any good movie, beautiful, and unique animation and solid character voicing. I really do wish I had this on Blu-ray (I used to have the DVD, but don't know where it went) but I guess watching on Amazon Prime is as good as anything else these days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and you don't have to have WIFI to play;) Almost everybody I know has this game it is ghat awesome!
B005DJGMQE|5.0|GOOooood!<br />(have to have 19 more words)<br /><br />Well done portrayal of a subject often denied. WE (Americans) need all of our history, not just the glorious parts.

B008XGFZRQ|5.0|My favorite vampire movie of all time and the HD Cloud version only makes it better! Getting to see this in all it's fun, sexy, cool hipness at the same quality level as the original film, but on my TV, is like meeting up with David and the Boys on the Boardwalk and living to tell about it.<br /><br />But can I just say if you are too young to remember this movie, or haven't seen it yet, you need to fix that Cluster, and right now! I swear if I again hear the name (which I will not type here) of that film series about emo-sparkly-high school-wussy excuses for vampires, my head might explode. Seriously, even my 19-year old brother after he saw The Lost Boys, called me up on the phone and said, \\"OMG...this is the way all vampire movies ought to be!\\"  Now people, you just cannot argue with a film that is so classic, SO well done and has eye candy that is SO much better (seriously) than those \\"new\\" films, that it's capable of jumping a 15+ year age gap!  I'm sure it must be a personal bias (not), but I have only two real pet peeves with this film, as follows...Spoilers Alert...<br />1. You cannot convince me for even a second that Star would have chosen Mr. Goody-two-shoes Boy Next Door (Michael) over the Sexy, Leather-Clad Bad Boy-James Dean-type on a Motorcycle (David). Nope, not buying it. (And okay, I get that it was 80s Hollywood and the villain has to bite it (ha) in the end for there to be that nice, pat happy ending everyone was expecting). ....Still so wrong. I mean, the dude had spurs on his boots, ladies. Spurs! Seriously. (And exactly WHERE do you think they got the idea for Spike later, anyway? (ala Buffy the Slayer)  hmmm? Hello! Few vampires on film or TV have ever had the same intensity and screen presence that Kiefer Sutherland projected with David ...And well, the man did end up being Jack Bauer later on, so... Wow, imagine running into both of them at once? ...Um, ladies, don't answer that, this is a G-rated review (not). Yes, but I know you were thinking it, because so was I. *snort. But I digress...<br />2. There is no way a 1/2 vampire for all of 2-days (Michael) is going to kill a full vampire (David) who has been around longer than his gang. The medals David wears on his coat (one a French Legionnaire's/Asterisk from the 5th period (1915-ish) and a British Iron Cross from WWII era, suggest he either killed officers that received them or was alive himself during those time periods). In any case, the dude is not 18, and he's not a young vampire, either. And what's with the antelope horns? A proposed sequel with Schumacher directing had David surviving that experience and returning in a subsequent film, because horns are not made of wood, after all, and because well, he is a bad*ss (stoopid Star). Too bad the originally planned sequel never got made since #2 and #3 did not live up to even the shadow of the original film.<br /><br />But despite these minor peeves, I adore this movie for so many reasons. So much so that my friends and I even started a SmartMob event to meet each July on the Boardwalk where the filming was done in Santa Cruz, CA (better known in the movie as Santa Carla)... just for the fun of it. Our group is LostBoysReturn. And we sure wish they could! Because there will never be anyone like Sammy, the Frog Bros., David and the Boys, Michael, Star, Lucy, Max, and Grandpa on film again... the movie was so well cast and so well acted that it's still timeless and a fabulously good time. If you haven't seen it yet, get on that, you're missing out!<br /><br />To say that I think the director, Joel Schumacher is a genius is an understatement. Give that man a medal... just not one of David's, please. A fun piece of trivia about this 1987 flick: When Joel Schumacher was shooting this film, the studio kept asking him, \\"Are you making a horror film or a comedy?\\" and he would always just say, \\"Yes.\\"  Priceless.<br /><br />Now, I have only one last thing to say to all you \\"then and now\\" vampire lovers outthere: If David and Edward both walked through a spider web, David would make a snack of the spider and Edward would drop his sparkle and scream like a girl! Team David, I say!!there: If David and Edward both walked through a spider web, David would make a snack of the spider and Edward would drop his sparkle and scream like a girl! Team David, I say!!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|First off,I am a huge Jimi fan. This cd is exactly what I thought it would be from Janie. Scraping the bottom of the barrel for more money, but there is some great stuff here. For Jimi fans out there who liked the \\"Crash Landing\\" & \\"Midnight Lightning\\" albums, it's great to hear \\"Somewhere\\" with the original tracks, Jimi's wah-wah guitar on the song is Fantastic!! \\"Gypsy Boy\\" is even better than the overdubbing job that Alan Douglas did on the \\"Midnight Lightning\\". The lamest song on the cd (\\"Let Me  Move You\\") with Lonnie Youngblood on Sax & Vocals has the best Hendrix solo on it. Jimi just lets loose.\\"Hear My Train\\" which has been on countless cd's has another Jimi solo that shows whatever song he plays will be different. Bottom line, if you love Jimi, then this stuff is good, if you're just starting out on him, go for \\"Are You Experienced\\", \\"Axis:Bold As Love\\" or \\"Electric Ladyland\\"
B00AA03D18|2.0|My reasons for ordering this book were: I wondered if the author might be related to a Dr. by same name that I knew back in 1959. He was a special MD and I had hoped to share my experience with author if he was.  Did not get answer from his website and I was very disappointed.<br />  Being retired from long history working in health care I always like to see what is &#34;new&#34; in spiritual experiences and how they line up with Scripture.  This book was confusing to me because of his terminology and my personal beliefs.  I cannot decide if he found the heaven of the Bible or manufactured his own.<br /><br />mary wright mcharris<br />Knoxville,TN

B008HK3XU4|3.0|I love the color of it, and the overall case is good.  The only thing I'm a little disappointed in is the material that keeps it standing in upright position.  I've only had it for a couple of months, and already it seems that the material has become a little slippery and doesn't hold things up well.  If I stand it upright, it's okay, but to put it at a different angle so it's easier to write on my email, it slides right down.  Makes it difficult to read at this angle too.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the large print and the fact that it is easy to use and has large buttons that fits my large fingers.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Best album of the year.  Would highly recommend this to others. Joe Walsh is at his best, clean and sober.
B008Q08EV8|2.0|Stylized violence and individual combat with some fantasy weapons and a 100ib female Celtic warrior that can go toe to toe with 225lb soldiers for physical strength.<br /><br />Other than a lot of special effects blood from huge gaping wounds, I'm not sure what they were trying to do with the movie.

B0091REZMW|4.0|it is a good game if you like a game of hidden objects. The one thing i don't like about it is that it requires a lot of energy to search a room. So you can only play the game for so long.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It was excellent!!  2 of my friends and I stayed up every night and watched at least 3 episodes until we were done!!!  Getting ready to watch Season 3 - can hardly wait!!  And then we have to wait until January 2014 for Season 4?????????  Oh what will we do?????
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome graphics. Works perfect on my Kindle Fire.  I definantly recommend getting..why not its free??!! Great way to waste some time :)
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Really. I've been into them since &#34;So Jealous!&#34; came out, and I've bought everything they've done since then. I saw them in 2007 on The Con tour- I still have the ticket stub from that gig. I myself have something to say to quite a few people instantly dismissing this album for being &#34;pop&#34; or too much of a departure: they've stopped making &#34;If It Was You&#34; a LONG TIME AGO!!! Really, they've made every album sound different since then, and you can hear it in the songs.<br /><br />I expect you guys would have figured that out with &#34;The Con&#34;, but come on, guys. Tegan & Sara have been transitioning into a more pop sound for a long time and even though there's a noticeable difference between this album and the rest, they're still Tegan And Sara. They're still the cute girls from Calgary with great voices and the ability to make us smile every time they show their faces. The point I'm trying to make is that difference is in the eye of the beholder- Artists have to change some time and if they keep going on with the same sound their whole careers, the formula is tiresome very quickly.<br /><br />I'm giving Heartthrob 4/5 as opposed to 5 because I've only listened to it a few times and although imlike it, I'm still not &#34;used to it&#34;. I mean, I know my opinion will change over time, and already it's growing on me, but it's an album that requires multiple listens to for the listener to really catch the charm. There really isn't a weak track at all- theynall sound like they could be future classics. I Couldnt Be Your Friend is the closest sounding to T&S of old, yet it still has their perky, upbeat pop sound. It's an enjoyable track that really stands out. Even the single &#34;Closer&#34; great too, and the closing tune &#34;Shock to Your System&#34; is one of the best closers they've had in a long time.<br /><br />So overall, if you can look past that they'll never make The Con Part 2 or So Jealous! Part 2, this album should be as enjoyable to you as the others. Sure it isn't as good, but it's enjoyable enough on its own right and it will grow on you. Recommended, for sure.le to you as the others. Sure it isn't as good, but it's enjoyable enough on its own right and it will grow on you. Recommended, for sure.

B004Q9TK98|5.0|The reason why I read Jodi's books is because of her biliary to get inside people's heads.  This is no different. An incredible story showing such insight into the struggles faced by Max and Zoe, Vanessa and Liddy.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|I have watched the first two movies, so I thought I would download the books on my kindle, and read them.
B00BGZ8TVA|3.0|This film should NOT be rated PG. PG-13 maybe, for the average viewer. I was prepared for some jarring scenes, but I thought the movie in its entirety would offset them. I was wrong. The majority of the movie was upsetting and overpowered the story, leaving me depressed. The visual effects were beautiful, and the ending was cool. The message of spirituality is pretty much rammed down your throat; something that wouldn't have normally bothered me as I am a very open-minded Aethiest, but I was already in a high state of distress from the storyline. I'm not saying it's a bad film, but it is definitely NOT a film for sensitive animal lovers. For other points of view, read the many other reviews.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I gave it 3 stars becauseI have not read the book yet, but I loved the movie, after watching it I decided I would read the book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ok so my friend Rose said this book was amazeballs good. And I had to know what amazeballs was like. Now I know. OMG this was one of the best books I have ever read. So emotional and intense and honest. I loved the way it was written and the way the story line flowed with the build up and final realizations about everything and the impact it all had. Wow. I might need therapy or at least a hug.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very soothing while still being totally engaging. Beautiful graphics and sounds add to the allure of this game. If you can only have one game - this is the one to have.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|If you don't use wifi, don't click &quot;buy.&quot; You are not provided with the NECESSARY info until AFTER you have bought the game; wifi is REQUIRED to download. They aren't good about giving refunds either.

B00ARAO720|5.0|While I don't care for actors, or everyday people with hypenated names/descriptions, Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivered a superb performance in this action packed thriller.  Never having been to NYC, it gave me a new perspective beyond Google Maps in how large and busy the city is.  5 out of 5.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Touching on so many levels.  Entertaining, didactic, philosophical, insightful, and fun while describing the hurdles, pitfalls, and pain of life.<br /><br />I miss reading it...
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I'd already read some other books on the subject, but this one is particularly well written, and besides the science, talks about the different aspects of trying it out. Good combination of theory and practice.<br /><br />Personally, I'm currently doing a variation of this this program where instead of 'fasting' for 24 hours while you do still eat 500kcal, I don't eqt qt all for 16, meaning I simply don't snack after dinner and skip breakfast (do drink water and tea, of course). Even with just this, I'm losing about 1-2 pounds per week. That's more than I would expect from a simple diet, which would take far more mental effort as well. The simple calories in / calories out equation does not seem to apply here. And there's the health benefits to boot :)
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I am not sure why the critics were so hard on this movie. Its not trying to win drama of the year. This is this decades Independence Day. Its really fun, the sci-fi is legendary and there are some really cheesy, patriotic feel good moments. The action is really great and it catches you off guard sometimes. Overall, this is a really fun, Friday popcorn movie that everyone in the family will enjoy.

B009B2VBWE|3.0|This album is good.  I've listened to it repeatedly.  However, it's not the same style, feel, or sound that we've grown accustomed to from Diana Krall.  Enjoy the music, but if you're looking for more Jazz and Standards from her, buy one of her other albums instead.
B000679QK2|4.0|Nice collection of Genesis Hits, over all most of the one's I remember from the past are on these 3 CD's not all are my favorite songs, probably could compile what I liked most on one CD.<br />The Import was at a very good price with no problems with shipping and handling.

1451662432|5.0|It is what it is an biography on Arnold Schwarzenegger. If you're an Arnold Fan you'll enjoy it. I have to say it's definitely worth it on Audio cd because it's partly narrated by Arnold himself which is great. By this time we've all grown used to his accent and there were many times if parts of the book he seems to starts ad libbing with classic Arnold mannerisms.  I humorously noticed early one when he lets out \\"and all deez kinds of tings\\" which he's known for. Classic

B003EYVXTQ|4.0|If you're a fan of Jennifer Lawrence after seeing The Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook, you might be interested in seeing the film that put her on the map. She gained a Best Actress nomination for her performance in Winter's Bone, and after seeing it for the second time, I have come to the conclusion that it may be a better performance than her 2013 Oscar-winning effort. I say that because of the demands of the role, and not because anything was lacking in her Oscar-winning performance.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is an incredibly bleak story. Ree Dolly (Lawrence) is 17, and her very existence is a challenge. Her father is missing and about to stand trial for manufacturing crystal meth. Unfortunately, he put up their house as collateral for his bail, and it will be taken from her within a week if he fails to show up. Ree's mother rarely talks and is incapable of taking care of her and her young brother and sister. As a result, Ree is responsible for the entire family.<br /><br />In order to resolve her situation, she must find her father. There's also the chance that he's dead, and she would have to prove it to the authorities if that turned out to be the case. So, Ree sets off to discover the truth. The story takes place in the Ozarks, and everyone she questions is aggressive, dangerous, guarded, or a combination of all three. It's risky to even pursue her investigation with some of those she encounters also mixed up in the illegal drug trade.<br /><br />If you thought Lawrence was plucky in The Hunger Games, you'll be amazed by the things she has to deal with in Winter's Bone. This world is real, and director Debra Granik doesn't pull any punches. The result is a tense thriller, but it's not an action movie. The tension is more in the style of Hitchcock because we know that Ree is in danger the whole time.<br /><br />The other outstanding performance in the film comes from John Hawkes as Teardrop. He doesn't say much, but his character oozes menace every time he appears. He also earned an Oscar nomination, and it's hard to argue with that decision. If you saw him as Mark in The Sessions, you might find it difficult to believe that Teardrop is played by the same actor.<br /><br />Lawrence is off to a strong start with two Oscar nominations and a win by the age of 22. After seeing her play Ree Dolly, I think it's clear that she has a lot more range than most young actresses, and it will be interesting to see what she does over the next few years.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is a scary place to visit, but it's a riveting piece of drama with superb acting. It didn't find a large audience in theaters, but the Blu-ray experience is a good one. Don't watch it if gritty realism isn't your thing.he appears.

157421327X|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one. I recommend Joy of Zentangle, which is quite comprehensive (containing everything in Basics and much, much more) and beautifully illustrated, instead of this extremely slender volume.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|The concept is interesting and I think that some people would really enjoy it, but I found it rather boring.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I waited 57 years to read this book! It was fantastic-not unlike the movie, but different. I highly recommend it!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Loved it all.......the characters, the history, the story's ability to draw one in..... didn't want it to end.  So enthralling could not put the book down.
B00846TTDG|5.0|The movie is unique in several respects.  First the story line is minimal with the movie primarily driving home the courage, training, high tech equipment of the worlds most elite fighting force based on several missions that comprise the story.  Second the Navy Seal main characters are portrayed by real life active duty Seals.  The less than stellar acting ability of the Seals can be easily excused because the action sequences are so well done they carry the movie.  Also, its easy to see past the acting with men who are so deserving of our respect and gratitude and I feel privileged to see the real people in action.  For me I would not trade better acting for the real thing.<br /><br />This unique mix of real and theater with the most intense, gripping suspenseful action sequences I've seen in a long time makes this an excellent movie.  The location filming also adds to the overall quality.<br /><br />My thanks to our military.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really addictive game. There is a wide variety of puzzles and games. Having to earn points to unlock the games is another game in itself.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|He told the story of physics today in a clear, effective manner.  The book was easy to read but had deep insightful points which were explained and left to the reader to ponder.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I Really liked this novel, especially the second part of it. The first part was especially slow, going through different aspects of the narrator's life. The second part was very interesting. It makes you wonder which story you want to hear? the one about the animals or the one he tells the officers?
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season three takes this show in such different directions each week. It seems like each episode has shocking conclusions that continue to lead up to, what I hope, is a fitting end to the Governor (I hate that S.O.B.)
B000NWJI6C|5.0|Fits in a large shirt pocket, and seems durable.  Good, well designed, user interface.  Excellent functionality.  No unit conversions.  Not RPN, but better in every other way than the HP35s.  Fantastic.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|If you have not seen this film, don't EVER watch this film!  This is a complete and utter waste of time.  With the expection of perhaps two or three of the main actors giving their all to roles they certainly knew were bad, there is really nothing I can say nice about this movie.<br /><br />1. The story is aweful, that's putting it nicely because I could rant for an hour on how bad the story is alone.<br />2. The acting is just as bad.  The only saving grace is watching Byron Mann (Ryu from the first Street Fighter movie) play a ridiculous character.  To be fair, Russell Crowe and Rick Yune seemed to do their best at trying to save bad roles.<br />3. The music selection is distracting.  Choosing to play nearly incoherent rap over unexplained scenes that supposedly impact the story line does nothing but distract from whats going on.  In fact, there are entire sections of the film I can barely remember simply due to how disconnected the music was.<br />4. RZA, and everything about him.  I may be unfairly bashing RZA (the actor for the main role and director responsible for this travesty), but every part of his involvement in the movie is most notably horrible.  He can't act, period. When he is attempting to deliver dialouge he can barely be understood.  The costume wardrobe he has for most of the film would be laughable if it actually felt like it was intended to be a joke (he spends about half the film walking around a beat up Chinese village dressed like Ezio from the Assassin's Creed games). His atempts at fighting are pathetic, like watching kids with a camera play power rangers. All the decisions for the film were his responsibility as the director and therefore I can aim all my disappointment squarely at him.<br />5. All the combat scenes are bad.  I can appreciate the Tarantino style gore, but to actually do \\"wire-fu\\" this bad in a kung fu 'parody' goes beyond deliberate and into the realm of incompetent. The film could have been justified if all else were bad so long as it actually had engaging fight scenes (the movies it's based on were like that), but this movie fails on that most important ingrediant.<br />6. Lastly, it feels too long.  At only 95-107 minutes (depending on which version you watch), the movie itself is not long, but it is so filled with extranious backstories, worthless side stories and explanations, and forgettable if not unhearable dialouge that the movie just grinds on forever.<br /><br />It's sad to see so many good names drug through the mud in this film.  Do not be fooled by the \\"Tarantino Presents\\", RZA was the director and main screenplay and story writer for this movie.  Knowing that films like this can be done right (see Kung Pow: Enter the Fist and Tarantino's own Kill Bill) and that expectations for this kind of movie really shouldn't be that high, it is a total shame to see a movie like this take money that could have been used for much more worthy projects.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I began reading this book about two weeks ago, after seeing it referenced in a health magazine. If the first three chapters aren't enough to make you change your perspective on food, then put the book down, and keep your extra tire.  I've lost 5lbs in these two weeks, am significantly less hungry throughout the day, am sleeping more solidly, and have lost several inches from my belly! I'm only 1/3 through the book and am convinced that the wheat of today's world is poison to most of us....Skinny feels better than the feel of bread or pasta in my mouth...I'll miss you wheat. Fair-well!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book.  It would make a great movie, like &#34;Roots&#34; did.  I was always guessing what was going to happen next and read the book almost non- stop.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I might as well get onto the web page and log on. It's slow and doesn't work all the time.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|The plot is thin and the protagonist is constructed in a very superficial manner.<br />Whilst I read the book it has not motivated me to read anymore. What's worse is there are typographical errors throughout the text. It is no Game of Thrones as it was compared to. Save yourself the time and read something else.
B005MRXS78|4.0|I used this in conjunction with a QM-1 Portable Camera Mount (for tennis, mainly) and a very light GoPro camera.  I could see on my iPhone what the GoPro was seeing,  and then adjust the picture and zoom to make it \\"perfect\\".  Although the camera mount works fine by itself, being able to move the GoPro around just slightly was interesting.  When I film a tennis match for someone else and charge them $100.00, this will be helpful.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Great start to an ending, leaves you &#34;Thirsting&#34; for more at the end, sad that the saga is almost over but enjoying the path to the end.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is a review on the vinyl.<br />Negative reviewers should be disregarded. Let's start with the packaging which is first class. Huge great picture and story book. LP has low background noise, and a texture and feel to the notes that put Jimi right in the room. Way better than late domestic pressings I own. I like the 200 gram weight. The protective sleeves are top notch two layer antistatic. The music is great, and I have the primary four Jimi albums to compare to, as well as great bootlegs, like the one with Morrison. (Listening final stage is through JBL 100s. Probably what the early works were mixed down on.)<br />Hope the wife stays out. I'm cranking this!

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I don't like racing games - I mean I REALLY don't like them - I'm more of a puzzle person - but I remembered being in an arcade in NYC with my Dad racing dune buggies against each other, eating Nathan's hotdogs, walking along Broadway and having a great time... so for old time sake I checked out this FREE app. not expecting much - Well...Surprise! Surprise! This has now become one of my favorite games. The graphics are second to none-the music is upbeat but not annoying, in fact the music goes perfectly with the game and the controls work brilliantly with the Kindle Fire. I love the fact that I can use tilt or touch control. I like tilt because it feels more like I'm using a steering wheel. I use my thumbs for the brakes. There are all sorts of really fun power-ups that you earn by picking up coins during your drive/race. I also like the fact that if I hit something the game doesn't stop -instead the thing that I hit breaks apart...there are also all kinds of upgrades you can buy with the coins you earn ( (no need to spend real cash - a BIG plus)- for instanced ...new dune buggies - new drivers and sooo much more. As a matter of fact there is sooo much going on in this game (without it being overwhelming) that it would take me too long to name them all...besides, discovery is half the fun, yes? Glad we agree. :-)....Hope this review has been helpful to you. Rainbows
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In all Subway Surfers is a great game , however just like any other game it has it's flaws but the only main improvement it needs is that it's hard I think if it was easier people would have a lot more fun on it.
1423140605|5.0|It is an awesome book with a shocking ending and a couple of twists and turns I know that the readers will love it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Thought provoking story, well written and well rounded. Can't wait to now see how the movie can do it justice...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am SO addicted to Pinterest. What better way then to have an actual app for it. A lot easier then having to go to the website every time.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Showtime has unskippable content which is truly annoying.  It goes on for minutes at a time.  Dexter is great as usual--but if you have an alternative to using the DVDs, I'd suggest using the alternative medium.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Had to download the app a few times for it to show up on my Kindle but now it works fine. It does take a little time to load Facebook at first but then it works fine. Better layout then if you were to just go through the website.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie but stuck with it.  I thought Helen Hunt and John Hawkes were superb. This was really touching...no pun intended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a fun game to play. You can have two options creative, and survival. It would be better if it could be cheaper than $7.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This left me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.  This is great especially if you are &#34;older&#34;.  Dame Maggie Smith is my fav since Downton Abbey.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|U Just Got This Today And It Is So Cool I Felt like i was dreaming but i was not i played the game all day long and i beat the hole campaing it is the best game ever and it even has multiplayer<br /> Totaly woth the money i recomend you guys buy this im 11
0817439390|5.0|This book will explain the science of exposure in an understandable language and give you tips on how to get those amazing photos you bought your DSLR for. Must have!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was good<br />It was better then temple run<br />Ha you should try it and tell me about it good
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so cool. I love PC, and my brother keeps bugging me when the 7.0 update comes out.<br />I just hope that in that update that there would be mobs and nighttime in Creative mode. It's also be cool if there was Redstone and the original Nether Portal. It would be really cool if Flint and Steel was in Creative, and cheats could work, too. Other than the really needed updates, I LOVE THIS!!!!!!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy was my favorite of the series so far.  Great action, good storyline, the video/audio transfer to Blu Ray looked and sounded great.  I could rattle the windows and stir my coffee at the same time!
B00004R99L|5.0|I have never seen this movie and i took a chance at buying it and it was really good. It showed up in perfecet condition and it showed way before they said it would.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I sampled other free calculators. This was the best of the pack.  I wish it had a key for double zeroes. I own a manual calc that has this key.  It's a great app once you get hang of it.
B009DA74ES|5.0|This dude's personality sells the show, pretty much apathetic about everything and everyone he encounters except his daughter and her mother. All the adults behave like adolescents but the shows are never boring and bogged down with fake emotion and drama, the people act real.<br /><br />Probably the best show on TV, any channel since it has come out, I'd say it's tied with &#34;Dexter&#34;
0062206044|5.0|I really really liked this book even though it was pretty sad. There were some really interesting parts. I think other kids would like it too. - Stella (3rd Grade)
B005FISBTO|5.0|I love Dexter, very gratifying in that he is a killer with a conscience and never hurts innocents, too bad our police and military can't operate like this, America would be a paradise.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|Default on power up should go right to easiest setting. It does not. You must push two buttons every time you power up
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Get books for cheaper than hardcopies on the go, easy to read, scroll and locate specific text with search options, saves a ton of space so I can jump from one book to another depending on the mood I'm in.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Plot was so thin and obvious. I did like the lead actor, but could tell he needed more direction. He was amazing in Game of Thrones.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This is a fascinating and in-depth history of past U.S. Presidents, how many of them collaborated, or sometimes refused to  collaborate, with their successor.  Their enormous egos and political personalities often worked against this, but, for some, their love of country, and the office of the Presidency brought them together to work through crises and enormously difficult problems.
0399157565|1.0|This book is more of the same, with too, too much psycho feelings and excessive fillers. It has been a long time since Patricia Cornwell has written a good book. But with this one, I could skim over pages of nonsense trying to get to to the end. Frankly, it was all a waste of time. This may be my last read of her books.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I had never read any of Hoover's books, but this was quite entertaining!  Would like to read more of her works.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|KIDS AND ADULTS LOVED IT!  Be sure to buy this if you can! It is one of those movies that will be a favorite for YEARS!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I'm a total horse freak and I love playing this when I'm not with my actual horse :)
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I particularly admire the point of not confusing acting out of fear or bad behaviour with who we are divinely.  To accept that someone, like a murder, at soul level, perfect and divine, is the perfect place to stretch in truly finding non judgement and healing
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love waking up to my favorite songs by using this app on my Kindle Fire.  I love all the different settings that are available.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very good movie, I loved every minute.  Bravo Canada for helping our people in need.  Great story that kept you guessing.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The the HOs had a nice twist to them and the puzzles were challenging but not too difficult.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie, it was well written and acted.  I liked it so much I purchased a copy after my rental.  It is still a great movie each time I watch it.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is one of the most challenging films to review. Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today.<br /><br />Widely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust. It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.<br /><br />The first element of note is the phenomenal cast. Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous. A real, raw, and emotional performance. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation. His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film. Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people. It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style.<br /><br />Right off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white. This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy. The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience. The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places. John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date. Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).<br /><br />Being a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence. It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back. I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart. But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.<br /><br />I will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart. Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />It's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind. And that's a good thing. While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film. In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten. Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtably remain a classic for ages to come.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw.  The sharp remaster is somewhat interesting, as I believe that black and white films are better with a softer edge instead of razor sharp HD quality, but this strikes just the right balance of soft edges yet distinct detail.  The audio is as good as it can be. It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either. In terms of a remaster it's awesome. The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray. Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV.<br /><br />5/5 - A classicemaster is somewhat interesting, as I believe that black and white films are better with a softer edge instead of razor sharp HD quality, but this strikes just the right balance of soft edges yet distinct detail.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I found the story uninteresting and the bear character offensive.  I had a hard time finishing the movie to the end.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|They rely on special effects and cliche acting styles to create a movie that is the epitome of a boring 'blockbuster'. Apparently, the script writer forgot how to write characters or tell a story if he ever knew at all.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed reading about what the guys go through in their training and how the whole thing played out from the REAL hero's viewpoint. I thought it was a bit hard to follow the first few chapters but once they got to the mission to kill bin laden it was gripping.  I loved the fact that he expressed his true feelings towards the &#34;leadership&#34; of our country. More of an honest version of what happened than the movie &#34;Seal team 6&#34;.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|She absolutely loves being able to read Amazon books on her tablet. The app works perfectly, is easy to use too! Thanks Amazon!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig - what else is there to say?  HOT HOT HOT.  He is a snack cake for the eyes ladies and a joy to watch.
B004XQYBA2|2.0|It was too hard to figure out how to work the components of the game.  There wasn't clear instructions or help.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I am so happy to learn of Sixto Rodriguez! What a fantastic story and what a great man! Not to mention his music, which I am now going to download!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This is a solid 5 star rating. I would rate it higher if I could. I will tell you right now without a lot of dazling words  This is the best CD I have bought in years!!! Dave Grohl you are now my new hero. I just wish more people shared your passion for real music and real recordings. Thank you so much for this recording.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was the best book I ever read I would read it over and over again I would recommend you this book for sure
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game very good graphics seems like the pic is actually in 3d. def reccommended. also lots of options to pick from.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Having lived through the Kennedy asassination, I found this to be fasinating in the historical construction (fact-based) that King used.  I also enjoy sci-fi, so that was also an attaction.  Really loved the book and was sorry it ended!
B002G4FQI4|5.0|A great, great addition to my Benson collection.  George is a true jazz legend.  A great buy for the price.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very Nice Bible. God's Words Look Nice In This Cover.<br /><br />Going To Church With This One Sunday.<br /><br />Thank You Amazon
B00821OX98|4.0|I wanted to leave 3-1/2 stars but didn't know how to do it. The casting is weak in my opinion and at first the story was as well but as it progressed, the storyline and human relationships became more dynamic and exciting. I began to care about certain characters which is always a hook for me. I do enjoy sci fi so am willing to put up with less than stellar productions. I watched all the available episodes and am looking forward to the next season.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|After a while it stops working, it may be free, but don't waste your space on ur phone or kindle with this app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel caught me by surprise, from the beginning to the end. It came out to be a lover story/thriller suspense that grabbed me! I could not put the book away. Loved it!
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|I found this collection of tunes to be a very pleasant surprise. A great tribute to the funk of old.
B002HSSAY6|4.0|Good action with some plot twists.The usual good guy as the quikest and most accurate shot with what goes around comes around.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Boz Scaggs has aged very nicely, this collection of cover tunes works very well. the choice of songs on this disc are right in Mr Scaggs wheelhouse.
B008ROZAQU|3.0|If you like John Wayne it's a typical Duke type action movie however very predictable and less dramatic than most of his movies.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The story in The life of Pi is a movie with a soul of it's own.  The viewer is on this trip with the character Pi and you can feel his heartache and struggle throughout the movie.  The details and scenery were breathtaking as were the computer generated effects.  I wish I would have seen this in the theaters but will be there if it ever gets released a second time.
0887431461|5.0|Great practice book. A ton of pages to keep a child entertained for days! Great prep for my 4 yr old!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|loading pages is awful! very slow,much distortion on pictures. jumps from page to page without touching screen. I don't recommend.
B00AYQNOU8|4.0|This was an interesting film but I did find at the end of it I was in a somber mood. There is no dialogue to speak of but the images on screen are engaging. I would recommend watching it. I like that the director let the images speak for themselves and did not feel a need for narration. I would assume that 2 people watching this film would have 2 very different reactions to it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After hearing a lot of people talking about it, I began watching and it is so intriguing! You won't be disappointed!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked this movie. It is a good story told well. I don't believe it was the best movie of the year but I rarely do agree with the Oscar picks. The movie is worth watching.
B000GT7XXW|5.0|If Branagh's including every word of the consensus-script of Hamlet were all, who would care? What matters is that we get to see a production make dramatic sense of all those parts and speeches or parts of speeches that usually get cut. Every speech, every scene, gets energetically interpreted, and not only with regard to the acting: the mis-en-scene is continually delightful. Some of the settings might be over the top (the mirrored great room of state, the steam of purgatory rising out of the ground), but hooray for boldness. The casting is wonderful and contains fun surprises (Gerard Depardieu as Polonius' spy, Judi Dench in a cameo as Hecuba); Kate Winslet is physically bigger than, and plays the part differently from, other Ophelias I've seen: loved her interpretation. Only Jack Lemmon (that twangy American accent) as Marcellus and Robin Williams as Osric seem not artistically comfortable or as if from a different production, not artistically comfortable. Some might find Branagh himself, as Hamlet, a bit too full of himself, but I find him continually intelligent, persuasive, clear as a diamond.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Very good game and graphics. Enjoyed playing and following the story line. Downloaded and played on my Kindle fire with no problems. If you enjoy other G5 games, this one will not disappoint.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Both Megan and Connor think they have a plan.  Then they get together and things change.  It takes Connor longer to discover that he is in love.  All for another happy ending.
B00003CX5P|4.0|First thing first, when news came in the mid 90's that a prequel trilogy was coming I was as happy as the next Star Wars fan - only exception was that I never got my hopes up that Lucas would recreate the magic that went into Episodes IV, V, & VI. It was never going to happen - that magic was gone and would never come back......and Lucas wasn't the same guy he was when he wrote the first 3. So right off the bat, I knew that all 3 prequels would be a different set automatically. Most rational fans thought the same.<br /><br />As far as those \\"fans\\" and supposed movie buffs claiming everything from \\"worst movie ever\\" to \\"garbage\\" either need their heads examined or need to really get out more often and see more movies - because there is a LOT worse things out there. This wouldn't make the top 1,000 worst movies of all time. Supposed movie buffs and fans make me laugh at times. Just to get that out of the way.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as the current 6 Star Wars movies out there go....yes, this is the worst of the 6.<br /><br />The casting of Anakin (Jake Lloyd) was bad - he was unlikable in Jingle All the Way and now here he was as a young Darth Vader. The Jar Jar Binks character was terrible and annoying of course. Yes, Lucas put the character in to appeal to the kids in the same way he thought Ewoks appealed to the kids of another generation (really young kids did - my ten year old self didn't really care for them). The pacing was lackluster at best, but still generally a good movie - just a poorish Star Wars movie when compared to Episodes IV, V, and VI.<br /><br />Overall though, this was NOT a bad movie and any respectable Star Wars fan would agree. Sure, it was a letdown from all the years of nothing, but that should have been expected from the beginning. From an objective standpoint this was still an entertaining movie even through the Lloyd casting, the Binks character, the Gungans, the boring pod race, and the rest of the poorest points of the movie. I've watched it multiple times since it was released and of course own a copy on both DVD and Blu-Ray (along with the others).<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're a Star Wars fan - you should still find a way to enjoy the movie. But to call this movie \\"garbage\\" or \\"worst movie ever\\" is just simply ridiculous. Calling it that means that you just don't watch enough movies. Watch Shark Attack 3 (for starters)and see what truly is worthy of being called \\"worst movie ever\\" - because this absolutely does NOT deserve that title or anything like it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the original trilogy and have yet to see the newer trilogy - keep your expectations realistic that those movies won't be repeated. Just like fans already anticipating that the new trilogy coming from Disney....they may be great, they may be blah, but they will never duplicate the originals. I as a Star Wars fan will see them and not compare them to something they should not be compared to. Check this out with an open mind and I think you'll be ok.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Read all of this author's books and they seem to be becoming rather formulaic.  But I know I will be drawn back into her stories whenever they are published.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another great Bosch novel.  I like how it goes back to a case he stared 20 years ago, and he's able to resolve it.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I love that this gives some great tips and also that it is available as a digital copy. I can take it anywhere on my iPhone/iPad. Great book to always have on hand!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I'd say this is a tween book.  The characters are in high school.  But that's okay with me, I like tween reads (even though I'm in my 30s).  It's a brainless read, until about the final 1/3 of the book.  I thought I knew what was going to happen, and there is a great twist that makes you want to stay up all night to finish it.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I love this classic and was excited to watch it again. When I was watching it I was disappointed to find that it ended at chapter 17 and having to flip it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't want to &#34;spoil&#34; for anyone, but this is one of the few books that has kept my attention in the past year.  I'd say it's up there in my top ten for how it resolved.  i do with the ending was different, but 1 chapter compared to the entire book, i can't really complain.  but it seems more realistic, though i wish it was different.  you'll understand when you read it......get it!
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|The book is a great read and this movie had the potential to be great. Unfortunately it looks like the best part of this movie will be in \\"The Hobbit 2\\" or whatever they call it..... This is not a project that should have been stopped where it was, or at all, and the way it was stopped was anticlimactic to say the least. At least the LOR series left you emotionally engaged and wanting more at the end of each movie.... It should also have been published that this was meant to be a two film series, that way those who have read the book would understand that the end of this movie would be before the end of the book. Also there were things in the movie that were not in the book IIRC, like the sword they found, nor Sarouman. Guess I need to read it again to be sure.... Bottom line, this movie started slow, sped up for a couple of brief periods, then returned to slow and then ended slow, disappointing to say the least..... Hope #2 is better......
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good game.  Not one of those extremely easy game to beat.  My kids like it and it is a good time killer.
0345803507|5.0|An absolute page turner!<br />Very well written, but it will cause sleepless nights as it is difficult to put down!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit Ninja.  This is a good version for being free. I would recommend.  The kids love playing it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|sigh*** if i could only begin to describe to you how good this movie is.......<br />i am sure your here reading this because you've only heard good things about this movie so might be thinking &#34;hey i should consider adding this to my collection of wonderful classics&#34;.<br />yes you should. why?<br /><br />1. i have never felt this emotional about a movie ever.<br />2. hit home on every aspect.<br />3. the director poured his heart and soul into this movie.<br />4. because your to smart to know that any bad review about this movie is just nonsense<br />5. the actors are only the second best part about this movie<br />6. you can watch it over and over and will always leave you amazed of how such a small movie can do so much<br />7. it moved you and in my opinion changed my outlook on life and made me a better person knowing that theirs others going through struggles and its just awesome and cant be put into words.<br />...dont hurt yourself by not having this on DVD...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So mu&ccedil;ch fun.I am glad I have my horse because its like taking care of a real horse but in a game.You will love this game once you play it.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I've only made it to the ninth board, but if the rest of the game resembles the first few boards than its quite repetitive. Hope there are varied challenges to come.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|I would compare this to the Back to the Future movies in that the second and third installments recycled the same basic story and jokes. This is the first film in a new location, but with pretty much the same plot, many of the same jokes (or cruder variations on the jokes). Even the film makers stated that this one was too close to the first movie and have promised the third one will be different.<br /><br />If you liked the first movie you will probably fall into one of two camps. You will either like this one, but not as enthusiastically as the first, or hate it because they just did the same story. If you were lukewarm to or did not like the first movie you will probably not like this one.  That is not to say that everyone will fall into one of those groups, but that seem to be where many people fall.  I know some love this movie as much or more than the first, and I know some are pretty indifferent to it.  That is really subjective to begin with.<br /><br />The positives to this movie are that Zach Galifianakis gives another great performance, and the cast had the same great chemistry as in the first movie.  That ultimately why this one work to the extent that is does.  If you are okay with the fact that you are not going to get much originality from this one then it is worth buying or renting. If not, then you probably want to skip it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|With other &quot;sound&quot; devices my brain is able to pick out the loop in the recording which spoils relaxation because that then becomes my focus. This is the only one I've found that I can listen to and on most sounds I cannot tell where it repeats. Incredible. I also love the limitless layering of sounds to create just the effect desired. As a chronic insomniac this app is invaluable.
1432794426|5.0|\\"Defending a King\\" was a fascinating read, giving an in-depth portrayal of Michael Jackson's final years. The author, Dr. Karen Moriarity, has revealed Michael's life in its full spectrum, from his many joyful experiences in fatherhood, to his many struggles and suffering at the hands of the press.  Michael's fans will learn the truth of his many-faceted experiences and how they formed his realities. I would recommend this book to all Michael Jackson fans.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Love the game, been playing for a few months. I do not like the fact that level difficulty only means your opponent is able to generate gold at increasingly faster rates, while you are still limited to your upgrades. It gets annoying when they can launch 3 ships to your 1. Would like to see the difficulty factor be in the points required to conquer a base. You build up your fleet then it is over too quickly because no matter the level of the base you attack, 200 points takes it.<br />Still it is a fun game and would love to see new levels. Also want a way to keep track of level you are on so if you leave you know where you left off.
6305252572|1.0|I am reviewing the DVD release, not the Blu-Ray. This DVD is labeled Widescreen but it is \\"standard definition widescreen\\". Meaning on today's nice widescreen TVs this movie is letterboxed top and bottom but plays only as wide as the standard definition TV screen. Think of it as being letterboxed on all four sides. In this day and age it is DISHONEST to advertise this as widescreen without including, CLEARLY, that it is SD format! DISHONEST! Amazon get with it!<br />Besides that the transfer is lousy. DON'T BUY the DVD until they re-release it!
B005DD7TI0|5.0|Interesting plot line. Some unexpected twists and turns. I like the overall premise and the story kept my interest. Well done.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Not my favorite story by Stephen King but by no means a waste of time to read! I was not bored.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I absolutely support the indie aspect of this book and the accolades that the author has received. The story was hard to get into for me though. I don't mind \\"end of times\\" types stories (just finished \\"The Stand\\" which was ok) but ultimately this was just too bleak for me. I wish the author well and hope indie publishing continues to succeed.
B005ZUR724|3.0|So this game was running fine before the update now that I updated it the graphics are horrid and the road in-game are all gone<br />PLEASE FIX THIS GAMELOFT!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I'm really blown away with this book. Great thing about this book is its concept. Different stories but all have same philosophy in the background. My fav stories are &#34;The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing&#34;, &#34;Letters from Zedelghem&#34; and &#34;An Orison of Sonmi~451&#34;. In my opinion &#34;Letters from Zedelghem&#34; is the best written one, the complete one, great structure, great writing and great story. Sonmi story is so inspired and truthful in its philosophy that I was touched and shaken after reading it. After I read a book I saw the movie and I liked it a lot because they menaged to convey the message of the book through the movie, and it wasn't easy thing to do. Thumbs up!

B000000OTU|2.0|I was excited to receive this item because after seeing Steven Tyler back on Idol it reminded me that it had been awhile since I just danced around the house to Aerosmith while cleaning. This disc however arrived and it skips the entire way through. With that being said, I was never able to dance around and clean to Aerosmith the original... more like the remix! :*(
B008CRC506|5.0|What a great and original series!<br />The dvd is brilliant, I am so happy that I decided to buy it.
B008EKOO46|5.0|In my opinion, Diamond tries to paint an accurate, realistic view of primitive peoples. He doesn't stereotype but gives his observations over many years of fieldwork. He doesn't present his interpretations as the final or only word on this subject. Additionally, his insight and the practical suggestions of what can be learnt, both good and bad, from primitive peoples is worth reading.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It really makes you wonder at times and you make so many elements! It is fun and interesting. At first I was confused but its simple and not to mention the other two games that are just like this which I proudly own :)
B00138CYD4|4.0|I had heard some of the newer songs on the radio. The version of Game of Love with Tina Turner on vocals just blows away the other version of the same song with Michelle Branch. Don't know why they released that version though. The older classics songs on there are a must have for any Santana fan.
B00338QENI|5.0|My friend started reading this book to me for entertainment as we floated in the ocean on the Carnival Triumph. Since we couldn't finish it, I had to download it myself- eventually my husband did the same. Skloot did such a great job combining the science with the human story of Henrietta's family.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really liked the first book, so of course  I jumped  right into this one. But the entire first 3/4 of the book just felt really  Long.and dragged out. It took me a while to get into the book. I just kept reading...when I finally felt the book starting to get really good I looked an saw I was at 70 % already. I am going to read the third one when it com  out of course, but don't have very high expectations for it.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|This is the One I was telling u about. It is a great app. It is Easy to. There are tons of very GOOD Booksto choose from. Download and enjoy!!
B007REV4T8|3.0|It's all right. It's James Bond. It's Daniel Craig's third appearance as James Bond. It's not Sean Connery. It's not Pierce Brosnan. It is, however, an improvement over Quantum of Solace.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|I just recived the movie in the mail and excited to open and watch it but when I put the Blu-Ray on my screen turned black as if it was turned off and to make things worse than it already is the tv screen flickered purple as if my screen was broken.  I would like an exchange please. Other than that the DVD works well but that's not the reason why I bought Blu-Ray.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I was surprised at the weight it added to the camera but the picture quality is amazing.  It really helps for locations that have difficult lighting.
1400067820|2.0|I am a voracious reader and big fan on Taleb's Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness. So I bought this book as soon as I saw it on the bookshelves.<br /><br />This book turned out to be a disappointment. It starts with the good idea that there are ways to be robust against random events, and even benefit from large random events. However, after that the book meanders through numerous rants against formal education, modern medicine, soccer moms etc, most of them unsupported by data (just personal philosophical statements). Mind you, I happen to agree with the author, but the way he presents these ideas is superfluous and yet pompous. There are also minor but annoying inconsistencies, like having a mortgage makes you fragile in one chapter and anti fragile in another, or running is much better than walking but in another chapter walking is highly recommended (and what do they have to do with being fragile or not?) - I wish the author had used a better editor or given the book a second pass to make his ideas more coherent.<br /><br />One of the worst features of the book is the constant references to Lebanon, Levantine culture, and how these are superior to all the modern Western world has to offer. It is on every page. And it feels like there is way too much first person bias all over. Too many mentions of f* you money (the author's main achievement in life, sounds like). The only personal anecdotes I truly enjoyed were his descriptions of his trading colleagues in London who were \\"very street people\\", avid drinkers, and cockney speakers.<br /><br />I very much agree with most of the points the author makes because they resonate with my personal philosophy. However, the book is not well organized, not eloquent, and much too long. It is rare for me to not finish a book. With this one I gave up in the middle and had to skim around towards the end. And I wished I hadn't spent as much time reading it...<br /><br />Not recommended unless you are huge fans of Nassim Taleb.

Yes, I've eaten all these things at one point in my life and to be honest I think I was in a food trance. Reading this book was more like a trip down memory lane at times. It is also a very revealing look at the processed food industry and how they rely on salt, sugar and fat to increase sales and beat out the competition. It is like they are battling for your very soul!<br /><br />\\"Salt, Sugar, Fat\\" is by far one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. Michael Moss presents such a vivid picture of the food industry that you can't help but read more and more. It is like he was actually there when major decisions were made. That is how good the \\"reporting\\" is.<br /><br />\\"They wanted formulations that would increase desire.\\" ~ Michael Moss<br /><br />I liked the information on how people shop in stores. I shop the same way. After reading this book I went into the grocery store with new eyes. I could literally see what I was being tempted to buy in a new way. Mostly I saw items with sugar in them and they were everywhere. I have gotten into the habit of buying more whole foods than convenience foods but suddenly everything in the store seemed to be rushing at me. This book made me way more aware. It is amazing what you miss when you don't understand the psychological aspects of a grocery store layout.<br /><br />Michael Moss is an excellent writer but at times he playfully taunts the reader with delicious descriptions of food. Don't be surprised if you get a craving while reading this book. He also delves into subjects quite deeply which is why the Kindle book is 7341 locations long.<br /><br />In this book you will read about mouthfeel, sugar enhancers, flavor burst, bliss point, line extensions and sensory-specific satiety. It would seem that humans have become too smart for their own good and now finding what pleases us is working against us.<br /><br />In the end Michael Moss does admit that what we eat is our choice. Still he gets into the minds of people who worked in the food industry and really reveals that the love of money really is the root of obesity.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewelves into subjects quite deeply which is why the Kindle book is 7341 locations long.<br /><br />In this book you will read about mouthfeel, sugar enhancers, flavor burst, bliss point, line extensions and sensory-specific satiety.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like the British Clasics... this is a great series with a mixture class, quality and soap opera.  Two out of three is good for me.
B000NTHT6G|5.0|I highly reccomend this movie to anyone looking for a good Will Ferrell movie. Hes a star as Harold Crick, this is a different character for Will as Ive always seen him in funny roles where he plays the loveable idiot. This movie is a great way to spend a family night. Id recommend it to anyone.
B00B780TAK|5.0|I am a big fan of first, The Tudors, and recently Donwton Abbey. Talk about a culture shock, going from one to the other! They both have very fully developed characters and fabulous costumes. As a seamstress, I can appreciate the work that went into just the look of each actor. The evil characters of The Tudors don't hold my interest as much as Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess. I love her piss-and-vinegar attitude juxtaposed with her love for her family. And the season 3 finale of Donwton Abbey rivals that of the vintage \\"Who shot JR?\\" episode of the original \\"Dallas\\".
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My husband and I do not have luxury of HBO, had to cut back. Our daughter got to see some of the Season I with friends, she got the DVD's and we were hooked.  Each episode grabs you and holds your interest.  Great service from Amazon.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|So I took a friend to see the Hobbit at midnight when it came out on a whim.  I hate crowded movie theatres, but I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep until I saw it.  A quote from my friend sum it up nicely.  After dropping her off, I got a phone call.  \\"It's four o'clock!  How long was that movie?  I had no idea it was that long cause it just flew by!\\"  People might have their opinions on how the movie should or shouldn't have been split into three almost 3 hour movies, but the fact is that the movie's pace doesn't really suffer for it.  I like to consider myself open minded to letting the director tell the story he wanted to tell thing the movie is fine how it is.<br /><br />The good news is there is no disputing that the 3D and special effects are the best of any movie to date.  On my Samsung 8000 series, I only saw cross talk during the Riddles in the Dark sequence and only an two or three shots.  And the picture is absolutely stunning.  This is definitely a reference quality Bluray and a welcom addtion to anytone's collection.  It's up there with Avatar as a movie you can show off your tv with.  Also, the sound and music are perfectly executed.  Dialogue is always clear.  And the production diaries do an amazing job of showing how absolutely monumental the task was that Peter Jackson set out to accomplish.  I think military invasions aren't as carefully crafted as this.  Also, for your money you get a 3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, standard DVD, and UV digital copy.  I honestly don't know why some of the reviewers here seem to hate UV or hate the theatrical version.  It's the same movie they saw and loved in theatres so why the hate?  Also, they haven't seen the extended edition yet, so how do they know that's the better version?<br /><br />Here's my unboxing and review on [...]

0062014536|3.0|In sheer desperation to read this book i bought it in hard copy as over here in Australia, it hasn't been released on kindle yet.  I feel like asking for my money back.<br /><br />It started off well but when when I realised that I was over half way through the book I started to think - this isn't going anywhere.<br /><br />There was so much more she could have done with the characters - I don't like to write spoilers so I won't go into detail but I felt like she didn't know what to do with the book so she just ended it.  Hugely disappointed.

B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I would have loved this game if it didn't lag so much! Its really fun but the movement is super slow and I end up tapping buildings and dinosaurs a million times before I end up collecting the coins. Also lost a dinosaur for 15 minutes after playing the code red mini game because of the super slow response. Maybe its just me.<br />I just deleted this game from my kindle fire. Last night I played it just fine and then today it downloaded 121.5 Mb then closes. I open it again, it does the same thing again. This was my favorite game despite the problems with the lag and I had put a lot of time into it. I'm very disappointed that I had to get rid of this game.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Love this movie tons of action, Great plot and storyline. I would watch it again. I would also recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I use this for the real time games that don't have notifications. The different alarm sounds are easy to hear. I like how it also tells you the weather. That's pretty nifty.
B008469DGY|4.0|I've been enjoying this game since I downloaded it a few weeks ago. I recommend this game for anyone who likes golf.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I heard that Skyfall was the picture to see. In my humble estimation it was good but not up to the standards of the previous Bond pictures. I also felt the beginning was somewhat confused and disjointed. But I still enjoyed it and perhaps my expectations were too high considering the build-up I had heard from the media.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|This negative and slide scanner is so easy to operate that even those of us who are old enough to have stacks of old slides and negatives can easily use this little device. The scanner is a compact little machine that you can connect to your computer, PC or Mac or if you prefer, you can plug it into the wall with a USB converter and use it away from the computer. Strips of negatives are fed into the side of the machine and you can advance them with a knob on the machine. There is a holder for single negatives. Slides are inserted into a little slot on the top of the machine. A little flip up LCD screen lets you see your photo. You are able to adjust the brightness and flip the image like on a mirror. Then simply hit the Scan and then the Save button to save it to your memory card. (The memory card isn't included.) Your scanned photos are stored on a SD card 32 GB or smaller. The images are high quality jpeg files, between 5 and 10 MB each.<br /><br />We scanned a bunch of slides downstairs, away from the computer and then took the memory card up to the computer when we had a bunch of images scanned. We used a memory card reader, the same one we use for pictures from our camera, and transferred them the same way. We could just as easily have connected the scanner to the computer. It shows up like an icon on the desktop. From there the images can be dragged to the desktop and saved. No software is needed to do this. Once they're on your computer, you can email or print them or just arrange them in folders to store. You could also use any photo editing software you own to add further effects to the pictures. You can also connect the scanner to your TV to see your saved images on the big screen. Looking at all these scanned photos is a real walk down memory lane. (Did we really dress like that?)<br /><br />The scanner comes with an AC wall plug power supply, a USB cable to connect it to your computer or the wall, a cable to connect it to your TV. a film holder for strips of film and one for a single piece of film.<br /><br />I love the compact size and the straightforward ease of use with this scanner. The price is reasonable, especially when you compare it to the cost of having a service scan your slides. Two thumbs up for this useful and simple to use product.<br /><br />I was supplied with a review sample of this product.s of film and one for a single piece of film.<br /><br />I love the compact size and the straightforward ease of use with this scanner.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I recommend this game for horse lovers. My favorite part is when you compete and train your horse the best. -Emily Age 8
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I'm definitely unsatisfied with the product delivered, specifically the Hunger Games DVD. The reason I'm upset about it, is because the DVD doesn't work. But what really angers me, is that you can clearly see where someone had written \\"Scratched Discard\\" on a piece of paper over the DVD cover and it was engraved on the case. So the fact that it seems they knowingly sent me a defective product is pretty upsetting.<br /><br />I can still use the Ultra-Violet Digital Copy, which is why I didn't return the product. It would have cost me money to return the product, so I just kept it and will use the Digital Copy.

B00BEZTMWW|1.0|I enjoyed the movie, but this ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" is an absolute joke. I have not bought blurays in the past because of Ultraviolet and I will not be buying this one either.
044024613X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  To me the characters were developed enough and the mood, from the beginning, foreboding all the way to the (to me) logical conclusion.  Perhaps the mother was a bit irritating, especially because her husband judged her as 'brilliant.'  The problem with a proper review is that one can's say too much about the plot.  Let me just say that I thought is was well-written and pulled me along until the end.
B003TTCURU|5.0|I got hooked on Grey's Anatomy several months ago when I got my Kindle and Amazon Prime.  I watched it from the first show on season 1, having never watched the show on TV.  I liked them all, but I thought season 6 was one of the best so far.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love the game, is challenging and fun. My son likes it too so we play together once in a while. I recommended for kids of any age.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I do not watch to much TV and for a long time have not liked any of the shows.  But this one is something different.  I cannot wait to see the next episode.  Love all the characters, acting, the direction and the cinematography.  A must watch for those who like history .
B00009W0U4|1.0|i only given it a star for some nice death. without such torment an death in the film its very impossible to watch. the whole film is terribly shot, the camera never holds still or stays in frame. the camera is constantly being thrown aroun an shaken. ( filmed as if a tornado was holding the camera) i had only bot it for its description of bein a sic film
B00846WWVM|5.0|it is so addicting and when I first played it I was glued to i<br />my dad loves it too<br />but be warned it is very challenging in the later levels<br />but overall I live it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!****@$%!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like temple run I love it. It is so intense because you have to slide and move!
B003L77NL8|3.0|No academy awards for acting, but ok story. Drags in places. In spite of good effort by Ron Howard's daughter to fill in as Victoria, the original Victoria was missed by fans. Twilight producers messed up on that. Should have waited for her to be available.
140131046X|5.0|Mitch inspires me to look at life diffrently live better. Amazing that his world has been filled with so many interesting people. A nonstop read.
B001AQR3IU|4.0|Interesting story that flows reasonably well. Likeable characters. Some slow places but worth keeping in my collection for future viewing.
B008I3RARW|3.0|I read the reviews before downloading the game. I agree that the five star reviews had to have been left be the developer/friends or people who have never had a race game before, or maybe any app for that matter. The only reason I rated this app as high as three stars is because I got it while it was the faotd. Had I paid for it, I would have been extremely upset and it would have gotten a much lower rating. This app is not anywhere near a five dollar app!  As a matter of fact .99 cents would be pushing it until they fixed a few major problems.<br /><br />The problems with the throttle and steering are the most obvious. First, it is very difficult to regulate the speed of the car. The amount of 'tilt' between slow and full speed is so slight it's very hard to maintain a constant speed while at the same time tilting the device side to side to turn. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />Second, the steering needs to be proportional to your speed. I noticed that while going slow and trying to turn, just a slight tilt slammed the front wheels one direction Or the other so you couldn't turn just a little.<br /><br />This game is ok for a starter, or a developers first attempt at a racing game, but it needs work and a HUGE PRICE REDUCTION!! If you want to play around with it, get it while it's free, but don't pay for this one unless you feel the need to throw money away and then beat your head against the wall after the purchase.<br /><br />Note to developer;<br />please add proportional steering.<br /><br />Add the option to choose on screen buttons for steering and throttle/braking.<br /><br />Add an occasional chevron to the track surface so the operator knows what direction to go after a crash. Something like this (&gt;). It would be much better than having to look at the small track and/or wait for the wrong way message.<br /><br />Now, even if you fix all those things, you'd be hard pressed to get more than $1.99 for it. $.99 is much more in line for a race game of thatcaliber. a race game has to have EXTENSIVE options and tremendous capabilities before you can ask people to pay five bucks for it.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Plot was nothing new and a bit touchy feely ah-la kind of like American Indians in harmony with nature before the European invaders showed up and made a mess of everything sort of genre, but it takes place on a distant world that the dying human race is exploiting for natural resources to keep what is left of planet earth on life support and pissing off the native population in the process.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling provides a very fresh approach to playing the violin. In this album she plays against a backdrop of “dub step” music (a heavy electronic rhythm based music). Though I am not a big fan of &#34;dub step&#34;, I found myself really enjoying this album. My favorite track is &#34;Elements&#34; and there is a great video on You Tube to go with it. For that matter, there are quite a few of Lindsey's songs both original and covers on You Tube that are worth watching. A good first effort. I hope to hear much more from this new artist.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|This was a recommended book in a runner's club newsletter, and I found the author to present well with the current information about how exercise helps improve focus and mood. I would recommend this book for therapists who would like to place exercise in a treatment plan.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I  love this book because it has a lot of words and its appropriate for me cause in school l go in a word group with words like simile and I would recommend this book to people who want to learn more about words.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I feel like there could be more data and charts for someone who is not an economics major. I would recommend this book. Krugman does a great job paralleling some of the ideas that led to a Greater Depression and subsequently leading to a Greater Recession/Depression today.
B007REV4YI|4.0|My favorite one from Daniel Graig's role as Bond is still Casino Royale, the emotion and intensity of that movie was one of the best of any Bond film I have seen .<br />But Skyfall would easily come second, I was expecting more twist and some of the plots were kind of obvious but the acting from pretty much everyone was great and I will watch it again for sure .<br />Too bad they didn't include this one in the box set 50 years of James bond movies

B000000OMB|4.0|this CD was to replace an LP I had of this album.  some good tunes on it  you don't hear much of this group on the air play anymore, this is a good way to collect the music.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|This album doesn't explore new territory for Del Rey, it's a nice complement to Born to Die.  I simply like the bizarre aesthetics of the modern production and its marriage to this Nancy Sinatra-esque pseudo-empowered character that is a romanticized and generalized prop. This character is seriously limited, however, and Del Rey will not last much longer unless she treads into new territory after this. As it is, you will enjoy this album if you liked Born to Die. If you're hoping for more, you'll have to wait and see if she'll deliver.
B001S86J1C|5.0|this was a good show.  the blu ray proved to be a good bet for this show.  I will probably be watching this show often.  this is what I have been tempted to do when I was in school, but I knew, in real life, likely, a person should not do these things.  it is fun to watch the show, and a good way to smile at what could be my temptations.  don't do what is done in the show, but I do recommend the show
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book,loved it. This book kept me wanting to read all the way thru it. I did not expect the ending.I  would read this book again and other books from this author.
B000002J6H|4.0|this cd is a good CD.  I got it to replace an LP I had of this album.  this album was not a top seller, but it had some good songs on it. good sound and it is good to find this CD.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|i just have to say this this is a very inspiring movie. i have always liked it from beginning to end
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game had me before while I was playing on an ipad in a walmart shopping its also a good time burner and very easy to play
B00005JMXX|5.0|i liked it so much even my daughter wanted this movie for her self. the prices were so very reasonable. i could not let it go
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved every minute of this book! I felt like I was right there with Connor and Megan through everything.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|excellent movie. i watched it back in 79 also. great actors . would like to see a part 2 to this
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app! I don't have to wonder what the weather will be like. I can plan on what to wear because I can check the weather/ temperature per hour on a certain day.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite James Bond films and definitely makes up for Quantum Solace. Film quality is amazing. A great addition to anyone's Blu-ray collection.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|This is the movie about an indifferent slob so stuck on himself that he needs to be awakened and set straight. The movie is fun and funny, in the things that Bill Murray gets into and does during his groundhog days. When it's finally over, you kinda wish that it weren't, so well have they crafted the events which happen.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|Felt like the movies hype set the bar too high. I did enjoy the film and definitely has a good story.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is truly an unlikely but likeable tale of two survivors. When you think about the likelyhood of sharing a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger, how would you come to terms with this big cat? their mutual need overrides the instinct of the cat and they find a common ground until at last theyreach land. What a bond, a wild and thrilling story done so well by Ang Le.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is the first tilt control game that I didn't have to switch to touch. it runs very smoothly and theres tons of new cars and other upgrades to buy
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I would recommend this app. It is actually flowing very very easy but gets harder just a little while after you pass through the levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing the game. It is is a lot of fun and I enjoy taking turns and playing with my brother. JG
B004I11VZ0|5.0|Simply put this movie may not be as incredible as the 1st, but its donnie yen and its very entertaining! As far as I'm concerned he is one of the greatest martial artist's I have ever witnessed!!!
B00APKIN1I|3.0|As a few previous reviewers have mentioned the CD release of Sound City has become another victim of the \\"Loudness Wars\\". All the tracks on the CD release have had their dynamics squashed and sound very fatiguing when listened to on a nice sound system. It's a shame that so much effort was put into the recording of the album only to be undone at the last moments of the mastering stage.<br /><br />That being said the vinyl release does sound much better, not because it's vinyl but because it doesn't suffer from the same dynamic range compression. If you have a nice system and want the best sounding version, look at going for the vinyl release. The content is great but if you're looking for that analog sound being discussed in the film you'll need to go with the version that has the highs and lows intact.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Anyone who doesn't agree that this is by far one of the greatest stories ever told doesn't know martial arts at all! Amazing movie on every level and the story behind Ip Man is truly amazing! Donnie Yen gives his greatest performance to date, and quite frankly he is one of the best martial artist's that ever lived!
B002GOAH1A|5.0|I've had this movie since the day it came out. I got this one because my mom put a player in her sewing room and i've been loaning her movies. Both of us have had the movie memorized for a very long time but still love it!! (Who else wouldnt love Will Smith dressed as a cowboy????? YUMMY!!!!!) Mom kept &#34;forgetting&#34; to bring that one back and I kept picking on her about it. When she got back from the lastest cruise, I had her own copy waiting for her!!! She's been back for about a month and she just changed the movie in the player. LOL
B0063M22QO|5.0|I play this game incessantly on my computers.  It gives me hours of enjoyment and frustration.  I was amazed at how easily it played on a small screen.
B005HSL626|5.0|The boys loved it!  My husband and the boys had a great time battling each other. They liked the different play options.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|The second season of Castle is great. These guys are still getting to know each other but they still have some great chemistry. Love this show!
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|I would recommend this product! Big Log great song.well produced & I have re-discovered Ropert Plant.Go get it & listen to Rock & Roll Royalty
B003L77FYS|4.0|This season was full of sweet moments, exciting story lines, and murder. Castle and Becket sizzle in their scenes. Love this show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh, I was surprised, dumbfounded and gained a new respect for the simple resources we use daily but never actually make with our own hands and intellect. I am only left wondering how it all started, how the end began the new beginning that became this story. Thanks for a great read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow! Katness, Peeta,  Gale..What paths they take..to end up in unexpected places. I really enjoyed the ability to keep going through all three books. Once you start, you will never want to stop! Katness, the somewhat unwilling, not too disciplined face of rebellion. Peeta, the sweet, strong boy next door. Gale the teasing, handsome \\"buddy\\". Follow them all to places you never expected them to be. Acting in ways you may never have expected them to act (certainly no one in the story did). Absolutely has what it takes to become a classic. I won't spoil it for you with details beyond that, but, trust me, this is one book you need to read!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a wonderful spellbinding movie. My husband enjoyed it, too.I can see why it won the top movie. Ben Affleck was very good.
B009AP2G26|4.0|Have watched this show since it began and have always enjoyed it immensely. This year I am having a little trouble getting used to the shift in characters since many of my favorite characters graduated and there are new faces to be seen and new voices to be heard. I am glad that Rachel, Finn and Kurt are still on just about every week. I do enjoy the New York segments with Rachel and Kurt. And I will continue to watch and give the &#34;new kids&#34; a chance to really shine.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like to plan my week a few days ahead of time and knowing what the weather will be is very handy. If I know it's going to rain, I'm able to plan my schedule accordingly and this app doesn't let me down. It hardly ever crashes and usually very accurate.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is the first comedy I have seen in a long time that does really make me laugh when I'm watching it. And I mean, my sides hurt I laugh so much sometimes. I love all of the quirky characters, the stories range from silly to touching, and all of the actors perform seamlessly. If you're feeling blue or cranky, give this show a try - it should cheer you right up!
B000X2H8G4|3.0|If you want to watch tv you must put the unit near the tv SPEAKER duh! and purchase the correct set of wireless headphones..once you do you will be happy happy happy, if not get ready to stand in long lines at p.o. to wait for a rude clerk (usually male..avoid that line, most are nice). And god bless the post office, if u pack your junk properly it will get there in good condition..i sent almost 2000 items (and i was't selling bubble wrap either) and all but one arrived safely..so pay the extra penny for a stamp (dunno why they do't make it 50 cents n get it over with) and don't bitch..they should give postage discounts to everyone that accepts mail every other day or whatever..i don't need junk mail every day, and if YOU do just pay extra for signature confirmation..see all the wonderful idea's i come up with..don't get me started on social security for the rich..have a wonderful day.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I am enjoying this show quite a lot. There were some initial criticisms that the show was too gory and violent, but I think there are a lot of other shows that are much worse in that regard. I do enjoy the cat and mouse feel of the show and the unanswered question of<br />&#34;Why is Joe Carroll doing all of this - from a jail cell most of the time?&#34; Kevin Bacon is great as Ryan Hardy, the FBI agent who put Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) away years ago and reluctantly returns to hunt the mad who almost killed him years ago. And what a chilling performance from James Purefoy as the chilling serial killer leading his cult of killers. Lot of edge of your seat tension in this show.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|With St Patty's day right around the corner, we decided on this one for family movie night.  It had all of us cracking up, and the story line was very nice too.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This is an old style turn based RPG. I am enjoying it very much and am nearing the endgame. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the graphics. They are also old school. When I first started playing, it was like seeing the graphics from the original Final Fantasy on the old Nintendo system. Some of the translations are a bit off but over all this is a fun game.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Good movie, the DVD was new and the picture quality was great.  Would recommend this to anyone.  Lots of action
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best. James. Bond. movie. ever. That is how much I liked this movie and I have seen ALL of the James Bond movies. I can't say too much about the plot without giving spoilers, so, I will just say, if you enjoy James Bond movies, you really should see this one.
B00B1E6DEQ|5.0|I've been a fan for a few years and love all of their albums, but this is the best so far. I got it on Amazon UK in late January, so I've had a few weeks to really get to know the tracks. Don't be daunted by the fact that this is a double album. There's no filler on here. All of the tracks really solid, and there's not one skipper. I played the first disc a bunch of times and got hooked on it before I even started to digest the second disc, and now I have the whole album on repeat. I can't remember the last time I was this excited about a new album. It's all I want to listen to! The last half of disc two in particular is just perfect! If you're a new fan, this is a good one to start with, as it's not difficult to get into like some of the earlier albums might be for the uninitiated.<br /><br />Pocket seems to be a track a lot of fans dislike. It's a track that Simon wrote several years ago and could never find a place where it fit, and finally they said screw it and put it on Opposites. It does seem a bit out of place and is by far the most pop track. But it's so fun and catchy I couldn't possibly dislike it.<br /><br />I think this excerpt from a recent AltPress interview referring to the track Stingin' Belle sums up this album and why I love Biffy so much. Interviewer: \\"The song has a nice contrast between the rapid-fire guitar and drums, and the vocals being a lot more mellow.\\" BC: \\"That's exactly what we wanted: the duality of the anger and as always the pop melodies, because that's what we've always loved in music, right from when we were very young. Even when we were going through a Lightning Bolt phase and were listening to really abrasive noise music, we still always loved bands like Weezer. It's so important even when music sounds so brutal, that is should have some kind of beauty in it. If it's brutal all the time, it becomes boring. If it's gorgeous all the time, it becomes boring. We sometimes like to just bounce between beautiful and ugly.\\"<br /><br />Buy the album! Mon the Biff! Oh, and make sure you get the full double album version.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Weejee was, of course, the photog who beat cops to crime scenes and snapped shots that captured mayhem with unforgettable clarity. In the same way Connelly uses words to create images that will keep you thinking and probably awake at night as well. At the very least this little collection will encourage you to watch your speed on Mulholland Drive.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is a classic . The movie is excellent . the songs are so good that they can stand alone in music alelles of our time. This is a movie that belongs in every collector's  collection. If you have never seen this movie you are in for a real treat.
3100512731|5.0|Brantley Foster (Michael J. Fox) new to the city is a young lad out of management school and looking for a job. Luck would have it that his Uncle Howard Prescott (Richard Jordan) runs a big corporation. He gets a chance to work his way up from the mail room.<br /><br />In the process he encounters his uncle's wife \\"Auntie Vera\\"(Margaret Whitton.) She takes an instant shine to him. One of my favorite scenes is where he barely escapes Auntie Vera's clutches.<br /><br />Soon he realizes that the only way to get to the top is start on a higher rung; finding an empty office and knowing the way the building system works, he takes on the persona of Carlton Whitfield male \\"Suit\\". He has a business type interaction with Christy (Helen Slater) a female \\"Suit\\". She has a quasi relationship with someone higher up.<br /><br />Then the action starts. There is a \\"working\\" weekend in which everyone has a second agenda. To this weekend both Brantley and Carlton are invited.<br /><br />What are Brantley and Vera cooking up?<br />Is Carlton getting too close to Christy?<br />Does someone else have plans for Christy?<br />Will Carlton meet Brantley?<br /><br />And who is the \\"bimbo?\\"
B003K16PAU|2.0|This is an amazing story that I would definitely recommend reading.<br />Unfortunately for Orwell and me, the errors in the Kindle version were quite distracting.  For one thing, words that are considered improper have been ---- out.  This is a major problem considering the book includes a section specifically about the improper language used in London during the time.  Quite a bit of this section is ---- out. Furthermore, there are typos all over the place.  I submitted corrections for 23 errors.  Stopping every now and again to report content error did not help the flow of the story.<br /><br />Overall, I am going to try and get my money back for this purchase.  Maybe I'll read the story again someday and have a much more pleasing experience.
1572707208|4.0|There are only so many ways you can tell somebody to write a list and plan/start on something in advance. But this is well layed out and there are many other words of wisdom in here that are valuable and sometimes powerful.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|Some may consider this is a very radical approach to the treatment of cancer and other chronic diseases, however one that appears to work for many people.  According to the statistics its a treatment that provides better results than traditional medicine.  Since insurance will not cover this it's not cheap in the short term, especially if you go to one of the institutes to start the treatment, but in the end if it works then what does cost really matter?  Also read The China Study and Anti-cancer.  These both will support this treatment and provide proof of it's power.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|this is the biggest game or app of any kind that i have tried to download. i had to remove a bunch of other games from my kindle to make room for it, and it took several tries to get it to download. but it was so worth it. this is a beautiful game! the graphics and sounds are simply lovely, and it plays ever so smoothly. it is an aesthetic delight, and zen mode is really meditative. i love it. i had to stop playing to write this but i'll be going back. it is just what i was looking for.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really loved this novel. I felt that Flynn handled some disturbing psychological content very well and kept me hanging on until the bitter end. I so felt the heroine's pain and isolation and I've thought of her terrible childhood so many times since reading this book. Wonderfully written and suspenseful.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I was not overly impressed but did enjoy this film. It had a good creep factor, the kind that prickles up the small hairs on your neck.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Like that can't figure &#34;bad guy&#34; unti very last of book.  Also it is a clean story not dependent upon &#34;mush.&#34;

B00BLCHL4Y|4.0|The History Channel's new series \\"Vikings\\" sets sail with a fresh historical saga of the Westward raiding and later settlement by the Vikings, beginning in the late 700's CE. If you know anything about this period of history, you know there will be enough excitement and fighting for even the most demanding action fans, once the longship sets sail.<br /><br />The recreations of Viking Halls, longships, technology, and daily life are impressive. The writer's and director navigate the need to inform the viewer, while moving the story forward, with a practiced hand on the steering oar. Ragnar reveals Viking navigational technology like the sunboard and sunstone in a rather exciting secret meeting with his brother. No boring lecture here!<br /><br />Katheryn Winnick fills the multifaceted role of a Viking woman, who wields a sword as a shield maiden, is a lusty lover, and a caring mother in a believable fashion. My one quibble is with the weaving scene, in the first episode. Why not show the mother and daughter weaving the sail for the longship. The woolen sail constituted a large investment of time and goods.<br /><br />Viewers are invited to take up their shield and ax and sign on to sail into history. Watch as the Vikings found an empire with cities like Dublin at its heart. Along the way, the pronouns they and them will enter English as well as the word husband.  Every time we say husband and wife we are using two words that became joined as the Germanic origin Saxon word \\"wife\\" united with the Norse word \\"husband\\" as the two peoples, Saxon and Viking, began to intermarry.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I really struggled to find anything redeemable about the characters in this book and by the time I reached the 300 page mark, I quit. I read another book in between and then went back to finish it. In the end, there was a tiny bit of redemption (something I really like to see), but I found the explanation of the murder to be preposterous. The writing, thankfully, was good enough that I have read and loved Flynn's other works. This one was the wrong one to start with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My life has recently changed drastically, and I am in a wheelchair.  It has been difficult sometimes to be able to get my Bible out and read it, and this online Bible came to my attention.  Not only can I read it on my Kindle, but if I am too tired to read, I can have it read to me! I love that there are so many choices of translations, and it is SO easy to get to the book, chapter and verse.  Awesome!  I know I have barely scratched the surface of all this Bible can do.  For example, I cannot find where I can do a search for something, but I am sure I will find it soon. Great product!
0385349947|5.0|As I read Sheryl Sandberg's superbly researched book Lean In, I winced in remembered pain.<br /><br />In early 1990, six months after my husband and I arrived in New York, I was waiting for the 1-9 train at Lincoln Center with several acquaintances. No longer the frightened young woman who wouldn't go anywhere without her husband, I was enthusiastically describing a foreign film I'd recently seen (possibly Cinema Paradiso), just one of the many wonders of New York I was discovering. Clearly fed up by my gushing, one of the women who was a few years younger than me and had also majored in music at university, but who was now rearing two young children as her husband attended law school, declared imperiously, \\"Whitney, you really do need to start having children.\\"<br /><br />I was hurt, then angry. No doubt I went home to my husband and criticized her for having children when she seemingly didn't want them. The incident also made me question the decision I had made to pursue a career prior to having children.<br /><br />However hurtful the mommy wars being waged on the homefront (and inside me) were, they were nothing compared to how embattled I have often felt as a woman working on male-dominated Wall Street. This experience of being picked on, overlooked, or otherwise put down started young. In third grade, to be precise, when during a grammar lesson my teacher wrote they'er on the chalkboard. Eagerly, I raised my hand to correct her. \\"Ms. S,\\" I declared proudly, \\"You made a mistake. It's supposed to be t-h-e-y-'-r-e.\\" Instead of congratulating me on my keen observation and excellent spelling, I was reprimanded for being a smart mouth.<br /><br />As I moved from schoolwork to Wall Street work, there was the boss who wouldn't remunerate me for superior client service because \\"girls like to do that sort of thing.\\" And the occasions, not a few, when I have watched senior men throw open the door of opportunity for young men--doors that I had hoped (and asked) to be opened for me--I was then expected to wave my pom-poms as the young Turks paraded by.<br /><br />It is no surprise then that while reading Sandberg's book was just a little painful, I felt validated. It wasn't just my teachers, colleagues, and bosses dismissing me. Other women, many, many other women, have been systematically overlooked and undervalued, and Sandberg draws on a wealth of research to show us that we're not alone. She cites studies indicating that men are compensated for helping co-workers because it's considered an imposition, while women are not because of our presumed desire to be communal.  Research demonstrating that boys can call out answers voluntarily in school and teachers listen, while girls are scolded when we don't raise our hand; data showing that men are significantly more likely to be sponsored than women.<br /><br />As for her rallying cry that we \\"lean in\\" to our career and pursue our ambitions, I couldn't agree more, though let's first be clear about what I am agreeing to. I read Ms. Sandberg's book through the lens of Jungian psychology, which asserts that every woman and every man comes equipped with a psychological structure that includes qualities characterized as both \\"feminine\\" and \\"masculine.\\" Our capacity for relatedness and love is feminine, while our ability to wield power and control situations is masculine. In order to become a complete person, we need to develop both. But leaning in--whether toward our masculine or feminine side--can be a double bind. Even as society shames us for wanting to navigate uncharted waters, it criticizes our dream of nurturing, of being a safe harbor. Meanwhile, because many women feel the tug of our ship full of dreams while (surreptitiously) trying to keep one foot grounded on the dock of family life, our choices often feel Solomonic.<br /><br />Which brings me to the chatter that Sandberg places too much responsibility on women to be accountable for their own success (in spite of scores of footnotes and citations that acknowledge the systemic bias). And yet if we walk away from the notion of leaning in--believing that our success hinges less on our personal actions than on the removal of institutional barriers, then we undermine the entire premise of feminism. (A term which, make note, I am using for the first time in print because of Sandberg's commentary.) Feminism isn't about \\"the man\\" finally capitulating to our demands, or even about our very own corporate version of Cinderella. It is about believing that each of us must lean in to becoming a complete woman, learning to love and wield power, to be a harbor and a ship--and respecting other women as they do the same.<br /><br />I was intrigued that Sandberg included the statement \\"all advice is autobiographical.\\" As she penned this book, a book which she described as \\"what would I write if I weren't scared,\\" what advice was she giving herself? In my piece, \\"Why I'm Glad Sheryl Sandberg Isn't On Facebook's Board (Yet),\\" I wondered, and still do, if Sandberg would have delivered her watershed TED talk, the precursor to this book, if she had not been long-denied a board seat at Facebook, something she clearly deserved. Was she giving herself advice then? Is she now? Passion is often born of pain, of the desire to make meaning of our lives.<br /><br />\\"Boo hoo!\\" some may utter. It's easy to step up with a silver spoon. But if we are really honest, we all know that pain and deprivation is relative. We feel it where we are, within our own sphere. And no matter how much we may elevate and admire her--and I very much do--Sheryl Sandberg is not a demigod, free from constraint, impervious to pain. She does wield tremendous power relative to most of women. But extrapolating from my own work experience, and reading between the lines, she is still very much beholden to Mark Zuckerberg. From where we sit, it may look like Sandberg's call for us to lean in comes from a cushy chaise lounge. But I suspect that, most days, her seat of power feels anything but.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive.I am so glad that this app is free and everyone should get it. this is just so fun. GET THIS!

B0091REZMW|5.0|Really love this game! If you are careful and patient it is free!! Plus there are so many layers! Enjoy!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is my favorite book of the year. It's so well-written and the twist midway was one of the best, most compelling twists I've ever read. The writing is perfect in so many ways and, unlike many, I loved the ending. I thought it was perfectly in keeping with the rest of the novel and wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way. YUMMY!
B00ATP24SW|5.0|I've been listening to this group since their first album (CD). This CD just shows how they matured and gotten even better with time. Anyone who likes this type of metal will love this CD. EXCELLENT!

B000W4HIXQ|5.0|This is a very good action movie with good characters, and a good story. The Blu ray quality is nice as well with good sound and an excellent picture. Another great part of the Die Hard series!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|What we get makes for great dramatic listening. Love Thomas Newman's score. But not only do we miss out on the song, but also on the final (so called) bonus track &#34;Old dog, new tricks&#34; which is quite atmospheric. I had to download the two tracks missing here from iTunes.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|coolest game ever run jump play run jump play is all I ever here from my 4 year old brother and if you want a little kid to get out of your hair get this game what do you have to loose it's free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was one of the best games I have ever had. It worked perfectly and I have recommended it to many other people who also loved it. I don't know why they cant make all apps good like this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Faced with some long flights for work, I decided to load up my Kindle with some entertainment.  Hearing a lot of hype about this book, I went for it.  I had no real expectations going in, and maybe that's why I'm not as willing to bash it as others are.<br /><br />It's entertaining, for sure.  Even by the second and third parts, when I found myself rolling my eyes at the plot line and character development, I still wasn't willing to ditch it.<br /><br />A lot of people rave about the first part being &#34;oh-so-good&#34; and then being let down by parts two and three.  I don't know if I agree.  I think even in part one, the author presents completely one-dimensional, flat characters and it's so obvious that something has to change because there's no way you could keep telling a story with such boring, predictable people.<br /><br />Even though I found the characters a little banal, I suppose what kept me going was watching their relationship unfold.  This is where I think the author shines - she does a fantastic job of portraying a realistic, complex relationship in the first part.  Every encounter was at least a little bit relatable - and I think that's what kept me turning the pages.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend - but with caution.  Don't go in expecting the next great American novel, and you probably won't be disappointed.  If you're looking for something to eat up a 6-hour flight, and you like stuff that won't make you think too hard, this is probably perfect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love it!! helps pass time and keeps me reading amazing books. everyone should have this app on all their devices
0770435726|1.0|This is a poorly written book. I can imagine why the author was a ghost writer. He should have remained anonymous.

Every recipe in it is awesome (all right, I haven't made them all yet, but every recipe of Deb Perelman's I've ever made, here and on her website, has never been a disappointment), and her writing is just genius.  I'd like to buy one for all of my friends who enjoy cooking.  I love how her recipes are based on how she thought things would taste...or things she would like to try but aren't available, like with her grapefruit cake recipe, or how she makes a red velvet cake with red wine ( a REAL red velvet cake).  This book is worth every penny, you should buy it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|All the reasons I got into History in the first place! Solving the mysteries of the lives attached to all those old goodies in your grandmothers attic only to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Beautifully written, a journey definitely worth taking.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is truly magnificent and quite stunning visually and on every other level. It stands solidly beside the Lord Of The Ring trilogy. It is totally absorbing, very moving and absolutely entertaining. I was very pleased. I truly recommend this one.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game has a very good feel to it. It made me personally feel like I had a PhD in the architecture business. The section of this Entertaing App/ Game that is most exciting is the free play feature. In this mode, you may create your own contraption with various supplies.  Then you can put it to the test and see how accurate it is to your expectations.<br /><br />Recommendation:  GET IT!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is fun and funny and way better than hungry shark games love it!!!!!!! five star review who agrees with me? I want to know cuz I love the fricking game!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  It's my favorite game among them all.  I play this a lot.  I  play it so much my device dies I play it so much.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It was a good movie. I thought it might be better based on trailers and awards that it won. I enjoyed watching it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game. it is fun. I love his toy can visit others. I like the breeding cave and the different islands.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Mis&eacute;rables is a visually impressive film. It is emotionally charged. The performances were exceptional. My expectations for this film were low, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Overall, this film is powerful on so many levels. It is stunning. Some of the scenes are just so moving. The images linger for some time.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This part of the Knight trilogy is my hands down favorite. Bane played by Tom Hardy is an exceptionnal performance and the other characters do their thing too. A definite must see for Knight fans. ENJOY :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm not a religious person. I do not adhere to the doctrine of organized religion, but I have a very deep belief in God in all his/ her forms, and the basic tenets that we are put here on earth to love one another and learn to be the best people we can be. This book gave a scientific credence to the reality that science is not all of reality. That our existence is so much more than cells and atoms. If you seek to learn more about the universe and whether or not there is anything else out there, read this book. At the very least you will come away with hope. At the most you will know, in your soul, why this mans story resonates with you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Downton Abbey series is first rate.  We watched it religiously started with season one.  The producers amazingly keeps the stories fresh, interesting and exciting.  Season 3 doesn't disappoint as it finishes dramatically.  Can't wait for season 4 though emotionally we need a few months to mend.
0385349947|4.0|\\"I could not have gotten more headlines if I had murdered someone with an ax.\\" That's author Ken Auletta's characterization of the fervent, wildly divergent and huge public response Sheryl Sandberg received after her video interview for the PBS documentary MAKERS. What was her provocative comment? That she left the office at five thirty to have dinner with her family. Earlier, she'd spoken at the launch of Facebook Women, an in-house resource group at work. \\"When asked the (inevitable) question about how I balanced my job and my family,\\" she said that she left at five thirty and, after the children were in bed, she went online to get more work done.<br /><br />1. Speak out yet stay human<br /><br />Taking stands for what you believe in is core to Sandberg's credo, in her new book that's out March 11th. Lean In to your career \\"and do not leave before you leave.\\" Don't hold back, as she feels that women have been conditioned to do. Instead, \\"we need to feel more comfortable with power.\\"Yet her expressed trepidation in being bold gives her approachability: \\"I wanted to encourage others to personalize their schedules too. Even though I had planned in advance to discuss this, I felt nervous. Years of conditioning had taught me never to suggest that I was doing anything other than giving 100 percent to my job. It was scary to think that someone, even people working for me, might doubt my diligence or dedication.  Fortunately that did not happen.\\"<br /><br />She advocated flex time policies just as Deloitte's Cathy Benko and Molly Anderson recommended lattice career options to replace the traditional corporate ladder policies. Sandberg's willingness to be vulnerable is part of what builds bonds with others, according to Brene Brown who also believes courage, for both women and men, is borne out of choosing to be vulnerable. Yet others who emulate Sandberg's public stands may not get the same supportive response from their work colleagues. That is what makes such acts daring.<br /><br />2. Work to deserve smart mentors who are stellar in your profession.<br /><br />Sandberg's willingness to work hard and take strong, sometimes controversial stands may well have been bolstered by having long-time, strong, some would say alpha male mentors, including Larry Summer and Tim Geithner, as godmother to his daughter. Sandberg met Summers when taking his public sector economics class. She doesn't indicate why he took her under his wing, yet she must have stood out in some way: \\"He offered to supervise my senior thesis--something very few Harvard professors volunteers to do for undergraduates.\\" She also doesn't say why Washington Post chairman Don Graham \\"helped me navigates some of my most challenging professional situations\\" yet she clearly has a gift for attracting extremely successful mentors, including Arianna Huffington, Gene Sperling and Oprah Winfrey. For Sandberg that may be an undefinable capacity yet it did play a vital role in her success.<br /><br />Don't seek out strangers as mentors, Sandberg advises. \\"The strongest relationships spring out of a real and often earned connection felt by both sides.\\"<br /><br />That's been my experience too. My most transformative professional mentoring relationship sprung out of my work for my boos, a bureau chief at the newspaper where I worked. I was the first woman to work for him who wasn't covering the society beat. He was a proudly self-described curmudgeon, often blunt, blasphemous and unbending yet extremely smart and seasoned in the news business.  My unrelentingly \\"Pollyanna-style questions\\" (as he dubbed them) initially irked him yet he eventually warmed up ...grudgingly. Then proactively helped me. He gave candid and extremely specific feedback about my talents and weaknesses as a journalist.  We wound up becoming fans and supporters for each other through the peaks and valleys in our careers.  As Sandberg discovered, getting mentored well spurs us to mentor others.<br /><br />3. Reducethe number of \\"benevolent sexists\\"<br /><br />Men in \\"modern marriages\\" with wives who work full-time outside of the home view \\"the presence of women in the workplace more favorably\\" than men in \\"traditional marriages\\" do.  The later group \\"also denied promotions to qualified female employees more often and were more likely to think that companies with a higher percentage of female employees ran less smoothly.\\" These \\"benevolent sexists\\" were largely unconscious of their bias, according to Sandberg. She also cites the Heidi/Howard study that shows we tend to \\"want to work with people who are like us\\" and research that shows that \\"success and likability are negatively correlated for women.\\" In response she calls for two changes: make workplaces more amenable to women succeeding and for women to act more boldly on behalf of their career advancement.<br />4. Make your partner a genuine partner<br /><br />\\"Wives who engage in gate keeping behaviors do five more hours of family work per week than wives who take a more collaborative approach,\\" writes Sandberg, referring to a study as she often does in this book. Her advice: \\"Anyone who wants her mate to be a true partner must treat him as an equal - and equally capable - partner.\\"  She cites Gloria Steinem: \\"It's not about biology, but about consciousness.\\"<br /><br />5. Who was the foremost female figure at Davos?<br /><br />To stand out, be willing to stand for something important. One clear benefit that Sandberg models for women who choose to lean into their career while also taking public stands that are relevant and authentic to their experience is that they become more widely visible and valuable than others who may be equally successful at work yet have not taken daring stands. There was much public cheering and some private grumbling from other women at Davos this year as Sandberg became a magnet for attention. To stand out, lean in and be willing to stand up for something that is really important to you and to others. How's that for muddling mix of body stances? Yet expect some flack, as I discovered when I wrote about her book at Forbes [...]<br />6. It's not about having it all but making it all better<br /><br />In this inspirational book Sandberg cites several other studies about bias in the workplace, by women and by men. For each, she offers concrete suggestions on how to make our work and home life more satisfying and successful. Like Anne-Marie Slaughter, she doesn't believe that women can have it all, yet we can work smartly towards attaining more, in ways that make it better for us all.with wives who work full-time outside of the home view \\"the presence of women in the workplace more favorably\\" than men in \\"traditional marriages\\" do.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the best game I have on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are beautiful, and the game play is great. I would have paid at least $2.00 for this game. You will not be disappointed by this game. This game is suitable for children, as well as adults. This 42 year old loves this game.
1401937519|5.0|Of all the NDE accounts I have read, this is definitely different from all the others.  Even though I have finished reading the book, I'm still processing all Ms. Moorjani had to say.

B003WC5EQI|4.0|I enjoy seeing movies taken from classic literature.  I saw this movie before reading the book and I think the movie stays true to the novel.  If you like period dramas, this is a good one to see.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My kindle wouldn't keep the charge. Received help from the kindle help line and voila, all I needed was the new USB ord and adapter. These were sent free of charge and I could settle in to do all my reading. It was wonderful to receive such great help. Also, the goods were at my home within 24 hours. Ellie

B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing Awesome. Now I need a book on his Dom years. His time with Leila would be good to show what they had together for her to do what she did.
1416511946|5.0|Love this guys more than words can say and his books and photography are even more amazing that I would have imagined.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I don't know why but the Voyager series did not get the respect the other Star Trec series got. I thought it was a great series and I enjoyed the second time as much as the first. I look forward to season two.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever and  we get to on tour with this in our homes [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] which is good if you can't afford to go and new characters and boards is just good especially when on the egg hunt and getting a board after getting to 100 egg.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I love the fact that I am able to see my shots and love the new black look. It would be a 5 star if the touch feature wasn't so bad. It works and gets the job done but they need to work on it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best hale ever its soo fun I love it. and I will never stop I'm addicted, .............. ha ha ha o.o
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so fun... a little disturbing but still fun. once you start playing you just cant stop. so download this app and be addicted.
B0098460O4|4.0|This CD is very enjoyable, but could have been so much better.  Let me start by saying the vocal performances are fantastic.  The booming resonance of Jonathan's tenor combined with the pure sweetness of Charlotte's soprano are a joy to listen to.  I was not bothered that most of the vocals are in Italian, because I believe Italian is the most beautiful language in the world and anything sung in Italian sounds better.<br /><br />The problem I have is with the production.  It is mediocre at best.  It feels like they rushed to get this out to market.  No effort was put into producing any new harmonic arrangements; almost every track is the same back and forth between Charlotte's verses and Jonathan's refrains.  Reminds me of a tennis match.  The editing is choppy; on some tracks, like The Prayer, it's blatantly obvious that the final cut was pieced together from different takes.  On some tracks the recording wasn't clean.  I can't tell if it was due to a cheap mic or the audio post processing.  The mixing levels are off as evidenced by the choir drowning out Charlotte and me having to adjust the volume level from one track to the next.  They butchered up the Ave Maria.  Charlotte started out beautifully and everything was still fine when Jonathan came in, but then he got the lyrics wrong and next they decided to omit a good portion of the second verse in lieu of a choral interlude.  I don't mind the interlude, but you can't arbitrarily leave out part of the Hail Mary!  They also decided to truncate Caruso.  I don't get it.  Why not sing the whole song?<br /><br />In summary, I think Jonathan & Charlotte are immensely talented, but need to find a better producer.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the best PBS show ever!  I can't wait for season four.  If you love period pieces this is exceptional.  The scenery, the setting,  the clothes and the lamps, those amazing lamps.  Well done, very well done.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the app I like my hourse I like everything about it but I am still trying to get more gems though
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I watched this film for two reasons. First it has great actors in it, no doubt. Second, it has a great director. I wasn't sure about the premise of the film, but I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning. Denzel played the lead effortlessly, once again that &#34;hero-villain&#34; that he is so great at playing. The beginning of the film is amazing and the entirety of the film will leave you rooting for this bad guy, because this is what humanity has defined as bad. I recommend this film and it is a grown-up movie, so unlike what the majority of common films  are today.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great to see a show such as this, it's wonderful. I could watch the entire season over again...in fact, I'm sure I will.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|There's no disputing that Stephen King is a masterful storyteller.  In 11/22/63, he tackles a very different time travel / alternate history genre, and does it very well. It is ultimately believable, though his post-apocalyptic world stretches credulity a bit. A good bit of history mixed with fiction, a good love story, and an exciting personal conflict made the book a thoroughly engrossing read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The reader really doesn't know who to like in this story.  The characters are really not likeable people and the ending really leaves you unsatisfied.  You hope that the good guy succeeds, but it doesn't seem like there will be any guarantee of that.
0743490304|5.0|Very different from the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, but very engaging nonetheless.  I couldn't put it down.  Would highly recommend.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I picked up the Martian and had limited expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised. I love hard sci fi and the book seemed very plausible. Also the story was compelling and well told. This book provided more laugh out loud opportunities than I can remember having in years. All in all, well done.
0062267787|4.0|In this trio of Delirium stories, Lauren Oliver has pulled back the current even further revealing tantalizing details about her characters and this dizzily addictive series.<br /><br />HANA follows Lena's best friend during the second half of DELIRIUM as she gets caught up in the Underground of illicit parties, music, and interactions with the opposite sex. Since Hana's story is half of REQUIEM, I highly recommend you read HANA before finishing the trilogy. I understood her so much better after seeing her first `date' with Fred, her first kisses and more with Steve, and riotous emotions during her scenes with Lena that led her to make the choices she made.<br /><br />ANNABEL is the story fans of this series must read. In it we get to see the world as it first began to change and identify love as a disease. We get to meet Lena's mother as a teenager and see her later as a prisoner leading up to her escape after eleven years in a cell. It was a little like Shawshank Redemption mixed with Lauren Oliver's immersive writing. Her story might be the most tragic of all the characters we've met in this series, and that makes her strength, her determination, all the more amazing.<br /><br />RAVEN was the story that surprised me the most, since Raven as a character, keeps so much of her thoughts and feels to herself. Seeing her laid bare like this was a revelation. From her first days joining up with the rebellion as a young teen with the tiny, barely alive baby Blue, we see how that little life was nearly snuffed out. We also meet Tack and learn how her and Raven got together. It's really a beautiful and quiet love story with a bright burst at the end that made me smile as I cried.<br /><br />If you love this series, DELIRIUM STORIES is a must read. Not only does it include three gripping and emotional stories, but a ton of extras too. There is a massive excerpt from REQUIEM, a list of banned books and poems, but even a quiz to help you determine your role in the world of Delirium.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissing.

B008I3RARW|1.0|So this popped up as the free app of the day. I read the poor reviews and thought it might be good for my young sons.<br /><br />Well I was wrong.<br /><br />Downloaded it<br />installed it<br />started it<br />played 30 seconds<br />and deleted it<br /><br />TOTAL WASTE OF TIME
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This book is well written and easily readable, with lots of new insights in how we became the way we are. It is a book that takes some time to swallow because of the tons of information.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is the best series to come along in a very long while.  I have purchased all 3 season and love every one.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz's style is unique to him, the only complaint i can make, is with CD and the capacity, put a few more songs on them, it's over too soon.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Didn't think I would like this, but I was pleasantly surprised. My wife also liked this movie even though she is not a fan of sci-fi movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome even though you have to pay seven dollars I would get it if I were you .Not just OK but awesome!
B000KGGB2A|5.0|I just recently found out that Take That got back together a few years ago. Where have I been? Not under a rock, just in the US, where I wish they were more popular. I LOVE this album, their new sound, the fact that they're all taking turn leading. \\"Shine\\" makes me smile every time it comes on, and \\"Wooden Boat\\" brings shivers down my spine. I'd love to hear Jason lead more often.<br />It's a 10 stars for me.<br />A terrific album!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I chose this rating bc some of Josh other CD's have not been as good. Has a nice mixture of songs sung in English and other languages. He does have the voice of an Angel as has been said before.<br /><br />Josh Groban fans...go pick up his new CD today!
B0053O89JM|5.0|I am a devoted follower.  Excellent series.  I bought all 8 seasons and then bought another 8 seasons for my grandniece as she is a dedicated House follower as well.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Robin just continues to turn out a great style of music that entertains and can be played over and over.
B00AG473IC|4.0|Better than expected, this one will be in my play list for a long time to come. Breath of fresh air
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a well written book. Everyone will love it. The characters are real and jump off the page. You feel their pain.
1400069289|5.0|got it on kindle and bought another copy to share.  I was learning to trade and had to know my habits to be successful. (deep)
B0074MZSWW|5.0|One of my favorite CD's....this band is fresh and fun.  First time I saw them was last summer as the opening act for Neil Young (wish I had enjoyed him as much) and was blown away.  Am now a faithful follower of their progress and will continue to support their band by buying their music and attending their concerts when I can.
B002NWOOXW|4.0|Great original cast.  Very entertaining.  I love the first Bridget Jones, which is still my favorite, but this is cute and worth the watch, if you enjoyed the original.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Steven Pressfield has written a book that speaks to the very core of my artistic life...the good, the bad, and the parts I didn't want to admit were there. This small but powerful book has given me a mental chiropractic work-over. He identified all those parts of me that are standing in the way of reaching new levels in my art...and given me a road map to navigate around...or through..them.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|We did not know what to expect and found it way too sexual and confusing to follow.<br /><br />You make this process too hard with needing all the words.  I will not complete one again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is the best free app game I have played. Excellent response time and graphics on the Kindle Fire. The missions keep it fun and exciting.  Coin purchase is not necessary to level up or customize your Barry.  The gadgets definitely enhance the game. Give me more GADGETS!!!!
B001UAPVDU|3.0|After hearing the demo I thought poker face would be better but its not bad. My favorite on this cd is just dance, and eh eh(nothing else i can say) I never herd before but i think the songs starting to grow on me.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Saw him on Austin City Limits and bought the CD to further discover his music.  He certainly has a sound that is all his own and I believe we will hear more and see more from this up and coming artist.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This is a movie at its best!  Elegant, amazing storyline.  They certainly don't make them like this any more!  I watch over and over.  How does it get any better than Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Beautifully filmed, great tech but this franchise is getting a little long in tooth. Still worth a Saturday afternoon watch.
098478280X|5.0|I'm a current CS student, and I recently needed to prepare for a tech interview for an internship at a major tech company. I ended up getting the internship and I think this book is a big reason why.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the concepts discussed in this book (linked lists, hash tables, queues, etc) then it probably won't be much help. However, if you just need to hone in your problem solving skills and review the main concepts and data structures discussed in the book, this is for you. It's very well written and extremely easy to read. She packs a lot of really great information and tips in a short, easy to read form. The sample problems are all very cool and fun to solve, and the solutions do a good job of describing the thought process therein.<br /><br />If you think you're just going to be able to skim through this book and then ace an interview, you're wrong. But if you pick this up and approach it in the ways she suggests, you'll feel much more comfortable going into your next interview, without a doubt.
1597801585|5.0|A thought provoking book about the results of genetically enhanced food, genetically enhanced diseases for other peoples crops and of course, genetically enhanced people. Don't think its not happening, now.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|For those of you not really into &#34;collector&#34; items or special features or the like this is for you. Just the movies and no BS. I've seen a few people complaining about their discs being messed up or different and all I have to say is that is unusual and probably just a glitch in the printing for the discs or something. All eight of my movies were printed and etched correctly, all are widescreen, and all play just fine.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money and I would recommend you pick one up straight away if you love the HP series.
B006964E8S|5.0|Baldacci books are so gripping from start to end. This started a bit slower than usual(slightly contradictory I realise), however no less exciting!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome it poped up on my screen so I downloaded it.It was so awesome
B00797MB0O|1.0|I don't have the time to go into how bad this movie was, but to sum it up, I was completely grossed out by the (SPOILER ALERT) sex scene with Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt.  Other than that, this movie had absolutely no resolution.  I sort of wanted to check myself into a mental facility after watching it because it was so depressing.  Disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished. Ready for catching fire but I promised myself if I finish this one I can go to sleep so I'll start book 2 when I wake up. I keep hearing after I finish the series I'll go into a week long depression. Haha. We'll see how that all goes.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A story as old as the seeds of the earth of learning to find the beauty and good. God has been good to man.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Very entertaining read. When I wasn't reading the book I was thinking how soon could I get back to my book. Baldacci kept me guessing on how the book would end. Looking forward to the next John Puller book!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Pre-ordered this and it arrived on time, the movie is amazing and in my opinion the best movie of the year. Very spiritual and a must see!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a pretty fun game. Minus the glitches. And some of the items should cost less. The characters are fun. You should get more girl ones though its kinda sexist....
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|It's a good app to pass the time. I am going to have fun with this for a long time. So far I like it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the 3rd season.  Just sorry that &#34;Matthew&#34; will no longer be in the show.  But I am sure that the writers will be making new challenges for the family.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|very prompt personalized service where I was kept informed of happenings via email.<br /><br />The cables are not aftermarket cables so hopefully they will work and work for a long time!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game. It has a lot of details and clues to find in every room. Some rooms are even dark, meaning lights off and you have to find the clues.
B00AJLHUYO|1.0|So where to begin...<br /><br />Bad guy looks scary, story has potential and that's it I'm sorry to say, there are parts so dumb it's painful. The movie could have been made so much better but the main character's actions are ridiculous so much that it's hard to enjoy the rest of the movie when he's being so dumb! I mean seriously if you move into a house with your family, discover that potentially a serial killer has returned the tapes of his killings to your attic after the crime was committed then you continue to stay there still, with your family totally at risk, I mean come on! The amount of times you think FOR GOD SAKE JUST GET OUT but he stays is just beyond belief, it's frustrating so much so you can't care for the character. He hears a noises, investigates in the dark, gets filmed by an unknown entity and pulled around by ghost hands and still stays pretty calm and stays with his wife and children in the home.<br /><br />You can tell it annoyed me, it will annoy you, especially with so much potential. I could easily have restructured the screenplay as I'm sure most adults or children could have and got something worth 4* but it's maybe worth 2* at a push....nah!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I think it would be great if stories of these American Heroes were required reading for our high school age children, so that they are made aware of the price of freedom.  I just started reading  military books after being introduced by a friend to &#34;Fearless&#34;, the story of Adam Brown, Navy SEAL, and then I read &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; and &#34;Service&#34; by Marcus Luttrell.  I definitely think Fearless was the best of all these books.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like it cause its just like instagram, and d only reason I don't have a instagram is because I have no idea how ta make one but back to d topic! Pinterest ... well I have NO what so ever problem with it at all to be honest. Hope this helps?
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Since I'm a pilot, this is one of my favorite movies.  The 3D 'remake' was excellent.  The aerial shots were the best.<br />Highly recommend this.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I have played this game for awhile on my iPad so I know what the game should play like.  First of all on the Kindle Fire I can't get the game to slow down or speed up.  Also, it seems like my Ball thing is always in the middle of the screen.  On my iPad my Ball moves around and I can slow it way down and speed it way up.<br /><br />With a little tweeking by the maker to make this play on the android as well as it plays on an iPad the game will be a lot more fun.<br /><br />I removed this substandard version until the next update.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't, put the book down because it kept my interest and was very thought provoking . It is a must read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 books and especially loved the ending. Now I'm waiting for the movie which should be interesting to see how true to the books it is.
B000002A3T|5.0|Every song and every note of music in this album is, well I was going to say perfect, but Pink Floyd suffice.
B005ZUR724|1.0|It is a good game WHEN IT WORKS! The problem is server crashes and lags A LOT. If Gameloft does maintenance, update or anything else plan on not playing for several days. When you contact support or customer service expect no response or if response Gameloft says it s your problem and that you need to figure it out by yourself. That is if you get response. Even if it is Gamelofts actions that cause problems Gameloft will insist it is your problem not theirs. Gameloft makes good games but customer service, support, maintenance, and updating their games they have no clue.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is a classic for all who love history and want a hero. Abraham Lincoln was truely an amazing man with talents, genius and empathy of which he made good use. I feel this book backed by the author's outstanding research deserves all the honors it can bring to Doris Kerns Goodwin. It is easy to read, full of details, gives the complete picture of what happened during the Civil War and describes the personalities surrounding Lincoln throughout his political career. Fifty-five percent  of this book is narratative with the rest being epilogue, acknowledgements, notes, illustration credits and index. Each area is interesting and important. I will certainly reread this book several times. Abraham Lincoln is an icon for the ages who needs to be studied by all who value negotiation and want to emulate a master. Would that more leaders would demonstrate just a portion of Lincoln's wisdom.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I am one of those adults hooked on Angry Birds and now on Sprinkle.  I have only played the first few levels which seem to get harder as you progress from one level to the next.  The object of the game is to put out fires with a limited amount of water.  The graphics are good on the Kindle Fire.  In my opinion a good game for all ages.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It's time for me to re-read the entire series from start to finish. It never ceases to amaze me that each time I read these books there is foreshadowing or connections that become apparent multiple books later. Yes, I enjoy this series enough to own all the books in hardcover, and I have read all of them as many as five times, depending on when they came out.<br />This is the last book of the series and I decided to finally buy an autographed copy. This book is just as long as most of the others in the series, and you won't feel robbed of the reading experience because it is too short. If you liked the series, you will like the last two books that Brandon Sanderson wrote. The actual book has the same cast of characters we all know, love, or hate. There were several twists and character deaths that I didn't expect and some things that I did expect. Brandon Sanderson did a very good job tying most everything up in the final book while leaving the option open to write several spin off books. The bad news is that this story ends, but the good news is that new stories begin. The wheel weaves as the wheel wills.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Love this backpack.<br />Definitely holds everything i need and more - use it daily for work and for quick weekend trips.<br />Packs a lot more than you would initially believe.<br /><br />Took 1 star out for the following reasons:<br />With the bag full with folders, books, laptop, etc - it gets tough to get a water bottle in on the sides.<br />With the bag half empty, the front does sag a bit and does kinda look weird.
B00005NMVP|5.0|I love this song for many reasons.  Al Stewart made a great splash with this song and I still, after all those years find myself under its wonderful spell.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I would love to find more by this author or books of a similar style.  The ability to be able to feel the closeness to the character was well done.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is amazing all around.  George keeps you involved in all of the main characters as in previous books and intertwined their stories further together.
B0010X745K|5.0|The Mist is one the best movies I had seen in a long time.  I saw this movie once the SyFy channel but it wasn't until I got the DVD that I could appreciate its true horror.  There no wasting time building a plot in the beginning because it just unfolded as the movie went along.  The plot, by the way, was very solid.  The special effects were impeccable but not overwhelming overdone.  Some of the religious fanaticism was a bit much but still very much needed in the plot.  THE best part of the movie, is the ending which will leave you with your open and stoked.  This is a great movie!

B004CQ5GMU|4.0|This is a very high quality product - it was shipped and delivered as advertised, but then I have yet to experience shipping issues with any of my Amazon purchases.<br />The plastic case is of very high quality and fully encloses the drive.  The cap clips firmly into place - very unlikely it would fall off and get lost.  The hole at the end is very small - it would not fit on a key ring unless you ran something very fine through it to affix it.  I would prefer a bigger hole specifically to place it on a key ring.<br />It works well and it is plenty fast.  It has a blue light to indicate function.  My only issue is that when you open it for the first time the computer indicates 29GB of usable space.  What happened to 32 GB?  I believe this might be common on most drives but it doesn't seem right.  I am not sure what the deal with that is.  I bought 3 of these and they all do that.  That is the only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5.<br />For the $$ it is the best thumb drive I have purchased to date.  I will be ordering more.
0307463745|4.0|This book by Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson is an easy read.  The chapters are all 1-2 pages long with specific recommendations for how to turn conventional wisdom on its head.  This is a good book for people:<br />• Who are busy and don't have a ton of free time<br />• Want to consume a book that is practical rather than theoretical<br />• Deals with today's business realities<br /><br />This is different from the vast number of business books I have read in the past and that is a good thing.  From advice on how to (or not to) hold meetings, how to get things done rather than perfect and perhaps the most interesting is the hypothesis that the authors posit - that bigger isn't necessarily better, and that you don't have to 'out feature' your competition.<br /><br />There are a host of other interesting positions that they put forth which are directed at entrepreneurs, professionals and small to medium businesses.  The great thing is that you don't need to try and institute an entirely new process/infrastructure with hours of training and consultants in order to get immediate value out of this book.  And even if you work at a larger corporation, there are tips and thought processes put forth that can help you in the way you decide to approach your own work and career each day.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - both for the ease in which it can be consumed and the immediate value you can get out of it.
B00BMUYLSE|2.0|All you fans of the \\"Thin White Duke\\" do yourself a favor, first listen to Ziggy Stardust, then The Next Day, you decide and you'll say the same thing I said... You had 10 yrs and this is what you put out????
B006BQM762|4.0|This movie won't blow you away, but it's done in the style of so many movies from the 80s. It pays tribute to such greats as the goonies, E.T., and other movies driven by child heroes. Definitely worth a watch.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I saw so many good reviews of the book and decided to read it during a long flight. I'm half way through the book, and I'm struggling to get beyond the boring part of this book. It drags on and there's nothing refreshing so far. The story is cliche and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel about the characters... no one stands out in the book and the dog's narration seems very fake and cheesy. I feel bad to give this book only 2 stars, especially so many people liked it. But I honestly did not enjoy it and will not finish it.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|I purchased Ms. Sandberg's highly anticipated Lean In because I have a young daughter and have developed an interest in issues affecting women. The book is an interesting conversation starter regarding women seeking to achieve prominent positions in the corporate world and government. However, it falls short in recognizing that over-ambitious and reckless people caused much of the financial calamity over the last five years and is far too optimistic about men and women sharing child-rearing duties. Much of the criticism of the book in the media seems to revolve around her being a man-hater (she is most certainly not) and that the book is only intended for the Ivy League elite. While the value system she espouses may seem a bit alien if you are not a one percenter, writing a book that explains to every woman in the world how to improve every aspect of their professional lives is not a feasible undertaking, so I do not wish to fault her for having a limited target audience. If you are a young professional woman that is well-educated and looking to go far, this book will be of interest of you. Lean In could also serve as good policies and practices for high-level managers to implement to facilitate mothers in the work place, promotion of women, and ensuring adequate work-life balance.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is very slow and involves Ms. Sandberg informing her readers of awards she has won, famous people she has met, and the success of her career. These self-serving anecdotes may work at a speaking engagement, but they do not make for good writing. It was incredibly off-putting and it is a mystery why the editors felt the need to include this information. Ms. Sandberg is very famous and well-known for her accomplishments, so this type of information is completely unnecessary. Most readers will already know about her before cracking open Lean In, so there is no need for Ms. Sandberg to take up valuable print space talking about what a success she is. She should have gone straight the message of the book in Chapter 1.<br /><br />Ms. Sandberg raises some interesting points on work-life balance and the need for husband and wife to share child-bearing and household duties. Although, I disagree with her strongly that a man can be as good as a woman at raising a child (especially a baby), she does have some good points that men in the modern world need to take up more of the daily tasks, especially as there are more and more working mothers. The discussion of flexible work hours for families is also important and how some of the stigmas of \\"not being at the office\\" need to be removed. She seems to be speaking to higher-level executives in the hopes that they will adjust their company's policy--hopefully Ms. Sandberg's ideas will be accepted.<br /><br />Some have said that she overly criticizes men, but I feel she did not go far enough. Judging by the content of Lean In, you would think everything is swell at Silicon Valley and women in the tech industry are just as welcome as men, if only the women would be more ambitious and assertive. However, reality tells a different story. The recent high-profile and ongoing sexual harassment suit at Kleiner Perkins, a well-known venture capital firm that has invested millions and millions of dollars in both Google and Facebook (Ms. Sandberg's former and current employer) was, unfortunately, ignored in the book. Ms. Sandberg had the opportunity to take some well-deserved swipes at the culture in Silicon Valley, but the book reads like it was sanitized by the Google and Facebook PR departments. It's should be a book, not a corporate training manual.<br /><br />On the message of the book itself, Ms. Sandberg advises young women to put aside their guilt and nagging self-consciousness and be more assertive and risk-taking like the men. This approach may have helped Ms. Sandberg rise to the top, but this message could be dangerously misconstrued. Having guilt and humility implies a certainlevel of accountability for decision-making and a respect for how your decisions affect others, which is most definitely a virtue and not a flaw. Doing whatever it takes to get the best grade in the class and getting to the top of the corporate ladder (or Jungle Gym as Ms. Sandberg calls it) has resulted in an overwhelming ethical failure by the American elite. Chris Hayes book The Twilight of the Elites: America after Meritocracy discusses the concept in depth. So for women who are looking to get to those top positions, please remember that your decisions can affect the lives and morale of many. Please don't step on too many people's face to get what you want.<br /><br />It is admirable that someone as powerful as Ms. Sandberg wants to bring about social reform for women in the workplace. I wish her the best of luck in this serious endeavor.level of accountability for decision-making and a respect for how your decisions affect others, which is most definitely a virtue and not a flaw.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book is definitely different from the norm it helps you see something in a entirely different point of view that has almost a childlike quality. If you are reading it because of the movie it is completely different and only a few things match up. Would recommend reading but don't read it just because you watched the movie.

Highly recommended to have the Word of YHWH continually at our finger tips.

1451695195|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. A big waste of my money. I was not interested in simply reading more about NDE's,since I had already read enough about that phenomenon, so wasn't looking for that aspect so much as I was about how he felt his NDE proved heaven was real. I think the book 'Heaven is For Real' was much more to the point in that respect.<br /><br />I had an experience many years ago that was somewhat similar to an NDE,but I was very much alive and not near death. My experience was a new spiritual birth, outside the church, all alone with God, but as soon as it was over I ran and found a Bible to compare my experience to. I learned from the Bible that I had been born again from the Spirit of God/Jesus/Holy Spirit. I purchased this book because I was interested to see how Eben compared his NDE experience with the Bible. How else could he know it was heaven? Some things he wrote in the book sounded more like hell to me. We know, from the Bible, that Satan transforms himself into an Angel of Light to confuse and lead people astray from the truth. Has Dr. Alexander ever opened a Bible--even once? He doesn't mention going to the Bible to compare his experience to Scripture. That, it seems to me, would be the first thing an educated professional would do following his experience which he tells us was being in heaven. If you use the word heaven in a book title, the obvious implication in 21st century America is that you are talking about the heaven of Christianity, unless  you somehow point out something else. No, not so much as a mention of the Bible, and of all things, it is not even listed in his extensive reading list. Is it possible that he somehow felt that his experience set him above Christians, especially the much despised 'funamentalist' type Christian and he wanted to have heaven, but distance himself from those who claimed heaven as their future before him? Weird! It seems, over-all, that he wrote a book about his NDE, but he wanted the sales that a \\"Proof of Heaven\\" title would be assured to bring in. Shame!at a \\"Proof of Heaven\\" title would be assured to bring in. Shame!

B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Great CD with many good songs and arrived quickly.  I would recommend the purchase of Train 37 CD to others.
0385536828|4.0|This book is a clever and fun MI5 spy story set in 1970s London. Cleverly, the author sets the scene through the undiscerning literary tastes of Serena Frome, the lead character.  She reads everything from Solzhenitsyn to Ian Fleming's Octopussy.  I gobbled it up as if I were consuming a bag of candy and enjoyed every moment. (Unlike eating a bag of sweets, I had no serious regrets at the end.) The plot and the characters keep you guessing and McEwan's writing is -- as always -- pure pleasure to read.  The twist at the end of the book is cute -- maybe a little too cute.  But, as the title suggests, this book does not aspire to be an ambitious work of literary fiction; rather, it is a confection to be consumed and enjoyed.  At that task, it succeeds beautifully.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game which makes great fun. There are ways to clean your horse and the stable and to take part in competitions. Moreover the horses seem very real...

B00BLGXL3U|5.0|a number of customer reviews begin or contain the phrase:'i don't get it'...after reading these and then watching the movie, what is not apparent to me is how one cannot 'get' it.  the movie is a masterpiece of insight into humanity, often scratching its raw underside - perhaps that is why many don't 'get' it - because to 'get' it would be to entertain thoughts they'd rather not....the production is subtle, it is forceful, it is engaging, it is eerie in its depiction of cultism and it is brilliant.....what's not to 'get?'
B00BDPW7XE|3.0|I bought English Electric Part 2 partly based on the recommendations of the Amazon reviewers, many of whom thought it was superior to Part 1. Part 1 justifiably was voted the Best Prog album of 2012 by the listeners on Aural Moon. However, in my humble opinion Part 2 is clearly an inferior album. While Part 1 has some very memorable and diverse songs (the rock edge of The First Rebreather, pastoral banjo sounds of Uncle Jack, Byrds 12-string pop influence of Hedgerow, and syncopation of Judas Unrepentant), Part 2 lacks such strong and interesting material. In addition, BBT recycles some of their instrument sounds and melodic patterns as if Part 2 are the weakest songs (B-sides?) they left off of Part 1. The influence of early Genesis (e.g., Trespass) is quite obvious too but if you love Genesis it's not a big problem since many prog bands steal from them. (The Beatles stole from other bands and were quite happy to admit it, except nowadays such flattery may come with a lawsuit).<br /><br />If you are new to Big Big Train, I recommend you buy The Underfall Yard and Electric English Part 1.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|Not a love song in the tradition of [[ASIN:B003B6OSRG For your eyes only (1981) / Vinyl single [Vinyl-Single 7'']]] or [[ASIN:B0040P4SXQ a view to a kill 45 rpm single]] as the song begins with \\"This is the end\\". Fits well with the opening credits of [[ASIN:B00B5HQKNI Skyfall]] as Bond appears to fall from the sky.<br /><br />It mentions never having their heart but also loving arms around them. The sound is engaging, it almost seems some of the words are inaudible. Won the Oscar. Pretty sound.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars but to be completely honest I would rate it more like a 3 1/2, I'm just in a good mood today. As far as the writing itself goes I have no complaints, I just felt like it dragged in certain areas and it never reached that climax your always anticipating.  I wouldn't know who I would recommend this book to, maybe someone who's traveling that's looking for a quick read since I finished it in one weekend.

Very dispappointed especially because it will cost me more to send it back than what it costs!!!  Did i mention i am VERY disappointed????  Same thing with Pulp Fiction that I ordered!!!!
B00007LTIB|5.0|`Relayer' released in November 1974 has been called (though not all fans agree) \\"Yes' last great album\\". It's certainly a corker, though probably not the best starting point if you're just beginning the journey of discovery into the Yes musical legacy.<br /><br />Following the departure of Rick Wakeman at the end of the `Topographic Oceans' tour the band spent more than six months auditioning for a replacement keyboard player, all the time working on Jon Anderson's arrangements for the music to be released on `Relayer.' The final choice was Patrick Moraz, a Swiss-born professional musician steeped in the jazz-rock fusion style characterized by Miles Davis' `Bitches Brew' and the then-contemporary Mahavishnu Orchestra. Though `Relayer' was the only album release with this Yes line-up (Wakeman returned to the band late in 1976) Moraz brings a lot to the party and his faster, more aggressive jazz-funk style drives the music along with a special energy and gives it a harder edge.<br /><br />The album follows the same structure as `Close to the Edge' in that it has a 20-minute opening number 'The Gates of Delirium' containing several movements with varying tempos, then two further numbers each of around 10 minutes: the frenetic `Sound Chaser' and a more relaxing classic Yes number `To be Over' which in mood would have fit right in with the CttE album. The musical ideas were (as usual) conceived by Jon Anderson's rare genius for innovative arrangements, then worked on by the rest of the band in the studio.<br /><br />The music here is different to that of the band's previous work; it's denser, more multiply layered, darker and in places more aggressive - the only exception being perhaps `To be Over' and the final movement of TGoD `Soon' a slow melodic vocal-led track dominated by Anderson's soaring falsetto and reminiscent in style to `And You and I'. Steve Howe really lets rip with some awesome guitar passages and Chris Squire, as ever, continues to ignore the rule-book and deploy the bass as a lead instrument by playing complex counter-melodies in the treble register (eat your heart out, Jaco Pastorius). Alan White holds the whole thing together through split-second time-signature changes effortlessly executed, proving himself an equal partner in this extraordinary band of musicians.<br /><br />Like the epic `Tales', you might need to listen to `Relayer' a few times before you start to genuinely enjoy it. Truth be told, no-one is making music like this in the 21st century. Today's musical landscape is in tune with current cultural values: predominantly aimed at instant gratification like fast food, it's in comparison just plain dumbed-down.and deploy the bass as a lead instrument by playing complex counter-melodies in the treble register (eat your heart out, Jaco Pastorius).

0393343405|5.0|One of the very best books I have read recently. THE SWERVE is a literary detective story, a beautifully researched and written account of the recovery of the ancient poem by Lucretius, DE RERUM (THE NATURE OF THINGS). Most interesting to me was the Epicurean origins of Lucretius' idea, and the systematic suppression of the work by the Roman Catholic Church. It left me wondering what the world would be like today, if the text had been readily available historically. Would the The Enlightenment have happened centuries earlier?  This book raises many questions about our own time.

0780622553|4.0|Dark City is aptly named.  The &#34;world&#34; it conveys is dark, dirty, and sinister.  I had never heard of this movie before a co-worker told me about it.  He defined it as a cult classic.  I can understand why it would generate a following.  It's a great movie.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the movie, and all about my co-worker.  He told me way too much about it and spoiled it for me.  Nonetheless, I was glad to have seen the movie for myself.  If you're not into sci fi, this movie may not be for you.  If you're a sci fi nut like I am, however, Dark City will not disappoint.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Into the Wild represents the spirit of man in its most primal and spiritual instinct, in its desire to be encompassed by nature, environment, emotion, and self-sufficiency.  The film, while indeed demonstrating the consequences of the main character's choices, also demonstrates with fluid direction and dialog the need for humans to be co-dependent on nature, and to find happiness in everything around us.  Leaning on literature, philosophy, and emotions we all share in the postmodern flux of chaotic society, this film illustrates effectively a desire I believe we all at some point have: to break free from whatever burdens society places on our shoulders, to be in the most primal of places.  If this is one goal of the film, it is accomplished exceedingly well.<br /><br />Yet I also utilize this film in my college Critical Thinking classroom to demonstrate the ideological warfare between discourses, between identities and the forces that socially construct them.  In this regard, there is no better film, I believe, for examining where identity originates, and for witnessing a true story that portrays the consequences of discursive divergence.  An all around great film, but not for those complacent and comfortable in the artificiality of postmodern geographies.

B008LC8TJI|1.0|Unfortunately, this album and their last (Hands all Over) have one thing in common.  The \\"band\\" seems to have gone away from making talented, thoughtful, original music to a more popular variety that sells better.  This used to be one of my favorite bands, but I am finding that I do not enjoy the songs on their 2 most recent albums.  Come back to your roots Maroon 5!!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great books. I just wish fewer faves of mine had died. I will start them reading with my son this summer
B005ZUR724|2.0|Love this game. It's great.<br /><br />Since update this week I can barely connect. When I do, I'm in some queue to enter the server that's 130+ people long.Then, if you get in the game, there have been numerous server issues that disallowed travel and entering new game zones. Very disappointing from a game I've been logging some serious hours on and told a lot of my friends about.<br /><br />The content of the update was great though....

I work with students who don't tend to like to read for enjoyment, but these books have changed that dramatically.  We only had 2 of the books at school so I bought several more on my own.
