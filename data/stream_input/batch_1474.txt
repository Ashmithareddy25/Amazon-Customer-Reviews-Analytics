B005LAIGN2|1.0|Cuba Gooding is one of my favorite actors.  How they recruited him for this movie, I will never know.  This movies sucks.  The story line could make for a great movie, but the screenplay, acting, and music are terrible.  The actors stubble over their lines and there is no flow to the movie.  The flying and special effects are good, but they don't make up for the other stuff.  I watched it once and it made for a good nap.  I won't watch it again.

B004RKXNDU|4.0|Showing what a literary lowlife I am, I bought this to fill in the gaps after watching the Oldman remake.  For those not acquainted with le Carre', this is a rather dense book and you really need to think when reading it, unlike most of the fluff on the shelves at your local brick-and-mortar chain store(s).  It's quite riveting - I rode the train totally oblivious to where I was for thirty minutes one morning while reading this.
B00000J6AG|3.0|Yea, prior to doing this stuff which isn't bad.  It reminds me of Beck.  There's a heap 'o stuff here.  My daughter when she was around 15 was horrified that I like PET SHOP BOYS.  It's what we call a guilty pleasure.  But their hits are dance done right, great overall presentation.  Normally, I like JIMI, punk, hardcore punk, international hardcore punk and rock with some jazz and some world.  I tried this and was not disappointed but it's not really for me.  Lotsa energy, lotsa ideas but doesn't really ring my bell.  PET SHOP BOYS hits, that does it for me.  Glad I bought it, especially since I bought the VATICAN COMMANDOS 7\\" and 12\\" back in the early 80's and glad i did, real hot hardcore punk rock.  ciao bella. God bless.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is every bit as intriguing as the first one. The puzzles are a bit more complicated which makes it just that much more fun to play. If you like the first Quell, you'll love this one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|extremely fun! very addicting and lasts hours. pretty much built everything already. I have to give props to g5 entertainment.
0061537969|4.0|I want to start by saying that I am not really a dog person and everyone who recommended this book to me was, so I was a little apprehensive when I first opened it up.  I was pleasantly surprised though by how much I enjoyed it.  The writing was great and the I loved the 3rd party prospective.  Seeing the highs and lows of a persons life told through the eyes of someone narrating events with such unconditional love, oddly ties you in to the human emotions of living.  Strange being that a dogs perspective could convey such feeling, but the writer obviously has talent. The subject matter has a little bit in it for everyone: Dogs, race cars, relationships, family and loyalty.  Well worth the read.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Keeps me entertained for hours. Wiki entries help get you solving. Makes me want to get the nintendo version for the day.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|very easy to read and visualise. could have perhaps ended the story on book 1 if written the right way- definitely felt like story was being dragged out so can have a trilogy.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Sometimes watching \\"old\\" movies makes one chuckle at the lack of sophistication and attempts at \\"special effects.\\" Watching this film has something of the opposite impact--it makes one appreciate the depth of talent displayed and that writers, directors, and actors actually had to rely on the storyline and acting for films to succeed. This is one that did and does.<br /><br />Some of the \\"special features\\" drag a bit, but it is interesting to hear Gregory Peck talk about the film and to experience his wit and humor. Again, \\"behind the scenes\\" isn't about how things get blown up or car crashes are staged. It's about the heart and soul of the film, the characters and the actors who portrayed them.<br /><br />In a word, \\"Recommended.\\"<br /><br />While some kids might groan at the black and white images and lack of \\"action,\\" it's good family viewing. There's a lot to experience and a lot to talk about.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|really badly written as mentioned in previous reviews by other readers. James used almost one whole page to descibe a hair brushing episode un-necessarily....just skimmed and skipped sections. didn`t even bother finish reading the book.
1416955070|3.0|Nothing like a little clubbing in New York to change your forever.<br /><br />Fifteen year old Clary was thrilled to get an evening at the happening club Pandemonium, hanging out with her best friend Simon.  Dancing and a good time was definitely on the agenda... witnessing a murder was not.  Yet Clary is unnerved when she witnesses three teenage boys commit a murder that no one seems to notice but her, and then the body disappears into the air without leaving behind even a trace of a struggle.<br /><br />Into the air!<br /><br />Shortly there after Clary takes a call from her mom telling her not to come home but to go anywhere else and then she hears her mom being attached.  By the time she does arrive at the house it is ransacked and her mom is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of the Shadowhunters, a group of warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons.  When a Shadowhunter  close to her own age named Jace comes to her rescue, things become interesting.  Clary is introduced to a while new world she never knew existed.... one of fighting for justice, and filled with weapons... and apparently, good looking guys.<br /><br />As Jace, as well as his close friends Alex and Isabelle, come to help Clary find out what happened to her mom, they all discover that Clary's meet up with the Shadowhunters was less of a coincidence than one may think.  Clary is connected to these people more than anyone had realized...<br /><br />and that puts her in a dangerous position.<br /><br />City of Bones was pretty much what I expected, an interesting paranormal YA genre of these Shadowhunters who fight demons among us every day human types who really don't have a clue of what is going on around us.  The Shadowhunters use something they call \\"glitter\\" that makes us everyday humans not be able to see them as they truly are, but instead they blend right into wherever they are:  an elderly gentleman making his way down a hospital corridor, a businessman walking hurriedly through the streets of New York...  if you were wondering how Clary seen them... well, that I can't give away.<br /><br />While I found City of Bones to be interesting and well written, I don't see myself diving into the rest of the series.  It was good, but didnt hook me to the point I need to go and get the second book right now!riedly through the streets of New York...  if you were wondering how Clary seen them... well, that I can't give away.<br /><br />While I found City of Bones to be interesting and well written, I don't see myself diving into the rest of the series.

0920668372|5.0|I first picked this up while browsing childrens books at Target.  Luckily there was no one nearby because I was in tears before I got halfway through the book.  I bought it not for my toddler son, but for ME.  When I read it to my mom, we were both in tears by the last page.  I took it to work and my friend read it...same reaction! (she is a mom too).  While it's kind of borderline creepyish when mom drives across town to climb into her sons window (haha), the deeply moving love of a mother for her child overcomes the crawling across the floor part of it.  The end is so touching to me....I do feel that if you are NOT a mother, you may not be moved at all by this story.  I have a little boy, and this story really spoke to me.  I feel a love for my child I never understood before I had a child.  My husbands mother recently passed away.  I was startled when cleaning out her bookshelf and this very book tumbled out.  The same exact copy! At first I thought \\"Did I loan her this book?\\" but no, it was hers.  She had three sons and my husband is the \\"baby\\".  I felt sad that I never discussed this book with her and thereby found out she had a copy too, but she loved her boys very much and I bet it brought a tear to her eye also!

B007JM4CWY|5.0|After playing for the past few days, I've decided this game is fun, addictive, and very well made. I just wish I had a Kindle Fire, would be even better on a bigger screen!

B0042RUMJG|3.0|Nice addition to your Sting library, good picture, but unless you absolutely have to have ALL Sting releases, this one just does not make the grade for a Bly-ray disc.  Orchestra - 5 stars, performance & presentation by Sting - 4 stars (maybe).  Material selection - 3 stars.  Audio mix (5.1, really???) - 1 star, in other words, bad.  Even worse with headphones mixed down to 2 channels.  I like the CD much better, have not seen/heard the DVD.
0446585025|1.0|What a disappointment.  I love Ellen and her standup routines.  She is a very funny lady but not here.  I couldn't even finish the book.  Maybe writing's not her thing!!!  Still think she's great though.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Hunger Games is a great movie. Follows pretty well with the book. This is a good movie for anyone aged 12 and older. The books are very well written, I can't wait until the next movie comes out. I would recommend the series to everyone.
0345803485|2.0|I went on the recommendation of an intelligent, educated friend and I needed a quick read for a long weekend away.<br />Not worth the ten bucks it cost to download to my Kindle.<br />Had I gotten it from the library I wouldn't mind so much. This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read and all I kepp thinking about is the author laughing all the way to the bank!<br />Strictly for young twenty-somethings.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Lame and hard to follow due to the slow pace. I found myself wanting to clean the house instead of finishing this movie.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have never played this type of game before, but it is great. Its very challenging, yet very fun. The directions are easy to follow. Its so rewarding to complete each level of play. This has provided hours of entertainment for my family and we are only on the second level.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you like these kind of puzzles, this is absolutely worth the $5. If you're not a big fan of math puzzles, give this one a pass.<br /><br />I have been playing it almost nonstop since I got it. Good challenge.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|Lots of reviews that cover how great this is: this is a wonderful app - for tablets.  Most of the puzzles have so many squares that they are impossible to work on a cell phone without increasing size of font and massive scrolling.  Fingers are just not small enough to touch the desired square without touching unwanted squares.<br /><br />I have Samsung Droid Charge with a 4.3 inch screen.  Can't imaging doing these are even smaller screen.<br /><br />Would love to see more puzzels with up to 9 large squares. The level of difficulty progresses too quickly (i.e. too many large squares).  Would have loved more puzzles with 9 or fewer squares that one can complete quickly at end of day or when one has just a few minutes to play (and are workable on phone).<br /><br />Lots of fun, but more shorter puzzles please!

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|When I was a pre-teen I picked up my first comic book and I remember thinking to myself, won't it be a great day when these great, escapist stories can be made into films. For the most part until the 90's I was pretty disappointed in the effort. However, going to see the Avengers was like a cathartic moment. It was if all the previous work on comic books films were all a preamble to this film. Don't get me wrong there are some great comic films out there now, like Sin City, Watchmen and many others. But for the most part these films felt like I was watching a film about a comic book instead of a film sprung forth from a comic book. Films and comic books are different media and I think until this film, although it has been close, there has never really been a film like this. This is no longer a comic book film BUT a really good film that just happens to use concepts first created for comic books.<br /><br />And in the same train of thought although this film is not a copy of a comic book, it has almost perfectly held true to the comic book ethos and should not, for the most part, disappoint the hardcore comic book fan. However, one of my few criticisms of the film deals with a difference between how one particular character is portrayed.<br /><br />I am not going to go into the plot of the story as you should go see/buy it for yourself! Just stay watching after ALL the credits. There are TWO bits after the credits.<br /><br />Now below I am just listing a few criticisms of the film, but over all I give it a sold A. It would have been an A+ expect for the following.<br /><br />In the comic books, Thor is clearly a Norse god and is unquestionably Marvel's \\"Superman\\". Between his own film and this film there seems to be a effort to take him down a few notches. I don't really know why but I have a feeling that somewhere there is an old, childhood prejudice against this character. I am sure somewhere along the line, some power that is, didn't like that Thor was the best of the best and is using his/her influence to knock him down a few pegs. I find it silly and very disappointing because if he was portrayed honestly, it would severely add to not only the escapism but bring a real since of order and justice to counter the Hulk's raw terror.<br /><br />I also was a bit disappointed in the Captain America's line that proclaimed that Thor was not a real god and only the Christian god was. For that reason alone, I can't give this film five stars. There are people out there that still worship the Norse pantheon and making that swipe is no more different than saying the same thing about Allah or Buddha. The only reason this part hasn't received any bad press is that few pagans that still worship Thor (et all)have a really good sense of humour and are very few in numbers. If they picket the film who cares right?<br /><br />Another criticism I had about this film was a wee bit of dialogue by Loki when he was in Berlin. It was just too \\"hokey\\" and could have been written much better.<br /><br />And my last very, very, very, tiny criticism is that this film was in New York. There should have been at least a mention or shout out to the Fantastic Four. NYC is their stomping ground and by all rights someone at SHIELD should have at least mentioned them. And come on, let's all admit it, wouldn't it have been awesome to see the Hulk turn around and come face to face with The Thing?f the best and is using his/her influence to knock him down a few pegs. I find it silly and very disappointing because if he was portrayed honestly, it would severely add to not only the escapism but bring a real since of order and justice to counter the Hulk's raw terror.<br /><br />I also was a bit disappointed in the Captain America's line that proclaimed that Thor was not a real god and only the Christian god was.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|I have followed Paul Simon for a lifetime, from the early days with Art Garfunkel, and always enjoyed his music.  He has continued to mature as a musician and a man, and this last piece of work is simply amazing- flawless!  He is a musical genius at the top of his game and at ease with that place in his life.  Reminds me of Woody Allen and 'Midnight in Paris', or Clint Eastwood and 'Hereafter.'  The depth, compassion, wisdom and positive energy found in this music is a constant source of inspiration for me...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game and awesome relaxing spa music. Please develop more games like this for us adults to play and enjoy
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I am a huge fan. I go to his concerts and buy every CD and some DVD's too. This is different Bonamassa. To me, it seems like he has incorporated his experience with Black County Communion into his work. More rock and less blues. These songs have a more relaxed (but great) style. Dare I say, more like Clapton. I love it. If you are a fan, I think that you will too.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash is at the top of his game here and on a whole other level these days. This is a great release. This has been a great month for artist releases and this is surely one of them. Some ripping guitar work. Glad to see he has found a band lineup to gel with. Alot of people are kind of slamming on Myles Kennedy here. I think he does a great job and is able to pull off some of Slash's previous work with G&R and Velvet Revolver. Not too many guys out there to do this. He fits the mold. As with most singers for me, I get tired of hearing them over time and prefer one who can chage up there game. Example of a great vocalist that I can only take so much of is Glenn Hughes. Great voice, but after a few songs I am over it. I dont get tired of listening to Myles on here. The song Not For Me is my favorite and sure to become a hit. Happy for Slash, and would definatlly make a point to see them in concert. Slash's new band is more G&R than G&R is.
B00074DXJE|5.0|Compared to the list price (50$ as of 5/25/2012) spending 7$ (including S & H) is a insane deal for this VHS Tape.<br /><br />Regarding the film itself, it's phenomenal, such a simple plot, but when in the hands of James Wan (Writer & Director) & Leigh Whannell ('Adam' & Writer). It's transformed into this thriller that will keep your eyes fixed to the screen, just waiting to discover what happens next.<br /><br />I doubt many who've seen the film knew what was coming at the very end. And if you've yet to see it (and haven't read/heard spoilers) I doubt you will either.<br /><br />If you can stomach the gore, and are fan of horror/thrillers. You will want to add 'Saw' to the list of films to watch before you die.<br /><br />-Understand that such statements above are opinionated and if you disagree then so be it.-
B000055Y0X|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film DR. STRANGELOVE is a hilarious film about the nuclear annihilation of the human race. Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his  B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution.<br /><br />Originally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, DR. STRANGELOVE became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse and are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly betweeen Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War II.<br /><br />Filmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is. Nonetheless, this film remains perennially funny, and even after numerous viewings over the last 15 years or so I still laugh every time.

0439023513|4.0|*Spoilers Ahead*<br /><br />Perhaps one of my most avoided categories of books is the \\"Young Adult\\" section. It's that section in the bookstore that sits somewhere between greeting cards and mystery novels that normally smells of too much perfume and hormones. A section that more mature readers tend to thumb their noses at and move on to the \\"real love stories\\".<br /><br />I imagine that it is very difficult to write about the life of a teenager, even one pressed into such extreme circumstances depicted in the Hunger Games without alienating a host of older readers who are long past the days of fantasizing about being loved by two attractive men who ultimately want to kill the other for the heroines affection. I mean, it's been at least two months since I've had that fantasy.<br /><br />Still the teenage brain is, without a doubt, one of the most intriguing, horrifying and vast canvases upon which to start a trilogy of books. There is nothing a teenager cannot do. They are developed adults physically and range from Dora the Explorer to Stephen Hawking mentally.<br /><br />That's not to say those storylines can't be compelling, but it takes a truly great writer to dive into the inner angst of the teenage brain and pull out of it a story that is both moving and relatable. For the most part, Ms. Collins brings to life all of these aspects in her wildly popular Hunger Games Trilogy.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, the main heroine of this trilogy, is the stereotypical young female that is confused by things like love, boys and is often betrayed and confounded by her own emotions and thoughts. Katniss is the representation of what this author seems to believe are some of the most basic concerns of young females the world 'round. The Hunger Games really gives its reader a front row seat to the inner emotional turmoil of its main character. We get a glimpse at the inner struggle of a young female trying to find her way in a world that has thrown her, by chance, into the mostdifficult of situations. It isn't enough for her to simply survive the Hunger Games, she is asked to be the poster-child of a movement that will change not only her personal world, but that of every single person in this fictitious nation known as Panem.<br /><br />The basic tenets of a teenager unwillingly pushed into an undesired situation that ultimately proves her mettle while depicting her mental unraveling aren't new (think as far back as, I don't know, Harry Potter). However, one of the greatest assets of this book is that the idea of the Hunger Games is uniquely compelling, violent, and refreshing. It wasn't lost on me the similarities of this series of books to that brilliant film Pan's Labrynthe. It is the fusion of intense innocence with utter depravity and gut wrenching violence.<br /><br />The age old question is asked, at the epicenter of this collision, when good and evil fight to the death, which will emerge victorious out of the unimaginable destruction that will be left in the wake of their war and, will it have all been worth it?<br /><br />The backdrop of this story mixes the extreme lavishness of the Capitol city, led by an evil President Snow and a group of citizens that live to feed their most base desires while 12 districts of slaves spend their waking lives working to insure the status quo is preserved.<br /><br />The Hunger Games are the piece de resistance of the Capitol lifestyle. They are the brutal display of two young adults, one male and one female from each district, forced into an arena where they fight to the death and only one walks out the victor. 23 dead, one alive. Are you not entertained?<br /><br />Think The Truman Show, only instead of cameras following every moment of one man's fake life, the Hunger Games arena has cameras that follow every move and fatality dished from one innocent victim on another for the amusement of the gluttons and bon vivantes of the capital city. The districts who were forced to offer up their progeny for the Capitols entertainment are required to watch and cheer for the small chance they get a devastated son or daughter back or watch in agony as their life is snuffed out either through murder or unspeakable horror.<br /><br />The foundation of this story is so compelling that it wasn't difficult to become invested not only in the story of Katniss, but also for her Games-mate Peeta. Both were well developed characters that stood together in the games and created a spark that began a revolution. The world created in the Hunger Games is so interesting that, at times, it even outshines the characters built to give it life.<br /><br />Unlike many authors who take on the unique challenges of writing a trilogy, Suzanne Collins rarely loses control of the pace of her novels. This pace has one speed. Fast. Most of the times this is extremely refreshing. Her story moves quickly and outside of the occasional Katniss introspection rarely wastes words. One of the unfortunate side effects of this fast pacing is that, at times, critical and interesting details are left up to the reader's imagination to fill in the holes. Perhaps this is on purpose but the general effect is that the development of certain characters are lost.<br /><br />The most poignant example of this is the character of Gale, Katniss's childhood friend, a friend that she, in typical teenager fashion, misreads as just a friend. Gale's love for Katniss is undeniable but falls deeply in that \\"Eros\\" section, a love that requires affection be returned to last. Gale might be Katniss's closest confidant but instead of coming across as a protector until the final chapters of the last book he comes across as jealous, bitter, and even vengeful of Katniss and her relationship with Peeta. At the end, when he is sold to us a wounded hero it rings hollow. When compared to love for Katniss shown by her Games-mate Peeta, Gale is character that suffers from a lack of any serious development, a situation perhaps even Suzanne Collins realizes at the end of her trilogy as he is epilogued away into nothingness.<br /><br />For its violence and understated political messages the Hunger Games is, at its core, a love story. It's a love story that is not well told by its heroine but by her supporting cast, and in this way Ms. Collins created something akin to a masterpiece.<br /><br />Love is usually broken down into three categories, ranging from least to greatest:<br /><br />1. Eros - a love that is based on the erotic. It's the physical attraction love that relies on romance.<br /><br />2. Philos - a love based on friendship and mutual respect. At its core, there is a mutual admiration for one another that goes beyond just the physical.<br /><br />3. Agape - unconditional love. This love is selfless, like that of a parent or best friend.<br /><br />While Gale was relegated to some kind of hybrid of Eros and Philos love, the characters of Peeta and Finnick showed a true development from Philos to Agape and it's a story that truly stands out far above the violence and glamor of the Hunger Games and the resulting rebellion.<br /><br />At the end, when the innocence, violence, and depravity of this story collide and lay waste to everyone and everything, the love of these two characters for Katniss (and in Finnick's case Annie as well) tells a story far more compelling and powerful.<br /><br />In book two, we are introduced to the character of Finnick who at first glance seems to be the typical knucklehead brochacho who thinks that he is all that. Over the course of one half novel Suzanne Collins develops a single character that steals the story away from her heroine with a love story so compelling that it completely overpowers anything created between Katniss and Gale. Finnick, who puts everything on the line to keep Katniss alive in a true act of Philos love during the Quarter Quell in the second book, shows true Agape love when he sacrifices everything for her at the very end. It was the ultimate tragedy. It was brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.\\"<br /><br />As these books raced to a climax Suzanne Collins was in what must have been her storytelling finest. The descriptions of the rebels path through the Capital city put her writing skill on full display but as she crashed her readers through the streets of her final battleground something went wrong.<br /><br />I have never written a novel before so I can't imagine how difficult it is to finish out a story but I imagine it is one of the hardest things for a writer to do. As hard as it must be to lay those first words on paper, it must be ten times harder to write those final words.<br /><br />There is a moment near the end of \\"Mockingjay\\" where everything seems to come to a grinding halt, suspended in time. A certain action one way or the other would send this story in completely different directions to its end. Katniss and her soldiers have made it up to the steps of President Snow's mansion which he has protected with a front line of children, the ultimate show of cowardice and brutality. Then, in a moment of true horror, she watches as she and they are all obliterated by fire.<br /><br />Game over.<br /><br />It is here that Suzanne Collins had the mammoth task of making everything that Katniss and her loved ones went through worthwhile. Instead, Katniss falls into a confusing mixture of grief, self-pity, and catatonia. As readers we are left to wonder if everything Katniss did leading up to that final climax would have made any difference at all, or should she have simply kept back where it was safe and helped by continually making more propoganda videos for the rebel cause?<br /><br />It is almost like the ending became too big for its author. The ending too important and consequences too serious. The love story leading up to this moment fell away to utter violence and destruction and once again, as the chapter closes, the readeris sped along as months pass wondering what the point of that moment really was other than to completely break our heroine?<br /><br />As the story is wrapped up neatly in a short epilogue the redeeming qualities of Peeta and the men and women who played a part in this story are forgotten behind a backdrop of personal devastation. Once again, a critical part of this story is left up to the reader's imagination.<br /><br />After the Capital has been overthrown a character we hardly know has taken over as President; leaving the future of Panem nothing short of meaningless. While the reader may be interested in the results of the rebellion in Panem, we focus instead back to District 12 and Katniss who, years into the future, watches the kids she never wanted play on a graveyard of memories she will never recover from. There will be no salvation for Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />And in light of this fact Suzanne Collins plays one final game of Real or Not Real with her readers:<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta live happily ever after...<br /><br />Not real.

B000OVLINI|4.0|Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, born in Barcelona in 1964, is known as one of Spain's most successful contemporary writers whose works have been published in 45 countries.  His first novel \\"Prince of the Mist\\" (1993) earned the Edeb&eacute; prize for young adult fiction.  He has authored an additional three young adult novels, the last \\"Marina\\" published in 1999.  \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" (2001) is Zaf&oacute;n's first novel written for adults; a second adult novel published in 2008 was entitled \\"The Angels Game\\" and his latest novel \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" (2011).  Zaf&oacute;n, while a native of Spain, has lived in Los Angeles since 1993 where he has been developing his writing career.<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a novel of the mystery/intrigue/love story genre.  It is narrated in the first person by the main character of the work; dialog is denoted and is attributable to the person speaking. The writing style is variably complex with many descriptive passages drawing vivid depictions of persons and places; a talent attributable to the author's penchant for film and screen plays. Although described as an \\"adult\\" novel, the writing invokes the author's previous entry into literature writing for young adults.  The composition liberally draws from the persona of young characters in the story and invokes that subtlety in the overall cast of the writing.<br /><br />The tale takes place in Barcelona during the early 1900's and extends to about 1958.  At its heart, the story is about a small cadre of young men brought together by circumstances while attending an exclusive private school. Each of them has some distinct facet of his current life that weighs upon their association and that will eventually lead to the future fate of each.  Of particular interest in the group is one Juli&aacute;n Curax who as a young adult aspires to be an author and writes several books that never seem to attract a following; one of the novels he writes \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" becomes the catalyst for the tale.  The story opens in circa 1945 with ten year old Daniel Sempere taken by his father, a bookseller, to a mysterious place called the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\".  Young Daniel is sworn to secrecy about his visit and is given the privilege of selecting one of the books to keep for his very own. Daniel selects the novel \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Juli&aacute;n Curax and thus begins the quest by Daniel to unravel the mysterious life surrounding the forgotten author and his works.<br /><br />Zaf&oacute;n brings to the reader a compendium of characters in this work all seemingly linked in some way that determines their fate.  It requires some tenacity to recall all of the persons and their associations due somewhat to the foreign names used, although Zaf&oacute;n seamlessly and skillfully summarizes them all near the conclusion of the work and this provides a deft help to the reader.  While the novel is described as an \\"adult\\" work, it only seems so perhaps in its reach into some adult themes, but it could plainly serve a mature young adult reader and would probably seem quite exciting to a supple imagination. Zaf&oacute;n's skill at providing mental images of people and places though his writing is a particular highlight of the composition and that which makes it so enjoyable.  The mystery and intrigue is held to a high level and extends to the very conclusion piquing the reader's interest to discover ever more of the tale and fates of the characters.  The love story part of the novel brings forth the image of a Shakespearean tragedy replete with the fierce longing of young love that is adeptly woven into the saga.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you add this novel to your reading list. I would rate it \\"Memorable\\" and suggest that you won't be disappointed.the catalyst for the tale.

B005HJWWW8|1.0|This is my first ever review. I felt compelled to write it based on the vast amount of poor and inaccurate information out there. I was looking for a headphone amplifier to solve a basic problem that I am assuming many others have. My songs on itunes are not loud enough and I enjoy my music loud. Always.<br /><br />I originally purchased the Fiio E6 to solve this problem. I did so because it was the only brand that showed up on Amazon and in most Google searches. One has to dig rather deep to find anything else. Fiio had several models ranging from $20 to $200. When I received the E6 the model was so cheap that the jacks did not even stay in the holes. They were cut wrong. I sent this model back immediately.<br /><br />Upon further research I learned that many people were spending HUNDREDS of dollars to solve this simple problem. Then I came across the Pyle PHE3AB and took a chance on it for $17. It seemed like a simple unit for a simple problem. I also purchased the Fiio E9 Ipod Line Out Dock for $9 because it is the only plug of its kind and I needed something sturdy. It connects to the bottom jack (where you sync your tunes) of the ipod. So my total investment was just under $30.<br /><br />When the new unit arrived I put a AAA battery in and hooked everything up in seconds. PROBLEM SOLVED! The music is loud and clear and sounds amazing on my headphones. I am not really sure what a $200 amp does, but there is no way that it is worth the additional expense. There must be  a lot of people who believe their heaphones are much better than they really are. I use the Old School Grado SR60 (on most true connoisseurs' short list). I would put my music experience (under $100 minus the ipod) up against any more fashionable set up. Hope this saves you from the HYPE and leaves you with money to buy actual MUSIC!
014312093X|5.0|I start a John Le Carre book with mixed emotions.  I know that the story will be entertaining, but the reading will be difficult and sometimes taxing.  However, as the story finally unfolds, the intricacies that bogged down some of the telling, begin to put an edginess and intense nerviness into the plot.  The climax builds and builds and then as the subplots and characterizations turn into a climatic blaze, the reader is transfixed and engaged in the atmosphere of the Cold War.<br /><br />Wanting to read this trilogy for many years - beginning with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy - with George Smiley, the British intelligence head of the Circus (fictionalized MI6) and his Russian counterpart, Karla (from Moscow Centre), I've had trio of books sitting on my \\"to be read\\" pile.  Finally the movie came out recently and I decided that maybe I'd forgo the reading and succumb to being just a movie watcher.  Well, that didn't work out as the movie was just as confusing as a Le Carre novel (without the ability to re-read a section or go back and watch it a second or third time) and left too many questions unanswered.  Okay, I had to read the book.<br /><br />This might be the best Le Carre book that I have ever read.  The cat and mouse attacks by Karla and Smiley transcend time and bring us to intelligence work like no modern author.  The lines between good and evil blur as one side is being played by the other.  The players hardly know who is controlling them and pulling the strings.<br /><br />The book begins as Smiley was \\"retired\\" from the Circus in a set of confusing circumstances.  Smiley had begun to believe that the Circus was infected with a \\"mole\\" and thus his superiors were unhappy with his hypothesis.  But he doesn't give up.  And when the Prime Minister asks for his help, the levels and layers of spy vs. spy are initiated.  The hunt for an internal \\"mole\\" begins.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  However, that comes with a caveat.  If you are looking for quick, action packed thrills, this is not it.  If you are into story telling with characters that emerge as real as your life, then look no further.  I am now looking forward to reading book number two in the trilogy, The Honourable Schoolboy.packed thrills, this is not it.

B0081KTI0E|4.0|Not a big fan of horror movies but did enjoy this one since it was in the tradition of \\"Turn of the Screw\\".  I like the Victorian style ghost story that takes its time in presenting the plot and characters.  This film had nice sets and great costumes.  Also loved the ending.  If you are a fan of modern horror this will probably not be your cup of tea.  If you like your James then you will probably like this film.

This should be a must read for anyone wanting to achieve more in their career or be true to who they really are!  I've helped lead several start-ups within corporate settings and wish I'd had this book much earlier in my career to help me better establish my own brand and not become what I was doing at the time.  This book helps put you in control of your own career and defining who you are as a person and as a professional.

0399159029|4.0|This is my first Bernie Gunther novel, and several times in the first 50 pages I felt like tossing it on the charity pile, due to Gunther's crushing cynicism and incessant, stupid wisecracks.  However the novel improves dramatically once the scene shifts to Prague, where Gunther shares a manor with an odious collection of real-life Nazis, Reinhard Heydrich foremost among them.  The author makes the characters come alive, or what they called alive anyway.  Gunther hopes to solve the crime and get out of town, but his departure is delayed by a shattering scene which showcases the Nazis in all their depravity.

B007IE4DSG|5.0|I have collected all of Harrison's non-instrumental albums since 'All Things Must Past\\" when they were initially released and I found this compilation very satisfying. The demos are generally limited in instrumentation and many of the 'All Things' songs are pure without Phil Spector's wall of sound and it is quite pleasing just to hear Harrison's voice. I am particularly impressed with Harrison's ability to hit the complicated notes of 'Run of the Mill' while accompanied just with a guitar. I also liked the soulfulness of 'Awaiting on You All' that sounds very sincere and also contains two lyrics negatively referencing the Pope that were deleted from the commercial release. I also found Harrison's vocals on \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World'  from his \\"Living in the Material World' very strong vocally. In some of the demos, Harrison's voice has evidence of a slightly hoarse sound but not significant enough to mar the songs. The CD also contains two songs I don't recall from any of his previous albums, \\"Mama You've Been On My Mind' and 'Let It Be Me'  that I've never heard. Both of these added songs are of most interest to a long time fan and if you admired Harrison's work, you'll be happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Thanks to BearguyVA, I just leaned that the lyric about the Pope in 'Awaiting on you all' was in the original release but I apparently never heard the Pope reference on my 70s cheap stereo back when I had the original release and the Spector production may have  overwhelmed the sound clarity. So this CD is a real plus since the demo allows Harrison's voice to clearly stand out and hear all his lyrics much more clearly.  My reference on the lyrics did state the lyrics referencing the Pope were deleted from the enclosed lyric sheet in the original.
1400052181|2.0|I think many of the other reviewers have it right.  The salient facts of this case could easily have been presented in another feature-length magazine article.  Most of the rest of this book might just as well be the transcript of a reality television program. There is a political angle to this book that doesn't quite match with the reality it portrays. The Lacks family's dysfunction has nothing to do with \\"them cells\\" as much as the author might like us to think so, or as she might like to think herself.  I feel bad that Henrietta Lacks died so young and in so much pain, and that her surviving children live(d) in poverty and ignorance.  Her personal story, though, just isn't particularly interesting, and that of her surviving family even less so. Henrietta's cancer cells happened to have some special qualities, but Henrietta herself didn't beyond those that could be perceived by those who loved her.  If it weren't for a biological happenstance, Skloot may as well have picked a name at random out of the Baltimore telephone book and wrote a sketch of that person.<br /><br />NB: The Henrietta Lacks Foundation is nothing but a PayPal button with a link to the Lacks family's \\"website\\", which in turn refers one back to the Henrietta Lacks Foundation - bizarre, all of it.

0345803485|1.0|It gets 1 start from me due to my generosity.<br /><br />I cannot process the mass hysteria that has swept the nation with these books. To each, his own, sure, but WTF is appealing about a creepy, rape-y douchebag with a pen and a contract?<br /><br />...Please sign your vagignity (vagina/dignity) away here. And here. There. There as well. Congratulations. You are now the proud owner of nothing. Allow us to retire to my creepy, rape-y rape room...<br /><br />I'm far from a prude, so it isn't the thought of \\"taboo\\" sex that repels me. It's the thought of any form of sex with a nasty, pompous, creepy, rape-y loser like Christian Grey. I don't like slippery snakes like him. Not in RL and not in my books. That women across America (including some of my own close friends - *shame*) are falling over themselves for this filthy bastard of a character, makes me extremely sad. I'm also embarrassed for them.<br /><br />Additionally, I hated Bella with a passion, so why would I like Ana who is just the older, more idiotic version of that too-stupid-to-live character? And why is she always biting her lip? The chick is also clearly schizophrenic, as she spends a lot of time talking with, being talked to, and being chastised by her \\"inner goddess\\" and her SUBCONSCIOUS. That's right, folks. Ana has a conscious subconscious. So, just to make sure that this is clear as day: Ana, Ana's inner goddess, and Ana's subconscious act as 3 separate entities and they all converse in her head. Just do the world a favor - slip, fall, and die AnaBella.<br /><br />What's worse is that the sex in these books is CORNY and unimaginative! It's so amateurish and silly when it isn't downright disgusting and dirty in the germy way, not the good way.<br /><br />I cannot fathom why women everywhere are fanning themselves over this crap. I'm not a huge erotica fan, but even I have read some amazing erotica that will leave you  breathless. It's out there ladies. No need to condescend to rape-y douchebags toenjoy it.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the sub-par writing. Save your money and search for James' free Twilight fanfiction \\"Master of the Universe\\". It's nearly identical to FSOG, but with the original names of Edward and Bella - as E.L. James intended. Yah, she just changed the names on her free fanfiction, put a new cover on it, and now you get to pay her for that which was widely available for free. How lucky we all are.

B00127RAJY|4.0|If you, like me, are a mother that maybe has a few lbs to lose-this is a good start for you-my review is based on me as a mom without a lot of time to go to the gym or go running. It's a short video, it would be really easy to get up a little bit before the kids to do it and start your day off. It's nice and short, so you could cram it during naptime if you so desired.<br /><br />As for the workout itself-the moves themselves are not overly difficult in my opinion. Squats, regular crunches, punches and jumping jacks are all in level one. Pretty basic moves-and it offers modified versions of some of them so if you really can't do the harder ones, you can change it a little to build up. But you don't get to stop moving. That's the challenging part and where you really start to feel it. Too often you will be working out at the gym or wherever and stop once you feel the burn, and move on a bit later to the next move. Not here, you are just going going going. Jillian says it in the video-if you want results in 20 minutes, this is how you need to do it.<br /><br />A few nitpicks-the warm ups in the beginning are one direction-she has you do hip rotations for instance, in one direction only. I feel weird and need to alternate every so often to feel \\"even\\". I don't think just going in one direction will change the effectiveness of these moves but I'm a little OCD.<br />It's so easy to not want to do this though. It is intense for 20 minutes or so but it is still relatively boring to me-doing the same moves I did in a high school gym class. I have no doubt it would work really well if you can stick with it but for a lot of reasons, I have never finished the 30 days.
0446541478|5.0|I found this book not only easy to read and follow, but very well informed. As former employee of the Israel Government I read in the book internal information, I knew before, but thought not to be public. I personally behaved in military activities and Government projects very much as this book describes our way to innovate, as I also found agreement with my thoughts why all these happens and why we believe that it is right to act in a very Israeli way, called chutzpa.

0345803485|2.0|I bought this book because we're reading it for my book club. I was intrigued. I paid the 10.00 for it and now wish I could get that money back. The writing is just awful. I don't know who edited it, but oh my, they didn't do a very good job. There were so many phrases that were repeated over and over and over again. A few times, in the middle of a sexy-ish scene, Ms. James would use a word I'd never heard before and wasn't even sure I could figure it out through context. I feel like I have a pretty good vocabulary, so it was astonishing to me that out of nowhere she would use a fifty cent word that would send me to the dictionary! Who wants to go to the dictionary in the middle of foreplay?!<br /><br />If you would like a well written sexy novel, I'd recommend anything by Alison Tyler. You can start with [[ASIN:0352341661 Melt With You (Cheek)]] and [[ASIN:0352340398 Tiffany Twisted (Cheek)]]. Ms. Tyler can write circles...heck, she can write dodecahedrons around Ms. James. If you enjoy the kink aspect of Fifty Shades, you could always go with one of the little anthologies edited by Ms. Tyler (she also has a short story in it) like [[ASIN:1573443077 K Is for Kinky (Erotic Alphabet)]].
0345803485|1.0|I really expected more after hearing all the hype. I am a self-admitted smut addict. I love erotica in all flavors. This entire trilogy is unorigninal, unbelievable and uninteresting. I feel it is a complete waste of money and cannot believe the amount of press it is getting. There are too many deserving books that should be in the limelight instead.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|At this writing I have the \\"honor\\" of being the 100th person to place a review for \\"The Avengers,\\" an as yet unreleased DVD.  I shall attempt to write with all due aplomb.<br /><br />\\"The Avengers\\" is exactly what escapist movie fiction is supposed to be.  When real life contains as many terrors as Hollywood can dream up we need to laugh and cry and jump and shout at the screen to relieve those tensions.  To refer to this as \\"war porn,\\" as I saw one reviewer did, is to underestimate the powerful purgative and emotional effect that purely enjoyable movies like this do.<br /><br />This is a clever movie--it begins by introducing the villain, Loki, then two of the least well-known superheroes in the \\"Avenger\\" stable: Hawkeye and the Black Widow.  Only quick clues about them are given, but they're enough for the movie to progress.  (To tell you the truth I've seen the movie twice and I still don't have any real idea what the Black Widow does.)<br /><br />Regardless, one by one the superheroes and their supporters are brought to light--the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America.  Eventually, all make it to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s home base (and occasionally flying aircraft carrier) the Helicarrier.  It isn't long before they all begin to fight among themselves, and, as we all know from lots of film viewing we're going to need a reason to bind together.  That reason comes in the form of the death of someone very close to the circle of heroes, and unite they do.<br /><br />All of this isn't terribly important...I'm very sure some similar components would have occurred regardless of who wrote the film.  It isn't hard to figure that you have a bunch of superheroes and they all have egos the size of their talents, so you know it would be difficult for them to bind together.<br /><br />Apparently some similar plot was being put together for its original date of release in the summer of 2011.  But various factors required that the movie be pushed back a year, and along came Joss Whedon, who took the script in hand, rewrote it, and became its director.  And thus was birthed this version.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Joss Whedon has put together hit TV shows, yet has had little respect among the powers that be, nor a really successful show in a decade.  Once a writer on Roseanne's TV show, he wrote the original movie \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" then convinced the studio to allow him to re-create it as a television show.  He went on to win an Emmy for writing, and the show lasted five years on two networks.<br /><br />In 2002 Whedon went on to create the cult classic and oft called space western \\"Firefly\\" which, despite its strong core fan base (nicknamed the Brownshirts), was cancelled after 11 episodes even though they had shot 14.  Later this strong fan base encouraged Universal Studios to wrap up the series in a two-hour movie called \\"Serenity,\\" which again underwhelmed...despite the Browncoats.<br /><br />The same went for \\"Dollhouse,\\" a show that only ran two years...a victim, again, of low ratings.  Other than a couple of fan favorites like \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,\\" a short starring Neil Patrick Harris shot during the writers' strike, Joss Whedon had done little else that wowed anyone.  How he was able to land the directing post of \\"The Avengers\\" I simply don't know, but thank God he did.<br /><br />For instance, talk to anyone who enjoyed this film and ask them their favorite scene, and you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't tell you right off the bat it's one that involves humor...and, not coincidentally, the Hulk, whom I'll get to later.  And that, in a nutshell, is what Joss Whedon brought to this movie.<br /><br />Whedon's humor is ever present in his work, whether it is billed as a drama or not, and it is this humor that is at the heart of \\"The Avengers.\\"  It is through Whedon's jaundiced eye that we see these six superheroes interact, and it is through him that the story gains its humanity.  Think of it: the very fact that such oversized and super-powerful beings exist, even with the blessing of Hollywood, is funny.  And that they must CO-exist for any of this to work...well, that's hilarious.<br /><br />And it is this that lies at the heart of this extremely entertaining movie: what characterization that exists does so not to make our heroes SUPER, but HUMAN.  It is Whedon's genius to set his eye upon the all-too-normal traits that lie at the heart of all of us: vanity, pride, fear of failure, competitiveness, and even the desire to erase that part of us that we wish others not to see.  It is not that the characters can fly that wows us; it is that even he (or she) fears falling.<br /><br />I have heard some minor complaints about the drag at the middle of the film, when our heroes are weakest, when they fight among themselves. But I think it is this scene that makes the movie believable...that speaks to a deeper dread.  The crisis in this movie began when we sought to make bigger weapons, and making bigger weapons drew the eyes of bigger enemies.  If one thinks of it, the worst criminals never show up until there is a superhero worthy of them: there was no madman named Joker until there was Batman, no evil Lex Luthor until Superman.<br /><br />On a more well, human, scale, perhaps the greatest beneficiary of Whedon's careful eye is the Incredible Hulk, who has been regarded far too seriously in each of his two big movie outings thus far.  As portrayed by both Ed Norton and Eric Bana--and, hey, even going back to Bill Bixby's TV Hulk--the Big Guy has just been too serious.  It is only under Whedon's watch that he has blossomed, and in such a way as to provide many of the movie's best moments.  We even get to hear \\"Hulk, SMASH!\\" and it is so good to hear the audience laughing ALONG with the character rather than AT him.<br /><br />But as long as we're on the subject, some credit must go to Mark Ruffalo, who has humanized the Hulk as well with his gentle but knowing performance as the Hulk's better half, Dr. Bruce Banner.  His dark, rumpled face is perfect for the man whose monster lies within, a man who knows all too well what it is to walk around with a terrible secret.<br /><br />Who cares if the movie goes a little awry in the end, having politicians decry our heroes for the damage caused to the city?  (And who else is getting tired of EVERY movie that depicts NYC as the perennial victim?)  Not when we've had such a wonderful joyride getting there.<br /><br />This movie is a pleasure from start to finish, Speaking of which, stick around for the credits, and a little beyond.  There are two little fun snippets of film left as Easter Eggs for the fans who care enough to stick around.e very fact that such oversized and super-powerful beings exist, even with the blessing of Hollywood, is funny.

0307592731|4.0|Reviews for this book seem divided into two categories- those who read it expecting a story about a woman dealing with the untimely death of her mother, and those who read it expecting a travelogue detailing the experience of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. Those who fall into the first category love the book while those looking for a book about hiking are sorely disappointed. Luckily for me, I fell into the group that wanted to read about someone dealing with the loss of a parent, having lost one much too early myself, and for me this book felt like someone else telling the story of my past three years, and telling it beautifully and with great honesty.<br /><br />To those of you criticizing the stories of sex and drugs, let me just say this. Things get crazy when a much beloved parent die. You do things you would never usually do, you disconnect completely from those around you, and your normal feelings of conscience disappear. Strayed chronicles this with amazing accuracy, and if you think that she is being selfish then I can only hope that you never experience the kind of loss that will make you relate to the writing.<br /><br />If you go into the reading of this book with the correct expectations, it is a fantastic look at how people and families deal with loss, how the loss affects their lives and the lives of those around them, and the journey necessary to regain a footing in their lives. Strayed's writing is phenomenal, flowing, for the most part, seamlessly and elegantly, crafting genuine emotion that will make you laugh out loud and cry within pages of each other.<br /><br />If you are looking for a trail chronicle, though, I would recommend that you look elsewhere. The only reason I am subtracting a star is because I feel that the book has been mis-marketed as an outdoors adventure book, which it definitely is not.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am at a loss to understand how this book is being recommended by New York Times and Amazon.  It is poorly written, unintellectual, ridiculous and tedious.  This must be a hoax.  The only positive thing I can say is that, having invested in half the book, I skipped to the end to find out what happened.<br /><br />It is a piece of romantic trash at best.  The S and M component is overwhelming.  Beware!

1451627289|5.0|When an English teacher living in Lisbon Falls, Maine, reads an extraordinary paper from one of his adult GED students about a day that changed his life, he is moved in such a way that it becomes one of those life-changing moments.<br /><br />Then, seemingly by chance, Jake Epping's friend, Al, who owns a diner, shows him a \\"wormhole\\" to the past that can be entered into and returned from several times.  However, after each return, only two minutes have gone by, even though the time traveler can stay in the new place for five years.<br /><br />But there is a downside, possibly a warning against traveling back and forth:  after each return, there is a reset, and sometimes, the changes that unfold afterwards are not good ones.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Jake decides to take a leap and try for the ultimate change:  Preventing the assassination of JFK.<br /><br />He does a couple of test runs, and then, on his third try, finds himself in various towns in Texas, keeping track of Lee Harvey Oswald.  At some point, he ends up in Jodie, Texas, where unexpectedly he falls in love.<br /><br />How will love alter the events that play out?  Will the price of heroism be too high?  And what, ultimately, will happen to the world afterwards?<br /><br />[[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]] was a totally engaging novel filled with enough facts to make the story seem all too real.  I might have read it in one sitting if I'd managed to stave off the eye blurring and fatigue, since it was so hard to put down.  Despite taking it on in bits and pieces when I could, the story flowed, showing such rich and enjoyable characters that felt real, like the first-person narrator Jake Epping, who became George Amberson in Mid-Century America.  The fast-paced tale with its many twists and turns, and the somewhat startling conclusion, left me longing for a replay of a few parts.  I wanted to travel back to the world inhabited so happily by these characters--between tense and suspenseful moments--before everything changed for them.  I would luxuriate with them in the slow-moving, more innocent time that characterized the world before the computer age.  As much as I love our technological advances, there is something to be said for those nostalgic times that King brought back to me in such vivid detail.  Five stars!re everything changed for them.

0345803485|1.0|I have to wonder how this trilogy has been so successful. The writing is pedestrian at best, extremely cringe-worthy and appalling at worst. The fact this has sold so many copies is testament to good publicity and does not reflect on the worth of the book. The characters are cliches and the story line (if you can call it that) is quite pathetic. The explicit sex scenes becomes tedious as does Ana's lack of vocabulary. The success is simple. If you LOVE days of our lives and think it is 'good drama' then you will like this. If you have some intelligence and want well crafted characters and great drama, don't waste your money. FSOG is akin to what i imagine furballs would be like - Painful and prone to making you gag.

B0050PYNN0|1.0|I cannot tell you how much I regret having spent money on this horrible stinker of a movie. I enjoy a bit of low brow humor now and then, but this film seemed to have been put together for a very specific demographic: male, poor white trash - the kind of people who drive pick up trucks with big fat wheels, have guns (and go \\"huntin\\"), don't wash on a regular basis, can't hold down jobs or hold a decent conversation. What astounds me is how they managed to talk a couple of decent actresses into even being in this thing!! Frankly, this movie is SO bad, it makes Ishtar look like Casablanca. And I never thought anything could be as bad as Ishtar. The people involved in greenlighting this film, producing it, and \\"directing\\" it, should be tarred and feathered and dumped in some horrible nasty place where they can't bother people with such dreck anymore.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|There's something to be said for ending on a high note. A part of me thinks that if STARGATE UNIVERSE had to end at some point, this was the best way to send it off. Another part of me is still brooding, certain that this is pretty much FIREFLY all over again: a compelling series with a brilliant cast of characters and worlds of potential (Literally!) ended prematurely. If SGU had continued on, you can bet I still would've been there. As it stands, this is still one of the finest (if not the best) science fiction TV shows ever produced, in my opinion. There are 40 episodes in all, but it still doesn't seem like enough!<br /><br />If you've finished Season One, the Final Season picks up exactly where we left off. The Lucian Alliance is still in control of Destiny, which is being ravaged by radiation from a nearby pulsar, and the fates of some of the crew are still in flux. It seems like quite the standoff, but the entire thing is wrapped somewhat quickly (I won't say how), which gets us back to familiar territory.<br /><br />What makes SGU something special, to me, are the characters, their development, the mystery of Destiny, and the new worlds the crew visits through the stargate. Thankfully, the Final Season is really more of everything. The conflict between Doctor Nicholas Rush and Colonel Everett Young still endures, drawing a respectable schism between the military and the civilians aboard Destiny. Relationships are formed and broken, interesting worlds are discovered, more of Destiny is explored. I think the show really hit its stride in the first season, which is a hard thing to pull off with so many characters, so the Final Season just takes off at a sprint.<br /><br />And the sci-fi element, which was so prevalent in the first season, comes back in full force. It may seem odd, but it's rare for a sci-fi show to have the natural forces of space affecting the crew so constantly in (fairly) realistic ways. Serenity never had to worry about pulsars and black holes.<br /><br />Unlike LOST, we get a lot of answers here. This is one of the reasons it's hard for me to imagine SGU continuing, simply because it seems like the writers were merciful enough to not draw things out any longer than they needed to. Many stories were wrapped up to my satisfaction, though the ending is a bittersweet one. I won't say it ends on a cliffhanger, because I'd argue that it doesn't (I found it much more satisfying than BSG's oddball of a conclusion), but it's still tough to watch simply because the show could've gone on longer, and doesn't.<br /><br />There are some mysteries the show brings up that won't be resolved, some stories that aren't concluded directly. But it was never really about the destination; it was the journey. Whether or not our crew make it home or complete Destiny's mission is ultimately untold, but we're left with a hint in the final seconds of the final episode, in how everything comes back around full circle, that everything's going to be all right: whatever that means to the crew of the Destiny.<br /><br />If you've already watched the first season, you owe it to yourself to finish up the series, because everything is better the second time around. I wish that Syfy'd had enough faith in the show to keep it going for another season or two (though, they seem to be content with showing Wrestlemania and terrible, terrible low budget sci-fi films, so maybe it was inevitable), but I think we're left with enough here to perhaps wonder where the show could've gone, but still be satisfied with where we've been.les.<br /><br />Unlike LOST, we get a lot of answers here.

0345803485|1.0|Sorry I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't.  I've read a lot of erotic fiction,  but this is the worst!  Bertrice Small and Susan johnson will always be top notch in my opinion and of course who could forget Rosemary Rogers.<br />This book was too repetitive, not believable and even the sex, got on my nerves after a while,  it was blah, blah, was much too long! sorry will not read the other two, Ms Small no need to worry, this novel will never be an equal to one of yours!

B0084IG8TM|5.0|Every year, twenty-four teenage \\"tributes\\" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.<br /><br />This chilling premise is at the center of \\"The Hunter Games,\\" a brilliant, powerful movie adapted from the first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim (Willow Shields). But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), she is swept away to the Capitol.<br /><br />Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.<br /><br />But because Peeta publicly declared his love for Katniss, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young \\"lovers\\" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.<br /><br />I'm not sure why so many people compare \\"The Hunger Games\\" to the Twilight movies, because it literally has everything that \\"Twilight\\" does not. It has plenty of action, adventure, a subtle romance, and some barbed social commentary -- and it has a raw, passionate quality that easily matches its strong-willed heroine.<br /><br />The movie also shows us what a rotten place Panem is, whether it's the sleek, colorful superficiality of the Capitol or the faded squalor of District 12. But \\"Hunger Games\\" is at its best when it's in the forests of the arena -- there's a primal, wild quality to Katniss' adventures there, tempered with tenderer moments (such as when she cares for the gravely wounded Peeta).<br /><br />The romance with Peeta is also refreshingly uncliched, leaving the audience unsure of how much of their love was for the audience's benefit (although we glimpse some flickers of real love between them). The biggest problems are that a lot of the violence seems rather toned down, and the shakycam becomes rather annoying at times.<br /><br />But Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job bringing Katniss to life, imbuing her with strength, fear, brains and a fiery temper -- exactly what the \\"girl on fire\\" needs to have. Josh Hutcherson is equally good as Peeta, and there are a string of great performances by Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and Amandla Stenberg. There's a lot of passion in even the minor actors' performances.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" successfully mingles dystopian sci-fi, romance and a tale of rebellion, giving us a brilliantly raw, passionate movie.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day. If you like puzzles such as sodoku, you'll really enjoy this. I've been playing it constantly since getting it. There are tons of puzzles so it's not a game you'll finish soon. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars: it needs player profiles. Only one person's progress is tracked. I had to go back and individually &quot;delete &quot; solved puzzles so my husband could give it a try.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A very reliable weather source with all that I need to check onthe latest weather conditions, forecast, and radar. Most certainly reccommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a great tool for the Christian. Navigation is easy and the app is very User friendly. One of the best features is the reading plans. They help to keep the reader on track and daily reminders help to insure that,  in this hectic world where all our time is taken by other commitments, we take the time daily to read God's word and spend some time with him.
B0086700CM|5.0|omgomgomg!!! finally! ive been waiting soooo long for this!!!! I luv luv luv this game!!! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!! I'm sooooo happy now!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is my favorite game. I have been waiting for it to come to the kindle. I need four words.<br /><br />done.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|you cant get out of the game.I had to shut down my kindle every time I go on it.Even though it does that I still play it.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Just got a copy of the CD Little Broken Hearts.  I'm not generally a Norah Jones fan; found her other songs rather boring after repeated listenings on the radio and have never bought one of her CD's.  I didn't buy this CD either, because I borrowed it from a friend, but I have had it on repeat ever since.  The songs have a very dreamy/spacey quality to them and her voice suits the lyrics very well.  I don't know if she wrote any of the songs herself, but they sound like they are personal.  I might even go out and buy this so I can get the liner notes, it is that good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great fun. you and your children will enjoy this colorful fun game!! I love ice age! easy to make coins and reach your goals!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun love playing this game all the time. really enjoy how you can get tokens very easily in this game
B007MNV5WU|5.0|best angry bird game ever. It was new and really fresh. also the worlds were really epic and really cool.
B0000085N4|5.0|The Cult Rocks, and Ian Astbury can belt it out, a couple songs seem a bit flippy wristed but who cares.  From Sweet Soulsister to Firewoman almost every song on this album rocks except for Soilder Blue sees a bit rainbow oriented.  Rest of the album knocks the socks off of anything else and Ian's range is amazing.  Most of the guitar playing is awesome as well.  Buy the whole album, you wont be sorry you did.
0345803485|5.0|This series is excellent.  I imagine that most people buy it because they have heard of the sexual action.  The sexual aspects are very well done, but the charm of the book is the character development and the repartee between Christian and Ana.  It is exquisite.  The action plotline is also well done. I am disappointed that the story will apparently end here, but I look forward to future work from EL James.
0345803485|5.0|It's a love story that has you giggling out loud.  The sexual content didn't bother me  but some of you might not care for it.  Can't wait to purchase the next too...which by the way I recommend just buying all 3 at once, saves you quite a bit of money.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing and awesome. I have it on every device I own. everyone should get this awesome game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been searching for this game for a long time.  well lets say waiting for it to show up.  love this game!  and now that is on the kindle. YAY!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is addicting... It takes a while to get energy, but the game runs when it is minimized. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes to build city's :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I see my friends play it now I can finally play it :) Yay it is the best game in the world!!!!
0060853972|5.0|Well-written and hysterically funny, this rivals any Pratchett wrote on his own, and that is saying something. One wonders what it was like, seeing these guys working together... a great introduction to both writers for anyone who wants to see the lighter side of science fiction/fantasy. Very clever book, one of my favourites.
B0086700CM|5.0|THE WAIT IS OVER THIS GAME IS BOSS Y R U READING THIS COMMENT GET IT NOW SIDES IT IS FREE I HOPE THEY GIVE US JETPACK JOYRIDE NEXT THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a really good game but it should have more games and awards to get also less advertisments but yes it is a good game.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Had an older USB to serial adapter that was nothing but trouble. It would switch comm ports everytime I plugged it in and wouldn't work at all half the time. This one works great - EVERY TIME!! If you need a serial adapter this is the one to get and quite affordable too! I've used it on Windows XP and Windows 7. Great for programming older URC remote controls like the MX-850 using my USB-only laptop.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I agree with all of the negative reviews of this book. The writing is just awful. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but with all the hype I was hoping for a least a decent 'guilty pleasure'. I could not stomach this book. If I had to read the word \\"murmur\\" one more time I think I would have flung my Kindle across the room. The sex scenes were certainly graphic and the concept titillating enough but the characters were too one dimensional and over simplified. Even though the author tried to make Christian complicated and mysterious, I simply didn't buy it. And Ana's ability to orgasm so easily and frequently...Please.  I think I would rather read a great book and have my porn on the side. LOL.
1600242197|5.0|Highly recommended reading for anyone wanting to be a seal. This book was one I could not put down.<br />I read it in two days. Definitely will hold your interest and attention while reading Marcus' story.<br />Navdiver
B006UHZ7OQ|5.0|I had recommended this one to people when they saw me using it. It is easy, very well made and constructed...excellent quality from top to bottom and all the way around. I had worn it on the hottest day and it is not like a vest that flaps all over. Everything is in its place. It would have been nice if there is another spot to put my video camera too but it doesn't. It is either I get rid of my other DSLR and bring the camera in or I don't bring my video camera with me. You see I have two cameras, one for shooting on the ground and the other for air shots. And there are times I just want to use my video camera for my interviews. I remedied that by buying a Lowepro lens bag and attaching it to my strong belt. The configuration of the Lowepro lens bag at the back is the same system as the carrier vest. Overall it is an excellent product. I do not regret purchasing this one at all.
0062209493|4.0|Excellent reading; recommended reading for all. Story was interesting and an accurate story of war.<br />The author tempered his language so all could enjoy this book. Navdiver
B0086700CM|5.0|o my God finnaly they have it its like the best game in the universe hay yay woooooooooooo woooook woooooo woooooo
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not bring myself to put it down! Just one more chapter, then i'll finished the dishes, just one more chapter and i'll do some laundry.... Its a very addicting book!!
0060873027|3.0|In order to enjoy this book, you must have a HUGE capacity for suspension of disbelief. If you start the book realizing that, it is a silly but fun read and you'll enjoy it. I have always been an avid Crichton fan, so despite several bad reviews, I knew I would have to read it. I checked it out of the library, however, and I am glad I did that and glad I didn't pay for it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the hunger games books, havent watched the movie. The books were too good. I dont see how they will top my version in my head.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|I am not one of those libertarians who thinks he can prove free will by snapping his fingers or kicking a stone.  I do not think neurology is irrelevant, by any means.  But I do think that the argument has to be put into its proper philosophical context.  That is what I have tried to to in my extended essay [[ASIN:B00869S35Q Free Will: A Response to Sam Harris]]<br /><br />Sam Harris' little book on free will positions itself as a frank and commonsense defense of its subject, determinism.  It argues from philosophy, neurology and introspection.  Many people find Harris' presentation as simple as truth.  And yet, Harris is wrong, wrong from top to bottom.  The only thing he gets right is his atheism.<br /><br />In his philosophical arguments he relies on the an updated version of Cartesian dualism -- a position crafted by Descartes to bring the idea of the soul in line with science.  Dualism has confused every issue it has ever touched.<br /><br />In his neurological arguments, he overlooks several interpretations of the data which are just as plausible, if not more, than the ones he give them.<br /><br />In his introspective arguments, he only looks at one, rather impoverished, kind of choice, the kind least likely to involve free will, on anybody's account, and neglects the aspect of our thinking where free will actually resides.<br /><br />I urge you to have a look at my rebuttal, especially if you believed in free will and Harris weakened or destroyed that belief.  The stakes are far too important to let yourself be persuaded by Harris' argument, which is, as I show in my response, riddled with errors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app. I use it daily. One of my favorite apps. It is a great resource.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like that it allows u to use ur own pic for ur game. Its just a full out great game.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Many great hours will be had from this fantastic, challenging game. Note: their point and click that takes place in a house is not representative of this company's quality, that one sucks. This game, however, is fantastic!
B0086700CM|5.0|So glad that this is on the kindle fire it took awhile no I don't have to steal my cousins ipod to play:)!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for temple run to come out for forever!!! I play it all the time on my sisters ipods but I never could find it in the appstore!! I love this game!!
B0086700CM|3.0|I was really excited that temple run came out for the kindle fire! but it wont let me turn corners. I will try to but then it will just make me jump or slide on my back. this is very frustrating. fix this problem and I will fix my review.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|It takes a lot to scare me. As an actor in the horrorverse, my tolerance for scares is pretty high, but American Horror Story delivers shocks that scared the pants off me. From the moment the pilot begins AHS hits the ground running with excellence. The plot takes twists and turns that can keep you guessing for weeks. Never in my life have I enjoyed a show so much. The cast is superb. New comers Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters (Kick-Ass) hold their own against powerhouse actors like Jessica Lange, and Dylan McDermott. Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) in simply brilliant proving her previous work does not give her due credit like this show. The supporting cast is full of A-listers such as Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Star Trek), Mena Suvari (American Beauty), and Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under). Also, it being an anthology series, the first season has a beginning and a satisfying ending. Each season will take place in a different location with different characters. Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy the masterminds behind Nip/Tuck and Glee have created a mind bending drama worthy of rivaling J.J. Abrahms work. If you love scares, gore, horror, and above all a moving and inspiring drama series then American Horror Story is for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire n its finally here.....YAY liv it
B0086700CM|5.0|finally they put this on the appstore. Yea 8) gr8 love it finally. awesome app as i said i love this app on my tablet.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its great to have the word of God at my finger tips. This app makes the Bible easily accessible for me. This is the best Bible app out there. I have it on my phone, pad, and ipod.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I so much enjoy reading Kindle books on my devices. Thank you so much Amazon for making this possible. It helps me pass the time on my 1 hour bus trip in the morning and if I am not too tired my 1 hr and half bus trip in the evening. Please keep the wonderful books coming my way.
B0086700CM|5.0|when i saw that it was oit i looked at the pics to see becuz it say temple run but its not so i looked and i scremed as hard i could
B0059XTUB8|4.0|This was a delightful surprise.<br /><br />Michelle Williams gave a beautifully evocative performance as Marilyn Monroe supported by a great ensemble of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh and Dame Judi Dench as Sybil Thorndike. Eddie Redmayne did a beaut job as the besotted young man by Marilyn's damsel in distress performance. To be fair he wasn't the only person, male and female, to be besotted by Monroe's girlish innocence and sensual aloofness.<br /><br />The audience can only feel empathy towards Williams enchanting impression of Marilyn as she struggles with her insecurities of self-acceptance and desire to be loved. It is still amazing that the \\"most loved woman in the world\\" at the time found it so difficult to love herself.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommend whether or not you are a fan of Monroe.
B006R1T40I|5.0|If you buy only one cd this year, this is the one to choose because it just keeps getting better the more you listen to it. Song selection, slide solos, and perfect pitch give this tour de force its muscle. It is such an imoportant album I sent it to my ex-wife.
B005T87QCI|5.0|great ggame never saw the movie tell it was on Dvd and I loved it<br />I hope everyone else does as well
B0055SWM08|5.0|Every puzzle has a new learning curve. It holds my interest. It is my favorite game to play before going to sleep. Mentally stimulating but relaxing at the same time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Very interesting and kept my interest due to the autencity of the stories. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys war stories.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Stupid, we, the readers are, to buy this piece of crap and fill in the authors'and Random House's pockets.<br />I'm returning/deleting it from my library.<br />Shame on us as readers to promote similar kind of crap (giving money for it) where the literature of real quality sinks in oblivion.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I expected more than this!  In the age of computers there's not even a square or square root function. What's the Plus feature? Multiplication?
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I bought because of the DVD Audio and I was not disappointed. I've seen the show and the audio quality , arrangements, audio mixing makes one back to the show experience
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is on every device I own that can run it and I wish my fridge could run it too.  Best idea capturing app out there.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|Both my husband and I are WWII aficionados, though I'm more interested in the Holocaust while he, having served in the Air Force, is in love with the planes and air battles of the time.  He has made, I mean, allowed me to watch the original Tuskegee Airmen movie from 1995.<br /><br />This movie has everything you would expect from a film produced by George Lucas: incredible filmography, fantastic special effects, and a lot of fiction.  It does not have a great script or great acting.<br /><br />I really feel that Cuba Gooding, Jr. was the most underused actor in the film.  He seemed to be a caricature, more than a character.  He stood around, looking like an African-American MacArthur.  I was surprised that he didn't have the role that Terrence Howard did.  I think it would have worked better that way.<br /><br />Obviously, artistic license was taken with the film, but I am sorry for those who seem to think that this was a completely faithful retelling of the Tuskegee Airmen.  Not so much.  I'll let you look up those errors for yourself.<br /><br />It's okay, but I would recommend the 1995 movie over this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg Omg omg omg its on the kindle at last omg!!!!!!!:-)<br />best game ever omg I'm sui happy its here its a good game
B0086700CM|1.0|Finally it came to kindle.... now everyone can shut up about it. The game isn't even that great. With all the hype, I expected more.
B0086700CM|5.0|its finally here!!!!! this is the best ever I don't know what I would play on the kindle fire !
B005LAIHQS|4.0|After a 10 year hiatus, MIB returns with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as our heroes J and K.  Still keeping order with an assortment of space creatures inhabiting Earth, but one invader known as Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) is so evil he has been sequestered in a special prison on the Moon.  Put there 40 years earlier by K, he manages to escape thanks to a special cake brought to him by his \\"girlfriend,\\" a delicious Nicole Scherzinger.<br /><br />Once on the loose he discovers a way to go back in time to 1969 where K managed to stop Boris and his plan to destroy Earth with more of his species enroute.  J makes the leap back as well in order to kill Boris (\\"I'm no animal\\") before the future is changed.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld returns at the helm and manages to infuse the film with goodly amounts of humor (did you know all models are aliens?), CGI wizardry and a lump-in-your-throat ending.<br /><br />Bringing in Josh Brolin as young agent K is a brilliant addition.  His spot-on characterization of Jones's voice and mannerisms is remarkable.  There is a hint of romance between young K and young Agent O (Alice Eve) that never gets played out.  Too bad.  In the current time frame, O is now the boss, played by Emma Thompson who has a great speech as the film opens.  Certainly III is better than II, but isn't quite the equal of the first film which was so original.  Still MIB III is a thoroughly enjoyable way to start the summer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't beleive temple run is finally a android app.I am so excited that it is.Best game eva.I downloaded it the when it first came out.<br /><br />I luv it so much!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the best app ever!  Apple finally comes to Amazon! The game is so addicting!!!!!! My highscore is 168,780! The good thing that I like about it is that its easy but has challenge in it too!

1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children<br />Miss Peregrine Book One<br />By Ransom Riggs<br /><br />Jacob's grandfather has always told him stories of the orphanage where he had lived for a while and the peculiar children who reside there such as the levitating girl or the girl who could control fire even the boy who was completely invisible unless he wore clothes.  As Jacob grew older he began to dismiss his grandfather's tales as fairy tales that is until the night his grandfather died and he saw something that would begin his journey to find the orphanage and some answers.<br /><br />This book is the young adult version of a picture book, and the pictures that tie into the story are amazing and bring an altogether new depth into the reading experience. Ransom Riggs did an extraordinary job bringing to life a broad set of characters each one with their own remarkable gift. The story itself is captivating as Jacob comes to terms with what he has seen and learns that he is not a coward inside after all, nor is he going insane. This is a great book I think this would be a good book to use for a young adult who is having a hard time getting into reading as the visual aids would entice them to keep going. I can't wait to read the next book and find out more about the peculiar children.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this all the time at church. I highly recommend this for all Christians it it it it it it Avery cool
B0086700CM|5.0|if you are on tutoriul and you swipe twice really fast on a turn you will go straight forever without any obstacles
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game when I get bored! I just love it!(: It keeps me going. Although... there are some deals that I get that you play for a while and you cant do any moves. That is the only negative thing I have to say.
B005QUQP76|5.0|This is a solid mouse, construction and materials, above any other aspect of the mouse, are the two keys to keep in mind with the M60. It feels hard to brake and most of all, comfortable in the hand. The matte surface is really cool,but I will had like to see more weight customization. All in all, is a great device...
B0049VZ222|5.0|Well, as far as (science) fiction goes, I was always a vampire fan, but after watching The Walking Dead, I have opened up a new love for zombies too. Nothing will take Kate Beckinsale's character Selene killing lycans and other vampires, but zombie massacres are cool to watch too!
B004EPZ0AM|4.0|\\"Happy Feet\\" is one of my all-time favorite films for its beautiful animation, wonderful music, and powerful environmental message. There was nothing more that needed to be added to the tale of Mumble Happyfeet, the dancing penguin. So, you can imagine my dismay when I heard that there was a sequel in the works. I've ranted and debated about this sequel in various blogs all over the place, and I can safely say that I both like this film and have issues with it.<br /><br />Good Aspects of this Movie:<br />1. All your favorite characters are back, even if it's only for brief cameos.<br />2. The animation is even better than the first!<br />3. You will fall in love with the characters of Sven and Erik.<br />4. The musical numbers play with some new territory with a great original song and even opera.<br />5. Less environmental \\"preachyness,\\" as some of you called the first one.<br /><br />Bad Aspects of this Movie:<br />1. Too many pointless subplots that distract from the main story (the krill and Carmen are primary examples).<br />2. Soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first film's.<br />3. A waste of Sofia Vergara. She only has seven lines!<br /><br />Main point: If you've seen the first movie and really like it, check this sequel out. It's not as bad as a lot of people say it is here, but it's not as good as the first one. If you haven't seen the first film or just know it's not really your cup of tea, just stay away.<br /><br />Also, the bonus features even on the bluray are bad. There's virtually nothing interesting to do. This is the same qualm I had with the first film's features though, so go figure.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|One expects Meryl Streep to be fantastic, and she did win the Academy Award for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in \\"Iron Lady\\" so I certainly expected that her performance would be great. But \\"fantastic\\" and \\"great\\" only begin to describe this performance in which the actress almost at times disappears, leaving only Margaret Thatcher on the screen, and an aged and infirm Thatcher at that. Streep is so incredible, just a perfect performance in a very interesting and enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Thumbs up to the makeup artists as well, whose work here is invisible. If you had never seen Meryl Streep before, you'd assume she looks just as she does in this movie.<br /><br />The cast all around is terrific, the script is tight and interesting. The drama is leavened at times with humor and spirit, at times piercing in its sadness, but always, always interesting.<br /><br />Recommendation: Absolutely, two thumbs way up.
B0086700CM|5.0|my friend got me into it with her oops thank God she did I love ittttt!download it please the best!!!!!!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|If you liked Pillars of the Earth you will like this book.  It's long but the more I read the more I didn't want it to end.  Well done and I highly recommend it.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|It's okay.  It took some deducing on my part to figure out how to play and I don't remove stars for that (a LOT of games have left it to the player to figure out game play).  I did remove a star for its failure to keep my interest.  Yawn!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is a great game if is so time consuming the games are fun some of them seem imposibal but you try try try and when u get it you are sk exuded. I would really regimens this competitive game<br />.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV The Voyage Home was released in 1986 just a few months after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, and there is a message at the start dedicating this film to them. I didn't see this in theaters but when it first came out on video so I don't have a story of seeing it in theaters, but of all the Trek movies I have seen-this is one of the best. Every crew member (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov) all play a big role in this movie. While the Probe is a ridiculous idea, and the whale story makes you scratch your head, the humor (Spock headlines this one) is fun, and makes you forget the plot holes. We also see how a future product may be invented, and at the end we see the Enterprise for about a minute in this film, as they are stuck in the Bird of Prey they hijacked at the end of Star Trek III. The 2 disc collectors edition has the feature in the 1st disc, as well as commentary from Misters Nimoy and Shatner. I recommend the text commentary as you learn other facets and tidbits as well. The 2nd disc has special features, Kirk's Women being the best IMO. A great movie, and I have to note that even people who don't like Star Trek really liked this film. If you want to bring people into Star Trek, this is a great film to do so.
B0086700CM|5.0|happy its finally able ti download best fame ever download it don't read bad responded oh yeah temple run yay yay
B007PTJOV0|2.0|love this game its so addictive<br /><br /> this game is so addictive. ive been playing it for hours and it doesn't get bring
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very addictive fun and fast paced game. I must confess that I had side loaded this game several months ago when it was available on Google play and I loved it.<br /><br />The game play is superb and has very good fast graphics on Kindle fire and hours of fun & excitement. Once you start playing this game I can assure you that you will never put it down - Beautifully done!<br /><br />While I was very happy to see that it was finally released for Amazon App store. Understandably I could not replace my existing Google play application or update it. I do not want to start all over again (I have scores in the millions with various characters unlocked with hours of play) so I prevented from the APP store replacing my game and kept the old version which I got free from Google play.<br /><br />This game has the best rating of any Android game ever. Glad it is officially available via Amazon APP store.<br />Thanks to the developer for making a fantastic free game.<br /><br />Download it now. It is superb game!<br /><br />Cheers!
B00006V9A0|5.0|I hear many people degrading all the Nirvana material released since Cobain's death by often labeling it money in Courtney's pocket. Ignore that nonsense, because the truth is everyone dislikes this woman because of what they've read or heard. I like Courtney and I think she is a talented artist, but that's another different story. For a band that only released three official albums this is a good greatest hits album. I read another review where a reviewer called this a cheesy greatest hits album and another criticized the lack of material. I mean, for crying out aloud just about all the real hits are here \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Sliver\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"About A Girl\\", my personal favorites \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", and of course the song that made Nirvana a household name \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". Other popular songs such as, \\"Dumb\\", \\"All Apologies\\", and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\". While a few could have made the cut like \\"Breed\\", \\"Dive, \\"Love Buzz\\" and \\"Drain You\\", but those songs just like many others are mostly considered hits when performed live. However, they still great songs that should have been included. The big story behind this album is the new gem \\"You Know You're Right\\", the final song recorded by the band before Kurt's inevitable demise. Released 8 years after its original date due to ongoing legal battles between Courtney and the remaining members Krist & Dave. To this day, there is still bad blood between them, but at least the song was released. The song is great and the other songs on the album speak for themselves. I recommend this to any Nirvana fan even if you already own all the albums as well as to anyone new to the band. Contains the awesome new song and the songs that made the band a success.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|The movie was good but if I adhere to full disclosure my opinion is influenced by the fact that I used credit card points  to rent it. I always say that not paying to see a movie will greatly change how the movie itself is viewed. That being said the acting was above my expectations with some B movie madness here and there. The set pieces were amazing, when the kids fly through the sky it looks really great in HD, especially the storm scene and the finale. The ending was predictable but none the less satisfying, I appreciated that it didn't set it up for an obvious sequel. Would I recommend this movie? Yes if you can rent it cheaply, otherwise I would wait until it is on Prime.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|[[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ The Hunger Games Trilogy]]<br />The first book was great and well worth reading, But by the scond and third it got tedious, The characters became less believable the longer it went. It became more difficult to stay with the characters that were so brilliant in the first book and watch them become confused and manipulated in the follow on books. Since I am at the other end of the age spectrum from teenagers (82) my review maybe different for all my years of experience.

0062124293|4.0|It might be fun to have a conversation with Caitlin Moran.  After all, she thinks about things.  She has some reasonable things to say.  She likes fun and has a bit of a wacky streak not unlike the one Louise Rennison's fictional character, Georgia Nicolson, possesses.  Do I have all the same stances she has?  Certainly not.  For instance, I'm not in the \\"expensive purses are a waste of money\\" camp--I'm in the \\"ALL purses are a waste of money--buy a messenger bag instead and have room for an iPad, two multitools, a couple feminine hygiene products, a case for sunglasses, etc.\\" camp.  And Moran seems to think using cloth diapers is impossible; having used them at least 75% of the time before my son was toilet trained, I tend to disagree.<br />But then, that's part of Moran's point:  that feminism means equal rights for all, including the right to one's opinion.<br />The thing I found the most disturbing of the book was not Moran's quick decision to have an abortion--although she did breeze past the decision a little more lightly than I was comfortable with, I absolutely agree with her point that bringing an unwanted child into a family is a bad idea.  It was not her apparent fixation on cardigans, the harrowing tales of the relative poverty of her childhood, or the implication that all one has to do is exercise and go to classes during pregnancy to make childbirth go smoothly.  The thing I found most disturbing was that, in nearly every anecdote about Moran after the age of 16, there seemed to be quite a bit of alcohol involved.  When I reached the chapter called \\"Intervention,\\" I was relieved.  Surely this chapter involved someone who cared about Moran pointing out to her that maybe she could be an interesting person having a good time without consuming an entire bottle of champagne in one evening?  Nope, it was about plastic surgery and women's fear of aging.  With all the talk in the book about how a parent is incessantly busy and constantly needing to do productive things, one would think there wasn't time for getting drunk enough to dance around trees naked in broad daylight, then being hung over the next day.<br />Still, How to Be a Woman is fun to read and makes some good points.  It gives the reader things to think about.ve things, one would think there wasn't time for getting drunk enough to dance around trees naked in broad daylight, then being hung over the next day.<br />Still, How to Be a Woman is fun to read and makes some good points.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is an awesome game. its a time waster and I always play this before I sleep or when I'm bored its definitely worth buying :D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought the book hearing about it from a friend.  My curiosity was piqued.  I could not put the book down once I got started.  It became an obession.  I was sneaking around reading, getting in a few pages here and there, in between work and daily life.  The more I read, the more I wanted to read about this explosive couple.  I fell in love with Christain upon meeting him.  Without hesitation I purchased the next two books in the series becasue I could not get enough.  It is a must read and definaltey a page turner.  I'm having an affair with a book!  A good book.  And am very sad that the affair is over...I hope E.L James gets back to work soon!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been checking the app store everyday for two months to see if they got this app. It's even better than it was on ipod.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a very fun game. I have it on my Ipod and loved it, which is why I was so happy that it finally came out on the Kindle Fire. But it is very laggy on the Kindle which causes me to die most of the time. If it wasn't for the lag it would get 5 stars. PLEASE FIX!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|this movie was good i loved the original series i thought i would see the apes do more but it was good
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is one of my all time FAVORITE games and it's rrrreeeeeaaaaaaalllllllllllyyyyy addicting. I am really glad that they now have it on the amazon appstore! But, on the kindle fire it is very slow and lags every now and then making you run into the obstacle you were going to avoid.... But other than that it's a very fun game! :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the 2nd time I have bought this game and I love it. Great game&hellip;very addictive!  I recommend it very highly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it!!!  Fast and easy.very smooth deals! I've been playing other games, but always come back to this version of spider!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|An absolutely fantastic series and a beautifully packaged DVD Boxed Set. Difficult to not want to watch the entire series in one go, it is so compelling. As usual, outstanding delivery service from Amazon to an international location
B006OFN0SE|2.0|Not understanding the 4 or 5 star reviews AT ALL. This was a man whose development (and that of the FBI) over time needed to be anchored in the many different faces of America that he lived through. The best way to do that would have been chronologically. The best part of the movie was a decent stretch of continuity. But the jumping back and forth gimmick got real old, real fast and took away from the movie.<br /> As with his portrayal of Howard Hughes, Dicaprio continues to impress with his performances. All the actors were good, except the Burn Notice guy. This is a movie that would definitely benefit from a more linear edit.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|It's good so far to find the book almost just like the HBO series<br />And to get a little more back ground on the series
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The question comes up......what would you do? This book was read upon Book club recommendation. Great choice!  Some technical difficulties; not crazy about the character of the father.  The Mother's ultimate sacrifice MAKES the book.  Read This!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is so fun I love it!!!! This game is so fun. the family's are so cool and have good graphics.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|we are having a lot of fun playing this together.  a lot like farmville. I really don't have any complaints other than I wish you could save your progress with a password.
0345803485|3.0|I finally caved and bought this book (as well as books 2 & 3).  I can't say I totally understand the fuss.  Book one was just OK, not much plot per se but moderately interesting.  The ending was the best part and reason why I bought book 2.  Book two at least had some plot to it.  I'm currently 1/2 through book three and at this point...enough with the sex already!  I've actually started skipping over the \\"juicy\\" stuff.  Seriously, how many times can you repeat the same sex scene?!  I'm a 34 yo woman and by no means a prude but geez, come on already.  Do we really need to read about them having sex 5 times a day, every day?!<br /><br />I would agree with other reviews that comment on the repetitive nature of this series.  I'd like less repetition, more plot.  I rated it a 3 but I'd give it a 2.5 stars if I could - just ok, not overwhelmingly great.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|i just use thunderstorm two. thats it. alot of useless sounds like frogs and what not but for free the thunderstorm sound makes it more than the price of free heheheh. seriously though def worthy of download (free version anyway)

B004V45YBG|5.0|Julian Barnes explores Rouen, France, the home of the great writer Gustav Flaubert.  Barnes, physician and writer, as was Flaubert, follows the events of Flaubert's life through hospitals, remains of statues, and museums.  He discovers a back-story to one of the most famous of Flaubert's stories, &#34;Un Coeur Simple.&#34;  In this story Felicite, a poor servant who outlives everyone she knows, is left with only a parrot, Loulou, who becomes more and more important in her life.  When Loulou dies, Felicite has it stuffed and continues her conversations with the bird until it too dies. When Felicite passes on, it is with Loulou at her breast.  Barnes is told that while Flaubert was writing the story, he borrowed a stuffed parrot from the Museum of Rouen to sit on his desk as he composed. Barnes suggests that there are parallels between this story and the life of Flaubert.
B0074Y2YZ4|2.0|I LOVE roxette, but this album is pretty dull. \\"08 Excuse Me Sir, Do You Want Me to Check on Your Wife?\\" has got to be one of the lamest songs I've ever heard. I sure hope they sing their oldies but goodies while on tour because this album is unfortunately quite forgetable.
B007SGM084|5.0|The best read EVER!, cannot get enough of it! I am on my second time around!, and will probably keep re reading it!
0345803493|5.0|After reading the first book I could not wait to read this one. It did not disapppoint me. I could not put it down. I will be reading these books over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who tends to like the same SF that I do. I recommend it, too.  It's \\"hard science\\" fiction, but bordering on steam punk in some ways.  The unusual last survivor premise is well done.  The book starts kind of slow, but by the time I was about 1/3 of the way into it I didn't want to put it down.  The ending was a bit of a surprise, and not quite as well developed as the rest of the book.  I will want to read other things that Hugh writes.
0345803485|5.0|I heard about these books on 20/20 and it peaked my interest. I ordered them the next day. It is one of those books you don't want to put down. I am very pleaed I ordered them. I am just starting the third book and looking forward to some good reading.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day. But it would be worthbpaying five dollars for. It's really fun. I love puzzle games. If you are a fan of sudoku you'll love this. I think it's even better.

0861714911|5.0|A truly  amazing book on so many levels! The historical perspective is impeccable, crafted by a brilliant scholar. I gained a profound insight into the times of the Buddha from the social structure of the day ( caste system) to the different spiritual and religious views and their origins.  Bhikkhu Bodhi's ability to understand the complete Pali Canon and then compose this kind of crystal clear distillation of Therevada Buddhism is genius. Also, there is a complete mp3 lecture series on the book by Bohdhi online free of charge. Ultimately, this inspired work offers the reader a skillful and expedient  path to better life here today and tomorrow. My work, relationships and meditation have  benefited greatly from reading this book. Thank you Bhikku Bodhi!

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|If you still haven't purchased Adam Lambert's new album, Trespassing, don't wait another minute! The music on this album is like climbing aboard an emotional roller coaster. It's the perfect blend of light & dark, happy & sad. There are songs to make you laugh and dance - others to make you search your soul & cry. Of course blending the highs & lows and bringing all the songs together into one cohesive whole is the incredible talent of Adam Lambert and I'm happy to say his amazing vocals are front & center of every track.  He pours his heart and soul into every song from the pure pop joy of Naked Love to the emotional depths of his darker half in Underneath. This album IS Adam Lambert. So climb aboard for the ride and fasten your seat belt. Let Adam take you Trespassing. You'll love every second!!

B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book is a very simple and straightforward approach to enhancing your ability to communicate effectively. The author navigates through the following ten key concepts in order for you to communicate effectively and build rapport with others. The techniques are:<br /><br />1: Establish Artificial Time Constraints<br />2: Accommodating Nonverbals<br />3: Slow down your rate of speech<br />4: Sympathize/Assist when needed<br />5: Suspend your ego<br />6: Validate others<br />7: Ask the right questions<br />8: Conversing with introverts/art of continuing the conversation<br />9: Giving the right gifts<br />10: Manage your expectations<br /><br />The above should be of no surprise to the reader as they work their way through this book but the practical insights and real life examples the author gives really nails down how valid and helpful his points are. For anyone who would like to further their skills in communication, I would highly recommend this book.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|This movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time regarding a real life figure. Margaret Thatcher was captured so brilliantly you hardly realize you're really watching Streep. The story line, which is the part most criticized, was just as good in my opinion. I think politics drove most of Hollywood to criticize it b/c they were upset they made a movie about a conservative that at least attempted to be accurate instead of a hit job on lady Thatcher. I do wish they had gone into her record more, but it was still a great movie and well done. If the same movie had been made but about a female liberal this movie would be praised w/ no end.<br />A friend of mine who didn't know anything about her and hates politics even said he enjoyed it.<br />TWO THUMBS UP!
0345803485|2.0|I was taken in by all the news hype of this book.  It was horribly written with tons of repetitive phrases.  I've read better Harlequin romance books.  The characters were totally unbelievable.  It did not leave me wanting yo read more and I will not be buying book 2 and 3.
B0086700CM|5.0|Download this app. It is the best app on the Kindle Fire!!! It is addicting and fun!!! The best part is is that I have been waiting for this app ever since I got the Kindle Fire!!! Amazing!!! Download this app please!!! 8)

B003WMX3SY|4.0|Initially I salivated over this case, the PROS: (1) obvious air flow, (2) modular design, and (3) general aesthetics left me extremely impressed and wondering why other companies hadn't incorporated more of Antec's winning design.  I remain positive about the case; however, I could not use the case for it's original purpose for the reason's highlighted below; however, i was able to find a h20 cooling option (or I would have returned the case).  I'll explain the reasons below that render the case a poor fit for some builds (mostly beginner to advanced h2o).<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) Almost entirely *plastic* construction<br />  - case wants to slide on most surfaces (must add sticky feet)<br />  - somewhat limited options for mounting radiators/fans for liquid cooling (2 bay pre-built the only real option IMHO)  [[ASIN:B005LJWB9I Thermaltake BigWater 760 Plus CPU Cooler - CLW0211]]<br />  -> Only 3 5.25\\" bays, which will be fully utilized by dual bay liquid + standard optical drive.<br />  - somewhat lacking in durability, definitely lacking in protection from nearby physical play (kids, etc) and drink spills/spray (apparently a concern for some folks)<br />(2) Limited (or no) options for liquid cooling<br />  - especially true for pre-built options like corsair H##'s)...DO NOT plan to use these (Not enough room above most MOBO's for internal placement, (partial) external just NOT possible.<br />  - completely adhoc/custom liquid cooling can be made to work (120 or 240 rad on top with tube entry via add-on card slot..so thin tubes.<br /><br />In the end, the case remains an attractive and reasonably priced option, and I'd certainly consider for a semi-mobile case...perhaps for a college student.  The plastic makes it somewhat mobile.<br /><br />Hope this helps, the reviews were noticeably lacking in the drawbacks of the case.  The positives you can read in depth from the other many reviews.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is about time this game came to kindle. one of my favorite games on the iphone now on my favorite device
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely love the 50 shades trilogy!! I immediately started the second book after finishing the first and same goes for the third. You will feel happy sad and a bit dirty all at the same time :). You won't be disappointed with this read! Highly recommended!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Once again, Joe creates a great CD.  Bought this on a pre-order basis and I have not been let down. After listening to it only three times, I am truly in love with it.  I grew up listening to the music of the 60's and 70's, and this CD brings me back to that time when music was great.  In a time where the Beibers and Gagas of the world clutter the airwaves, this is a truly refreshing collection of music.  Thank you Joe!
0345803485|1.0|I think I can say with almost unflinching certainty that about 80% of the women at my current workplace are beyond infatuated with this series. One started the whole chain of events by introducing the rest of them to it: talking it up, speaking at length about how great each books is.<br /><br />So, being the curious avid reader I asked a co-worker to borrow the first novel in the series. I'd made plenty of snide comments before actually sitting down with the novel to give it a go. Well, I gave it a go on my lunch break and the confusion that I must have caused among my co-workers after erupting in laughter at nearly every page of the book must have really been something else.<br /><br />The trend of which I speak in the title of my review is this: the same young gal at work who LOVES this series is also crazy about Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games, not to mention a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks. There appears to be two camps of people in regards to those who, beyond my understanding, are crazy for this series:<br /><br />- Young women who have no clue about the real world, real relationships; who spent their teenage years at pep rallies and fundraising bake sales.<br />- Women in their 40s - late 50s who've completely lost all lust for their own existence. \\"Oh no, Grey's Anatomy isn't on tonight, what will I do? Engage in a discussion with my fat disinterested husband? How about trying to peel my teenagers away from their phones or video games? Nah, I'm just going to read this so I can escape my hell on earth life.\\"<br /><br />All the negative reviews have covered all the horrible aspects of this cash-in series (because that's really all it is.); I think I shall embark on a personal quest to be sure to take a minute to recommend The 120 Days of Sodom and Story of the Eye to every female I see reading one of these books.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have to say that I have rarely heard an album that I don't have to skip a few tracks. Not this one. As soon as I listened to it I had to tell everyone b/c I couldn't stop! Even some of my friends that did not care for Adam much became fans of his music. I think any of these songs could be a #1 single. My favorite is \\"outlaws of love\\" where he opens up about the challanges he faces as a gay man and society's views. Way to go Adam! It is a very real and moving song. I love when an artist can do that! All and all run out to buy it, it is worth the money!
0345803485|1.0|I agree with many other readers of this book.  Utterly immature, unreal and downright annoying.  I felt like I was reading a teenage porno book and it felt kind of creepy.  I wish I'd never heard of this book.  Complete waste of my time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm soooooo happy this app is finally here I love it!!!!!! the only thing that disappoints is that the characters cost sosooosossoso much!! but I still luv temple run

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Tried to read it since I paid for it but had to stop after a few chapters. Aweful. Characters are so typical and yet so unbelievable. Its Bella and Edward recycled. A clumsy virgin that wants to go straight into S&M with a rich guy who has it all.

0006486118|5.0|This is a great series but this last book is a little slow. Right now I am half way through this book, although I love the way George Martin writes but the story-line seems to get a little lost and some of the characters forgotten.<br />  All in all I love the series but this is the weakest of the books in comparison.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited so so so long for this to come to amazon. i can finally play on my fire
B00005YJMX|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Slow, but fascinating, \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre,\\" is basically an expanded remake of the German expressionist art film, \\"Nosferatu,\\" 1922.<br /><br />\\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" recreates the original faithfully, while filling in the intentionally left blank spaces of the original to keep Bram Stoker's widow from suing for copyright infringement of the book, which she did sue, & won. For years the original film was thought lost.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, & with breath taking scenery & grim locations all in one, \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" makes for an ethereal cinematic experience. Of huge note is the make up for Klause Kinski as \\"Count Orlock,\\" or I should say \\"Count Dracula,\\" as he is named in this English version. It is if Max Shreck has been reincarnated! Resurrected from the grave to once again perform his classic role! The resemblance is uncanny!<br /><br />\\"Nosferatu the Vampyre,\\" achieves the same eerie expressionism of it's predecessor, but in color & sound, due to director Werner Herzog's great eye for detail & the atmospheric spirit of the original, which is a major feat in it's self!<br /><br />If your looking for the typical Dracula film, then look somewhere else, as this is a tribute to an era long gone, but still essential for the horror film enthusiasts of today.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so happi when this game finally came out yay. this is a mighty fun game it is very fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|AMAZING! I have fallen in love with this book! Can't wait to read it over again :) Even though this book can be embarrassing at times, it is one of the best books ever and I am so glad my friend recommended it. :):):)

0307346617|4.0|The Good: Interview style stories are a fun format to read, stories from all different walks of life, zombies taken in a very realistic approach<br /><br />The Bad: Some dull stories, jumps around too much, no hard conclusion, a bit disorienting to read<br /><br />World War Z is a book of short interviews with survivors of the zombie war. The book is depicted as if it actually happened, and this is a nice change for zombie stories. The book is broken down into different major events of the war. The book starts with warnings and signs of a zombie infection. After this you get to hear about how people of all walks of life survived the war under various conditions. This ranges from business men, teenagers, astronauts stranded in space, soldiers, generals, doctors, moms, families, and every other type of person you can think of. They are from all over the world, and each story is completely different from the last.<br /><br />Of course there are a few duds that are full of dry politics, or the characters ramble on about one subject and never switch topics. Some of my favorite parts were when the author argues or offends someone during an interview because it makes it seem more real. Some interviews are short while others just drag on too long. These uninteresting stories don't come up too often, and these usually don't talk much about an event or tell a specific story. They just talk about politics surrounding the event or philosophize about it.<br /><br />The zombies themselves are depicted as an unstoppable force that we can't stop. Max Brooks chose to make you fear these things because of just sheer numbers over looks, what they can do to you, and it all started. Battles are fought over millions of zombies coming at you, and this can create a fairly scary image. Towards the end of the book you start to see how conventional warfare just doesn't work on these things. Knowing that our army and high-tech equipment is ineffective against the undead is just astounding. This was probably the scariest thing of all. We rely on our military to protect us so much that when a problem comes up they can't fix you know everyone is screwed.<br /><br />While all this is really interesting the book doesn't exactly have a hard conclusion or overall story. The book feels very lose and almost random because the interviewer jumps around all over the world, and each person's story takes place in different times and locations so you feel disoriented when reading. Despite all this, this is a wonderful zombie book that even takes storytelling to a different level. Just be patient and stick with the book and you will enjoy it.s was probably the scariest thing of all. We rely on our military to protect us so much that when a problem comes up they can't fix you know everyone is screwed.<br /><br />While all this is really interesting the book doesn't exactly have a hard conclusion or overall story. The book feels very lose and almost random because the interviewer jumps around all over the world, and each person's story takes place in different times and locations so you feel disoriented when reading. Despite all this, this is a wonderful zombie book that even takes storytelling to a different level. Just be patient and stick with the book and you will enjoy it.

B007UZO3F6|4.0|This is not my first shuttle build, and while I like the combination of features, the compact form factor, and the fit and finish of everything in one...I think Shuttle has missed the mark just a bit with the R5 chassis.  99% of the design is great...but seriously...the door and button for the ODD is very third rate.  If it were possible to remove the fold down door and just have the ODD there, I wouldn't have deducted a star, as it is, I am stuck with something that I believe a third grader could have done better with.<br /><br />The ODD screw-up behind me, the rest of the build quality is great.  As far as included accessories...I would have preferred that they included right angle SATA cables as opposed to the straight connectors that are included.  The only other issue is the USB 3.0 internal connector/header is directly under the drive cage.  The header on the MB doesn't have a socket, only bare pins, so the cable flexes and I'm worried the strain of the cable might bend the pins on the MB.<br /><br />On another thought, it's nice to have the Mini PCI-E and M-SATA sockets, but it would be nice if Shuttle offered a solution for adding WI-FI antennas.  They left knockouts in the back of the case for antenna jacks (three of them)...but they don't offer a kit to wire it.  According to my measurements, you would need about 12\\" to 14\\" of internal cabling so as not to interfere with components and leave just enough slack on the cables (especially if you intend to use a dedicated graphics card).  Problem is, try finding headers in that length (most I find on here are 3\\" to 9\\" long).<br /><br />I know, the wireless headers are nothing for a seasoned builder (someone who likes to mod cases), however people who buy a Shuttle Bare-bone aren't usually looking to do much modding - and even then, they prefer to have a kit designed specifically for the Shuttle (usually by Shuttle).<br /><br />All of that aside, mine started up fine with a CMOS error (no biggie...every first power up has to enter the BIOS first), however, it can be a bit confusing...the options tell you to hit F2 or DEL to enter setup or hit F1 to continue....on mine hitting F2 or DEL had no effect...you have to hit F1 first, THEN hit F2 or DEL...I'm sure it states this somewhere in the manual, but getting a builder to read the manual before the first power on is like getting a guy to stop and ask for directions.<br /><br />Windows 7 SP1 loaded fine, and with the exception of the sound card, almost all of the drivers had to be loaded from the included driver disk (not even the LAN worked with the standard Windows included drivers).  I would recommend getting the latest drivers from Shuttle, since the driver disk has some out-dated versions.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good little system, great for day to day uses, but I would strongly caution someone that uses the ODD on a regular (daily) basis - really, the door mechanism is that bad.  Shuttle, if you're listening, Fix this for future designs, or at least give us the option to remove the door and just have the bare drive.

0486278077|3.0|When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.<br /><br />It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays.  This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).<br /><br />You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert has done it again! Another fun and entertaining album from start to finish. I'll admit when I first played this album I thought \\"Trespassing\\" was lacking energy and emotion. But with repeated listenings, I began to enjoy and immerse myself in the crazy, eccentric world of Glambert! First off, Adam's voice is still out-of-this-world! And I like that he co-wrote 12 out of the 15 tracks and I would definitely buy the deluxe edition, the 3 bonus tracks are amazing!! The first half of \\"Trespassing\\" is funky and carefree and the second half is more introspective. My favorite tracks include: \\"Underneath\\", \\"Outlaws of Love\\", \\"Kickin' In\\" (love the beat), \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\", \\"Nirvana\\" (gives me chills), \\"Broken English\\", \\"Runnin'\\" (the best song), and the title-track. You can tell Adam had a lot of fun making this album. This is the perfect summer record and it helps that Adam looks hot on the cover! Buy it today people!

B00701897I|5.0|The 3-D Adventures of Tintin video is the most realistic animation I have ever seen.  It's true the characters are drawn in typical cartoon fashion and many of the scenes could not exist in real life but the details throughout the video are fantastic. In close-up scenes, every hair of the character can be seen and every hair has its own color and highlights.  This is far beyond anything Walt Disney (the cartoonist,not the company) ever dreamed possible.<br /><br />With realistic videos like this today, it won't be long before new movies are made starring Humphrey Bogart or Elvis.

B002KQOCJ2|5.0|The Seattle quartet Alice In Chains made their debut in 1990 with the album \\"Facelift\\". Their album wouldn't become successful until they released thier signature song \\"Man In The Box\\". Two years later, they followed it up with their sophomore effort- their most succesful recording to date \\"Dirt\\". Though the album put them in the spotlight in the grunge era, the album had a rather dark undertone. Most of the album's songs were about lead singer Layne Staley's ever present drug addiction- something that he had severe trouble shaking. By the time they released their third album- the self titled \\"Alice In Chains\\"- the band went on hiatus- mostly due to getting Staley to deal with his personal issues. As the new millenium rolled around, Staley was found dead from a drug overdose in 2002 and co-founder/guitarist Jerry Cantrell insisted Alice In Chains was no more. However, over the next few years he had a change of heart and decided to reform the band with a new lead singer. They settled on Atlanta based William DuVall as the new lead vocalist and went in to record their next album.<br /><br />In September 2009 the band released their first new album in almost fifteen years, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\". It was their first release on their new label Virgin Records, and the first album with their new producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Stone Sour, The Exies). On this new album, it sounds as if they haven't lost a step despite being away for a long period of time. They start the album off with the ballad \\"All Secrets Known\\", a song about wanting to living a happier life. Leading into it is the hit single about loving the West Coast \\"Check My Brain\\". Much like the aforementioned \\"Check My Brain\\", William and Jerry trade vocals on the seven minute rocker \\"A Looking In View\\". On the title track \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\", they get help from Elton John on piano as well as former member of Prince's band The Revolution Lisa Coleman on Vibraphone. While Jerry sings lead on most of the album, William DuVall gets the lead on the song \\"Last Of My Kind\\". Overall, Alice In Chains' \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is a great album from the legenadry Seattle band. Despite the setbacks they have faced over the years, they show that they have still got it.of the album, William DuVall gets the lead on the song \\"Last Of My Kind\\".

A virgin has an orgasm by nipple manipulation and intercourse during penetration the very first time at that very young age?  Hardly!  I put it down after that.  I expected more from a book recommended on Dr. Oz.
0345803493|1.0|Although I didn't like the first book, I could understand the draw of the Twilight influence on this novel. I could also understand how some women could immerse themselves into fantasy or wish fulfillment. At the end when Ana, left him, I applauded her.  Everyone's sex life is their own business, but when it includes pain, it no longer is titillating, it is degrading.  But in the sequel Christian has to curb his desire for pain, much like Edward curbed his \\"thirst\\" for Bella. Really? Is that the same?  We don't have vampires, but S&M does persist in our society.  We do have people who have been abused as children and go on to abuse others. This presents a different reality in reading these two books. Vampires aren't real....abuse, no matter the guise, IS. And the  fallout and consequences of that abuse is real. So because Christian comes from a depraved background, Ana must submit to him because she feels bad?  I know the premise of this book is true love and the extent a person will go to to obtain it , and I know the sex is meant to spice it up. I am worried that it is becoming a cultural phenomena and being made into a movie. I am worried that teenage girls will automatically be very intrigued by this series because of its popularity. For these girls who are so impressionable, I worry about the messages conveyed.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book piqued my interest from the beginning. I was disturbed and involved all at once.  I didn't want to put it down.  I don't think this book is for everyone, but I couldn't wait to start book  #2!
B0084V702S|5.0|I listened to this book after checking it out of my library.  New mobile technology is great.  I didn't have to go to the library either to request the audio book or to pick it up. As with all audio books you have to remain focused on listening or you can quickly lose the train of thought.  The audio book has two draw backs.  First,  Krugman likes to start his chapter's with a quote, many times a quote illustrating his point by contrast.  In a book this is easy to pick up.  In an audio book you don't know that what you are hearing is not what Krugman thinks until you hear who the quote if from.  This makes following the thread of dialogue  difficult.  Second, there are charts that are supplied with the audio CD that can be downloaded to your PC.  This didn't work for me because I got the audio book downloaded from a website that didn't provide the charts.  Some of the charts can be found on the Look Inside sample on Amazon.  Others can be found by reading Krugman's blog.  It would have been nice to just put the charts up on a separate site.  I know Audible.com doesn't have this problem. You can download the charts at that site.<br /><br />The book itself is a cogent argument in support of Keynesian economics. I am not an economist so my understanding of the economics is as an amateur.  But I know enough about business to know that the argument that business will spend money on creating jobs because they have money laying around is spurious. Business will create jobs when the demand for its services/goods justifies hiring.  Cutting spending will reduce demand which will cause businesses to cut jobs.  There are numerous real-world examples of this.  Take Great Britain's current double dip recession or any of the conservative states who have cut government spending only to see their private sector job creation fall.  Paul Krugman presents enough evidence to persuade me that the fresh-water economists are irrational in their arguments.  The problem is a true believer isalways more persuasive than someone who has to base their arguments on the facts.<br /><br />But I knew all that before reading this book.  What this book supplies is in chapter 13 End This Depression!  What did I get out of this chapter?  There is an election in November.  This book present a progressive solution to the problem.  The problem is the lack of jobs.  In 2010 the Republicans ran on job creation.  From what I see they have done everything possible to stop job creation.  This book is a call for progressives to push for job creation.  Center Democrats in 2008 didn't do it.  Right wing Republicans in 2010 didn't do it.  Now it is our turn! OCCUPY CONGRESS!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|There're a LOT of good erotic literature writers out there: A.N. Roquelaure, Anais Nin, Henry Miller, Mario Vargas Llosa, John Cleland; the list goes on. E.L. James doesn't belong on this list.<br /><br />To start with, the characters are completely unbelievable. Ms. James takes quite a bit of time setting Grey up as a cold, uncompromising, controlling man with no desire for emotional connection. And then proceeds to repeatedly contradict everything that's supposed to make him Grey: He doesn't sleep with women, but sleeps with Ana; he's dumped Subs in the past for wanting \\"more\\", but constantly strives to give Ana the \\"flowers and hearts\\"; he punishes Subs for any modicum of disobedience, but seems to like defiance from Ana and withholds punishment because. . . well just because, as far as I can tell. And the biggest character transgression of all: Grey's been completely unwilling to so much as touch a woman without a signed contract, but doesn't even put up the token insistence with Ana.<br /><br />Then there's Anastasia- Ms. James sets her up to be bright, intelligent, oblivious to her own beauty, and more innocent than the modern fifth grader. And then proceeds to portray her as a vacuous nitwit with no decision-making skills whatsoever. Also, a natural at oral pleasure, despite the fact that she didn't know what 'oral' was five minutes before giving Grey the best he's ever had.<br /><br />Kate: intelligent, tenacious, observant to the nth degree; yet somehow easily distracted and thrown off by evasion my 10 year old nephew would've seen straight through.<br /><br />Worse, the character inconsistencies are not rescued by the writing style. The writing itself is, for lack of a better word, juvenile. Ana's constant exclamations of Jeez!, Crap!, Holy crap!, Holy cow!, and (when the situation is *truly* dire) Holy s* *t! are rivaled in their complete ability to jerk you right out of the story only by the constant gasping and sharp-intakes-of-breath. I mean, come on! Grey is supposed to be super-experienced at all things sexual and a master of self-containment, yet he's constantly gasping like an asthmatic in a cottonwood grove in shock/surprise/awe/whatever. Ana's gasping is equally annoying, but a little easier to take, since she apparently only had a vague notion of where babies come from.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the ongoing gymnastics of Ana's Inner Goddess. It's exhausting just thinking about it.<br /><br />But the coup de grace: the end, where the spanking Ana had just asked for was the thing that tipped her straight over into Thanks But No Thanks. Things seemed to be going wellish; Grey did nothing but give in and cave to her whims at nearly every turn, she decided she was madly in love, but somehow the spanking undoes it all and she bails on the man she couldn't bear the thought of losing NOT THREE PARAGRAPHS AGO. Ms. James practically bludgeons the reader with this sequel-setup.<br /><br />I was mentally concussed to no avail- I don't plan to read the ill hinted-at sequels. If this is your first foray into erotic literature, don't give up on it! This was a bad sample of the genre.Grey is supposed to be super-experienced at all things sexual and a master of self-containment, yet he's constantly gasping like an asthmatic in a cottonwood grove in shock/surprise/awe/whatever.

B003TML0VO|5.0|I've read several reviews of this disc, and cannot understand why some of you chose to slam this album. It's grand! I don't know what the naysayers were listening to when writing as they did, but it wasn't this CD!<br /><br />The first three tracks, Santana's versions of Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", the Rolling Stones' monster, \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\", and the Eric Clapton/Cream classic, \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" are worth buying \\"Guitar Heaven\\" for alone! All three pack the wallop of an uppercut from a young Muhammad Ali. I thought that I was too tired of \\"Smoke on the Water\\", that is, 'til Carlos' magic breathed new life into it. The George Harrison/Beatles' \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" remake is tender and soulful.<br /><br />Now, is this Carlos Santana's best album? That's hardly a fair question, given his immense body of superb work, (Santana I-III, Moonflower, Supernatuaral, amongst many more). Thus, the short answer is no, but \\"Guitar Heaven\\" is unquestionably one of my favorites.<br /><br />Yes, there are weak moments, but only a couple. I'm not a fan of \\"Back in Black\\", (featuring Nas), because I truly believe that rap and hip-hop are the musical equivalent of urinating in the Holy Grail itself. I didn't care for \\"Dance the Night Away\\", or \\"Photograph\\", only because I'm not a fan of those original tracks.<br /><br />Yet the rest of \\"Guitar Heaven\\" delivers pure gold: \\"Riders on the Storm\\", \\"Bang a Gong\\", \\"Little Wing\\", (of which Jimi would approve), and \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\", with the dynamic Jonny Lang, finish this bit of Heaven.<br /><br />\\"Guitar Heaven\\" *is* a great album! Those who think otherwise deserve to be flogged with a handful of Carlos Santana's guitar strings, though they be unworthy of that privilege. Listen to the samples, then buy--and truly enjoy--this disc!

0439023521|5.0|I bought The Hunger Games trilogy last year. Then the books got stacked up and forgot about having them. Knowing that the movie starring Jennifer Lawrence was about to come out, I took a slight break from my review piles and opened the first book. It was late at night, I was tired, and I was not planning to read very much. Well, I ended up reading about half of the book, as I was caught up in the futuristic, weird world of Panem, which strangely resembles the real world. The story is told from the point of view of sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (What a name!) who volunteers to take her sister's (Prim) place in the annual Hunger Games that the Capital holds. There were once 13 Districts in Panem, and the 13th rebelled against the Capital. After the 13ths were vanquished, the Capital decided to punish the other districts with the Hunger Games. Each year one male and one female (between the ages of 12 to 16) from each district are randomly chosen to participate in the games which only has one main rule, fight to the death.<br /><br />  Katniss is well aware that she volunteered for a death sentence. She is great hunter, thanks to her late father, and is an expert with a bow and arrows. She has much better chance of surviving than her other District 12 constant, Peeta - the son of a baker. With the guidance by District 12's only winner, Haymitch, who somewhat trains them before they are tossed into a forest like arena. Airing on Live TV, the 24 contestants must fight to the death.<br /><br />  The Hunger Games reminds me of the Running Man by Richard Bachman (A.K.A. Stephen King), but with teenagers. Suzanne Collin's narration is wonderfully crafted with a slight razor edge to it.  As a reader, I was instantly hooked into the story and felt for Katniss as she struggled to survive in the violent arena. Considering all the reality TV rage in our culture, we are not to far from this violent entertainment. That is a scary thought! The Hunger Games is targeted for the Young Adult market, but the book is written for a mature reader. The control that the Capital has over the Districts mirrors our current government as they try to control the public. The book is violent, not graphic, but I would not recommend it to younger readers.

0786891416|3.0|Being a fan of the television show \\"Castle,\\" I was excited about reading \\"Heat Wave\\" by Richard Castle - the fictional character on the show. I think the real author was either James Patterson or the late Stephen J. Cannell.<br /><br />The main character is Nicki Heat, a NYPD Homicide Detective. The commissioner assigns a famous magazine journalist, Jameson Rock, to follow her on the job. Jameson is a wisecracking idiot who keeps getting in her way - similar to the Richard Castle character on the show. As Nicki investigates the death of a real estate tycoon, she starts to fall for Jameson.<br /><br />I was disappointed that \\"Heat Wave\\" is just under 200 pages. More of a novella than a novel. The characters, dialogue and plot all mirror the television show. There is nothing original here. If you're a fan of the show, you may tolerate this so-so crime novel.

B0079J26TI|5.0|Having purchased and subsequently lost the prior remastering of the Mendelssohn recordings, I'm quite familiar with the brilliant account of these symphonies by Klemperer.  Fortunately, EMI's engineers decided to give some of their better master tapes the royal treatment, remastering them using today's higher resolution technology.  The performances were highly praised in ARG reviews for their (uncharacteristic for late Klemperer recordings) well paced tempos.  The 4th is nice and breezy without being as rushed in the first movement as so many conductors treat it.  You can hear brilliant articulation in the winds and a transparency combined with weight that was unique to Klemperer.  The 3rd or \\"Scottish\\" Symphony benefits from Klemperer's good judgment in giving the bombastic and un scottish coda it's proper weight.  I hate how most other conductors just blast their way through it as a means of coping with its awkwardness.  Klemperer does tend to slower tempos than his contemporaries but not by such a great degree as you might expect.  The finale of the 4th is indeed slower than the indicated vivacissimo indicated in the score but it still works quite well.  Maybe not as brilliant as my favorite recordings (Commissiona/ Baltimore on Vox if you can find it, or Abbado,LSO on DGG) but still quite good.<br /><br />The Schumann 4th was an unexpected pleasure, weighty yet quite transparent.  Klemperer admits to a bit of tinkering with the score to eliminate some doublings or add others to improve balance, but this was rather common in his era when conductors were not so pedantic about fussing with original scores where the performance would be enhanced by it.  For years many of us considered Szell's Cleveland Orchestra recordings of the Schumann symphonies to be definitive and he was not above some judicious retouching of the scores for sake of balance.  Again, the SACD sound is warm and transparent, free from distortion with just the right amount of air around the notes.  Significantly better than their first remastering around the early 90s.  The packaging and notes are deluxe in hardbound booklet form.  The discs are in sleeves at the beginning and end and a bit difficult to remove, but well packaged nonetheless.  Get it while you can as EMI loves to release and drop from print quickly.  If you don't have an SACD player, these are hybrid discs, playable on your CD player. The CD layer is derived from the high resolution remasters and sounds better than the prior release.<br /><br />Note that the Mendelssohn 3rd uses the original coda, not the alternate developed by Klemperer using Mendelssohn's sketches.  He recorded that alternate ending during these sessions and I wish to hell the engineers included it, but you get a nice weighty Hebrides Overture all the same.  The notes state that the Klemperer live recording of the \\"Scottish\\" symphony with the Bavarian Radio Sym. DOES use his alternate ending.  I'm eager to hear it as the original coda suffers from bombast and weakens the overall structure of an otherwise delightful and inventive work.Significantly better than their first remastering around the early 90s.  The packaging and notes are deluxe in hardbound booklet form.  The discs are in sleeves at the beginning and end and a bit difficult to remove, but well packaged nonetheless.  Get it while you can as EMI loves to release and drop from print quickly.  If you don't have an SACD player, these are hybrid discs, playable on your CD player. The CD layer is derived from the high resolution remasters and sounds better than the prior release.<br /><br />Note that the Mendelssohn 3rd uses the original coda, not the alternate developed by Klemperer using Mendelssohn's sketches.  He recorded that alternate ending during these sessions and I wish to hell the engineers included it, but you get a nice weighty Hebrides Overture all the same.  The notes state that the Klemperer live recording of the \\"Scottish\\" symphony with the Bavarian Radio Sym. DOES use his alternate ending.  I'm eager to hear it as the original coda suffers from bombast and weakens the overall structure of an otherwise delightful and inventive work.
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't understand how people like it so much. really fun for the first 4 minutes but after that its just repetitive. kinda dumb but its free so if u got extra space buy it
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the most best game ever. finally, they put it on the kindle fire. I have been waiting sooo long! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!! I play it all the time! I played it on the ipod and was sad to see that it was not on amazon, and I seen games who tried to copy, but finally, this is here! It's free!! what do you have to lose?!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Progressively more challenging puzzles and adorable resulting images make this a new favorite.  Each puzzle is a grid, you are told how many consecutive squares are filled in each row and column, using that info you have to figure out which squares to fill; succeed and you create a recognizable image.
B006RED4GA|5.0|If you have A.D.D. this movie is not for you. I suggest you go play a video game, a rental, then you won't have to own a game that will bore you after 2 hours of play.  If this first paragraph is boring you do not watch this movie, it is not fast pasted enough for someone with your...um...refined, shall we say, tastes.<br />However, if you enjoy older thrillers from the '50's and '60's, have fond memories of the original Shinning (the one from before you probably were born, made in the 1980's), and don't mind seemingly trivial story telling devices such as character development this just may be a movie that you would enjoy.<br />WARNING: this movie is so 'old school' they actually have real special effects and sets, instead of a CGC cartoon hackery. Enjoy.
B005PK58TI|2.0|Maybe it's because I don't have the emotional maturity of a twelve-year-old, but this turkey has taken me months to get through episode 6.  I doubt that I will bother with more.  The scariest thing about it is watching the characters give themselve lung cancer from sucking on coffin nails.<br /><br />AMC still has Breaking Bad, the best program left on TV, and The Walking Dead, a decent, if implausible horror series.  They could take the entire rest of their lineup and cancel everything.  I'd never know any of them were gone.<br /><br />American Horror is just that.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I bought this album because I LOVE the song, \\"Somebody I Used to Know\\" & \\"Hearts a Mess\\", so I figured the entire album would be as entrancing. NOT! All the other songs on this album are rather lightweight, hookless, pop ditties. Sweet, pleasant and totally un-memorable. What a shame. I really wanted to adore this guy.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was intense. I was told about it through a friend who LOVED it. I liked it, but did not love it.  I liked the book, quite a bit. I NEEDED to finish it. Definitely a page turner. However, there was something slightly disturbing about the intensity in which Travis became obsessed with Pidge. He was quite volatile, almost unbalanced. However, I would like to praise the author for the same things I am critiquing. The author managed to slip in very real circumstances of violence and I feel such elements are often curbed by publishers. This book had the raw intensity political correctness has robbed us of. The book is memorable, emotional, and exciting. I recommend it (even if it did make me uncomfortable at parts.)I would not suggest it to someone uncomfortable with reading violence (sometimes unjustified).
B0014DW3OS|5.0|This excellent film is Serpico on speed;  an idealistic rookie cop fights entrenched corruption, not over the span of months, or years, but in less than 24 hours.  Denzel is breathtaking in this tour-de-force, careering among charm, brutality, tenderness, sadism, thoughtfulness and savagery in  taut, jolting scenes.  Ethan Hawke plays the rookie he is training for possible work on an elite detective squad.  Scott Glenn heads a fine ensemble of supporting players, whose fully formed characters ground the often outrageous deeds of Denzel's persona in reality.<br /><br />The violence in the film is heart-stoppingly sudden, and the threat of it emits a miasma of menace.  None of the mayhem, however, is gratuitous.  In one verbal confrontation with Hawke, Denzel says,<br />\\"It's chess, not checkers!\\", in an attempt to explain his cozy relationship with a drug dealer (Glenn), and his willingness to discard him in a heartbeat.  It is such complexity and depth that elevate this film far above the average coming of age on the job procedural.

0385751532|5.0|It is quite possible that more has been written about The Holocaust than any other historical event in history. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted.<br /> John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book \\"The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas\\" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain \\"the voice,\\" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a \\"telling\\" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, \\"Heil Hitler\\" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, \\"Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.\\"<br /> The boy, his name Bruno; his age nine, misunderstands the key words and Auschwitz is written as \\"Out-With\\" every single time. The negative pun- the only way I could describe this- suggests the old work rhythm, \\"In with the good; out with the bad.\\" Then the boy mishears the Furher as The Fury\\" and this negative pun needs no description at all. We have a moment when Bruno meets \\"The Fury\\" as well as \\"her\\" when they come for dinner and Bruno is appalled at how small The Fury is, but how kind the beautiful blonde woman with him is (her name is simply Eva).<br /> The innocence and ignorance of this young boy is as critical to the brilliance of this work as the story of the Titanic. (I speak not just of Cameron's film, but Maury Yeston's musical, \\"a Night to Remember\\" and the three other films made between 1938 and 1984) Boyne uses the literary tool that his audience not only knows so much more than Bruno, but that we are anticipating the sadness that ends the novel. So we are prepared to cry but when the end does come, Boyne shocks us in such a way that instead of tears, our mouths are opened in the O shape that he uses to describe several characters through the book.<br /> This book is by no means a \\"Sophie's Choice\\" though the horror is just as shocking, but few writers in history have been able to achieve what William Styron did. Still Styron's novel and Boyne's novel use a similar foundation but their books are about very different things. Where the ending is horrifyingly shocking and, like Styron's \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" completely unexpected (who in fact could have imagined an ending such as this one) the poignancy of \\"The Boy In Striped Pajamas\\" makes it impossible for this book- and the fame it will bring Mr. Boyne, you heard it here first- to become satirized in any way. Because the innocence and ignorance, as a result of the way his parents have shielded Bruno, is a metaphor for the way in which the population who was aware of the death camps were inactive; complacent and how the same continues to occur day after day from the beginning of recorded time to the continued genocide in Darfur- the world's largest death camp- to which the UN has placed sanctions against while The full force of the American military tore apart Iraq in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br /> The current political winds in the United States suggest that Gay Americans and Female Americans are just as vulnerable. All of these circumstances suggest that you could very well be next. John Boyne manages to suggest all of this is his two hundred page fable using a modicum of brilliantly chosen words.<br /> John Boyle has sub-titled his book, A Fable\\" and it is. His final words are like a double edged sword:<br /> \\"And that's the end of the story of Bruno and his family. Of course all of this<br /> happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again.<br />  Not in this day and age.\\"<br /><br />The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others.<br /> This novel is worthy of a prize. It's not a children's book, though my children should read it. It's not an adult book, but all adults should read it. This would rule out the Newbury or Caldecott. In regard to its literary merit, the American version needs some editorial work (only once did the editors miss a pajamas and leave pyjamas) but the writing is pristine and brilliant and worthy of The Pulitzer. As far as The Nobel Prize for Literature, it is worthy there too. But mostly it's is worthy of you. And, like \\"Sophie's Choice\\" I am told that a motion picture is in the making. Depending on whose hands it falls into this could be a miracle. The innocent eyes through which Bruno's story unfolds are critical and these innocent eyes are just as important as Sophie's guilty and lying soul. If Benton could do it, perhaps \\"The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas\\" will as well.<br /> But there are a lot of \\"Maybes\\" involved with the hopes of John Boyne, this critic and every other artist who has attempted to move us. As far as I can see, Boyne has done his part. This book, like Elie Weisel's \\"Night\\" needs to be published in as many languages as possible and marketed toward as many customers as possible. No one should keep this book from the hands of a nine year old nor should anyone consider it a book too young for adults.<br /> In short, this is a remarkable book in every way and perhaps, after more times has passed for thinking and another read through or so, l may well see that there is no other possible way for this story to have ended.<br /> Not in this day and age.ng like that could ever happen again.<br />  Not in this day and age.\\"<br /><br />The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others.<br /> This novel is worthy of a prize.

B007PS0X0W|4.0|Not perfect, not the best of the series, but still a darned entertaining movie. I would have liked to have seen it run a little longer. Kate's awesome. You 1 star pseudo-intellectual reviewers should go watch 'The Vow' or 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. Bring it!

B005LAIGP0|4.0|I don't really like horror movies. I find them generally predictable and kind of stupid. Plus the gore in most modern horror does nothing for.<br /><br />The Woman In Black, however, is an old fashioned ghost story. And much better for it. It also relies very heavily on a single actor. In this case Daniel Radcliffe.<br /><br />This is the first time I've seen anything other than the Harry Potter movies and it is a little difficult to move past that image of him. Indeed at one point I found myself wondering where his glasses were, before realizing he didn't have any. But his understated performance was perfect for the role and he was able to capture my attention for the large portions of the film where he was the only character on screen.<br /><br />As I mentioned this is an old fashioned sort of ghost story. And it moves at an old fashioned pace that may not be to everyone's tastes. I loved the slow build up though.<br /><br />There are a lot of ghost story tropes here. Faces in windows; dogs barking; unwelcoming villagers. Some may say it's unoriginal I suppose. I think of it more as using the familiar elements to build suspense and fear. The movie is particularly good at giving you moments of quiet and then making you jump. Which is exactly what a film like this should do.<br /><br />I'd say this one is a definite watch.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I loved Slash's 1st solo album, but I was glad to see that Myles Kennedy sang lead for the entire album this time...

B0000549B0|4.0|I've always found this an entertaining film. Interesting from a psychological standpoint as well. You could find it tragic, in a way, but if you just sit back and enjoy it, it's pretty funny. I started laughing in the beginning, when that big lady was singing the goofy song and bouncing like, well, a rabbit. And the movie got funnier from there.<br /><br />When Elwood's (James Stewart) sister went to get him committed and got committed herself, it was hilarious. I mean, in a way it was horrible, because these days when you get taken to the hospital you don't get your clothes torn off and get thrown into a bathtub. (As someone who has studied the mental health system, this is partly why I found the film so interesting.) It was hilarious when the doctor was relieved about his close call of almost committing Elwood instead. That's his psychological expertise! It was also interesting how they panicked about a lawsuit. I wouldn't have thought that would be such an issue in that time period. (Much like today, what the sister went through was a bummer, but she doesn't deserve a fortune for being inconvenienced for an hour. An apology would suffice.)<br /><br />I liked the whole theme of the movie. Elwood obviously had a \\"problem.\\" (Or did he? We wonder at the end.) But he was happy and was not bothering anyone. In fact, he was kind to everyone he met. And isn't that the most important thing in life?
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|after this stabilizer arived late (and was thus unusable for me) i got an RMA from 47th street photo and sent it back UNOPENED, the box was UNTOUCHED. not only did the postage on this cost around 18$ they (47th street photo) kept another 27$ as a restocking fee. when i complained about that they wrote (english mistakes are theirs): 'we have to return product to manufacture as it can no longer be sold as new and they apply the same deduction to us'.<br />this is clearly a lie, they don't have to return an untouched and still sealed box to the manufacturer, that is a made-up argument.<br />when i complained again the reply was even more obscure: '... if we operated our business on the premise that we refund every customer in full when they return an unwanted product we would not be in business...'<br /><br />as well know amazon.com operates pretty well on taking products back and has many happy customers (me as one of them), who happily spend a lot money there. from what I know amazon.com is still in business...<br /><br />in any case: i can't say anything about the product, it might be good, so if you really know you want it, get it. just don't even consider returning it, as the 179$ price is counterweighed with a 45$ return cost, even for a SEALED, UNOPENED product.<br /><br />(btw: i ended up borrowing a Wondlan Professional Steadicam Carbon Fiber Camera Stabilizer]], which i can highly recommend for shooting with a canon 5D Mark III).<br />[[ASIN:B007RNBJK8 Wondlan Professional Steadicam Carbon Fiber Camera Stabilizer]]<br /><br />************** addition, june 2012 **********************<br />47th Street Photo contacted me after the review, apologized and returned the full missing portion of the refund to me.<br />even if it takes some steps to make thing right, the relevant part is what the final result is.<br />we all learn (i do, merchants do) and i almost assume that my stand will make the experience for future buyers better.
6305308659|3.0|I really enjoyed Pleasantville the first time I watched it. After another viewing or two I am not as sure. I really loved the black and white to color. It was so artistic, and different from the usual special effects we see all the time. That is what drew me in. The message of the movie, however, was weird.<br /><br />Now, I was not around in the 50s. I wasn't born until the 80s, so my only reference points are the TV. Let's take my two favorite black and white shows, I Love Lucy and The Dick Van Dyke show. They were not mindless. Working husbands, stay-at-home wives, but that was accurate for the era. And we saw Ricky and Rob at work, they didn't just appear at the door at 5:00 for their dinner. Both Lucy and Laura occasionally expressed interest in working and definitely were not subservient. Sure, they had twin beds, but who cares? We were watching comedy, not bedrooms. (I really don't find people bouncing all over each other that interesting, and it doesn't involve much acting ability.) And we never saw a toilet... who cares about that, either? It also baffles me that anyone wants to see someone sitting on a toilet on their TV screen. Especially when the person is having, um, difficulties. And rain was not non-existent. That's silly. I understand that Pleasantville was trying to make a point, but it was really kind of offensive to our favorite classic shows and characters.<br /><br />On the other hand, it made some really interesting statements. I guess the big one is that change is good. It is what keeps things interesting. However, like a lot of other reviewers said, we do not see the results of Pleasantville's conversion. It could be pregnant teenagers, broken homes, violence in the streets. Is that better than everything they had? Probably not, even though everything they had was totally boring. That's why I bring up my two favorite old shows. They had old-fashioned values but were not clueless like the world of Pleasantville. By the way, I am a liberal. The state of the world just saddens me. And I think movies have gotten more and more \\"graphic\\" not because of \\"freedom of expression\\" but because people are competing for \\"shock value.\\"state of the world just saddens me.

B007L96VCY|5.0|This Paul McCartney Archive from 1971 is a classic. Ram is one of my favorite albums.  As for the the remastering, which is excellent, am I the only one who heard some \\"static\\" or some background \\"stuff\\" on \\"Smile Away\\"?  Just curious.  I hope I didn't get a bad CD. All of the rest of the songs on both cd's are amazing regarding the quality of the remix.<br /><br />A few remasters of classic albums I have purchased have horrible sound.

0345803493|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  I really wanted to like it!  I bought it on my Kindle because of all the hype.  When I first heard about the Twilight series, it didn't sound like something I would like at all, but after someone convinced me to read it, I was hooked and I LOVED the whole series.  The premise of The Hunger Games didn't sound interesting to me either, but I sent the sample to my Kindle and ended up buying the series and finishing the books in a few days.  Surely, it would be this way about Fifty Shades.  Much to my dismay, not so much.<br /><br />I had a difficult time getting through the first book.  The hopeless romantic in me was utterly upset over Christian Grey.  Yeah, yeah, he is the most beautiful man to ever walk the earth, EVER! And yeah, he is a BILLIONAIRE at the young age of 27 and can pretty much make anything happen by throwing around his money and his name.  But he is also a deeply damaged and disturbed man.  I get that he had a horrible childhood, but the way he controls and abuses women is beyond creepy.  Who would want to be with a man like that??<br /><br />Our heroine, Anastasia, is such a weak woman with the self esteem the size of a peanut.  I cringed when she chose a life that she did not agree with just so she wouldn't be alone.  I could never subject myself to a relationship with a man who wanted to punish me if I didn't do as he pleased.  I also could not tolerate being told what to do all of the time.  She really wanted her first relationship to be one with a seriously disturbing contract?  So many shades of wrong.  The scenes where she was being punished made me cry, and not a good cry that a heartfelt story will do to you.  I did yell out a YES!!! when she told him off at the end of the first book.<br /><br />I have only read the first two books.  Halfway through the first one, I swore I wouldn't buy the second.  The only reason I wanted to finish Grey was because I was really wanting and hoping for Ana to save Christian fromthe screwed up universe he is living in and make him aware that he is worthy of love.  I still didn't understand why Ana loved him, because I didn't see the lovable qualities in him, but if that was what I was supposed to buy into, then I was really going to try.  The way book one ended made me read the second one.  Nice job, James.<br /><br />I did enjoy Darker more than Grey.  It was more obvious how much Christian loved her and wanted to change for her so they could be together.  I wanted to smack Anastasia myself every time she worried that she needed to tend to his \\"needs\\" more.  He told you he didn't need that in his life anymore, stupid woman!  The constant fighting and immediate sex became tiresome quickly.  This really is a classic case of an extremely dysfunctional relationship.  Young, impressionable minds need to stay clear from these books until they are mature enough to know that this behavior is not normal and is definitely not something you should want in your own relationships.<br /><br />I know that I will finish the series by reading the third book, but I am putting it off for some reason I can't quite grasp.  Part of me feels that I have had enough of this pair of unstable lovers.  These books can be wearing.  Morbid curiosity will win and I am sure it will be only a matter of days that I put an end to this series.  I'm hoping it will be worth it.
0062119044|5.0|\\"On the 11th of April, 1983, unto [Eva Khatchadourian] a son was born, and [she] felt nothing.\\" On the 8th of April, 1999, Kevin Khatchadourian locked seven of his classmates, a teacher, and a cafeteria worker in an empty gym and killed them. The story of Kevin is told through a series of letters from Eva to her estranged husband, a few years later. She wrestles with her guilt by recounting every moment of her life that lead up to this point (and beyond), from her perfect, child-free marriage in NYC to her weekly visits with Kevin in jail.<br /><br />At first, this book was my worst nightmare. I've never been 100% sure that I ever want to have children, and the idea that I could have one and not magically fall in love with it is truly scary. Does Eva feel nothing for Kevin because there is something wrong with him? Or is there something wrong with him because Eva doesn't like him? Is this all Eva's fault? Was there anything she could have done? No mother is perfect, but where is the line between an imperfect mother and a bad one? Kevin was apathetic, distructive, and sadistic from the very beginning, and I was sympathetic to Eva's helplessness.<br /><br />The tables turned for me when Eva had another child, who is sweet and innocent and loveable. Nothing is wrong with Eva; something is wrong with Kevin. Kevin gets more and more malicious, but he manages to hide it from his father. Arguing over Kevin's behavior eventually tears Eva's marriage apart. Is that what Kevin wanted all along?<br /><br />Whatever Eva (and the reader) thinks she knows about Kevin, she doesn't, in the way you can't ever truly know another person, especially one as misanthropic as Kevin. It's true, this book addresses a few extremely difficult topics. But the difficult topics are the ones it's most important to think about.

B004QOB8SY|5.0|I recommend buying Sherlock on Blu Ray because quite frankly, the way the visuals are in the show to tell the story, you only cheat yourself on the quality of going DVD. That is, if you have a 1080p HDTV to go with that Blu Ray player. The acting and the story is one thing, but the way the show is crafted, the direction and vision and the different tones and hues of the scenes from the show stand out in HD. If you are in the US watching the second season via Masterpiece on PBS, you arent seeing the entire episodes! They cut 8 minutes out of each show to make room for commericals and to thank funding partners. Its just another reason to watch the second season all over again!<br /><br />And enough about how good it looks on a HDTV screen, did I mention that this version of the modern day sherlock Holmes would probably make Conan Doyle proud? Dont waste your time on that new ABC series of Sherlock Holmes in the fall, the BBC version does it right.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was soo happy when I saw it on here I love this game its soo fun!!!!!....I'm soo happy I was about sell my kindle cuz they didn't have this game
B000H0MKOC|5.0|I recommend everything about this film. I think it makes its point well and with plenty of flair. The acting is top notch, script is brilliant at its worst, and the camera work on this movie is surprisingly creative and equally effective.<br /><br />This movie is also a definite must for mass communication majors everywhere. You will understand much more personally what the advertising and cigarette industry experienced, in its short history, when the government decided (and still decides) to get involved.<br /><br />Really, it's just great. If you like smart movies, there's no way you won't like this one.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|the movie was well done, most of the movie match the descriptions of the characters and places, but it missed small parts and changed a few things like how Katniss got the mockingjay (wich also changes some descriptions for the next two movies.) Some people don't like the concept but I think is not so far from  the reality of how humans abuse of their peers. In love with Peeta and Katniss love story!

B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I got this app when it was on sale for 1.99 and i've used boxee and xbmc, which plex is based on, before to watch videos stored on my laptop and internet videos on my tv. i like how easy it is to navigate using my phone as a remote and plex has some surprising features like downloading info about my music and tv shows automatically. I suggest getting the free desktop programs and trying them out first then see if you want to go mobile.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Husband loves his new copy of this movie.His old copy was taped off a movie channel and now he can watch a better copy.
B0060CV31C|3.0|Though this is rated G, all audiences, it seems for older kids and adult.  I watched this to my four year old and she wasn't that excited.  I think it is because most of the jokes were directed at adults and kids a bit older, lots of cultural references and sarcasm.  There was lots of sarcasm in the movie and a little kid just won't get that.  I also found the clear statements about murder/killing -- the emperor knows someone is trying to kill him and someone makes it clear that they are trying to kill him -- to be a bit non-Disney.  Disney movies tend to be a bit more opaque about death so that kids only understand that death/killing/murder is occurring or may occur if they already understand death and such.  But the movie wouldn't have worked easily without the direct talk about killing.  I found it funny but I was looking for something for my kid instead.  I'm sure an eight year old would enjoy it a lot better.  The G rating is a bit generic, and if I had to choose between G and PG, I might pick PG.  Movies really need those Youth rating like TV has these days.
B0028RXXE8|1.0|This was a great series!  But, the version shipped to me was heavily edited, and not nearly as good as the version broadcast originally. Too bad!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|If I had to make a choice between hand to hand fighting Liam Neeson OR an alpha grey wolf... I'll take my chances with the wolf. That guy scares the pink off my genitals.<br /><br />Quite simply this movie is FAR more cerebral then it's log line would lead you to believe, and It left me with a very unsettling feeling similar to the one I had after watching \\"Children of Men.\\"<br /><br />NOTE to those who complain about the accuracy of the wolves: OBVIOUSLY grey wolves are NOT the Sasquatch demon zombies this movie depicts them as. It's NOT necessary to REMIND us that movies are fantasy. YOU are the idiot if you HONESTLY think we are TOO stupid to grasp that. You OBVIOUSLY did NOT \\"get\\" this movie and should probably stick to simpler fare such as Transformers and Spider-man.
B007PS0X0W|1.0|This movie was absolute crap...the whole 10minutes I watched the only thing that went through my head was...just shoot her and get it over with.<br />Terrible story,terrible acting,it made my head hurt just trying to watch it
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|I don't quite see why this 'film' was made.<br />A plain, overweight, perhaps psychotic girl pretends to be a gorgeous blonde on the internet, through Facebook.<br />What else is new?<br />The good-looking guy who \\"falls in love\\" with her goes across America to find her and realises she is not the girl of his dreams after all?<br />Did this really happen?<br />I would guess it happens about a thousand times a day.<br />Does it make for an engrossing docu-drama? No. It's just sad, and I don't believe this hip cool guy was taken in for a minute.<br />If it is true, then his narcissism as he poses for her portrait of him is unforgivable, and just as psychotic as her compulsive lying.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|my favorite is what makes you beautiful i like them all there upbeat i can not wait to go to their 2013 tour

B001O5LVPI|5.0|Ever since my very first experience (no, I did not say experiment)I decided that Lilo & Stitch were well worth seeing more of.However, my experiences have only been 50% successful so far.Why? Well, I bought a 12 dvd set from Amazon (France) after having read that it is in English. However, it turned out that that information was fraudulently wrong.Half of the discs are in English (subtitled in French) while the rest were all in French, with no subtitle for English).It did NOT make me happy to have to sit and laugh at what I was seeing, without knowing what it was that I was laughing at!!Even though I got my money refunded in full as well as being able to keep the discs, I am still stuck with something I neither wanted, nor do I fully comprehend.A very similar situation happened with LILO & STITCH READ ALONG.(Check out my opinion on that at that disc site).But, THE BIG WAVE EDITION is entirely a new ball game (so to speak (or write).This is not only in English but it is completely, thoroughly and absolutely enjoyable.BUY it, GET it, you'll LOVE it.<br />I find it rather obnoxious that the Disney company would want to can it.Of course, we have Stitch now in Japan, with his new female friend.Having seen so much of Stitch, Lilo and Nani (and not knowing what happened to them prior to his appearence in Japan)it is a little hard to adjust to Stitch's new friends.I see on Amazon Jp. that they have a big selection of Stitch's escapades....all made in Japan.....and, I sadly say, most probably all in the Japanese language.I have written to Amazon Jp. asking if the discs have English subtitles.NO REPLY.But, I am again visiting Japan (for the 9th time) in January. So, if they do have English versions guess who's going to come home with a suitcase full.<br />But, apart from those anomalies, do not refuse to buy Stitch and his friends, they are just so great to see. I like them so much.....I paid $200+ for a Stitch plush. He has pride of place on my bed.(I don't have space to sithim in my lounge room!!!!).
B002ZG98LO|3.0|It seems a very long time ago when the word `Predator' in the title meant a decent film: a fusion of sci-fi and action with plenty of tension. I gave up on the series after the first (and dreadful) 'A vs P' movie. Despite that I was quite excited when I heard about this Rodriguez re-boot and thought I'd give it a go, especially with that S at the end. One always lives in hope of a new 'Aliens'.<br /><br />This, however, is not it!<br /><br />It begins intriguingly enough with a group of soldiers and ex-cons being dropped into a mysterious jungle... but after that it's all rather familiar. This film is very much a re-run of the 1987 original just with a different setting, a few underwhelming twists and some not-so-subtle references to other films ('Aliens', '7 Samurai' etc).<br /><br />The action is OK, though there is a distinct lack of suspense, while everything else - camerawork, stunts, special effects etc - is efficiently workmanlike. The dialogue is functional but taken down by some puerile and sexist jokes to pander to the teenage boy audience. That's a shame because 'Predator' began as a movie for adults with its 18 certificate. On the subject on dialogue, Brody's voice is risible: from the Christian Bale/Batman school of gruff talk.<br /><br />Spoilers in this par so if you haven't seen the film, skip on to the next. My biggest gripe was Laurence Fishburne. Now I think he's a fine actor but here he's just going through the loony-motions. He's utterly unconvincing. More than that, his physical appearance is ridiculous. He's supposed to have survived on the Predator-planet for ten years, scavenging what he can; at one point he even says there isn't enough food. And yet it's difficult to imagine a plumper, better fed man! He should really have been told to get into better shape or been fired the day he rolled on to set.<br /><br />Overall 'Predators' is not a bad film (though it's definitely not a good one), it's just a pointless one. If it hadn't been made neither film history nor the franchise would have been any better/worse off. That seems a terrible waste of time, talent and money.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game will give you hours of enjoyment, as well as, some frustration. Definitely worth the time and price. Love it

B0086700CM|5.0|Glad to see this app in the Amazon store.  I've played it before and got hooked.  Very addictive.  Thanks for adding it.
B0086700CM|3.0|when I got this game for kindle fire it was fun but the graphics where bad and when I want to move it barley works.but people you should get it if you really like temple run=)
B0086700CM|5.0|finally! they added temple run! i have it on my iPhone 4s and love it! im so glad they added it to the kindle! its about time!
0385737955|3.0|Moving along at a break-neck pace this book would be great for reluctant readers who enjoy action, adventure and mystery.<br /><br />That said, there is not a lot of character building and the author  constantly withholds information from Thomas and the reader in order to keep up the mystery pretense, which can be quite frustrating at times. I was also surprised that there was almost no growth in any of the characters including the protagonist, which is odd for a young adult novel.<br /><br />I was also surprised that none of the boys seemed to share information with each other, which I felt was a bit implausible considering their situation.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Maze Runner\\" is a light enjoyable read that will entertain you as long as you're not looking for deeper substance.
B007N6EUHI|5.0|I do diagnostic 3d imaging. This app is priceless for easy reference and as a visual aide  while I'm instructing my students. I love this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app. It's been extremely helpful in putting together Bible studies and personal studies. I'm very happy this app exists and is free.
0345803485|1.0|One word describes it all. Garbage. I do not understand the hype. This was definitely not worth the full 13 bucks (or however much) I spent on the kindle edition. Seriously are that many people lacking the intellectual capacity to judge this book for what it was?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Okay, I don't get it. Are there that many women out there that never read erotica before, or even a hot romance novel. This was so poorly written, its embarassing that so many women are running out to buy this book. Perhaps I should write one too if this is all it takes. Ugh!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a challenge to finish the puzzle. Not like others that are mindless games. Sometimes I wish it had a hint button but I still gave it a good rating.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun, until you get to a game you cant beat. if you cant beat it you cant unlock new games. I wish you could use in game money to &quot;pass&quot; the level.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|When you click on the video it tells you to click the green button. Instead, I should be able to assign an action since it obviously knows I'm clicking the video. For example, it should either view or download by default based on what I prefer. It's EXTREMELY annoying to see that prompt for doing what I do intuitively!
0439023491|4.0|The Hunger Game's was the best of the three books. Catching Fire seemed repetative at first but got better as it went on.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|great and interesting game worth the 99 cent price. very entertaining and visual.  long upload though. but overall a great game at a great price.
0061692042|5.0|Two adults that were never meant to be get married, and the longer they stay together, the worse it gets. It was quite obvious that their children would be affected for a lifetime, suffering the mistakes their parents and dysfunctional family make. The year is 1960, a man and a woman walk into a bank and rob it, everything went wrong, and they were sent to prison. The consequences of their behavior and crime were rested upon the shoulders of their two children, Dell and Berner. From that day on, the children grew up overnight, lost their own identity, and lived with fear of the unknown. The Breathtaking story not only sets your nerves on fire, but reminds us all of the inner-strength we never knew we had, until we are forced to use it. Two children are trashed into an uncaring world to fend for themselves as they struggle to survive, while enduring horrific events and life-threatening situations. I highly recommend \\"CANADA\\" to all literature and fiction lovers, who enjoy dramatic stories that become thrilling and emotional. Richard Ford delivers an incredible page-turner, made for the Movie screen. The characters are genuine, and the 'Dell Parson's Story' is mesmerizing and tugs on the heartstrings. The story will bring tears to your eyes as you learn of the Trauma of two children, inner-strength and emotions of the crosses we bear. This is a brilliant coming of age tale, an adventure through life-changing events, and survival of the unknown. A Masterpiece of storytelling and a gem in itself.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the greatest app. works great on kindle fire so shut up to the people who said it doesn't. thank you so much for putting this app on here! you don't know how long ive been waiting! I usually have to play on my friends tiny i-pod touches. THANK YOU!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for temple run for a while now, and finally it's here, for the kindle fire! This game is awesome and addicting, everyone should try it.
1936891026|5.0|This book came recommended to me by one of my writing instructors. Some of the negative reviewers call this book spiritual and overly religious.<br /><br />If you call being in touch with your soul's purpose religious then I guess it would be. Anyone who is put off by the so called overly 'spiritual' or 'religious' tone of this book is not an artist. Artists are people who have a felt sense and need to be in touch with their soul and things unseen.<br /><br />If you are truly an artist who is stuck and can't figure out why, I suggest you read this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love thid game it is tbe best game ever thank u amozon for putting temple run on kindle fire

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Nicolas Sparks on Anderson Cooper show suggested this book as a good summer read.  Took the suggestion and have been glad that I did.  Have really enjoyed the book, great insight into the American Family and what can happen in an instant.  Had not read this author before but will be added to my list for the future.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app for keeping notes about business likes list etc. pictures can be uploaded as well! I use this fir everyday kife
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this app. except just recently it wont let me open the app. its always worked fine until now. I even tried reinstalling it to no avail. plz fix!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|THE HOLY BIBLE puts everything that you need for Bible study a your fingertips.  If you want to jot notes it is just a tap away. I really love the ability to change versions with the touch of a finger. Excellent app!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just when the uncomfortable begins, it gets worse.  The twists in the plot and unpredicted and make the scenario all the worse. You find yourself believing there is no way the book can go through it again... then it does. (Sorry if that is a spoiler alert.)
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I loved this book! Mr. Navarro made this book hard to put down and it is practical throughout the read. I gleaned so much out of this book that at times it was hard to remember when I went to practice finding \\"tells.\\" It is interesting from time to time to see some of these \\"tells\\" such as the framing with thumbs in the belt loop! I really didn't expect to change my own body language by reading this book but I found some bad habits that I fell into as far as body language and realize how others perceive me based on that. Anyway, I would recommend this book to anyone!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book has more turns than the pages it is written on. I loved the future of weapons in this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never written an online review, ever. Just never felt  it was necessary since others had already written very good reviews. I decided to write this because the author requested it and this book was just that good. I am over 60 years old and have literally read hundreds of books , if not thousands, in my lifetime. I really enjoy scifi but read all types of books. This book was excellent, top of the list. I read on an iPad and just stumbled on this book by accident. I hesitated because it was not published by a known publishing house but decided lets see what this Floridian has to say. I am glad that I did. Buy the book you won't regret it either.
0439023521|5.0|The social aspect of the book is a future of the world that has a theme as old as time. Power and control, manipulation of the people through poverty, it is interesting to see how the author twists the theme into a whole new story.
B0086700CM|3.0|ok so I have this game on my ipod and iphone! I just got it on my kindle fire and when I got to turn it does not! or jump.or slide!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Took many useless dowloads of aps to get here and now I don't go a day without using it.  I am always saving from the web and now I can have the info at hand anytime, anywhere. googled how to refinish a table, found best links, clipped, and took my Kindle along with me to store. Full web page was available even without web connection. Crisp and colorful, pinch and zoom, it is great.  Also have clipped personal docs from desktop and synced to Kindle. Can clip from note aps, pics...I AM USING IT ALL THE TIME AND KEEPING MY INFO ORGANIZED ON THE GO.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|The third book in a brilliant trilogy about a victim who refuses to be a victim and who is ultimately victorious. Very well written; woven with intrigue and suspense, yet easy to read and follow characters even though names and places may be unfamiliar to non Swedish residents. A story set in our time and technology. Some sexual violence relevant to the story, but delicately and artfully included.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I definitely liked Book 1:  Fifty Shades of Grey better than book 2.  The reason I did not like book 2 as much is the repetitive cycle of someone gets mad over something stupid and then they have sex - over and over.  The maturity level of the relationship is slightly annoying - on the other hand, I felt they were learning along the way.  The sex scenes did not develop too much more intense from book one - which I was hoping they would.<br /><br />What I did enjoy about this book is how it is truly about a relationship of 2 people so in love (or they need each other in an unhealthy way).  Christian Grey is opening up his heart which allows the true love to shine thru.<br /><br />The end did provide a much needed twist - but I felt the book was too repetitive for at least 50% of it.<br /><br />It is not going to stop me from reading Book 3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bought the book just to understand what the hype was about and read it in 3 nights,,,, too little sleep later I wanted a Chrustian Grey
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I did not buy the SB-700 - but I am writing this review because I was trying to find alternative flashes to the SB-700 that would be comparable, but this information online was almost impossible to find.  In the end, I had a local camera retailer help me understand SB-700 features compared to other brands flashes compatible with Nikon cameras.  In the end, I chose the Nissin Di622.  I am not a professional camera user, but like to EASILY, enhance my pictures. This lens was easier to use and less money than the SB-700, so hopefully this review helps those people in the same boat I was in.<br /><br />I gave teh SB-700 a 5 star because I don't doubt it is a great product - but if you need an EASY solution for LESS MONEY - then I highly recommend Nissin Di622.  I wish I had a review to read similar to this when I was trying to make my purchase decision via the internet.
B0086700CM|5.0|I raelly like the game on the ipod and happy that they made it for kindle fire. YYAAAAYYY YYYAAAYYY YYAAAYYY
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you are looking to be taken away into a different world and fantasize over a rich, handsome, and sexy man - than this book is great.  It was exciting to learn a little about the dom and submission world - but it was not over the top.  This book is about consenting adults and safe sex.  I did not think the sex scenes were over the top - but they were interesting and kept me reading.<br /><br />I loved this book for the entertainment factor - I did not overanalyze the writing, which so many seem to be stuck on.  Christian Grey is a goddess - he knows how to treat a women, is soft and hard - and you jut cant help but want him.<br /><br />This book series is not my type - but my friends were reading it and loving it.  I too enjoyed it.  I bought the book for my 60 year old mom for Mothers Day and she loved it, too.<br /><br />If you are on the edge - take the dive in to read the book.  I think you will be hooked on the series - like every one I know who has read it so far.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book caught my attention right away.  It took me 3 days to finish this book.  I have recommended it to other people and find they have enjoyed it also.  I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.  I have read all three books and am hoping that she will continue with these characters.  I would highly recommend this series.
0345803485|1.0|To begin, I feel like a small bio of myself is necessary. I'm a 17-year-old, straight male who reads on his iPad whatever wanders into his sister's Kindle library.  I did, however, know what I was getting myself into due to all the attention its attracted but was like \\"Hey, it's a best-seller, right?\\" Well that's enough about me; let's get to this literary masterpiece...<br /><br />I'm just gonna start off real blunt: it was awful. Every component, which I'm about to list, just annoyed the hell out of me.<br /><br />1) There is zero depth to our \\"heroin.\\" You know nothing about her besides where she works and the school she goes to. Oh, I almost forgot that she's permanently blushing.<br /><br />2) The dialogue is unbelievably awkward and nonsensical.  Getting from point A to point B comes straight out of left field.<br /><br />3) Something fairly small that really bothered me was the fact that the college newspaper of which her friend was the editor was never named.  I'm sure that's not a big deal to 99% of readers, but it just kind of came off as another area of underdevelopment.<br /><br />4) SHE FLUSHES, SHE BLUSHES, AND SHE FLUSHES AGAIN! Either the main character is extremely prone to awkward situations or the author just has no creativity or vocabulary. During Ana and Christian's coffee shop trip, she was flushing and blushing, literally, every other sentence.  This is what ultimately forced me to not finish.<br /><br />Maybe there was some sort of redemption factor that played out later in the novel that I missed.  Although judging by these reviews, I highly doubt it.  Just don't fall to peer pressure and \\"join the crowd.\\". Sit this one out.
0698116496|5.0|My son loves \\"Good Night Moon\\" so I decided to get him \\"Good Night Gorilla\\" since it was also about saying \\"good night.\\"<br /><br />Good Night Gorilla is one of the sweetest kid's books I have ever seen. The pages are very colorful and vibrant and and the words are simple and easy to read. The story setting is at the zoo. The zoo keeper is putting the animals to bed and saying good night to each, one by one. What he doesn't know is that a mischievous little gorilla has taken his keys and let himself out of his cage. What follows is a hilarious little escapade by the gorilla and all the zoo animals!<br /><br />One thing that is different about this  book, is that some of the pages actually don't have any words to read on them. The pictures are supposed to be story enough on the pages without words. At first, I wasn't sure what to do. I wanted to keep my son's attention, but it's hard if the book doesn't have words on all the pages. After thinking about it, I decided to make up words on the pages that didn't have any. My son loved it, and didn't even know the difference! It was more fun for me too. Just a little imagination goes a long way!<br /><br />You can tell this is one of his favorite books by the condition that it is in. We read it so much that it's falling apart now and probably time to buy a new one!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this case about a month ago.  The case itself is really decent, it feels good to the touch, and although light, does offer good protection for my Kindle Fire.  An elastic band keeps the cover over the screen when not in use.<br /><br />As far as the stand, you fold the screen cover backwards and insert it into the groove on the back of the case.  It works well as long as it is on an even surface, but first you have to be sure it is actually all the way in there.  If you pick up the Kindle while you are using this, you need to reinsert it back into the grove in order for it to stand up.  This is slightly annoying to me, hence the 4 instead of 5 star review.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent case, and makes my Kindle Fire light rather than bulky.  It is worth purchasing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game for those of you that enjoy problem solvers. Its fun, entertaining, and challenging. it makes you think.
B00004SPVE|5.0|after watching this movie i have been wondering where the man of my dreams is, you know - the one who will have sex in a phone booth and isn't afraid of talking to a ghost elvis!<br /><br />in all seriousness, this movie has remained one of my favorites of all time!  this movie has set the bar for my expectation of women in peril.  did you see alabama handle that thug?  between her resourcefulness and her courage and bravery, i would say she is the strength of that particular twosome!  and clarence?  he's a dream!  not only is he handsome, he is a good guy who will always be there for his lady.  he fought and slayed her dragon.  what more could a girl ask for?<br /><br />if you haven't seen this movie, i would encourage you to try it.  i would also recommend boondock saints and pulp fiction.  and if you are looking for more, try kill bill 1 and 2.
B007SGM084|5.0|I do not consider myself a dedicated reader, however, this trilogy had me under its spell. I am currently re-reading the entire trilogy. This is a definate must read.
0307594165|5.0|It takes a great writer to be able to create such a moving novel in less than 150 words, and Toni Morrison certainly has done that.  The themes are powerful, and the characters are vividly portrayed.  What a masterpiece!
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Everyone seems to give Sera Gamble crap for the show's perceived \\"decline\\" once she took over as showrunner.  Gamble has been with 'Supernatural' from the beginning, and is responsible for writing some of the series' strongest episodes.  I agree that 'Supernatural' could have ended with the conclusion of its fifth season, but it didn't.  When shows age, they show signs of wear and tear.  As years go on, some seasons are weaker than others.  Look at 'Desperate Housewives,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' or any 'CSI' or 'Law and Order' show for the proof.  Blaming Sera Gamble is weak, and if Eric Kripke were still in charge people would be blaming him.  The show isn't as fresh because there's nothing fresh about it.  The actors and crew have been together for so long they're all family now.  Everyone is so overwhelmingly familiar with one another that the sense of newness and adventure seems to be gone.  I will say the show has lost the edge it once had but I still enjoy coming back week after week.<br /><br />I will say I was slightly disappointed with the season finale.  Am I the only one who thought it anti-climatic?  Also, I hope that Bobby is gone.  I love the character and the actor, but I hope the show does not fall prey to bringing him back just because he's a beloved recurring character.  Let him go.  His death and his ghost finally moving on should give the boys a renewed edge.  Bobby was one of my all-time favorite characters on this series, but nothing about the finale or the burning of the flask gave any poignancy to his death.  The show is usually better at handling the deaths of beloved recurring characters ... i.e. John Winchester, Ellen and Jo ...
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an amazing game. I have been wondering if I would he able to ever get it on my Kindle Fire. :) this is a relly fun game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I'm so happy it finally came out for kindle fire!<br /><br />You should get this amazing game!! :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm not much of an application gamer, but I really love this little game!  It's fun playing with the characters from the movies, and the detail is absolutely amazing. Update: after over a year building my village, obtaining all my favorite animals, achieving a stockpile of game tokens, and amassing a large fortune for future projects ... it all went bye-bye one morning. The game has had problems with updates lately, and I guess it was my turn.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Hounded does something that I have never seen before. It manages to take almost every manner of mythological, religious and folk character, and add them to a plot, and make it coherent. Now my Celtic Mythology is poor, due to its lack of prevalence in pop culture. A few Wikipedia searches later though, and you find out that the gods and lesser beings in this book have legitimate back-stories. The premise behind the world of \\"Hounded\\" is relatively simple. All the gods that are, or have been worshiped, (yes ALL of them) exist and exert their will in varying degrees upon the world in one way or another. In this fictional world, Thor is a big jerk, Coyote (Native American god of trickery) lurks in the desert, and the Virgin Mary is exceptionally benevolent. Add in a liberal mix of Faeries, Vampires and Werewolves, and you would think that this would disintegrate very quickly into a hodgepodge of religious mess. It doesn't. In fact, it works exceptionally well and all blends together rather seamlessly.<br /><br />Now this novel also manages to do something very different in taking the fantasy genre and placing it in present day. Lots of magic, sword wielding and alchemy rear their heads, but again, it is all woven into the fabric of the story so well that it is actually refreshing. Kevin Hearne didn't need to create an entirely new world with its own history. He just used present day Arizona for his backdrop.<br /><br />Our hero, Atticus O'Sullivan, is extremely likable and well developed. Told in first person, the story is able to give you a great insight into his personality and his personal growth and evolution, even though his life now spans several millennium. Supporting characters are very well developed and even though they may not act how you would expect (how can you predict the behavior of the Celtic god of Death?) each appearance helps build them for future installments. Atticus' dog Oberon is exceptionally funny and lends a great foil to the rest of the story.<br /><br />This may be the first of a running serial, but it doesn't end with an obvious open tale. Everything wraps up nicely as each individual volume should. That being said, I didn't know what to expect going into this book. From all descriptions, it was different than anything I had ever read. I was not disappointed in the least. Give this one a try if Fantasy is intriguing to you in the least. It will not disappoint!

B002MT3CIY|3.0|This time I'm really kicking myself for not paying greater attention to the reviews that were posted prior to purchasing this DVD. They are, for the most part, right on the mark.<br /><br />Sadly, this is virtually a video tape recording, particularly a rather worn VHS tape played on an equally worn player, that has been transferred to DVD. I'm not sure whether this video was ever released on LaserDisc, as was the \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" which I had at one time. But if it was, I hope that someone would take an interest in transferring it to DVD, so we could all enjoy the vastly improved video and sound quality of that format. (Incidentally, LaserDisc, which lasted only about a decade on the market, was as great a leap in video & sound quality from the standard VHS tape, as DVD was to LaserDisc.)<br /><br />However, in my humble opinion, Pink Floyd is THE most exceptionally skilled collection of outstanding aural-visual artists to have ever come into existence. I believe that even those who aren't as fond of progressive rock music, could appreciate the skill, coordination and steadfast pursuit of perfection that goes into their live performances. In addition, the \\"message\\" underlying their lyrics, that which is against War and those who would promote it, is well worth one's time in contemplation.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for those of us hardcore fans of Pink Floyd and David Gilmour, I'm confident this would be a nice addition to one's collection of \\"Floyd\\" material. Once I'd gotten over the disappointment (and other related \\"peripheral\\" emotions) of the poorer-than-expected quality, I decided to hang onto this one, at least until the performance has been re-released onto a higher quality format. (Did you get that, Mr. Gilmour, Sir?!)

B000NDI3SK|5.0|This extraordinary series, thirteen fifty-minute episodes, is one of television's greatest achievements; four decades after its completion, it has lost little of its luster.<br /><br />A mathematician whose professional journey included work on the Manhattan Project, later at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, as well as an editor and scholar of the works of William Blake, Dr. Jacob Bronowski was one of the last true Renaissance men.<br /><br />Presented here is a veritable sm&ouml;rgåsbord of human history cast against scientific advancements and technological innovations that take the viewer around the world, from the dawn of Man to the then-present of 1972. Along the way, Dr. Bronowski stops to examine some of humanity's highest achievements - and lowest depths of depravity. One outstanding quality of this remarkable series is that he speaks to the viewer directly and very personally through the lens of the camera; the book of the same name is a virtual transcript of his remarks.<br /><br />Not simply lectures (nor read from a script), these extemporaneous essays offer Bronowski's \\"personal view\\" on a wide range of human, scientific and technological history, presented in both a dramatic and memorable fashion. For example, the episodes are sprinkled with delightful (and often moving) anecdotes of various people, some of whom Bronowski knew and worked with - such as Leo Szilard (who first conceived the concept of sustained nuclear fission - even coining the term \\"chain reaction\\" - and who subsequently wrote the letter which Einstein signed that was sent to FDR, bringing about the Manhattan Project) and John von Neumann (one of the great mathematicians of the twentieth century and the \\"Father of Electronic Computing\\").<br /><br />Anyone with even a passing interest in the history of our species and its place amongst the stars, or of science in general, will be astonished, delighted, deeply moved and profoundly affected by \\"The Ascent of Man.\\" The production value is of the highest order throughout (and, now in its second DVD incarnation, the sound, which was always somewhat problematic, has been greatly improved, matching the often stunning visuals).<br /><br />The most powerful episode of the series is, without question, number eleven, \\"Knowledge or Certainty,\\" which begins with this two-sentence paragraph:<br /><br />\\"One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an exact picture of the material world.  One achievement of physics in the twentieth century has been to prove that that aim is unattainable.\\"<br /><br />Bronowski continues, a short time later:<br /><br />\\"There is no absolute knowledge.  And those who claim it, whether they are scientists or dogmatists, open the door to tragedy.  All knowledge is imperfect.  We have to treat it with humility.\\"  Truer words were never spoken -- then, or now.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation.<br /><br />(NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series will almost certainly enjoy both the seven-part BBC miniseries \\"Oppenheimer\\" (1980) and their production of Michael Frayen's play \\"Copenhagen\\" (2002), both available on DVD.)value is of the highest order throughout (and, now in its second DVD incarnation, the sound, which was always somewhat problematic, has been greatly improved, matching the often stunning visuals).<br /><br />The most powerful episode of the series is, without question, number eleven, \\"Knowledge or Certainty,\\" which begins with this two-sentence paragraph:<br /><br />\\"One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an exact picture of the material world.

0345803485|5.0|I loved this book.  Swept me away to an amazing place!  I recommend to anyone and everyone and all who have read it finish it quickly and love it just as much.  It's an amazingly sweet love story, and racy to boot!!  Loved it, reading the 2nd book now and love it just as much!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really love it but u have to shut the whole kindle down if u wanna stop playing it which makes this game horrible so I deleted it!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Although there isn't anything more I can say that hasn't literally been said a thousand times over; but this is how a good book is supposed to be!!  Loved it!  Two finger snaps and a wave!  Whatever you think the characters you've come to love or hate are supposed to do, or are supposed to happen to them, NONE of that happens!  I am so totally addicted to this series and I had never been a fan of this genre before.  I would recommend this series to anyone who can read or wants to.  Thank you Mr. Martin, for being the genius that you are!!  I would honestly have paid more for the Kindle edition of this novel, it was that good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm happy that they got temple run but what about tiny wings? dillo hills is really slow and doesn't have any achievements which is kinda boring.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|There are so many ways to write a GOOD movie about the Tuskegee airmen.  How on earth did this dreadful stuff get put on film?  In my opinion it's disrespectful. Lucas does beat all for coming out with horrifying cheese.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I purchased Catching Fire after seeing the first of the three installments of the story in the theater.  It was so good that I spent almost non-stop time with my Kindle until I finished reading the whole thing.  It was excellent.  I proceeded to purchase the 3rd book of the series almost immediately, and finished that one quickly as well.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a great book for all those who are on a journey of self discovery. Easy to read, but rich in content, it contains some great insights into life and the journey we are on.  It's the sort of book that has 'layers' and can apply to a wide variety of people at different stages in life.  This book should be part of every good book collection and read numerous times in a lifetime.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Like everyone I saw this on the bestsellers list and had to have it, but then after seeing the reviews were either hit or miss, I thought against it. I ended up borrowing my friends copy of this book and I'm glad I did, not that it was horrible, just wouldn't have wanted to spend $10 on it. At first I thought the book was OK (like so many before me). I did enjoy Ana and Christian's witty dialogue; the emails between them were a good part of the novel.<br /><br />Now the bad, I found parts of this book to be VERY redundant, things got old really quickly. I found myself skimming over certain parts or just skipping pages at a time. The characters are hollow and unrealistic. There is basically no plot, just lots of \\"AMAZING\\" sex.<br /><br />Would I read it again or recommend it? NO
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Video was delivered fast & was in mint shape will shop here again!!!! I hope everybody finds this review very useful in their shopping for video's online
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Treat yourself and Buy Driving Towards The Daylight by Joe Bonamassa. This Man is a True Master with a guitar. Too many times I have heard my friends say there is no one new and exciting making music. You just have not heard about Joe Bonamassa. Joe Bonamassa has been around for many years making the most amassing blues / rock music. Driving Towards The Daylight would be the BEST father day present you can get for your Dad. There is NO Better guitarist playing today!!!!![[ASIN:B007R3AZNK Driving Towards The Daylight]]
0345803485|1.0|This was the worst book I have ever finished. Period. I took me a week to force myself through the first two chapters. I did not care about any of the characters and quite frankly found them terribly annoying. Crap. The \\"good parts\\" we not even that good. I don't know what people are thinking.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|loved this movie.  If you love horses this movie is for you.  It has some very sad moments in it.  I hope no horses got injured during this movie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's simple to use and you can revise all your annotation. the bad is little big on Mb. I like easy and simple. could be better if you can adjust the size of numbers. eliminating the use of glasses
B007VGXS8M|3.0|Ok game, that works fine on my Kfire. But I don't think it's worth 99&cent;. There are better games out there that are free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little games to pass time.  Would be nice to have instructions for the games though.  Overall definitely worth the download.
B0086700CM|5.0|So glad I read the reviews and downloaded this app. This game is an high paced,  fun and additive. And it's  free with no adds, couldn't be better.
B0086700CM|3.0|ive been waiting forever for temple run on kindle fire and finally its here!! the only thing is that its really slow and buggy. like when you swipe to turn it won't respond and you will just fall. its really annoying

0345525558|4.0|There have been rave reviews on Amazon for this book, and from reviewers I have come to trust, so I decided to give this debut novel a try. Set in the San Francisco area, this is the story of Victoria who is turning eighteen and being emancipated from the foster care system. It moves between current time where she is leaving the group home and moving out on her own and a period when she was about nine years old. In the portions of the story where she is younger, we find out about her history and the one time when she came close to being adopted.<br /><br />The story starts out slow but with a certain amount of tension to keep you reading --- you want to understand what the \\"event\\" is that kept her in the foster care system. It takes most of the novel to finally uncover the actions leading up to her being returned to the foster care system. Victoria has difficulty connecting with people but was exposed to the language of flowers when she was at this younger age and she uses flowers to convey her thoughts and feelings. The flowers and how important they are to her are a dominant theme in the book.<br /><br />Incredibly written, the narrative is outstanding. Most of the characters are deeply flawed which will cause some readers to take a dislike to the book. It can be very hard to find someone to root for most of the time. The story was often depressing and hopeless with Victoria having a hard life and then messing up her one chance at stability.<br /><br />Bottom line: Beautifully written, nice pacing with slowly building tension, but a storyline that was depressing enough that I didn't fall in love with the book. A potential 5-star due to quality but rates a 4-star since I found myself less than enamored with the storyline.
B0086700CM|1.0|Love the game and I am very happy that they made it for andriod happy face here happy face here
0316143472|4.0|Engulfed in Flames is my first Sedaris book. It will not be my last.  I very seldom laugh out loud while reading a book.  This one made me do just that.  Thanks Sedaris from a 60 year old woman that is very hard to make laugh. Afer reading, I tried listening to him speak.  Let's say after hearing his voice, I prefer the written word.
0345803485|1.0|I am on chapter 6 of this book, and its getting more and more painful to read. The writing is terrible, which makes it even worse. I finally read the first sex scene, and honestly, that was it? Are mommys not getting their \\"somethin'-somethin'\\" at night? So much so that this has been dubbed \\"mommy porn\\" because these husbands are not doing their job as lovers in bed?<br /><br />Its sad to see that the sex toy industry has sky rocketed over 300% in sales because of this book. Honestly, really? Thats pretty pathetic. Huge reflection of our society right here. No wonder divorce rates are at 50%!! Men, do your jobs a lovers in bed, and maybe your wife or gf wont cheat, or read this crap in bed and touch themselves to Christian Grey while your sleeping!<br /><br />I read this crap to see what the hell is all the hype, and honestly to read through the sex scenes. Maybe something I could possibly learn a thing or two, but nope! Im. Fine where I'm at, thank you! Dont need to force my husband into the masses and buy sex toys to spice up our bedroom!!<br /><br />Back to the book: poor writing, poor character development, Ana is an idiot and lets be honest, Christian is an a-hole. This is an over glamourized abusive relationship. Good God, American females are so stupid!! Our society is stupid for making this a best seller!<br /><br />Curious to see how this would be made into movie. I wont bother reading this book however. Waste of 15 bux!
0345803485|5.0|A mindless easy, hot and steamy read. What a great break from reality. The story is addictive so you have to get all 3 books
0525478817|5.0|I cannot even begin to explain the pure awesomeness of this book. It tore my heart into itty bitty bits, but I enjoyed the process of reading it more then I like playing ukulele (and that's really saying something). I like this book more then I like Doctor Who. And I REALLY REALLY REALLY like Doctor Who. So yes, it's technically a book about cancer. But it's also a book about infinity, a book about infinitely many things. In fact that's one of the biggest infinities I know about. Linguistically, the narrative is amazing. Easy to follow and with more and more depth every time you read it, bursting with capital M Moments.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|great book!  picked up the four book series after watching the first season on HBO.  The characters have more adventures in the book than they do in the television series!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|With all the hype surrounding Nolan's final Batman Film, it pales in compairson with The Avengers. The Chenistry between the cast and the way that each cahacter was woven together was outstanding! Mark Ruffalo as Banner/Hulk added to the pwer of this film, because his Hulk was raw, yet you could laugh with him as he side punches a teammate. This is a Film that when it is released on BLu-Ray, I'm reserving it ASAP!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|great book!  picked up the four book series after watching the first season on HBO.  The characters have more adventures in the book than they do in the television series!
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was a transformative figure who changed the way we live.  I am writing this on my MacBook with my IPad and I phone nearby.  I am not unique.  I doubt there will ever be another serious biography of Steve Jobs and even in this all of Jobs strengths were manifested.  The book was easy to use, artfully presented by an artist in his field.  Therefore, Steve Jobs the book was like Steve Jobs the creator.<br /><br />I worked most of my career in a large corporation. REading about Apple helped me put my experiences in a better light.  I hope this becomes a standard business school texts because among its other virtues it is the best management text I have ever read.  The approach will not work for everyone but it sets a model that can be the basis for an approach.  Hopefully a little less nasty and less crying but worth considering.

078322799X|5.0|Wonderful casting and witty scenes put a new twist on an old idea. Michael J. Fox is, as always, an outstanding performer in this story of ghosts and psychic phenomenon as a young man who sees them and tries to help. While he's attempting to make sense of a string of murders, the details of which only he seems privy to, the Ghostly quartet that provides humor to Michael's straight man act are superb at showing up during the most inopportune times.<br /><br />A tightly woven story, filled with mishap and mayhem leaves the viewer in a quandary as to whether to laugh, cry or run in terror! Fox lends his talent to this one-of-a-kind comedy of errors with serious undertones, and its old fashioned who-dun-it storyline. It carries the viewer on a suspense-filled journey of ghostly details and mystery, with laughter scattered liberally throughout the script. A truly well done film for everyone. Young children may find the storyline disturbing, but teens and those on into adulthood will enjoy and appreciate this little gem.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I don't have a whole lot more to add about \\"Thor\\" that the other positive reviewers haven't already stated so eloquently.  However, my take on this breathtaking movie is how operatic it is, both in content and mood.  Specifically, for those familiar with Richard Wagner's \\"Der Ring Des Nibelungen\\", I believe that \\"Thor\\" pays homage to Wagner's renown tetralogy, especially the first of the four operas, \\"Das Rhinegold\\".<br />The Ring Cycle, as it's also known, is based largely on Nordic and to some extent, Teutonic legends, mythology, and folklore.  For example, \\"The Rainbow Bridge\\" in \\"Thor\\" is highlighted at the end of \\"Rhinegold\\".  The German counterpart to Thor has a minor role in \\"Rhinegold\\".  And of course tumultuous family strife plays out prominently in both \\"Thor\\" and The Ring Cycle.  Details differ of course, as they are bound to do in works of art separated by over 100 years.  But key themes and motifs parallel one another in both of these art forms.  The similarities to me are quite striking, even though one is a movie and the other an opera.  I find both immensely enjoyable and emotionally stirring in parts.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is great but once you've played it for a while it crashes and u cant play it. (kindle fire)

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is one of my favorite board games! Great for 3-4 players (or more if you buy expansions), I've only played with all aged adults, not sure how kids would like it but it is simple enough to understand. Lots of fun for a game night, especially for people who don't want a ridiculously complex game, but who want something more fun than just simple monopoly or trivia or something. I've given this game as a gift before too. I highly recommend!
B002RI90WM|2.0|I gave this a whirl because of the great reviews. But it really was so sugary sweet and heart tuggingly sad in places that I lost the will to finish it. I ploughed through to the end simply because I felt I must be missing something. But no, even the epilogue made me cringe. I guess if you can believe in a philosophising dog and you like a story like &#34;Love story&#34; then you will really enjoy this. It certainly is not for me and I gave it 2 only becuse it is well enough written. I would have even stretched to more if there had been less rambling on the glories of racing and the meaning of life. I am sorry if this offends some. To be fair, I do read sentimental rubbish ( regency romances) sometimes and enjoy them. But there is something about this type of book that just sets my teeth on edge. I could compare it to another I read that I hated but others loved - the old mill house I think it was called. They both belong to a class of book I find difficult to like.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love playing this game and my littlest ones enjoy watching me play. The graphics are great and its something fun to do to pass the time during those boring moments.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a VERY nice implementation of a plain 'desk calculator'. Besides the 4 basic operations it comes with the 'percent' key, the traditional calculator memory keys, and a backspace function, all on a nice brushed metal finish that looks good on the Kindle Fire screen.<br /><br />I am not sure what the 'plus' in the product's name stands for... it could be the backspace or maybe it displaying the last operation right underneath the answer but that's not important. It's a great, plain-vanilla calculator that works well and looks good on the Fire. And, yes, like many 'free' products it does come with ads but they are on a small, narrow band at the top of the screen and easy to ignore.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|nevosoft is a great developer. good games at a reasonable cost. my only wish would be for a somme in and out feature. I've. been really satisfied with all my purchases. for the reviewer who wanted to turn off the timer look under options.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Two ultimate indicators of a good book: 1) it's so engrossing that you get annoyed if you have to put it down to do other things and 2) it leaves you thinking about it and mulling it over days and weeks after you finish.  \\"Perks\\" is one of those books.  It's one of the few books I wanted to re-read immediately after finishing it.  Chbosky has written a book that is simultaneously entertaining, hilarious, poignant and emotional.  It's a YA novel, but it really is effective whether you're in high school now or graduated long ago, as there's something for everyone to recognize here.<br /><br />The unusual ploy of having the story told through a series of letters from the main character, Charlie, to an anonymous person about his experiences of trying to fit in and experimenting during high school turns out to be a highly effective technique.  Part of whether one enjoys this book will depend on whether you can identify with being or having been a \\"wallflower\\" and all that it entails - the loneliness, the desire to fit in, the valuing of a few friends, being hopelessly in love and not knowing what to do about it.  Despite his many flaws and problems, Charlie is an extremely lovable character that you come to care about - and you will root for him, experience his extreme joys when things go well (feeling infinite) and his crushing devastation when they don't.  Although he doesn't always seem to realize it, Charlie has in some of the other wonderful characters all the things he needs to turn his life around: a special teacher that realizes his potential; an older best friend, Patrick; and Sam, a kind, beautiful girl that looks out for him, mentors him and becomes the intense object of his desire.  They're not perfect people either, but they're genuinely there for him.<br /><br />If you can identify in any way with the characters, and you will, \\"Perks\\" will put you through the emotional wringer.  It leaves you wanting to know more about their futures together.  While its themes are not new, \\"Perks\\" is a great read, something that will leave you a little different than when you started.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! Temple Run is now avaliable for Kindle Fire! Something I've been waiting for a good couple months. Cannot wait to test it out.

0618918248|3.0|I've actually read this book twice and it's definitely interesting! No doubt about that. Worth a read for sure. Remember to read it critically and don't accept everything Dawkins writes. I agree with most of it but there's a couple of aspects (actually several) of the book that I find too extreme.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally temple run came out I got it on opossum but not on kindle this game is the best game ever and you need to get it

B001PB3RU8|1.0|I listen to all my music on iTunes and every CD I buy is ripped losslessly to iTunes. This product is not a \\"Compact Disc\\" - it is a Windows-only readable audio disc (that tricks CD players into playing it) in a non-standard format with copy protection features that prevent it from being ripped to iTunes. As such it is incorrectly labeled on Amazon as an \\"Audio CD\\" because it does not meet the \\"Red Book\\" standard for Compact Discs. I actually believe in paying for my music - so I bought this disc, and now it's useless - I no longer have any means of listening to music on disc, all my listening is geared to digital audio from my server or from mobile devices.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app.  I picked it up for about a dollar and use it to monitor my 2 servers.  great for checking up on them from my phone and doing remote tasks, but also works from other desktops for easy remote access as well.  I love it.
B0086700CM|4.0|wow.this game is good and addicting.but it was such a late release.I hope there will be more games such as minecraft pocket edition or real racing 2 or nfs hot pursuit or even jetpack joyride.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Awesome first book in a new series. Fans of Percy jackson should definatly read it. So well written that I found myself arguing with the characters themselves, not the author
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Product was shipped in brand new condition, as promised. I bought it as a gift for someone because it's one of their favorite movies. I'm happy because it looks like I bought it at the store. They should be content.
0307959856|1.0|I was SO excited about this book.  I've read some PD James books that I really liked, and I'm a sucker for P&P 'homages'.  My reaction upon finally reading it:  Wow, this was bad.  Like really, really bad.  Plotting was slow and boring where it wasn't completely non-existant.  Characters were wooden.  They could have killed off everyone and it would have been less painful.  This was a a truly dull and pointless waste of ever more precious reading time.  Definitely the worst read of the month and very likely a top 5 for worst of the year.  If you really can't resist reading it, I strongly suggest you check it out from the library so you don't feel ripped off in terms of money as well.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|A wonderful movie that boats a magnifient remastering. I recommend it to all movie fans. It's a great experience, a kind of magic !

0439023513|3.0|I didn't fall in love with the first book like everyone else seemed to, but I really liked Peeta and wanted to see how things played out for him. The book didn't really give me that sense of knowing. I felt let down by the ending. For all I had to get through to get to the ending, it was pathetic. This book felt like the writer wasn't sure what story she wanted to tell and was just writing because she wasn't sure how to end it. The book dragged along and then just kind of fell of an edge abruptly. I wasn't expecting happily ever after but this was just not good.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very addictive game!! Perfect time killer, very logical game that keeps me engaged and entertained. Highly recommended and worth the cost
B0086700CM|4.0|Omg this game is of the hook. I just started playing the game and its totally awesome. I recommend all people of all ages to play the game.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Okay, so maybe this Disney version wasn't perfect.  Maybe Big Red farted when in reality he might have snorted.  Does it matter?  I was 13 years old and watched Secretariat make his legendary run on the Belmont Stakes.  I will never forget how me and my sisters screamed and cried as he won by 31 lengths. The people who insulted the Disney version probably never saw Big Red run the Belmont in the first place.  This movie is wonderful, for those of us who saw him make his amazing run.  If you missed it, cause you were too young or too  stupid to watch, please don't diss the movie which is very good.  Granted, I'd rather watch the YouTube where Chick Anderson calls the race, but movie or reality, Big Red kicked ass.  If you disagree, you need a serious reality check.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|As stated many times I am an electric blues fanatic and pride myself in exploring and enjoying the few modern electric blues centered artists... as well as going back in time... all the way to Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf... and coming back to the future with loving interludes along the way with Otis Rush... T-Bone Walker... The Butterfield Blues Band... Luther Allison... the great Albert King... Stevie Ray Vaughan... and the ageless Buddy Guy... and everything in between. And the beauty of Joe Bonamassa between the \\"notes\\" and his songs... is his knowledge and endearment of all the commercially unrewarded bluesman that lit and carried the original torch. This includes dedicating his free time to speaking to school children about the blues. Now I admit I was spoiled by Joe's modern classic \\"BLUES DELUXE\\" ... and I constantly made it abundantly clear that I was disappointed and yearning for more electric blues from him as he released CD after CD. Though creatively successful, the many CD's in between were nothing to be scoffed at... and his most recent (prior to this) CD with Beth Hart was absolutely beautiful (I gave it a 5-star-review)... it still left me yearning for a bigger concentration of electric-blues. Well this foot-stomping-electric-blues-rock-ballad-release should make anyone who loves Joe's work... no matter which of these previously mentioned categories are their favorite... more than happy. They should be near ecstatic... I know I am.<br /><br />For sheer foot stomping... string bending... electric blues... beautifully mixed with some songs that might be just a micrometer away from blues... into the rock category... each songs brilliance... makes it impossible to complain. As Abe Lincoln once said: \\"YOU CAN PLEASE SOME OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME... AND ALL THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME... BUT YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL OF THE PEOPLE... ALL OF THE TIME!\\" Well, I think Joe has pleased all of the people who love all the different types of his music with one CD.<br /><br />Front and center on stage with this CD... Joe's voice has never been highlighted better. From the sheer beauty of his voice... to the unadulterated power... to not only hitting the high notes... but the ability to growl with the visceral intensity that is the uninhibited soulful power and yearning of the blues... his virtuoso guitar work ranges from heavy string bending (ala \\"SRV\\" and Albert King)... to making his strings sing like it was replacing the lead violinist in the Boston Symphony. If you're able to catch the lyrics (which weren't provided in the liner notes)... for true electric-blues lovers he shares an almost \\"insiders\\" joke... when in \\"DISLOCATED BOY\\"... he states that he \\"shares a birthday with Robert Johnson\\"... which is absolutely true... and he also shares it with my dear departed Mother and \\"Give-Em-Hell-Harry-Truman\\".... *MAY 8TH*!<br /><br />A beautiful tribute to the legendary Howlin' Wolf is not only the cover by Joe of Howlin' Wolf's song \\"WHO'S BEEN TALKING\\"... but the preamble to the song... is Wolf's *ACTUAL VOICE* (unannounced or explained by Joe) as he gives instructions to his drummer as to what kind of beat he wants to accomplish... this to me...  is not only a unique and almost humorous remembrance... but a \\"tip-of-the-hat\\"... to one of the \\"authentic\\" pioneers of electric blues. Since I'm now... what would be considered... a veteran of the electric-blues (I guess that means old)... this dedication of time and valuable space by Joe... will forever cement in my heart that Joe truly is an electric-bluesman in his very soul!D.<br /><br />Front and center on stage with this CD...

B007NESBK2|5.0|I saw Sade live last summer in San Jose, and my feet were off the ground for three days!<br /><br />So, I had to get her \\"Bring Me Home\\" Live 2011 in Blu-Ray.  When I saw her live my seat was pretty far back, but with this video you have a front row seat.<br /><br />The amazing qualities that emerge in this DVD are the excellent production work in staging effects.  It is more theater or a movie than a music concert.  Sade sings better than her previous concerts.  Is it me, or does she even look better than her previous concerts? How is this possible??  She synchronizes her dance movements perfectly with each song.  All the hits, combined with her new material, make this a must for people who appreciate this immense talent. There is an awesome version of \\"Skin\\" that really rocks, showcasing the guitars. Technology has improved so much since the 2005 \\"Lovers Live\\" DVD..This is another level entirely-- it just doesn't get better than this Blu-Ray concert video!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Something different and fun. Recommend for kid's and adults . I was looking for something to do in spare time I found it in this game.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have quite enjoyed this game even in the short time I've had it. I don't often rate apps, even those promising in game cash for a five star rating, but this one is deserving of one. Great logic puzzle game!!
0345803485|4.0|Yes, we all know good literature.  So I'm not at all sure why you thought that this book could be defined this way.  Instead, I enjoyed it as junk food reading.  I've been on a diet and trying to lose that 10 pounds from winter.  This substituted for chocolate cake, warm chocolate chip cookies, chips in bed and delicious Wisconsin ice cream [[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]].  Other women know what I mean!  So, what could be wrong with that?  It's good to know this book for what it is and then enjoy it as a cheat on your diet or work, work, work, motherhood, stress, and marital petty arguments.  So there.  Read it and know it's a low calorie coffee break escape.
B00715SUI6|5.0|The reason I love these movies is for the suspense.  They're not filled with blood, gore, torture.  It's just good suspensful writing. I like the casting too, very believable acting and actors.

B007MAETA8|3.0|Impressions of the new John Mayer record...<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a bit of a lackluster performance. Not lyrically... his lyrics are often brilliant throughout the disc; they are anthemic to the 30/40-something generations and always seem to say a lot in a little space. Here and there, his lyrics seem a bit \\"inside\\" to me in that it seems like he's the only one who gets them, but that's allowed. Some of the lyrics, conceptually and thematically are identical across many songs (and other albums, might I add), but I guess that's what one expects from John.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the album is the concept. Prairie music or whatever he's calling it, it's really just a country/pop crossover so that he can market himself to the only pop crowd still buying music. I'm seeing a ton of it here in NYC. Many of my pop music friends are recording their music with a country twinge so that when they go to Nashville, they have a leg to stand on. Just looking at the picture of him with that idiotic 10-gallon hat on makes me cringe a bit. He's a rich, white kid from Fairfield, CT (more on this point in a second). It just doesn't fit into his image at all. He (and the record label) I'm sure are trying to market him and this album as iconic \\"American\\" music, but it falls flat and seems silly, especially in the wake of his recent, fairly racist, comments about fans and girls he'd date. As a note, I've been to 4 John Mayer concerts spread out over a period covering almost his entire career. Perhaps I'm missing something with this record, but it just lays there. It doesn't pop me in the face like his past records. Even \\"Battle Studies,\\" while mostly lacking in goodness still hit me harder than this record does.<br /><br />From a production standpoint, the album suffers from over-compression which creates the \\"wall-of-sound\\" problem and too much overall bass which is nearly impossible to get out, especially if using iPods/iPads, cell phones, laptops with/without earbuds. It's done in order to make the album louder than everything else in your library (or disc changer for those who still use them), but it severely destroys the sonic dynamics of the music. It's become a problem across much of recorded sound media in the last 5-10 years, but John always seems to do it more than everyone else. Unfortunately, it hides that which makes a John Mayer record good; layers of great guitar work and arrangement. Oh well. Anyhow, the tracks are, in true John Mayer fashion, hook-centric, though, and his guitar work is always extremely tasteful.<br /><br />Anyhow, a song-by-song breakdown looks like this for me:<br /><br />Queen of California -<br />Almost a direct James Tayor riff rip-off all the way through. Clearly the song meant to be the hit, here, but hardly original. The only things \\"John Mayer\\" about it are the outro guitar riffs (which I like quite a bit).<br /><br />Age of Worry -<br />This track may be my overall favorite. It sounds like John and is probably where the thematic aim of the record was headed in the beginning. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that this was the first song he wrote for the record which gave him the idea for the concept.<br /><br />Shadow Days -<br />This song bothers me the most, lyrically... \\"Hard times have helped me see, had a tough time, got a rough start?\\"... really? No you haven't, John. You were born into a fairly wealthy Connecticut family, you went to an expensive private college for music, never had any hard-knocks coming up in the industry, barely even had to play the club scene before being instantly signed to a major record deal, had hit songs and multi-platinum records every time out, have been able to date some of the most beautiful women on the planet and treated them like disposable products and are a multi-millionaire. If you have any problems at all, Johnny-boy, you've created them with your own childish ways and big mouth. That hardly makes me sympathize with you, buddy.<br /><br />Speak for me -<br />This song is just boring and the lyrics just make no sense no matter how I look at them. I have no idea what he's trying to say, here. \\"The cover of a rolling stone ain't the cover of a 'Rolling Stone'\\".... \\"I'm not mad about it, and I'm not mad about it, I'm not that mad a 'bout it, and I'm not mad about it\\"... Dude... Huh? It's just lazy lyric writing. If these lyrics mean anything to him, he's the only one who gets it. This song is just filler and nothing more. I'm sure this is where fans will chime in and pretend they understand this nonsense, but, really, it is just bad writing.<br /><br />Something Like Olivia -<br />This song is brilliant. Bluesy, tastefully written and has good, accessible lyrics. It's catchy and reminds me on older Mayer stuff, but with a nice new twist. He paid attention to this one and it shows. If he wants to sell this album, this should be the release, but I fear it's too blues-based for the general crowd.<br /><br />Born and Raised -<br />This song's issues are summed up in my opening paragraphs. The song itself isn't bad, but, John... who are you fooling, here?<br /><br />If I Ever Get Around to Living -<br />The opening riff is a direct rip-off of something, but I can't place it, exactly (if you reconize it, please tell me... it has been killing me). He transforms this into a more John Mayer-esque riff, later on in the song, when he harmonizes it, though. This isn't a bad song, but there's not much that's memorable about it, either, other than the riff he ripped off and the extremely cool and catchy outro lyrics, \\"when you gonna wise up, boy.\\" This lyrical set should have been more at the forefront of the song... probably the chorus. A missed opportunity, there, in my opinion.<br /><br />Love is a Verb -<br />Pure pop-cheese, but a decent concept. Done tastefully and in the vein of \\"Daughters\\" or \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" but it offers nothing of real interest musically. It's just the 1, 3, 4, four-on-the-floormodel and a bit juvenile in the writing of it, but it works, somehow, in spite of its faults. It definitely appeals to the female crowd which has always been a large fan-base for him (and all singer/songwriters for that matter) and it's a good marketing ploy to reel them in, once again.<br /><br />Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967 -<br />The Botti jazz intro is amazing and I wished he had taken this further through the song. The verse melody is almost a secondary chorus which is brilliant and is what made John so intriguing and infectious on \\"Room for Squares\\" and \\"Continuum.\\" It's the thing that made him stand out from other writers and I'm glad to see he still has this in him. The chorus itself is very well done, as well. The topic will alienate many listeners, as it is an inside type thing, but I enjoy something I can dig into, get to know the narrator and really immerse myself in. He actually can tell an intriguing story and make me want to listen to it. This is the best writing on the record even though it may not be my favorite song, overall.<br /><br />Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey -<br />Just an okay song with a bit of lazy lyric writing (same concepts as at least a dozen other J.M. songs), but I get it and the chorus is cleverly done. It definitely speaks to having the blues in a modern way. It has some musically cool interchanges as well. I like this one, overall, but it is a bit of a yawn. Also, gratuitously bad use of harmonica and slide guitar doesn't a country-ish song (or album, for that matter) make. Thus, in this way, he falls short of even his own silly concept, here.<br /><br />A Face to Call Home -<br />Again, the same thematic arch of trying to figure himself out and allowing himself to love someone. The chorus is almost non-existent and is the epitome of lazy songwriting. This one is very much a filler song. There really isn't anything else worth saying about it.<br /><br />Born and Raised (Reprise) -<br />This version actually hits the mark of a prairie campfire song and I like it a lot. It would have been a really nice addition to a regular pop record as a way to differentiate one's self and really show a many-faceted side of songwriting (which I think is what John was actually attempting to do with this record, overall). He should have probably put this version in the track 6 slot and ditched the other one, altogether.<br /><br />Anyway, that's probably more than you wanted to read about the record, but I'm disappointed in it and hope that this isn't the future direction of Mr. Mayer.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|I worked around some of that developing tech and I can tell you a lot of the tech they shown in the movie is no where near this level. For example, the thing that goes in your eye only shows about 10 pixels. But, if you were to do something like this movie shows, it would require millions of pixels.<br />But, besides that the movie is great. I does have some slow moments in it and the story has been done millions of times, but it still interesting.<br /><br />Anyways, I rented this movie because Amazon gave me $2 as a promo thing, and this movie cost $1.99 to rent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the kindle version and looked forward to reading this book every night. I am hooked and will read anything this guy writes. He creates very believable characters and spins a good story.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's ok, but in the age of super-computers and tablets you tend to expect much more. Good job generally. 3*
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|A completely unrealistic movie about people jumping off mountains and fighting wild beasts (beasts that have very little resemblance to actual animals here on planet earth). Putting aside how unrealistic this film is (there's enough commentary out there about that) there still isn't even a real story here. Do the characters survive? More importantly, who cares?<br /><br />I'm surprised this movie gets as many stars as it does here. The absurdity of the film is a major let down. I didn't come in to this expecting an unrealistic alien action flick or something, I was looking for a survival nature film with a plot (and some action). I could forgive a little artistic license but this strays way too far from reality to be forgivable. Wolves don't attack people for fun (they attack for food and they seldom attack humans) and they don't attack prey alone just to \\"test\\" them. Also people get hypothermia in the conditions these characters were in (especially when they don't create shelters and jump in running rivers) and no one in their right mind is going to leap off a mountain in these conditions (or any conditions for that matter). The crash, coldness, desolation or fear aspects of this film were never properly explored. Even basic survival stuff like creating fires and finding food is skipped over. They actually continued hiking in the dead of night at one point which seemed absurd to me personally. Basically this movie is just \\"our plane crashed so um, let's go run around and fight wolves or something\\".<br /><br />The other major let-down in this movie is lack of plot or proper character development. We never really find out in any depth who these people are or what motivates them to survive. The two characters we do get some exploration on are apparently miserable people who have nothing to live for anyway. As the movie goes on you'll ask yourself: will these characters survive? Half way through I concluded that I don't care. I actually ended up rooting for the wolvestowards the end.

B00479SVBU|2.0|The Soundfly works really well and sounds a lot better than my old VR fm mp3 player.  There are just two things I would change.  First I would have made the unit not stick out so far from the lighter and second I wish it would just remember where you are without having to bookmark your place in a song.  These are not deal breakers as this little guy plays mp3s and wma files great.  Also you don't have to pull it out to turn it off, there's a button to power down and it will turn on and go to your book marked location the next time you turn on your ignition.<br /><br />Remote died after a few weeks.  I got tired of having to remember to bookmark as it will not remember where you were at without book marking.  Dropped it offf at Goodwill and went back to my old VR mp3 player as it is so much easier to use.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a perfect way to end the series. It kept me on my toes and after finishing the first one I couldn't wait to start on the other two. Even though after a while I felt like I was a little stuck reading the same thing over and over.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like listening to the talk shows and news on the radio. Many of the shows I like are located on the AM band and thus not available on some devices that only broadcast FM. And if you listening in the car you may drive out of range for good reception. TuneIn Radio to the rescue!<br /><br />This application is very well organized, easy to use, the sound is great, no buffering delays.  What I like best about the UI that is very easy to narrow down on your favorite show by just searching on the title, and then select from several choices.  You can store your favorites in the 'favorites' list for quick access.<br /><br />When the app comes up you get a list of choices:<br />- Local radio<br />- Recents<br />- Recommended<br />- Music<br />- News<br />- Sports<br />- Talk<br />- By location<br />- By language<br />- Podcasts<br /><br />If you select Talk shows you get further refinements:<br />- Business<br />- Comedy<br />- Conservative<br />- Entertainment<br />- Ideas<br />- News<br />- Progressive<br />- Public<br />- Religious<br />- Specialty Talk<br /><br />Then if you select, say, Public Radio then you get a list of NPR stations from all over USA so you have more choices of times for the specific program you like.<br /><br />This app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb 3.2. I had no technical problems and the app scales to my screen size very nicely.<br /><br />This is a terrific app: Huge amount of choices for radio shows, great reception, excellent interface. I highly recommend.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

0857520172|1.0|How this book has received so many 5* reviews is beyond me. I found it slow paced, repetitive, implausible, and predictable way before the end. In fact I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to something new. It certainly put to the test my resolve never to give up on a book. I think I can honestly say that it proved to be one of my worst reads for a long time and I have chosen some stinkers.

0345803485|2.0|I love the Amazon reviews about this book!! I received a Kindle for Mother's Day and downloaded the book to see what all the fuss was about. I really can't add anything to the wonderfully witty reviews from the writers that appear on these pages, but you all made my day. The reviews are SO spot on- particularly all the lip biting, blushing, flushing, \\"coming on command,\\" and eyebrow raising references. ROTFLOL! I think the author has said in interviews that she knows she's not written fine literature. That is precisely true and any readers to this series and the Twilight series must come with that information at the ready.<br /><br />I'm just intrigued that so many people are drawn to these works- and I wonder if they, like I, grew up reading Harlequins. Those books unfortunately served as guideposts for my future romantic liaisons. I kept waiting for the \\"rich man, with the horse, who took me captive, who burnished me with his powerful lips, hands and searing manhood who I had to get to fall in love with me and when he did we lived happily ever after!\\" Reading the \\"Fifty\\" books reminds me of my days of great innocence, when anti-feminist books about \\"love\\" and \\"romance\\"- always with the man dominant and the virginal woman submissive were sustenance for me.  The \\"Fifty\\" series are actually \\"Harlequin Romances on Steroids with Red Rooms and Non-Disclosure Agreements.\\"<br /><br />In reality, I also wonder how real people who are dominants and submissives actually feel about the subtext of this book - I'm sure not all Dominants have been burned by cigarettes- and cannot be touched, but I'm out of my league on those matters entirely.<br /><br />But I shall read all three works (am on book 2 now), though they seriously disgrace my fine Kindle and I blanch when my daughter asks if she can look at my Kindle? \\"No,\\" I say, \\"I've downloaded some adult nonsense and it is not for kids.\\"<br /><br />I persevere in reading these NOT because they are EROTICA, they are NOT- but theyARE HYSTERICAL and my spouse and I chuckle at the passages. Instead of providing erotic suggestions...they provide intimate moments of belly-aching laughter. And we're not the only ones. The author is laughing ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK! What I fervently hope is for a satire to be written- and some of you reviewers, I know, are quite capable. I remain, \\"Fifty Shades of Bored in Ithaca.\\"
145580570X|5.0|So many of us have learned to live with damage to our bodies and minds as we go through life.--generally with little real help from the medical community in recovering what we have lost.  The case studies in this book and its clear and matter of fact historical perspective on the lives of the people who are pioneers in this field, brain plasticity, make it an invaluable tool for those of us who are trying to recover what we have lost and live \\"normal\\" lives.  The stories of the recovery of people coping with challenges that seem final and insurmountable, are inspirational indeed, and the method of that recovery is simple and approachable in most cases.<br /><br />The book sends the clear message that we CAN overcome damage to our bodies, and minds.  Giving hope and inspiration to those with challenges, and information and insight that is invaluable to those around us who are trying to grasp what we are going through.<br /><br />I have shared this book with many people over the years, and will continue to do so.  Bravo!<br /><br />The audio book is well produced and makes the book available in a wonderful way.  I heartily recommend it also.
B005HEGW56|1.0|Came back to this series after a while.<br /><br />The series is just like Star Wars I.  Yeah, people kinda wanted to see what happened before.  But just like Star Wars I, this series has no soul.  It's not any one particular thing, so-so acting, so-so dialogue, so-so plot.  Can't really blame any one person.  Just the entire thing together.<br /><br />The doctor is the only \\"character\\" in this show.  Even his character is muted.  The other characters are basically one big \\"blah\\".  Everyone is in a dull boring uniform  which could have been changed dramatically considering the time difference.  Heck, since this wasn't really a military vessel, you didn't really need standardized uniforms.  And if it was, no \\"marines\\" departed with the commander when he left the ship?<br /><br />In a \\"prototype\\" ship everything is clean and neat.  The quarters have full amenities which seem like they were designed by 2 full time designers.  Anyone know what happened when the first astronaut had to take a dump?  The writer didn't really need to make the changes I recommended, but they needed to do something to give the ship a soul.<br /><br />Many writers said that the TV series didn't make it past season 4 because people were tired of Star Trek.  I believe the series didn't make it because it sucked.

B0007Y08IS|3.0|Okay, when a friend recommended that I find and watch this funny little movie, I was intrigued. I knew that some of the subject matter was \\"Over the top\\", and to be quite honest,it did deliver.. I was more surprised with the great quality of this spoof comedy/romance/borderline naughty/ cartoon/movie, than what I had expected. If you want to laugh, and DON'T have young impressional children watching with you, I think you'll find the Risque humor funny, if you're into that kinda thing.<br />I for one Laughed loudly.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|My wife lost our first copy of Bon Jovi's greatest hits, so I ordered a replacement on Amazon. The price was good and the delivery was quick. Good music by a great artist.
B002RVZV9K|2.0|A wasted opportunity might be a suitable answer to the above question.  I may be wrong, but I watched this (on HBO, thankfully) thinking that it was about guitarists playing guitars.  Being one myself, the prospect seemed riveting, even if I'm not a fan of the Edge or knew much about Jack White.  I foolishly thought they would be sharing tricks of the trade, swapping  riffs, jamming, talking about effects, and all things guitar.<br /><br />There is some of this... but only a smattering and nothing developed.  We do get however, the early histories of each musico (!), as if endless documentaries on the matter don't already abound.  We see the Edge going back to his old school (twice!), commenting on the IRA (how relevant is that?!), White recounts childhood stories in a Mexican neighborhood (yawn), and some more than familiar Page memories.  Then, there is much footage on each musician on his own  working at home, the studio(although hardly any on Page), and even in concert (old Zep reels).<br /><br />And the guys sitting around jamming???  Precious little.<br /><br />You see, I thought they would be together in a room playing away, LIKE THE TRAILER SHOWED.  This is but a fraction of the movie.  Do not get your hopes up.  The only ONE real jam is on Page's \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", and then the movie briefly worked for me.  (They do get together at the very end to sing The Band's \\"The Weight\\", but it's pretty forgettable.)<br /><br />My last quibble.  Jack White was virtually unknown to me & may remain so:  he is unimpressive as a guitarist and especially as a songwriter.  He seems more intent on trying to shed some cred on himself most of the time.  The Edge fared better though what he reveals barely scratched the surface on technique, style, habits, etc.  Page has the riffs so his contributions were interesting yet negligible, and again hardly anything on his playing.<br /><br />I watched this for the interaction among the three and the playing insights.  I got neither.  This is shallow material somewhat deceitfully advertized.

0143121006|2.0|We never learn anything of substance about China or the Chinese people from this book. Far too much time is spent on foreigners, and China ends up being nothing more than an exotic locale.<br /><br />I found the book padded and disorganized, especially in the second half. The author takes known facts about a criminal case and adds every rumor he can find. Strangely, none of these rumors ever involve the Communist Party. One wonders if the author residing in China has anything to do with this.<br /><br />I think the book would have worked better as fiction, but as a history it falls short.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What could be better than a movie about a bunch of your favorite Marvel movie heroes played by some of your favorite movie actors? Answer: Not much. It really doesn't get much better than this for fans that have been waiting for a film adaptation to FINALLY bring The Avengers together.<br /><br />Everything about The Avengers movie was excellent...from the cool, unique story that Writer Zak Penn and Director Joss Whedon came up with to the devoted way the cast portrayed the characters. Just brilliant.<br /><br />The Avengers kind of picks up where the Thor movie ended. Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye to stop Loki (Thor's brother) from opening a portal that would allow beings from an alternate universe in to destroy Earth.<br /><br />What ensues is an awesome looking, action-packed movie that's pretty long but goes by very quickly. Even the dialogue--especially scenes with Tony Stark--is as witty and entertaining as anything that I've heard in any movie that I've seen in recent history. The modern dynamic of the character personalities and how they interact with one another take this film to a new level for a superhero movie. Dramatic, emotional and sometimes spot on hilarious. Man, I am still cracking up over one of the scenes that featured The Hulk and Loki \\"having a discussion\\".<br /><br />We may take for granted that we live in a time when the CGI has practically been perfected in order to really make a spectacular movie. The CGI in The Avengers is masterful. It will be many, many years from now before we might ever giggle at the CGI in this movie the way we do at some of the older and even more current CGI efforts.<br /><br />In closing I will say that every fan of the individual movies made with the Avengers superheroes knows that there was always an after-credits scene that hinted at events to come, and The Avengers does not break that tradition. But wow...if the ambitious implication of the after-credits scene in The Avengers ever has a hope of coming to true fruition it may take an unprecedented unification of movie studios. Avengers comic book readers know that The Avengers team is not limited to the superheroes included in the movie. And unless I was seeing something that I really wasn't seeing in The Avengers after-credit scene, [[ASIN:0785156593 the story it implicated]] includes superheroes that are attached by rights to a few different movie studios. So I hope that Whedon didn't overpromise something that really can't be delivered. Anyway....<br /><br />There is no question here....Add The Avengers to your cart. It's a Blu Ray preorder for me. The Avengers is a classic superhero movie and will be on the top shelf in my collection.edits scene in The Avengers ever has a hope of coming to true fruition it may take an unprecedented unification of movie studios.

B007P3TMW2|2.0|Skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and equally well-edited by Claire Simpson, \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" is about as good as it can be considering you spend two hours with two of the more annoying characters in recent memory. The first is 11-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) whose father died in 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. The second is Oskar's mute companion (Max Von Sydow), who answers questions by writing on paper, or flashing a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" tattooed on his palms. Together, they make a twee duo on a Journey for Truth. A Journey that's not really triggered by Oskar's dad but seems to be because the source novel, by Jonathan Safran Foer, needs some reason for the verbally-advanced-but-possibly-autistic Oskar to think he must walk the streets of New York City in search of a person named \\"Black.\\" If the summary seems ridiculous, that's because the story is. Damn if it doesn't go down easier than it should, though. The book is unbearable. The movie isn't.<br /><br />Thomas Schell (Hanks) bonds best with persnickety  Oskar when he sends him on fictional quests in the city. Maps. Treasures. Clues. So, a year after Hanks' character dies, Oskar finds a key in a vase. And a name: \\"Black.\\" Oskar fancies it as his father's last mission for him, and each Saturday he walks New York City rattling a tambourine for company, because his personality leaves him too scared for public transportation. Soon, a \\"renter\\" from his grandmother's apartment (Von Sydow) joins Oskar. He's tall and sad, with a secret out there in plain view. Folks tend to receive Oskar and this mute better than you might think for New Yorkers, and there's a reason for that, although it strains credulity just like the rest of the story.<br /><br />The Foer novel - and screenplay by Eric Roth - piles on props, symbols and emotional subplots. How does Oskar's mom (Sandra Bullock) manage her son's weekly disappearances?  Can Oskar come to terms with his final one-sided conversation with his dadover an answering machine? Does that key open any lock? Will the \\"renter\\" face up to his failures? While Roth wisely cuts out a lot of Foer's horsecrap - grandma's memory of French-kissing her sister has been redacted, thank God - if you scrutinize the details too closely, you'll find several don't hold up, especially Oskar's fixation with one of the leaping bodies from the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Oskar, the character, doesn't hold up. His level of organization - not to mention his acute antenna for adult emotions - are far too developed for a kid his age and supposed social struggles. He lapses into bizarre patterns of speech, talking without contractions, as if reciting a collegiate term paper. In one scene, he makes a calculated choice regarding the answering machine that's cruel beyond his comprehension; in another, he's making scrap book beyond his years as recompense for the initial cruelty he never acknowledges. Horn's voice quavers, breaks, bleats. He keeps his eyes wide in every scene. He's a smart, serious kid - he won's Jeopardy's Kids Week competition, which indirectly led to this role -  and that works against him here.<br /><br />Von Sydow, an Academy Award nominee for this performance, does a lot with pauses, shuffles and facial expressions to make up for the lack of dialogue. It's excellent acting for a shaggy dog of a character. Hanks has a small role depicting what amounts to a saint. Bullock's out of her depth, but that's no sea change. Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are a weary, estranged couple, careful in their performances.<br /><br />Daldry (\\"The Hours\\" and \\"The Reader\\") took plenty of shots from critics for his \\"exploitative\\" direction; that's code, at least in this case, for effective work. Whereas the book dawdles and tumbles into nonsense, the movie clips along. Daldry's big on fast-moving montages and matching images from scene to scene, and if you're trying to convey connectivity, there are worse proclivities to have. I disagreewith his choice of title sequence and the movie's final image - which is a stark juxtaposition - but that's what the book gives him. It's bad there. It's bad here. In between is a polished, effective piece of emotional snookery, anchored by a lead character you'll love or hate. It doesn't work on me - Oskar's a bridge too far, and the novel is odious - but it will work on some.

But when we buy into the idea that accepting D/s relationship is a good thing because it makes the D happy, while the s is there even though she is hating it but \\"I love him\\"?<br /><br />For three books, and she never gets it?<br /><br />I have to admit I skipped much of the middle of the soul baring, anguished prose, and cheered when our heroin walked out at the end. But no way am I tempted to read any more.
B0086700CM|1.0|Scored 750,000..... Now what?  Change characters lol, Google play had it like 4 months ago... WHACK!!! amazon how about sonic cd for free?
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i love it, i just wish I could find neighbors without logging into face book. otherwise its a great game.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw something is a very addictive game and is great to play with friends! Although I choose to create a random game and i have been waiting for about 30 minutes and it is still &quot;searching&quot; for a game!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited forever for temple run to come to kindle fire and it is finally here ;) ya I am so happy
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so mad that this game wasn't on Kindle Fire! But then one day I was looking through the app store. I was seeing what was for free. There was temple run! I was soooooo excited. I love this game. It is so addicting. I played it for 4 hours straight!
0345803507|5.0|I just finished all three books in a 10 day period of time, and never have I been so deeply engaged as with this trilogy.  It had it all from very tender heartwrenching pasts to the hot lovemaking between Christian and Ana (as twisted as it was, it was still HOT), and then the twists to the story, OH MY!!!  Couldn't put the books down, want to go back and read them again!  Worth and loved every moment with reading these books.  I WANT MORE!!!!  Come on Ms. James, start writing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great! It makes reading the Bible exciting and easy! Has many different versions available! I def recommend it!
0439023513|5.0|This last book brings the story of Katniss, Peeta, Gale and the rest of the Tributes to a final conclusion.  The story was gripping, the action thrilling, and the book was hard to put down.  Yes..... The author did kill off some popular characters.  The story would not have seemed real if she didn't include some measure of loss as well.  But by the end of the book, most of my questions were answered, the story was brought to a very realistic conclusion, and the characters were allowed to heal and move on.  I really enjoyed the ending and the brief peak into their lives 20 years down the road.  The whole trilogy was so entertaining and I thought this was the perfect conclusion to a great story.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best finally it came out for kindle fire FREE it really sucked when they kept on teasing me with games like temple ruin and temple rum... but its out now better now than never YAYYY!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely love all the details Hugh puts into his books, the accurate descriptions and richness he bring to everything in the world.  The depth of the characters along with everything else lets you easily get lost and emersed in the world Howey has created in the Wool series.  The best series I have read in a long long time, if not ever.  So excited and can't hardly wait for a reread and the release of more books in this series. Keep up the good work!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally !!!!!!!!I get to play this all the other stupid ones that pop up are dumb thanks for finally getting it
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great on the kindle fire...holds my interest...I like that you can tap the cards and they fly into the right spot...hints are great too.
B002RXHW6S|3.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my 2 and 4yo. They loved it...played with it every day...get excited about it just talking about it. I enjoyed watching how much fun they have in it. I just wish it would last. It kept getting holes at the seems and I would patch them with a glue gun because that seemed to hold the best. Finally they popped it and now it's dead. They miss it and want another. It's not a bad price...I just wish it would last more than 2 months.
B001FB55H6|4.0|This film got mixed to positive reviews with many citing that its a scene for scene adaptation of the comic.Let me state that there is nothing wrong with paying tribute to said source material and this film is that.With that being said it is suggested that the viewer goes and picks up a copy of the graphic novel before watching as then the viewer would fully understand the impact this film has.Jackie Earle Haley plays Rorschach.Enough said.Hellfire and brimstone follows.Movie will also make you question how far would one go to sacrifice for the \\"greater good\\".Watchmen is straight out from the comic it came from and i suggest people buy the ultimate cut and watch the whole thing.That's what i am about to do.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great, fun, engagin, easy read... hope the movie lives up to it.  First book is definantly the best one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game, it is very fun and totally addicting! Better than most games like it... Its free so give it a try!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Unlike other hard cases doesn't show any wear marks, still gets dust accumulating between the phone and the case. Dropped my phone couple of times and no problems so far.<br />Edit 5/22/13<br />Slight discoloration of the case either due to oil or sunlight. No change in flexibility.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet since I agree with most of the previous reviews. I am always on the search for new authors in the Sci-Fi and Fantasy genre. I found a treasure when I came upon \\"Raven's Shadow.\\" I feel the same about this book as I did when I also found the book \\"Ender's Game\\" many years ago. I am sure that this book will be one of the few that I read over and over. I greatly anticipate Book Two and can only urge you to hurry! Thank you for the profound enjoyment and pleasure this book has brought to me. You may be assured that I will be recommending the book to all and any who will listen.  You have my deepest gratitude.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Perfect balance between the plot, the setting, and the characters.  Nothing took over, and all three together elevated this novel in a way I've rarely seen.  Even when the perspective switched between several different characters from one chapter to the next, each story line was enthralling on its own - usually when a book does that, only one is interesting and I end up flipping through the boring narratives.
B00003Q438|5.0|When I first got this movie in 2002 it was the 2000 Two Disc Special Edition release.  We had a 4x3 television at the time.  When we upgraded to surround sound it was awesome hearing it in 5.1.  We then get an up inverting DVD player and an HDTV. Played the movie with the distortion.  Fathers' day (US) 2 years ago I got my dad a BluRay Player and promptly hooked it up as a surprise.<br />Long story short, I played The Abyss on the BluRay player and the screwed up distortion was fixed.<br /><br />The issue is that  the disc, when it was burnt onto DVD by Twentieth Centry Fox, was only flagged as \\"anamorphic\\" , but the screen format had not been encoded  in either 4x3 nor 16x9.  This caused the distortion on widescreen TV sets on most up converting DVD players. Bluray players ignore the screen format flag if it isn't present and go with the Anamorphic flag alone as default rather than 4x3, thus solving the issue seen in The Abyss.

B005ZUR724|5.0|I don't know why the game only has 3 stars it feels exactly like WoW but on my kindle. which is awesome in my book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game for a year.This game is really fun. My high score is 600,678. Wow thats a lot right.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I purchased this headset when it was selling for $22, and so far I have been very happy with it. It has great sound quality, at least for gaming, but for everyday use (listening to music, watching vids), I have found that the quality is not as good as you might expect. Without a doubt, however, these headphones are fantastic. I would recommend them to others.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy that this came out on my kindle fire. I have been waiting so long for this game. Yay!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played it before on my friends but was not on kindle fire now it is and I am so happy that it is because this is the best game .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My daughter and I both love playing this game. Its a fun game for everyone to enjoy! Its very addictive as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is good for any age it is a fun addicting game i know a lot of people that this is the only game they play
B0083GPDBO|2.0|My husband usually makes fun of the fact that I'll only watch movies with big-name actors.... There's a reason. When they aren't willing to spring for the names, it's usually a crappy film. The actors were fine - the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one - but it's a low-budget flick with a seriously stupid story. I could barely make myself watch. Seriously boring... and sad. I'll be sticking to the big-name actors from here on out.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Super fun game. Great mind game. Takes brains to play. Tons of wasted time. Stoker I got it and can playing spare time.great concept
B000XRG9IW|5.0|I love this album! I think it's the best of their 3. I'm not sure why, except it is the one I got first , and listened to the most. I especially love the song \\"Angels\\".<br /><br />This band has a male and female singer, though most of the songs are written by the band's leader, Stephen Mcbean. Their first album, self titled, has a big variety in sound between songs, for instance a jazzy upbeat number, the next song something completely different etc.<br /><br /> This album \\"In the Future\\" has a slower, soft feel. It almost seems to have a pagan theme. Then their 3rd album \\"Wilderness Heart\\" seemed to get more acclaim, and hype. But I found it - complicated, almost a frenzy.<br /><br />Give it a listen, you won't be disappointed! I don't know if this band is still together, or if they will make any more albums. According to Wiki, the lead singer has other bands and projects going on.<br /><br />This is one of the few newer bands I've gotten into.
B00005JPKE|5.0|This story will definitely bring reflection and challenge your beliefs if you grew up in the years after World War II where the common question among friends was, what did your dad do in the war? To us kids, the Germans were derisively called Krauts or Huns and the Japanese were Japs or Nips. It was a common frame of reference to look at your enemy as subhuman, as fanatical madmen that should be exterminated. Such thinking is essential to the fighting man who must kill and still be able to redeem his ego from the psychosis of guilt and nightmares.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood presents something very much absent from war movies past, the humanization of our former enemies. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" brings the Japanese perspective of the lead-up to the invasion of that island and the invasion. It centers around three characters, Ken Watanabe portrays Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commanding general of the island, Tsuyoshi Ihara plays a Japanese officer who was a gold medalist as an Olympic equestrian, and Kazunari Ninomiya who is Private Saigo, the most pathetic soldier and sympathetic character of all three, a young father-to-be who answers the knock on the door and is told \\"Congratulations, you have been selected for the army,\\" in a similar manner as Americans received their draft summons with the telegram that began with \\"Greetings!\\" His wife is chastised for crying at the news, as she is told it is a great honor to be chosen to die for his country. In one of the more poignant scenes, he tells his child in the womb that he is the daddy and promises to return home and see the child grow up.<br /><br />The Japanese commander is an egalitarian leader who does not share the fanaticism of some of his officers. He doesn't believe in ritual suicide or senseless charges. His letters home, from Iwo Jima tell his story and we see flashbacks of his time in the United States where he learned the language and made bonds of friendship. His closest friend is the officer and medalist who shares the same view of war and what constitute honor.<br /><br />The plot is the deprivation that Japanese suffered leading up the invasion, the endless preparation that created 11 miles of tunnels on Mt. Suribachi with ever dwindling provisions and replenishment and reinforcement that would never arrive. Soldiers question their military and cultural traditions that challenge them to die, when all they want to do is live and return to their homes and loved ones. Their turmoil is constant and we see it from the general to the lowest private. It's the turmoil of duty vs. the will to live.<br /><br />The story ends with the a soldier burying the letters of his commander so they will not be found. The story begins with Japanese anthropologists unearthing the letters.<br /><br />The splendor of this movie is its simplicity. It shows a minimum of color to reflect the deprivations and despair of the defenders.  The music is also muted, never overpowering adding its subtle sounds to a powerful script and images. The acting is superb and thankfully, the Japanese sound Japanese.  Clint Eastwood proves once again that he is a director to be taken seriously as the viewer cannot help but feel empathy for those who were once our most brutal foe. Eastwood also brings a strong message that in the brutality of war, soldiers of any uniform do not fight for their country, or their flag, or emperor. They fight for their closest comrades, their families and themselves. They fight to stay alive and stay whole physically and emotionally. On the island of Iwo Jima, many on both sides would never find either.<br /><br />It is a forgotten honor to remember our veterans on Memorial Day, men and women who have given their lives or their souls for their society. This time I will also think about those I never would have included before, someone like General Kuribayashi, Olympic champion Baron Nishi, and Private Saigo.<br /><br />Watch this film, and maybe you will understand why.<br /><br />For veterans everywhere.><br />For veterans everywhere.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey self publishes.  The WOOL series is as good as any sci-fi I've ever read, and I've read some of the best in my 50 years.  His work is overdue to be picked up by a major publisher.  In the meantime, I'm off to start the Molly Fyde series.  If you love good sci-fi, or even just a well-written saga with fascinating characters, buy WOOL.  You won't be sorry.  Note to the writers of LOST:  &#60;THIS&#62; is how you follow through and create an interpretative ending to a great story!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I am trying to connect with friends for some of the goals but it doesn't work! I made an account with their program and tried to add the person that way but it didn't work. then I tried connecting using facebook but it wont let me log in! this means I will have to spend real money to complete things
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a product review, please read the title. My wife loves this game. This sentence is a space filler because I have nothing else to write.
B0086700CM|5.0|Doesnt require actual money and is just entertaining to use. Most games you have to wait for energy or purchase stuff with real money. Kudos to the creators for showing who's boss and not letting that get involved.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  I think this is the best app anyone could have! I have it on every device I can so I can always have it with me!
0307592731|5.0|Just finished reading Cheryl Strayed's \\"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail.\\"  What a great story!  Well written, interesting, touching, compelling.  It really makes one want to hike!  A true adventure.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Though, many artists of years past, as well as our contemporary musicians, have recorded albums that reflect the turbulence of the times, none conveyed it quite as beautifully as Marvin Gaye's incomparable WHAT'S GOING ON. The lyrics could've been written for our young soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan (to name a few), on \\"What's Going On (The Ecology)\\" as they were written for those affected by 1971 Vietnam senseless violence and mounting body counts, the pollution that ravaged the oceans and the screaming pain of insufferable global poverty. \\"Save The Children,\\" \\"Wholy Holy\\" and basically every cut are recorded like an intimate parable and musical reflection on the signs of the times. The trials, pain and horrors are documented through seamless percussion, instrumental accompaniment and flawless vocal by Marvin Gaye. The lyrics, alone, carry the weight of this ambitious record. We sense Gaye's urgency to convey (in his own words) God's message to all who listen to the album.<br /><br />In our age, today, where petty tabloid stories, Twitter feeds and publicity stunts set the pace for fame and the measure of success, WHAT'S GOING ON provides us with a sobering reminder of why we all were brought here, to begin with. To bring our own authentic message to the world, even at the cost of being emotional, heart wrenching and even rung out by the pain of revealing our true selves. Marvin Gaye makes that risk more than worth taking. He paves the way to make it possible. That is just how much the songs, here, influenced artists on a global level. It opened the flood gates for creativity, social empowerment and collective thought toward an authentic new canvass of colors.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have waited, waited, and waited for the longest of time. This game has finally came out for the kindle fire.

B0086700CM|5.0|I loved playing this on our family's ipad, but its a little bulky playing on a tablet. I am so happy it came out in droid so I can play it on my kindle! this is one of the most fun games known to man.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really enjoy this game.The idea and the gameplay and even the animstions are quite wonderful. Overall I only discovered one flaw and that would be the fact that you can only play this game for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. The reason why this happens is because you run out of energy and have to wait 3 minutes before doing 1 single simple task. If you really want to go on then you are able to purchase a small amount of energy for a rediculous amount of real money. Maybe a nice update would be to purchase energy with the gold money that you earn in game. If this update is really possible it would be absolutely amazing if it was made. Thank You.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|At the end, when Kate says to the American helicoper pilot \\"I knew you were human back at camp because of the ear-ring in your ear,\\" he hesitates momentarily, then touches his right ear and she says \\"It was in your other ear.\\" Then she promptly BBQ's him with the flame thrower. Great action, but, think about it . . . If the alien really duplicated human cells exactly, it would know which ear the ear ring was in, right? The other alien duplicates knew their human's exactly. An obvious but overlooked issue by the filmmakers, (but not by Mr. Franchise) and still an excellent movie - almost as good as Carpenter's earlier version. And a great one to see, then double up this prequel with Carpenter's film.
B0086700CM|5.0|Y cant I find it in the appstore when I type in temple run can someone please help me asap
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Thanks you so much for listening and buying, appreciated! Watch out for the next album. May God Bless you all! Love love love...

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was one of those books that I was really sad to see end. Being a teenager in the 80's, I remembered darn near every 80's reference in the book. And being a lifelong Rush fanatic, I loved the Rush references.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not a bad game. I have played better games but this game isnt that bad,  it would probly be better if it were more challenging

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I used to play it on my brothers ipod, but it was really small and hard to see. I am so glad that they have released T.R. on the Kindle Fire. Whoop hook! I am so happy!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a really well written and engaging work. I was almost immediately enthralled with the concept of a population living in an underground silo and the whole concept of \\"cleaning\\". Loved the character development, especially the Bernard character - what could have been a very flat character developed into a complex character. If there are more coming, I'll read 'em.
0553593714|5.0|the book was great looking foward to reading the next one in the series  A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553593714/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B002VHI8J0|4.0|After downloading the sample pages, I was hooked. Six slightly-interconnecting tales, ranging from the 1850s, to the distant future, with a range of disparate but interesting characters. Each story ends with the reader wanting more, before being enraptured by the next. I can't wait for the film version later this year.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is full of easy to understand information. What I love about the author is that he keeps it simple and that motivates me to want to use his knowledge to become \\"bigger, leaner, stronger\\". At first I wondered if the book is for everybody and after emailing the author and reading the book myself I say there is something for everyone in this book. I really like the easy access to other links thru the Internet. I learned so much. I have some younger, fitter, guy friends who want to borrow it..I told them they  have to get it themselves...lol...it's more than worth it.<br />Thanks again Michael for all the time and effort you have put into this book...I look forward to your guide for women and any updates you have to this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are lots of fun games but some are too hard to complete. that and it seems like you never get enough points for the games so you have to either download stuff you don't want or buy points.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited whenever Temple Run came. I have waited wlever since I've had my kindle, which was Christmastime.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm soo glad that this app is avalible on kindle fire, and for FREE!  It is a great fun game that is addicticting and still entertaining after months of use!

B0086700CM|5.0|GREAT GAME GLAD THEY FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.NOW I WONT BE THE ONLY 1 NOT PLAYING PLEASE AMAZON LET KEEP THE GAMES COMING...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the hype on this book I thought it would be fabulous, I've had friends who read/or are reading it now & raved about it.  I borrowed it & started it but I couldn't get through it.  It's crap & that's the nicest thing I can say about it.  Unbelievable, inane characters who seem to be written by a 16 yr old....jeez, after all the talk about this book I expected something that at least was written by an adult....but the author could care less about my opinion since she's laughing all the way to the bank.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE this game!! we have lots of apple products in our home and I was thrilled to finally be able to have it on the kindle fire :D
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a very nice logic puzzle game. The difficulty increases with each puzzle. Without a stylus it is sometimes difficult to accurately mark each block unless you zoom in. Otherwise it seems to be an enjoyable challenge.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not much for \\"smut\\" but this was an exception. The story line was pretty great and interesting. I could barely put the book down.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had never heard of this game before but I was pleasantly surprised with it. Fun game, my kids will love it too.
0451169514|5.0|\\"It\\" was a fantastic novel, with lucid prose and a multi-faceted and textured story-line.<br /><br />It was thoroughly rewarding. If I have any criticism it's piddling. For instance, there are one or two loose ends. Unanswered questions. Clearly, King meant to explain why all the main characters are successful in their careers, and why they're all childless. He went to great lengths to establish these commonalities between all of the principal players. But by the time he gets through the next thousand pages of prose, he seems to have forgotten those earlier plot points. Where we were promised an explanation, none is ever given. If I ever meet the author I'd love to ask him what he initially meant to give as an explanation . . . before he apparently forgot about it (distracted, as he was, by the million other narrative threads that he had to stay on top of.)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Who has read the Twilight Series? I can't believe this author has not been sued for PLAGIARISM! Lets look at the setting, character's and their story.  Twilight took place in and throughout Washington State, this story takes place around Washington State. Edward has cooper hair,rich, a love for classical music, moody, and is an accomplished music composer as well as pianist. So is Christian Grey(although he is not a composer) Bella, is brunette, with brown eyes, is socially awkward, clumsy and always falling, she can't not play sports, talks in her sleep. guess what so does Ana, she is brunette with blue eyes but everything else of Bella. 3 or 4 scenes in that book are straight from Twilight. 1. Edward warns Bella to stay away from him, because he is no good for her, but he say's he cannot there is something about Bella that intrigues him. He is trying to having a hard time staying away, then she says than don't. And so does Christian Grey to Ana Steel and Ana Steele says \\"than don't\\" 2. Bella mother is flighty and very child like in her thinking, so is Ana Steele's Mother, only she is on husband #4 when Bella's mother was only on husband #2. 3. Bella's mom can't make it to her graduation because her husband has had an accident and broken his leg, and guess who else's mother can't make it to her graduation because hubby has broken a leg, or foot? Edward in Bella is in a restaurant in Port Angeles and here is how the scene played out and remember Ana and Christian is at IHOP A female waitress cones over and is instantly smitten with Edward-Christian here is how the conversation goes (Edward & Bella)\\"You really shouldn't do that to people, it' hardly fair. \\"Do what\\" Dazzle them like that....\\" He tilted his head to one side, and his eyes were curious. \\" I dazzle people?\\"... \\"Do I dazzle you?\\" \\"Frequently\\", I admitted. (Ana & Christian)\\" You know it's really not fair\\" \\"what not fair?\\" \\"how you disarm people, women, me\\" \\"Do I disarm you?\\" I snort \\"All the time\\" Oh by theway Christian cocks his head to the side also. In Breaking Dawn, Edward buy Bella a car, guess who gets a car brought for her? yup you guessed it, Christian buys Ana a car. In the Twilight Series thy an a love for fast cars and have an fleet of them, no other than Christian Grey has a fleet of cars.

So if you like the Twilight series, You should love this book with a grown up erotic spin.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a great play. easy to understand. the more you play,  the more fun it is.  build families and habitats. build a whole village and name it. characters from the movie help you along (even Sid). have babies,  earn points.
0385523912|5.0|This book didn't allow me to do anything else but to continue until I finished. I was fascinated with the storytelling of the lives of the North Korean defectors from start to finish. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the lives of those where the government rules supreme and the people have to learn to adapt in a country that expects everything and offers nothing in return but lies and propaganda. READ THIS BOOK!!!!! :D
0811875040|1.0|I'm an experienced baker, and have baked professionally.  There are so many errors in this book that it's almost unusable.  Even the corrected version is still terribly flawed.  Many of the instructions are unclear, and the cakes seem over-leavened.  In the corrected version, some of the corrections don't match the corrections that were issued in the piece of paper sent out to help the first book.  The pictures are pretty, but there was obviously no editing.  I don't even feel comfortable selling the book at a yard sale, since I wouldn't want anyone else to have to suffer through it.  My only thought is that they tried to cut down large recipes, and didn't get it right?  Don't waste your time with this one, it's not worth trying to deal with the mistakes.
B005LAIGPU|3.0|The story is pretty predictable (classic superhero origin story), but it has some great moments on the way and is an excellent \\"found footage\\" movie.<br /><br />What bothers me is the BluRay.  When I buy a BluRay I expect great visuals AND some good extras.  What I got was a message that I needed to install \\"external memory\\" into my BluRay player.  Weird, but I figured if it needs a thumb drive there must be some cool stuff... there is 5 mins of near worthless \\"directors cut\\" footage, 1 deleted scene, 1 crappy extra for half finished pre-viz effects, 1 crappy video test, and... a message that you can buy the sound track.  Really?  Not a single commentary? only 1 deleted scene?  No interviews with the actors?  No featurette about how they came up with the idea or filming it or anything?  WHY did I need external memory for this?  I get more info on a DVD made a decade ago.  Disappointing.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is a really cool app you love it I don't no anyone that dose not like this app . its really cool get
0345803485|1.0|I started reading this book series because every one in my office was reading them. They talked about how great it was, how their husband's loved it and so on. After, reading the first chapter I had to force myself to read the book! The writing is terrible, the author jumps from scene to the next and I hated reading the F word every page! The author really should have found a new word to use. I can not see how this story saved marriages or helped them! If you like stalkers and men dominating women then sure read this book. The author really over did the sex scenes! Enough is enough, move on and give us some thing more. The world needs writers who are better than this to be published! I do not understand why this the #1 best seller any where! It needed to be stopped from being published!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote gives me the ability to share whatever,  whenever with all my devices.  work,  home, play and pleasure.  I can do it all and stay in synch
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Same tron i knew as a kid not much else to say, always a great movie though. The discs do play and work.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love the game... I just wishing it was easier to get acorns though.  I like how you can complete families and keep building constantly.
B005721Y7Y|2.0|I am dismayed to see how beloved this movie is (and mortified that most of the negative reviews focus mainly on the quality of the product, not on the film itself, though that of course is a legitimate thing to complain about).  I give it two stars and not one because it IS a well-made film.  The acting is strong and the director clearly had a vision.<br /><br />Now the bad news.  I find nothing, NOTHING profound or insightful or moving about this film. As another reviewer pointed out, is it really new news that the pursuit of the so-called American dream is shallow and unfulfilling?  Is it really a revelation that if you took a glimpse inside a seemingly perfect American household you'd find a lot of shocking things?  And the solution -- that we should take time to enjoy life and its little moments of beauty ... really?<br /><br />[Note: the following contains some spoilers]<br /><br />Hollywood and the movie-viewing public love movies in which wealthy people are unhappy and can only find happiness by shunning their materialism.  This makes us all feel better:  people who aren't as wealthy as the family portrayed here (which is most of America and most of the movie-watching public) can feel good in knowing that it's OK that they struggle to make ends meet, because, hey, it's better than being rich!  It's the same fake-populist message moviemakers have been throwing at us for decades, and people eat it right up, somehow believing that the family in this movie is \\"just like us.\\"  I doubt that.<br /><br />What's more, again as another reviewer pointed out, this movie should have been titled \\"American White Wealthy Straight Male Fantasy.\\"  This is one of the most misogynistic movies I've seen in years.  Annette Benning should have won the Oscar just for being a good sport in allowing her character to be portrayed in a spectacularly unflattering way.  The ambitious middle-aged career woman is portrayed as a monster, while her daughter is portrayed as more of a female ideal. Why? She falls in love with the boy next door, whom others think is creepy but of course she sees through that and allows him to watch and film her disrobe.  How good of her to enjoy being objectified.  When they agree to run away, she sweetly offers the small amount of money she's saved up.  He smiles protectively and says that's OK, he's made enough money selling drugs to take care of the both of them.  Enlightened viewers are supposed to go along with this and think it's cool and delightfully subversive that he's a drug dealer, and if you have a problem with that you're too morally upright because who is he harming?  Uh, how about all those people who are killed during drug trafficking?  But that's OK, because it's more important that these uptight, angst-ridden American suburbanites are able to cut loose and get high.<br /><br />And then there's the dreadful cliche of the \\"bad guy\\" of the film being a repressed homosexual.  The film wants to show how enlightened and tolerant it is by having a nice gay couple in it and having the Spacey character befriend them.  But including this stereotype subtley suggests that homosexuality is shameful and messes with your head.  I know this was unintentional, but if you're going to make a film that's Oscar-worthy, you can't be that sloppy.<br /><br />I could go on but have gone on too far already, especially since I know all this will fall on deaf ears.  Make a beautiful-looking movie, cast great actors, and make it seem like you're revealing something profound when you're really just slinging the same tired message that is so comforting to audiences -- badaboom badabing, award-winning success.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|you need to play this game.you will love this game.<br />they need to make more games like this one.the only problem is they trying to get u to buy everything in the shop
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is great that you can pick which games you want to play next according to your interest instead of having to unlock levels in a series order. Expect lots of fun challenges for all ages.
B007URCTOG|1.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  The acting was decent, although there was no chemistry between the lead characters.  I think it was the writing.<br /><br />*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most is the letdown as to why she:<br /><br />Completely cut off communication with her entire family.<br />Broke off her engagement.<br />Became a vegetarian.<br />Moved \\"to the city\\"<br />Dropped out of law school to become an artist.<br /><br />Because her father had an affair with her friend?  Really?  I mean, cut him off if you want but it seems like a tad bit of an overreaction to me.  Her mom and sister were probably like WTF did we do?  She was a total brat throughout the whole movie.  Her character was unlikable and he was a wuss.  I hated it.  I'm glad I Netflixed it rather than paying to see it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game. it's highly addictive so be prepared to spend a few hours of your day checking in on your stoves.
1400069289|5.0|This riviting book is an exploration of the functioning of the human mind; how to understand why we do what we do, and, how to alter our behaviours.  Further, it's an insightful foray into the world of marketing and advertsiing - how those folks use our tendencies (mostly unknown to us!) to sell us products.  I couldn't stop till I finished, and, have been recommending this one to all my friends and colleagues.  A must read!
0345529057|5.0|I bought this four book series SOIF because I have recently discovered reading is wonderful again. These books are absolutely great, well written, and long. My only thing I want to tell other people when they buy this set, is the housing unit which holds the four books, once you take one book out, it becomes nearly impossible to put it back together as it was shipped. I ended up ripping my box a little trying to get the book back in, so be weary. But this isn't about the box but about the book. Go buy it, it has the occasional sex scene which isn't very graphic (different than the HBO show), and I would say once every 50 pages a curse/vulgar word.<br /><br />I do not regret this decision in any way, and 20 dollars for four books, this beats any deal...anywhere.
B004LWZW24|5.0|when i saw this as a preview, i thought it was going to be lame.  i must say this is a very smart, clever and VERY SCARY film.  i saw it a year back in theaters and just watched it again last night on netflix, and it was just as effective as it was in theaters.  the ghosts, the jumps, the atmosphere, everything was there and i cannot stop thinking about this film and how effective it was.  see it if you are into ghosts, haunted house movies or anything even remotely creepy and scary!  tip toe through the tulips!
0785152458|5.0|So different, and better than the first one but they are both great. I loved it so much and is a must read if you have read the first.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Like so many others, I picked up on this series after the show aired.  The first book was fairly interesting, if not exceptional within the Fantasy genre.  Since then, Martin's droll writing (entire pages of names/foods, frequently repeated monologues, etc.) have ruined this series for me.  A hodgepodge of underdeveloped characters, coupled with an agonizingly slow plotline, have made what could be a very successful story into something not worth the price of printing it (e-ink included).  One chapter's lack of vivid descriptions leaves a bad taste in my mouth, which is immediately picked up by the next unremarkable chapter's lack of significant action or plot development and so on.  I'm not usually one to give up on a series once I've started it - if only to find out how it ends - but I do not plan on reading any more from Martin.
0091935571|1.0|I had a heart attack after following the Atkins diet. This was followed by a triple bypass.<br />With the diet I ate lots of meat and rich creams. I can't say that this diet is the cause, but I have a strong suspicion that it may have added to the problem. In addition, I tried the Atkins diet a few years ago and have eaten things thru the years that have lead to high blood pressure and chloresterol.
B000BISBDY|5.0|What can be said about Johnny Cash other then he is Amazing Artist and forever will be in the eyes and ears of the people who loved his music.  I won't lie I went head and bought this CD for a few particular songs, but then listened to the whole CD and I loved listening to every single song on it inculding the cover songs.  The man in black had true talent for music.  Buy this CD and you wont be sorry because you also will enjoy every song on here if you are a true Johnny Cash fan.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the real temple run! This is not just a fake. Look it is spelled right! TEMPLE R-U-N.  I would rate it 5 stars any day.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fun. Its very addicting:) I would recommend this game if u like playing games like farmville and others like it.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|This movie isn't going to win awards, and is not what you're looking for if you want some deep plot. This is simply a traditional \\"spy double-cross\\" movie with some nice fight scenes. Honestly though, I only watched this movie for the fight scenes.  She's a pro-MMA fighter, and the techniques are all actual moves that work.  Some great armbars and chokes.<br /><br />But yeah, watch this movie for what it is... a predictable spy movie with some well done fight scenes.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thank you soo much for being FREE! I have been &quot;borrowing&quot; my brothers I-pod for like ever just to play Temple Run!!! I have been patiently awating for this app to be available to Android /Kindle Fire!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Still Alice was an excellent book.  I felt that the author really captured what it would be like to have alzeimer's disease.  I liked the way she put across Alice's view on how her disease was progressing and how she was feeling about losing control of her memory.  I enjoyed the book so much that I went ahead and read Left Neglected, also an excellent book.  Lisa Genova is a good writer and I would definitely read more of her books.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|The new Halestorm CD is a Great Rock Album.  They have showed they haven't lost their touch and sound for giving people some good rock music for today's day and age.  It contained 9 rock songs and 3 softer songs in between the rock songs.  I say to you who read these reviews to buy this CD if you enjoy solid rock music with female vocals.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|One of a life time experience even though, I only own their DVD not the real luve concert in Vegas
0440244870|5.0|This book is so funny, as is the whole series! I love all of Sophia Kinsella's books, but this is by far my favorite!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's hard for me to get into sci-fi books because they seem to get really complicated, really fast - apparently for no other reason than to obscure a mundane story. This series is outstanding, well written, entertaining, engrossing. This is the first time I've been so engaged by a book in YEARS. Well worth the small price I paid on Amazon. BUY THIS BOOK!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|In my viewpoint this should be Rock Album of the year as I see it.  Plus this is the best Shinedown album I have heard to date.  I admit I have yet to listen to Sound of Madness, but of the three albums I have heard from Shinedown this is the best they have offered their fans.  I enjoyed listening to every song on the album, but lryics wise my favorite song was their last song called Through The Ghost.  So if your a fan of Hard Rock music with an edge and enjoy listening to lryics to show the meaning behind the songs then get this album and be prepared to be blown away.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|its a good game app even for beginners. allows for guarding king and doesn't give away mates. I do remommend this game for players of all levels
1416550550|3.0|I was looking for an epic novel like the Thorn birds, and it was good...but not as good as the Thorn birds. This book takes a little bit to get into, but overall it's a good book that keeps you wondering.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ever it is so awesome thanks to the people who even came up with this game
030014332X|5.0|Amazing. Absolutely amazing. That is one of the few words worthy enough to describe This masterpiece of a book. E.A Gombrich has certainly left a standard that is higher than it has ever been with \\"A Little History of the World\\". It is truly a sumptuous book.<br />This book basically tells the entire history of mankind; all the way from our primitive neanderthal ancestors to the solemn atomic bomb. But the author tells this story (which is incredibly fascinating by itself) in such a simple and well thought out way that it becomes a novel, and not just another boring history book. He connects events from all over the timeline and shows the reader how history repeats itself over and over which makes you just gawk at how simple and non enigmatic everything is. He also teaches us important life lessons that are implanted forever in your brain using rhetoric questions and complicated language. For example, he teaches us how to avoid serious calamities and disasters, such as the ones created in WWII, and how to never forsake the power of love.<br />Personally, my favourite part of the entire book was the very beginning, because Gombrich explains probably the simplest idea in the entire writing with such elegance that I really have no words to describe it.<br />I think that the best character in the story was Buddha, because he just seemed like a very calm and down-to-earth person. I would really like to meet him  and get to know him. I'd also like to take part in some of his teachings, such his austere way of life, since they are so peaceful and cool.<br />I would definitely recommend this book for everyone, since it is has a perfect level of difficulty. A 10 year old can enjoy and understand it just as much as a 60 year old. I would especially recommend it if you have an upcoming history/Social studies test, since I found that in some parts this book explains the material better than my teacher, and you avoid the penitence that the teacher may give you if you fail the test. If so, he/she might hold this book as a fanfare. And if you do manage to fail, Gombrich will be a perfect scapegoat. So if you live in a mansion or in a tenement, scroll up now and click 'add to cart' so you can quickly abdicate this fantastic little book!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best bible app!! Love to use it on my tablet on my phone even very helpful and easy to use

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this album along with her previous album (19) and the DVD of her concert at The Royal Albert Hall in London, and loved all three. The order arrived well ahead of schedule, which impressed me greatly. Adele's music is absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. Nearly every song she writes has a story behind it which, I think, gives the songs additional significance. Nearly every song on the album has a story behind it, from the aftermath of a nasty argument (turning tables), to reconciling with an old flame (someone like you) to reacting to an ugly rumor (rumor has it). All the songs are delivered with a voice that reaches right into the heart of me and pluck at my own emotions. I'm not ashamed to say it, but one or two songs did leave me teary-eyed. Anyway, I loved this album and simply can't wait for the next one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you don't have a Bible and you want one get this app because its free and it can change your life on just 5 minutes
B007YOC4RW|5.0|The first time I stumbled across Joe's music was a discounted, $4.98 steal of buy from iTunes of him playing live in Shepherds Bush in England. (Now the album can only found here: [...])  I loaded up this album on my iPod and used it to go for a long run.  I just fell in love with his guitar playing.  Just pure blues rock guitar magic.  Ever since then I have eagerly anticipated his album releases and bought them.  Joe is a young blues rock phenom.<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece.  There is not one dull moment on this album from beginning to end.  I have to say I always think his own creations are the jewels on the albums.  I have read some of the reviews for this album and many folks do not care for \\"Heavenly Soul.\\"  This is the candy on the album.  I cannot resist gorging myself on this song when I get to it on my play list.  On my first album play, I could not resist at least 7 repeat plays and told myself to let the album move on so as to not wear it out.  Joe really burns through that song and the repeated electronic rendition of Joe via iPod gives him a rest from his devoted, demanding fans.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting 4 this app since I first got my kindle! now I am soooo happy they finally have it for the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|This is Bob Dylan at his prophetic BEST. It's incredible how this man has always been able to see into the future. The lyrics and music are Outstanding. Mark Knopfler plays on this. You just can't get any better. Dylan always surrounds himself with great talent and this album is totally worth having for any Bob Dylan fan, or even someone \\"new\\" to Bob Dylan. (I don't see how that could be possible, but you never know!)
B0086700CM|5.0|its about time they got this app my friends and i love it and ive been watong for it to come out for the kindle its one of the best apps ever
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I used to love these puzzles and am very happy to see this easy to use version as an app.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|A friend mentioned on an Amazon mystery thread that they had to DVR SHERLOCK on Masterpiece Theater on May 20 because JESSE STONE was on simultaneously.  There's something as good as SHERLOCK on?  This piqued my interest so as a mystery aficionado streamed this film which is the prequel to the series.<br /><br />Even though this is the prequel and the second show in the series, I would watch this first as it shows the backstory regarding how Stone ventured from CA to MA to be chief police there.  The major characters are introduced.<br /><br />Wow!  It totally exceeded expectations.  Stunning scenery (supposed to be norther MA but actually Canada), witty dialog, complex characters, believable acting, intriguing plots, haunting musical theme, pacing which kept you interested....don't know why I'm just hearing about this series.<br /><br />Haven't read the author Robert Parker's books but now I want to--he had a PhD in English Lit and taught, along with writing 50 novels.<br /><br />Selleck acts, produces and helps write the teleplays and you sense someone who cares about the production oversees the details.  It emanates quality.  It is better than many movies I have been to.  Like other reviewers, wish they would produce more of these per year whilst retaining the quality.<br /><br />Love the set design, especially the Chief's office and home with the cracked leather chairs.<br /><br />If you like a warm, intelligent, imperfect, masculine, astute, humane, non-political chief of police as protagonist, check this series out.
B0086700CM|5.0|love the game an now its for free heck to the yea i play this game 24/7 no pie when bored this is the game love it
B004T4KQJS|2.0|I began by watching this as a lecture on youtube ([...]) and was so intrigued by the lecture that I decided to buy the book... A forewarning, much of the book is taken verbatim from the lecture. Though the information is still amazing, I would have to say it is much better delivered in the lecture format, and cheaper as well!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad this game is finally available on the kindle! I always play it on my boyfriends tone and l am so obsessed with it!!

030788743X|5.0|I am so glad I read this book.  This author was genius in his writing and even though I was born in the 90's, I really loved the 80's and it brought back nostalgia for me.  At points in the book, I was actually laughing out loud.  The plot was excellent, the world highly believable, and the characters well developed even though they are hidden under their avatars!  I don't have a single bad thing to say about this novel, and just thought it was genius.  What brought out the most nostalgia in it for me I think was the whole gaming aspect.  As the sister of a big gamer, I dabbled in gaming and loved watching my brother play games and beat levels I couldn't beat.  This whole world I just seemed to understand so that's what made it so fun for me...I felt like I was a little kid watching my brother play again.<br /><br /> I wish I could write a better review to give it justice but I can't...so just READ IT!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally! our prayers for this addicting game to be released on this market have been answered. temple run is a fun yet simple game that will keep you occupied for hours.
B0086700CM|5.0|so happy that this game made it to the kindle fire. Was tired of having to use my friends ipod to play it. lol

B002WY65VU|4.0|Many folks in the zombie-loving universe are picky when it comes to their favorite monster. This movie withstands most of the criticisms simply due to how well made it is along with the perfectly timed humor. Nothing beats the Bill Murray cameo. This movie is worth owning if you have a zombie fan in your home. And for non-zombie lovers...trust me when I say that you will get a few chuckles

1416550550|4.0|Kate Morton successfully wrote a book about four generations of English/Australian women.  The book begins in 1913 in a poor attic in London where we meet a little girl on a ship.  This little girl, however, sets sail for Australia without any companionship and she cannot seem to remember her name or anything about herself when asked.  Upon arriving in Australia, a man notices the little girl seemingly abandoned on the wharf and takes her home to care for her until her guardians arrived.  That didn't seem to happen before Nell, the name the Australian family gave to the girl, became part of her new Australian family.<br /><br />Nell had a wonderful life growing up, but on her 21st birthday, her adopted father lets her know that she had been born to other parents.  Nell, who had formerly been easy going and happy, becomes sullen, calls off her engagement, and begins looking for her biological parents.<br /><br />The story again fast forwards over fifty years, and we learn that Nell left to her granddaughter, Cassandra, a small cottage in England.  Cassandra, determined to find out the origins of her grandmother, leaves for England, and the rest of the story follows....<br /><br />Morton does a beautiful job telling three stories at once: 1) the story of Nell's childhood; 2) the story of Nell searching for her ancestry; and 3) Cassandra's search for Nell's biological family.  Morton brings numerous characters to life while writing a book full of suspense, history, romance, and fairy tales.  By skipping back and forth between the present, past and long-past times, Morton never lets the story become boring and always adds a little piece of information that makes the puzzle behind Nell's ancestry come into focus.<br /><br />I gave the book four rather than five stars because I wished that some of the characters did not have such a sad existence.  Nell had a terrible relationship, if any relationship at all, with her daughter and I couldn't tell whether Nell had many happy moments after the realization that she had been adopted.  Cassandra also seems to hold a dark secret from her past and doesn't seem to be happy with her life, except maybe at the very end.  Clearly, Eliza has some happiness in her life, but the end seemed bleak and Rose and Rose's mother only took happiness away from others.y moments after the realization that she had been adopted.

I have long since left the carpool behind, but this music is now one of my favorites of all time. The vocals are amazing (none of the REALLY high-pitched stuff you will find on The Kick Inside)and \\"Wake the Witch\\" is perhaps her best song ever. Of course I could make that claim for each one of these \\"stories set to music\\" on a different day depending on my mood. Simply a must have.<br /><br />1.

B001DHXT20|3.0|I saw the avenger's first and then I saw this movie.  It was late and I was tired when I saw it so this might be biased from that.  The hulk in the Avenger's was much more exciting and believable.  This movie is just a big guy fighting another big guy and looking for a plot.  The CGI was great but the storyline skipped whole sections (like how in the heck did he cross into the US border from Guatemala?).  The movie is average and worth seeing once.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I got this app and I love it.it's one of the best games ever.the only thing we need now is temple run.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Decent, not bad, not great story, and too young for me at the age of 41. More for the 18-23 year crowd. It became a challenge to finish ONLY because at my age, the things that occurred throughout the book was not romantic to me now but it maybe it was 25 years ago. Still, the story is a reminder of those feelings of a head-over-heels wild teenage love.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been dying to have this game on my kindle since like forever. its about time you gave us what we want super happy now I really got a reason to stay up Lol

B000VDDWDS|5.0|This is truly a masterful and commanding sea adventure in the style of the great old Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone movies from the 30s and 40s such as Captain Blood, or The Sea Wolf, with E.G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart. For those who are fans of \\"The Mountains of the Moon\\" with Patrick Bergen (although a land adventure in Africa) you'll know what I mean when I say that if you've been wanting a similar historical adventure in faraway places then this movie might be just what you're looking for. I really enjoyed \\"The Mountains of the Moon\\" and have always wished for more.<br /><br />I understand that the movie takes liberties with the original timeline and combines two O'Brian books, which has offended some fans, but as an adventure movie it comes off very well. Using a combination of CGI, big and small ship's models, historical footage, and on site filming, the movie's look and feel is as authentic as you could want.<br /><br />Add to that several dramatic sea battles and hand to hand (or more like sword to sword) deck engagements, and you have a rousing maritime adventure as good as anything from the old days of action and adventure flicks. The brief sojourn to the Galapagos Islands adds another dimension to this well done film. Fine acting by the whole cast and a more than competent script round out the film's many strengths. Overall, a great adventure film from the capable hands of Peter Weir and well worth your time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Everyone should read this trilogy. The word \\"Masterpiece\\" is an understatement.  Note that it is violent, cruel and there is much death. The writing will move and entrance you. The first book in this trilogy is much better than the B+ movie. The best book I've read in at least ten years. The kind of book that I'll read again several times. Unbelievable. Utterly phenomenal.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thx so much Amazon my brother has a ipad and he has temple run, when hes gone somewere i play it its so much fun but after a while not so much but still AWESOME
0439023513|1.0|This is my first review of a book ever.. that's how bad it was.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert:<br />So after not being able to put down the first two books and staying up countless nights to read them, I found myself in a bad mood every time I read Mockingjay. The only reason I kept reading was because I felt that I had already invested so much time that I needed to know how the series ended and figured it couldn't get any worse (oh but it did). Basically all the pointless action in the last third was hard to follow and didn't even make that much sense, not that it ended up mattering because it was just the means the author used to kill off basically everyone we had just been introduced to. The whole last third of the book was such a waste because the story didn't even really contribute to the overall plot besides Prim's death. Almost everyone dies on a mission that wasn't supposed to be taken and isn't even remotely achieved in the end. It doesn't end up even mattering that Katniss makes it to the square except that she sees Prim's death. It didn't even matter that they took the mission in the first place. The book never mentions any renewed hope from the rebels by Katniss being seen as a martyr or anything. At all. Just maybe fewer rebels died because they used cars to activate pods after seeing the black wave. Collins also doesn't even explain why Boggs said \\"don't trust them\\" on his death bed. Don't trust who? Because the whole team basically died trying to help Katniss achieve her pointless and selfish mission. And Coin's motive for setting off the final bombs was never explained.<br /><br />The one thing that Collins achieved through Katniss in the end was a reoccurring theme that if you are feeling sad than just drug yourself up and pretend the world around you doesn't exist.. because that's the right message to send to your readers!! Or if you are feeling sad and hopeless.. why not ignore all responsibilities and hide in a closet! Katniss did both of these things (was drugged up or hiding) throughout most of the book which made it not very fun of a read. I hated her the whole book- she cares for Peeta so much she barely has the will to live and is hysteric over him- but then does nothing to help him return to his old self and would rather kill him? Just.. not consistent or very good story telling.<br /><br />In the end Katniss is upset over the death of innocent civilians in the Capital, specifically a little girl in a yellow coat that's mindlessly shot by the rebels. Five pages later shes mindlessly shooting into a crowd not worried if its the enemy, rebels, or civilians? Right because that's real consistent<br /><br />Katniss, now with a history of being mentally disoriented and able to kill innocent people, kills Coin and gets let off because she's mentally unstable.. and then is just sent back home (where there are weapons) with telephone calls for treatment? Because that makes complete sense. Not.<br /><br />I'm bitter over Finnick's death.. why did Collins even bother developing this character, who I ended up liking, when she barely mentioned his death. Same with Johanna- her and Katniss finally get somewhere in their relationship and it doesn't even mention what happens to her in the end. Disappointing.<br /><br />It was never explained why Haymitch agreed for the Hunger Games in the end.. or Katniss for that matter.. Considering that's why the rebellion was started I would've appreciated some explanation as to why they would agree except for some vengeance over Prim which doesn't match either of the characters' developments.<br /><br />**And finally Collins never explained why Coin would send in the parachutes for the rebel's own medics? If Coin wanted to make Snow seem like a heartless murderer of children to help speed up the end of the war then the first round of bombs would have been enough. I doubt even Coin would kill off a countless number of her own side's medics just to have Prim killed off when Coin at that time had no way of knowing if a) Katniss was even still alive at that point (ruining Katniss's theory that it was done to gain her support or break her mentally) b) Prim would even be killed by the bombings. Gale and Beetee developed that bombing tactic to kill the enemies.. not their own troops... just so many plot holes I don't even know where to begin.
0307949486|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a good, solid mystery novel that is definitely worth a read.  That said, I don't think it is as amazing as many people make it out to be, and here's why.<br /><br />-This book, to me at least, was not a page turner. The lack of suspense discouraged me to read on to see what happens next.  Because of this, as well as the slow nature of some chapters, you will have to power through it if you get bored easy (especially the very beginning).<br /><br />-The book, at least to me, was very predictable.  The way that the author led up to the climax caused it to be spoiled, and in turn not very exciting.  I also guessed the ending, the big twist, rather easily.  This all caused a less than interesting read.<br /><br />-This book is completely misnamed in America.  I don't want to give anything away, but the girl in the book that has the dragon tattoo is not the main character.  Nor does the book revolve around her at all.  In the original country of publication, Sweden, the book is called Men who Hate Women.  As you will see if you read this book, this name is much more appropriate.<br /><br />-It helps if you are interested in finances and the business side of things, because this book dwells on those topics for extended periods of time.  Luckily, understanding the details of those parts is unimportant to the overall story, so just power through it like I did.<br /><br />As I said, it's a good book.  Unfortunately, that's about it.  Definitely worth a read, but don't expect the best mystery novel since And Then There Were None or Sherlock Holmes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a hot book. Sure the female lead said \\"Oh crap\\" at least 100 times but she is young, inexperienced and caught up in fairytale land. The male lead is hotter than a sweltering fire. The writing gets the juicy juices going. Be warned: If you do not enjoy a book that is approximately 75% of sex, which is rough and kinky, stay away. All men should be required to read this book because even if a man or his partner isn't into BDSM, he will still learn how to make a woman palpitate by speaking the scorching words written in this book.
1590200918|5.0|I haven't yet read  Susan Hill's-The Woman In Black,so while waiting for it at my library I got her The Man In The Picture and I am so happy that I did.<br /><br />It is a short story-160 pgs,but such a page turner that I could not put it down until I finished it last night!<br /><br />It grabbed me from the very first page and kept up the fast pace of my desire for revelation,as each tidbit of the story of the painting was revealed.<br /><br />I am more anxious than ever now to read The Woman In Black.I prefer to see the film first if one is based on a book,so I don't have the same complaint as so many about the film not being as good as the book. I don't expect it to be,but this way,I really enjoy the film much more,I believe, than those who compare it to the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Man In The Picture to all Ghost story lovers.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game based on virtual city, but the whole &quot;invest points&quot; part is a racket if you ask me. The investment points take too long to earn and are too needed to advance in the game.
B005ZUR724|5.0|good casual mmo worth the time.  big download though latest update was about 800 mb very good game I enjoy it
0345803485|5.0|Sorry some of you didn't like or enjoy reading this book! I however LOVED every page. My only issue with this book and the 2 that follow is, I certainly hope NO PARENTS leave them laying on an end/coffee table for young people to open and start reading...... I strongly feel these books should have a rating as they certainly aren't PG and they aren't appropriate for 11, 12 or 13 year olds to read.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|However may be before we buy amazon should suggest in different colours about region that DVD can be played...lucky have other DVD players that play this movie,love it...thank you Amazon:):)

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I think the writers did an amazing job of making Sherlock seem more human in this season. He gets to experience all of the emotions we never thought he was capable of: love, anger,hurt, betrayal and doubt. It makes the character alot more fleshed out than he was in the first season. can't wait for season 3!
0439023513|3.0|It took me longer to finish this book than it did the first two. I began reading it around Christmas and only got about 1/3 of the way through it. I'm not sure if I was just hesitant to let it end, or nervous that it wouldn't end the way I wanted. I picked it back up this week and started from the beginning, but I still had trouble getting into it. The writing style is the same, but this is a far different book that the previous two. I'm not sure if it was the lack of action in the beginning or lack of contact between certain characters that turned me off, but this was definitely my least favorite of the three Hunger Games novels.<br /><br />That being said, once the action picked up (and a certain character re-emerged) I really got into the book. Unfortunately I had already been spoiled on some of the plot points, but that didn't make them any less shocking to read about. Overall, I felt this was a nice conclusion to a great series.
B0057RCFQS|3.0|Nice packaging,original,however it is American region version,so can't play in my main DVD PLAYER but play in my other ones. Love the movies
B005EGXTEE|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to read the book, the book is so much better than the movie, a lot more details, and back ground information, which was missed from the movie.  Highly recommend this book, worth the read.
B000084T18|5.0|Instead of gettin rich & die tryin with a passion for hip hop he got rich and stop tryin with no substance.So enjoy this one album wonder because the rest of his stuff gets boring real quick, lyrics like ''i'm a thug, ''i got shot 9 times'',''i'm a pimp'',''i sold drugs'' etc... Are childish attempts at getting street cred, it's bad enough he's not a top notch lyricist but the beats carry his average pathetic rhymes at least so all is not wasted.krs-one,Nas,jay-z (sometimes),oukast,a tribe called quest,wu tang clan (various members),gang starr,mobb deep,rakim,common,eminem,jeru,ice cube(87-94),run dmc etc.. Are far more entertaing & enjoyable consistent,creativity,album wise.Buy or Sell? I recommend buy but be warned of the repetative lyrics
0525423656|4.0|So I was really excited about reading the sequel to Matched. I really liked Ky and near the end of Matched Cassia really started to look like she was becoming stronger, and more determined.<br /><br />Well, Crossed started off really well. Cassia is on a mission to find Ky and won't let anything stop her. She is stronger, she is more determined, she is...well, she's not smarter. She makes some really stupid decisions and there were points were I wanted to smack her across the head for her constant wavering between Ky and Xander.<br /><br />I really liked the back and forth narration between Ky and Cassia, because it shows just how differently they are thinking about things, even if they have the same end goal of being together. And just as Cassia became frustrating with her decisions, so was Ky. Ky is just trying to survive and he has very little hope that he'll ever see Cassia again, although it is the only thing he is holding on to. With him it's the rebellion and whether he should join. He doesn't want to and he doesn't want Cassia to join either. And that's where he starts his stupid decisions.<br /><br />Even though I was really frustrated with a lot of the choices the characters made, it was Condie's writing that saved this book for me. She has a very beautiful descriptive style that really lets the reader see what the characters are seeing without being overwhelming. If you liked Matched, the Crossed is a definitely read.

0345803507|5.0|LOVED IT! Ana finally brought him into the light. I thought she was so very cleaver in the bank. Don't want to spoil the story for you. The first book was rather dark and I almost didn't finish it but I am thrilled how the 3rd book turned out. I especially liked reading the epilogue where we get to hear what Christian's thoughts were from his first meeting with her in book one. The far fetched wealthy lifestyle was a little unbelievable but can be easily overlooked for the exciting joy ride the author takes us on. Very satisfying ending to the trilogy. Now if I can get my husband to read it! :)

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooooooooooooooooooooo addicting!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is the best game ever. I was so sad when I found out they didn't have it on the kindle firs and the other games like it suck mega time. this deserves more than five stars.

B004J4WKTW|1.0|The first chapter of this book sounded like someone discribing a scene setup, very dry.  I almost stopped then.  Then it became a little more interesting except there was no character I cared enough to learn more about.  I stopped when the Kindle said I was at 10%.
B007U3SZHK|4.0|This is a great Live Album.  There are some sick songs on there, including \\"Why,\\" one of my favorite Satch songs ever.  So, in total, great, but the only downside, is that there are some of the same Live songs he always does.  Still, awesome.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|When I read Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond or Why the West Rules for Now by Ian Morris, I always thought it was only a part of the minor reasons for the development of a richer society.<br /><br />While it's hard to deny that geography or plantation played a role, the effect seems to be much less obvious in recent times. There must be a reason why most of the earliest civilizations concentrated around Tigris and Euphrates or the Yellow River, but not in Alaska, but it didn't explain the obvious and huge difference between, say, Afghanistan and Korea.<br /><br />I live in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong was not much different from other parts of China 150 years ago, or just to compare two cities, Hong Kong vs Guangzhou. People are almost the same, same food, same culture, same language, almost the same geography, but yet Hong Kong is richer, the infrastructure is better, legal system more intact, at least for now.<br /><br />I always know politics play a much bigger role, politics is the only way to explain this discrepancy, border is a better definition. Border defines institutions, extractive or inclusive.<br /><br />I think the first few chapters of this book were thought-provoking, the latter half rather a repetition of the previous points.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I've been out of the YA age frame for many years so you can imagine I don't read many books in this category. Yet, this was one that I could not put down!  Such a great plot. Definitely a must read.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|A young grieving lawyer, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) is sent to a remote village to settle the estate of a recently deceased woman who had a quite large English manor. It is very clear from his first arrival that the locals do not want him there, and that they are hiding a terrible secret. As child deaths start to occur in the village, the hatred of the villagers is set against Kipps, and he must, with the help of his friend Sam Daily, seek to unravel out what happened at Eel Marsh House, and who is the woman in black.<br /><br />Based off of a novel of the same name by Susan Hill, and set in the early 1900's England, this unique film was, to me, a very welcome surprise. Out of a very wide genre filled with generic and sometimes pathetic offerings, this one stands out as one of the best horror films I've seen a good while. While keeping the tension, gradually building the dread and at the same time intensifying the mystery, this film is a superb piece of entertaining, thrilling and engaging storytelling. Backed by great acting on Radcliffe's part, (which frankly, I wasn't sure about at first either, he surprised me) and snap directing by Watkins,  the film kept my interest, and kept me in suspense the whole time. It does have its jumping moments, but do not get the idea this is a movie filled with cheap thrills, it is an intelligent and fine example of suspenseful storytelling, one that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.<br /><br />Also, I must comment on the filming of it. The lighting and framing of the shots in this piece was absolutely brilliant. Props to them for building such a great atmosphere throughout the film in that regard.<br /><br />As for content, there's not much to list. When it comes to the disturbing content, I'd say the PG-13 was well earned. The deaths of children occur infrequently throughout the movie and the ghostly woman in black is a quite frightening figure as well. Add in a couple of scenes of extreme tension involving ghosts and it's for sure this is not for the kiddies. There is only perhaps a couple mild profanities, (no more than Sherlock Holmes) and absolutely no sexual content. All in all a pretty clean film.<br /><br />So what's my verdict? As a horror movie fan, I must say four and a half out of five stars. With this level of acting and the brilliant filmmaking, I must give this one a high rating. Not particularly everyone's favorite genre, but this one is well worth it in my opinion.

B0000U0X1G|3.0|Loosely based on the controversial mid-70's ABC television series of the same name, the film S.W.A.T. (2003), basically borrows the original characters names, and inserts them into a situation involving a captured criminal's attempts to escape from custody.  Featuring a strong cast, headed by Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, and Jeremy Renner, and with some large scale action pieces, chases, and shootouts, the film was a solid box office winner.<br /><br />Scant homage is actually paid to the original S.W.A.T. program (1975-76), which was mostly about duty, trust, teamwork, and leadership.  Although this oversight may disappoint dedicated fans of the TV show, most probably regard the S.W.A.T. movie as just another police drama.<br /><br />LAPD S.W.A.T. (Special Weapons And Tactics) team members Jim Sweet (Farrell) and his partner Brian Gamble (Renner), are involved in a situation where a hostage is injured by one of Gamble's shots.  Gamble and Sweet are reprimanded, and Gamble quits the force after having a fight with his partner.  Sweet is demoted to inventory clerk, where he meets up with Sergeant \\"Hondo\\" Harrelson (Jackson), who is putting together a new S.W.A.T. team.  Eventually, although Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter) Harrelson's superior officer doesn't approve of some of the members, Hondo completes his team, which consists of Sweet, and officers Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deacon Kaye (LL Cool J), T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles) and Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt).<br /><br />After completing training, the team is assigned to safeguard the transportation of Alexander Montel (Oliver Martinez), an international drug trafficker.  After they prevent Montel from making his escape while being transported, the criminal announces that he will pay a hundred million dollars, to anyone that helps him to escape, which soon makes life very complicated for Hondo and his team.<br /><br />The movie features a big twist that shatters the unity and integrity which was at the heart of the Steve Forrest led S.W.A.T.  Despite cameos by Forrest, and Rod Perry, besides a few names, a black van, and the theme song from Rhythm Heritage, not much in the movie has anything to do with the original TV series.  Any cache the series had would seem to be minimal, so tying the movie to the series seems like a questionable move, particularly when similar to the film adaptation of Mission Impossible (1996), S.W.A.T. abandons the core values of the source material.<br /><br />The film is already past the halfway mark before the team even gets their first assignment.  Then once solidified, all that was built up is quickly flushed down the toilet.  While perhaps not the greatest story structure, the film manages to conclude with some nice action scenes centered around a plane landing on a bridge, and chase through the subway, and storm drain systems.  Flashy and PG-13 violent, S.W.A.T. is an entertaining time, though perhaps not a particularly memorable one.  The DVD is loaded with extras, including a couple of commentary tracks, and multiple featurettes including one on weaponry.at the heart of the Steve Forrest led S.W.A.T.

B004V6MWFU|1.0|I am a huge Pearl Jam / Vedder fan, and in the past, when bands / singers have branched out to do something a little \\"different,\\" I have, in general, been pleasantly surprised.  This, however, was not one of those times.  I have a heard time believing that so many people genuinely like this album.  I think it is a case of hardcore fans who will like anything that their beloved demigod puts out, or the ever present music snobs that like anything that they feel will elevate them above the common masses who propel popular music.  You know, the people who liked all the big bands while they were still underground or independent.  Anyway, for true fans of the ukulele, I am sure this album is a god-send and I am glad it is here for you to enjoy.  As for me and myself, I will go listen to Ten.

B007BZM3HK|1.0|So I don't have a lot of vitriol for this song, simply because it isn't the most horrible song I've heard ever. I don't plug my ears and scream at the top of my voice when I hear it, nor do I condone those who do.<br />I was introduced to this song via the music video for it, which, I think, was in poor taste.<br />As for the song, it's not got any explicitly foul lyrics I could harp on, it's just a little too...lifelike. Essentially, she meets a guy and immediately falls in lust because he's so very attractive.<br />Granted, I probably listen to worse songs that I actually like, but that objectifying message coupled with the sucky pop instrumentals (normally I like violins, this time they sounded a little too overdone) makes me really not like this song, no matter how catchy it is.
0345803485|1.0|This has to be the worst written book I have ever read.If there was a \\"zero\\" rating,that's what I would give this book. It's written like a Danielle Steel novel or a Harlequin Romance with porn thrown in to make it \\"interesting\\". Really, the porn is not that good either. Lady Chatterley's Lover-it's not. If it didn't have the sex in it I would put it in the YA (young adult} section of the Library! I rarely give up reading any book and stick it out to the end but this one- I gave up 1/3 of the way through. The writing is immature and and there is absolutely no connection to the characters. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME reading this \\"novel\\"  I am angry that I put as much time into this terribly written book.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I wanted to like this book because of all the hype surrounding the series. But I was severely let down. The writing in itself felt juvenile. I was never able to connect or sympathize with the characters. The theme of S&M was overdone to the point where I felt enough is enough already! I felt angry much of the time with the characters' unhealthy emotional relationship and by the end, I was grossly irritated with the characters and Ana's \\"inner goddess.\\"
0375703764|5.0|\\"House of Leaves\\" is a complex, extremely challenging, but ultimately rewarding novel. The story follows one man's discovery of another man's archives that document horrifying events chronicled by a couple of films that do not exist. These films were supposedly created by a professional photographer who was documenting his family's experience moving into a new house-- that may or may not exist in some parallel universe.<br /><br />I have to admit that reading House of Leaves took me quite awhile, not only due to its length, but due to the distraction of citations and footnotes. The oblique format of the book may distance or even put off some readers--which may explain its cult status, over blockbuster status.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to avid readers with a lot of patience and time. But while it's not for everyone, it is a magic book for any well-read individuals who are interested in work that bends and even breaks convention and genre.<br /><br />When you get past the form, you'll find that it's a book about human struggles that anyone can relate to.

B00846REIS|2.0|There were a few things I liked in this book and a whole lot I didn't like. I was hoping for an angsty romance (my favorite)...which it kind of was...but much of the plot seemed unrealistic, forced, and uncomfortable. (ESPECIALLY in the beginning)<br /><br />First of all, WAY too much sex. And waaaay too graphic! I was torn between amusement and absolute horror at some of the descriptions. Gross and not sexy in my opinion. I had to fast forward through a lot of the very frequent sex scenes in order to keep reading because I hate to not finish what I start. I'm NOT a prude, but the sex-scenes were over the top and some of the terminology I could have really done without. I have a few choice phrases/images still mentally seared into my brain...but I will spare repeating them! *shudders*<br /><br />*spoilers below*<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't find it believable that Eva would jump into such a sexual relationship with Gideon so quickly...and BAM she's in love with him. I think a LOT more conversation/interaction was necessary...especially for the love part. Also, I don't care how hot/magnetic/enthralling Gideon is. His initial advances towards Eva are downright creepy and degrading. Most sane women would be a bit put off, especially a former abuse victim I would think? The sexual tension/attraction wasn't translating for me here. I just wanted her to slap him.<br /><br />Surprisingly, a little more than half way into the book I did start to care about the characters and their issues. At least there was a little bit of character development. It started getting better. However,  I hate that it always seemed to turn to sex with them...there is more to intimacy than just that. It seemed their relationship was just sex, sex, sex. A little more insight into Gideon's mind would've been great, because I had no clue what he really liked about Eva. The part where Gideon decides to solve their fight by taking Eva for a sex-trip around the block? Absurd!!! Completely unbelievable!<br /><br />Something about this story really bothers me and I just can't get over it. The Eva/Gideon relationship is very unhealthy in my opinion...I will usually go for a dark/twisted romance any day (I LOVE getting into the minds of emotionally damaged characters) but something about this one is unsettling to me...and leaves me feeling a bit \\"yuck.\\"<br /><br />After finishing this book I felt...confused. It ended abruptly, without the main characters resolving their issues much at all. I guess the author was leaving room for a sequel, but it felt very incomplete and sort of depressing to me. The plot was not much of a plot at all. (Also, side note...why do we never find out the deal with Gideon's \\"preference\\" for brunettes...or find out what heck is really up with his family...Christopher? And Gideon's mother? So many loose ends...).<br /><br />I will not be purchasing the sequel. I'm shocked Amazon put this at the top of it's \\"Best Romance\\" category for the year. Sex-obsession, yes. Romance, no.

B000002HK4|5.0|Dream Theater essentially equate to gods amongst men. They're equal parts brilliant musicians and master songwriters. They've conquered the genre and every metal fan knows their work. With an impressive resume of albums, there is, in my mind, only one song that captures every intricate detail of this band's talent. It's \\"A Change of Seasons.\\" Listening to this 23 minute track will take you on an emotional ride through crunching riffs and beautiful melodies, movements changing, ebbing and flowing with the seasons. As a single entity, ACoS encapsulates the soul of Dream Theater and gives the listener quite literally one of the most epic songs ever written. A masterpiece.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|Chronicle is a mix of good intentions, deliberately amateurish filmmaking, and almost dreamlike wish fulfillment on the part of three adolescents. That said, this is an absolutely mesmerizing film, worth watching because it is so fantastic and yet, paradoxically, real.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so happy when Temple Run finnaly came to Kindle Fire because I heard so many reviews and once I started playing I couldn't stop so get this awsome app.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|this is a beautiful film with a great cast. ' music , films, books Amaqzon is the  smart place to buy.
0345803485|1.0|So ashamed I got sucked in by the hype. This book is terrible. The writing is atrocious and the sex scenes overdone. The characters are unbelievable and 2D.<br /><br />If you're after the shocking sex scenes, read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books. Much more satisfying.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Nice tale with likable characters.  The series is set in a massive underground silo after the surface of the Earth has become toxic and will kill anyone who ventures out of the silo. The societal structure is very rigid and controlled.  Gradually a few characters have the \\"wool\\" removed from in front of their eyes to reveal a devious plot similar to Logan's Run and Soylent Green.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|This book I read very fast. It is so so great. I recommend it to anyone who would love to read an easy book about positive thinking even if life is hard. I will think about buying the paper copy for a Christmas gift for my sister and a friend. Please it is a must read.

0525425764|5.0|Have now read each of the Theodore Boone books,  this is the best of them;  Grisham takes Theodore to a new level;  love the connection with his family and friends. Enjoyed this one due to the story line and spins throughout;  looking forward to many more.  While it is stated it is a read for the young, it should not be limited to the young;  I enjoyed this more than Calico Joe, which fell very short in my mind for Grisham novel.
B005QUQ99K|3.0|Ninjago is the latest Lego incarnation that is sweeping the world of boys ages 6 - 12.  This is our second set and the motorcycle was easy enough to put together, and it looks \\"cool\\" once assembled.  However, playability is poor.  Pieces continue to fall off, causing interruption in play, and child annoyance.  Legos have always had sets that were clearly meant to be assembled, and then set on an adult kid's shelf \\"for display only.\\"  I understand this, but Ninjago clearly is for kids, and this toy falls short of most Lego toys aimed at younger kids.
0307719219|3.0|Here in Brazil, I read this regular book.<br />The main five greatest points of this book:<br />1- This book is well organized.<br />2- This book is very easy to understand.<br />3- This book tells histories about about twenty famous cleptocrats, such as Idi Amin, Ismail Karimov, Kwame Nkrumah, etc.<br />4- This book is very fun to read.<br />5- The main idea of this book is that instituitions are decisive, to the destiny of nations. And this idea is mainly correct.<br /><br />Even so, I must give three stars for this book, because:<br />1- This book has many sophisms. About American development, this book claims that American development happened despite American Indians were behind Mexican and Peruvian Indians. Well, Mexico remains deeply linked to the Aztec past and Peru remains linked to the Inca Empire, but United States hasn't any real link to its Indians. The American Indians were mainly exterminated and their culture became over. The Mexican Indians became one important thing of Mexican culture and politics. As an typical example of sophism in this book, there's nothing about Guyana. And Guyana was colonized by England and its instituitions. Why New Zealand became a rich country and Guyana became a poor one, under the same British instituitions? Well, the nature gave a sentence that in Guyana, European ways of life couldn't be replicated, while in New Zealand, they could. Nature, not instituitions, decided Guyana and New Zealand's fates.<br />2- About \\"Israel\\", I didn't found this word in all of this book. The word \\"Islam\\" is on page 61. Even so, this book fails when it doesn't recognizes how important is religion to a people's destiny. Religion is the most important of all instituitions, in all places and times. This book compares Mexico and United States, but hasn't any places to compares The Islamic Morocco and Catholic Spain. And never compares Israel with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or Syria. Why Islamic Morocco is so poor and Catholic Spain is so rich? Because of their religions. Why Jewish Israel is so rich and Islamics Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria are so poor? Because of their religions.<br />3- About Brazil, this book fails many times. See pages 455 to 460.<br />4- About former Soviet Union economy, this book remains as correct, the KGB's fake that there was economic prosperity in USSR between 1928 and 1970. Nonsense. There was ever failures, corruption and slavery in Soviet Union in this time. Never there was any great economic growing in USSR. USSR's agriculture was ever a calamity and Russian agricultural production in 1913 was more than the double of any Soviet harvest, in more than 70 years of history.<br />5- The paper of this book has just regular quality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was never much of a reader. I kept seeing this book being talked about everywhere. So I downloaded  the Kindle app to my tablet and started to read the sample of this book. I enjoyed it very much that I just had to buy it. I finished this book is 3 days, then bought the second one and then the third. I enjoyed the Trilogy very much... I have also considered reading all 3 again.  I recommend this book to everyone :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so much about this book, that I went out and purchased the first one. This was the Friday before Mother's Day. Needless to say my husband surprised me with the last 2.

B000002UC5|5.0|How would you react if you'd just sued the Beatles,who musically defined a generational culture,and effectively broke up the band? Not only that but what if you were one of it's key members too? This is the circumstances Paul McCartney found himself in during 1970. Married to photographer Linda Eastman,the couple were expecting their first child together. Living in McCartney's Scottish country house with with horses and other animals,the couple faced many challenges from Paul's frozen assets to his depression over the whole break up. As John Lennon stated later,the dream was over. Or was it? Ever the optimist McCartney was soon back on his feet looking to rebuild his career. He elected to make a DIY album at home with his own studio equipment. He had a number of songs left over from the final Beatles sessions too that were thus far unused. So perhaps something good could come out of all this chaos.<br /><br />  Right out it's clear this is a very singer/songwriter styled and unadorned album,most songs written on acoustic guitar,organ and drums with few to no overdubs. It's also some to some beautifully crafted songs that actually hold up very well even now. \\"Every Night\\",\\"Junk\\" and even the brief opener \\"That Lovely Linda\\" showcase how Paul had lost nothing in his gift for melody and songcraft. \\"That Would Be Something\\" and the funky \\"Oo You\\" are favorites of mine here,showing his affinity for the blues strongly. There are a several instrumentals here too. The sprightly pop of \\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"Momma Miss America\\" and the more abstract \\"Hot As Sun Glasses\\" and the again very psychedelic blues closer \\"Kreen Akrore\\",one of Paul's darkest compositions ever. Of the Beatle era songs \\"Teddy Boy\\" is a quaint little story song,perhaps about Lennon and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\"?Well it's one of Paul's standards and basically an extension from \\"Let It Be\\" with it's epic ballad flavor.<br /><br />  So is this a proper extension of the Beatles output? Not a chance. But it is the beginning of a solo career that at it's core showcased the McCartney could survive and prosper on his own. The Beatles were a bit like a musical brain. In individual parts each had a thing going. But together some unspoken thing got created that gave them a being outside their rock n roll roots. As it turned out each area of this brain did have the capacity to grow into it's own entity. That growth process was only beginning for Paul on this album. He was still running largely on fumes from the freshly dissolved Beatles on this music. And his music hadn't quite fully blossomed into it's own entity yet. Perhaps that's why this album is a very representative image of a debut album to begin with. It has the basic elements of where he came from,boiled down to the bare bones of where he'd be going in the future. And while it's skeletal,almost incomplete sound is a far cry from the type of expansive production McCartney favored at any time in his career this album does lay out an important blueprint for what was to come in the solo career of Paul McCartney.eginning of a solo career that at it's core showcased the McCartney could survive and prosper on his own.

The viewing screen on the Kindle is 7 inches, you can find some obvious objects,but you need a magnifying glass to find others, and when a game like this offers some lame magnifying in the game it makes it worse.<br />Even at $.99 save your money. I used this game as a test for the company's other games, I won't be looking at the rest.

Who would not want to know what happens to our heroes? Well, I got it when I was given a second-hand kindle, and since its on a best seller list, surely it HAS to be good, if not brilliant? Nope. Thats where logic does not link with reality.<br /><br />I digress. I have to go and do the laundry and clean the kitchenafter cooking supper. Then I have to prepare my work for the week. You see - I am waiting for my Mr Grey to come and swoop me up in in private jet or helicopter or glider or first class ticket...anything will do. Just as long as I can escape from this mundane life....
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game.  This is what Puzzle and hidden Object People are looking for.  The length of the game is great for the price.  The graphics are great.  There is a lot of variety in the game play too.  I did get a little lost moving from one part of the map to another.  I wish you could have a jump feature to go from one end to another screen instead of running about from one side to the other.  I wish Maple had more games.  I hope they will release more soon.
B000H5TVJY|2.0|The premise seems forced and overdone, the \\"twist\\" was predictable, and no real social commentary was achieved. I think it was due to either a bad director, or poor delivery by Christian Bale, because he really didn't do a great job. I would recommend rewatching other movies rather than going to this one.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The only bad part of this review is that there are only two graphic adventure games from Maple Fire.  Please bring on more like this one.  Great game.  Lots of puzzles to check out and interesting roaming about the house.  The graphics are very nice too.  I thought the end was a bit lack luster, but over great.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library. I wanted to read it first and if it was worth it, I'd buy it later on.<br />I thought the information for type 3b Botticelli curls was great. I've been washing my hair conditioner only for the past 5 months and have seen a huge improvement in the moisture and definition of my curls. I Hydrate a lot and even with tons of humidity my hair looks good. I liked the book so much I bought the kindle version for my iPad.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great game and lots of fun with the storyline.  I just wish there were a few more types of games.  Can't wait to play #2 and hope the third one comes out on Android soon.
B006RUJST6|5.0|An amazing exploration into the themes of friendship, family and love.  This is a marvelous tale that shows the preseverance and strength of the human condition.  The reader is taken on a soulful journey where they will find themselves crying, laughing, and swooning.  Purchase this book and take a journey with Lake and Will where you will fall into a world of beauty and poetry.  Ms Hoover has written a beautiful story that will move you.
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I'm not saying the music is not heartfelt or honest. But the only thing that's new is the orchestration. It has a few more exotic sounds to it. (\\"Let's Do The Things We Usually Do\\") But the singing and lyrics are really stale and a little more depressing than usual. There are a couple of standouts for pathos: \\"Burnin Love\\", \\"Never Want To Say It's Love\\". The title track is nice. But it's all just so anemic, as a whole.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|the book was entertaining to read. the characters were interesting and novel, but the plot was a little thin. It gets thinner as the series progresses.
B00632HWOG|5.0|this is an awesome app. it tells when you get something from facebook to emails. take it from me get this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! Just yesterday my cousin and I were talking about how the kindle should have temple run during my brother's birthday- And they finally did! Dreams really do come true!
B0086700CM|5.0|I used to always play this on my mom's IPhone and my brother's Android. When I first got my Fire, I was really bummed that it was available. It's finally here now and I cant stop playing! :)
B005LAIHGI|4.0|In \\"The Dictator,\\" Ben Kingsley's character, in trying to persuade Sacha Baron Cohen's not to commit suicide, points out that he, alone of all the recent dictators, is still in power.  You know, unlike Saddam Hussein or Kim Jong-Il.  And Dick Cheney.  If you didn't find the last name amusing, you'll probably want to avoid \\"The Dictator,\\" a movie which also contains ample jokes about bodily functions, decapitation, childbirth and molestation of boy band members.  It also contains some sharp satire about today's political climate and the US's relations with other countries considered less \\"democratic.\\"<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen plays a North African dictator, who finds himself de-throned, and even worse, forced to take a job in a eco-friendly health-food store run by Anna Faris, in order to make ends meet, while he plots to get back in power.  Faris is a walking stereotype of a feminist, but she's also kind of cute, and her company, being hired to cater the event when \\"Aladeen\\" is going to renounce his dictatorship in front of many world leaders (all eager to partake of his country`s petroleum products), is a perfect cover to sneak in.  On the way there, he'll learn some life lessons about what's important in life, what qualities make up the perfect life partner, and what not to carry when being transported into a hotel room.<br /><br />The movie's humor level is uneven, which is a disappointment.  When it's funny, it's very, very funny; when it's not and the joke is drawn out too long, it makes you check your watch.  The outtakes are amusing, though.  Unlike \\"Borat\\" or \\"Bruno,\\" there are no celebrities getting \\"punked,;\\" all the actors, who do a decent job, are in on the jokes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is the best book ive ever read omg I'm hooked!!!!!! I cant wait to read 2and 3 :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this on my ipod and it is the best game ever!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!  p.s. it made me spell opossum when I typed ipod

B0086700CM|5.0|My son loves this game.  It makes long waits bearable. Couldn't locate on the app store but \\"purchased through amazon on my computer and imidiatly synced my kindle and it was there ready to install. Thanks Amazon.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I lived this CD.  It was pure Bonnie  It was a good mix.  It is worth buying for you and a friend.  They will appreciate it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The reviews for this series were so great that I bought the Omnibus first instead of buying the first book in the series and then making a decision on if I wanted to continue.  I'm glad I bought the whole set together.  It was extremely well written, it is a page turner, it's too young to be a classic now, but in a few years I'm pretty sure most Sci-Fi fans will have at least heard of it, if not read it themselves.  I love how each part of the series explores a different person's viewpoint.  I also loved the quick Q & A with the author at the end.  It personalized him for me, it made me feel happy, and I look forward to reading more of his work.  And I'd also be willing to pay a higher price for it, since I feel like this was such a bargain for what I got.  THANK YOU.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The author did a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life. I was able to feel a connection with the people in the book.<br />I recommend this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is really fun. I have always liked management. games and this one is probably my favorite. I think there should be more games just like it.

B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting forever for temple to come out on the kindle fire!! My dreams have finally come true!!! YAYAY!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS?!? Imitation of Amazon: &quot;It will be on the store in December. No, it will be on the store in March. Actually, we will put it on in April.&quot; BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH!  My wait is finally over. I just found this on Sunday.<br />  ~Yaz&lt;3
B007JM4CWY|5.0|can't seem to put it down.  better than sudoku!  no crashes or force closes either.  better on a tablet though. kinda hard on a small screen.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|If you are a fan of Mahjong like I am this game is (in my opinion) one of the best made for the Android format.  It has a fun campaign mode or the standard old pick a shape and play.  The graphics are nice and no lag in game play at least for me on my HTC Evo 4g and my Acer A500 tab... Give the devo team some cash and go ahead and download the full version...
B004I744AS|5.0|Superb English dictionary app that includes vocabulary games (spelling bee and hangman) and daily trivia. Weather forecast and even a horoscope are two of many options in a customizable home page. Looking up words has never been this fun.
B0041D843M|5.0|One of the best of the books on nutrition. Answers so many questions I had.  Dont know what to believe about alot of things.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the hoopla, I bit the bullet and decided I needed an easy read. This read was annoyingly easy, due to the fact that the author continues to repeat the same lines over and over again. I felt car sick by the end. The book bugged me. Little to no character development, and while it does paint a quite colorful, (unrealistic timing wise) picture, I found it all just annoying. A fantastic endorsement however for BDSM. I imagine many inexperienced husbands are accidentally injuring their curious wives as a result.
B0086700CM|5.0|I waited so long for this I mean 3 months ago I got my kindle fire so for me waiting this long without breaking my kindle to try and put this game on it was an accomplishment for me. so excited the game runs just as well as if you got any apple services. Thank you so much please continue to put more games like these cause its amazing. :)
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I would highly recommend this product to any Phantom of the Opera fan.  It was a good choice to do the show in this way, rather than doing a concert format.  The cast is exceptional and this will be a fun musical to watch over and over.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Malware is a serious threat on the android OS I mainly installed this for the web shield. Sadly the greater customization of android opens it to more threats especially if rooted. Must have app especially if you use cracked apps or visit bad websites however even a normal user has no excuse not to install this app. Runs great on the kindle fire as well as Nexus 7!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game ever since I got my Kindle Fire.. and now it's finally here! I love this game.. it's a great pastime. Thank you so much!!!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Excellent album of infectious songs with a heavier blues rock feel that is just plain fun to listen to. Most of the songs are uptempo driving beats with a couple of slower tempo songs to balance the album. Kudos to Bonamassa for never doing the same album twice and continuing to push the boundaries. The guitar playing (almost goes without saying) is superb and soaring. Joe's voice has never sounded better. The production has a rich sound and the keyboards and other instruments are up in the mix and can be heard clearly. Jeff Bova and the Bovaland Brass is also a nice touch. All the musicians did a stellar job. Bonamassa has a knack for picking unexpected covers and takes some old blues songs and updates them- pretty much injecting them with steroids. Joe's originals are just as strong as the covers. Jimmy Barnes' powerful vocals on the ending track are a great compliment to Joe's powerful guitar. Anyone who enjoys blues rock from the 60's and 70's should check this album out. Personally I don't feel the clips do the album justice. This is an album that needs to be heard from beginning to end.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love it!  it is one of the best games I have ever played!<br />I recommend this app for any one.
B0086700CM|5.0|FINLEY!!!! I've been waiting for this app since christmas when i got my KF!!!! LUV IT!!!!!!!:):):) u should get it!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I SOOO... LOVE THIS GAME BEST ONE YET :P I WISH THAT I CAN INSTALL IT ON MY PHONE THOUGH :'(
B004IOVGW0|5.0|PICNIC Blu-Ray-at last! a copy in the original Widescreen and a beauifully restored print. I love this movie; it is one of my favorite top 5 romances. I originally purchased the so-called \\"Restored\\" version released in 2000: it is anything but, and an awful copy that is printed in fullscreen, which chops up and destroys the original beauty. It is restored in some spots, faded and distorted in others-DON'T buy it. I am thrilled with the Blu-ray.<br /> Picnic is a slice of life in 1950's Kansas It begins Labor Day morning, the story taking place in just 24 hours.  It was filmed extensively on location in five small towns in Kansas, which lends total realism to the film. You will be swept away and immersed in a classic romance, spellbound for 115 minutes.<br /> Picnic won Academy Awards for:<br /> Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (William Flannery, Jo Mielziner, Robert Priestley), and Best Film Editing.  It was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Arthur O'Connell, who reprised his stage role),<br />Best Director, Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (George Duning), and Best Picture. It was released in 1955.<br /> The story:<br />Handsome drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hops off the boxcar into a dusty little Kansas town to connect with old college buddy, wealthy Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson).<br />Benson's father owns a lucrative grain elevator business and Hal desperately needs a job. On his way there, he meets single mother Flo Owens (Betty Field), her daughter Madge (Kim Novak) the town beauty, brainy teen Millie (Susan Strasberg), and their renter, the resentful and vindictive\\"old maid\\" schoolteacher, Rosemary Sydney (Rosalind Russell).<br /> Hal is smitten with Madge, initally unaware that she is Alan's girl.<br /> Hal attends the annual Labor Day picnic as Alan's guest along with the Owens women, Rosemary, her long suffering boyfriend, Howard Bevins (Arthur Connolly), and wonderful neighbor Mrs. Potts (Verna Felton). Hal creates a sensation with the women and the whole town, scandalizing the picnic goers with his bravado, sex appeal and charm.<br />As the day turns into night, smoldering passions between Hal and Madge ignite, consuming all; no one is left unscathed.<br />A must-see for William Holden and Kim Novak fans. Some of the criticisms of the film are related to the casting of 37 year old William Holden (who looks older than his real age) as a younger Hal. Cliff Robertson was only several years younger than Holden and he fits, but Holden looks too old for the part.  Kim Novak gets away with portraying a 19 year old girl. My main criticism is the character of Rosmary Sydney (Rosalind Russel) as a bitter spiteful \\"old maid\\" who is both attracted by Hal but refused to acknowledge her feelings, becomes manically vengeful in her attacks on Hal. Her character was just too over the top and soured an otherwise quaint portrayal of men and women in the sexually repressed fifties.  As required of movies in those days, there is only insinuation of sex, but this movie heats up as much as any explicit fim in more recent times.  William Holden is hot, Kim Novak is stunning and this movie is one of a kind. Check it out.ates a sensation with the women and the whole town, scandalizing the picnic goers with his bravado, sex appeal and charm.<br />As the day turns into night, smoldering passions between Hal and Madge ignite, consuming all; no one is left unscathed.<br />A must-see for William Holden and Kim Novak fans.

B007ZD17XO|1.0|I loved Montezuma 2; however, Montezuma 3 has much to improve on. I am stuck between the first two splash screens and cannot get to the game. I would not mind this normally, but considering I paid for this game, I expect it to work. Very disappointing.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been addicted to this app on my itouch for so long, now I have it on my kindle fire I love it!!!
B007IJDXFK|5.0|BEAUTIFUL!  I do not use this description very often, but I am so glad I decided to buy my first Anathema Cd last week. I think the first 2 songs are the most emotional, well written songs I have ever heard, and I do own over 1000 Cd's. The rest of the disc does not let up at all. Listen to the last song and I will bet that you will not be afraid to die! This Cd is awesome! Buy it and enjoy it. You won't be sorry. It's early in 2012, but I can say without a doubt that weather systems will be in my top 2 for the year and in my top 20 of all time!

0156013983|5.0|I read this last year in French class. It teaches the reader so many lessons and is entertaining along the way! I have a copy in French (which a lot more meaningful than English) and I will be reading it over and over throughout the years! Belle, tr&egrave;s belle!

1401307787|4.0|I loved this book. Great techniques for everyone. I loved that it promoted spirituality but left it open and available to people of all religions.  I do wish there was a tiny bit more variety and perhaps even tips on quick ways to pull ourselves out of the super charged world we live and into a place more comfortable to be \\"ourselves\\". That was my only desire. I'll probably re-read this book again and again over the years. Highly recommend!

THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I AM A HUGE SPARKS FAN!!!  LOOOVVVEEEE IT!!!!! :)
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Poor info for a $35 mystery set,what can I say, am looking for set which is not supposed to be available 'til July.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This film has such polarized reviews because it wasn't marketed properly, the marketing set up the expectation that it was a romantic comedy when it's not (that's the subplot), it's really a film about friendship - and - frenemies in particular.  It took me a second viewing to really get the film, honestly, because part way in I realized it wasn't a rom-com after all and I had to look at it from the frenemies perspective (and from that perspective this film is really good & really entertaining).  If you thought Darcy was likable and sympathetic, then you missed ALL the classic behaviors of a frenemy, but I've had several Darcys in my life (and even lost my Dex to one) so I could see it early on and I was firmly in Rachel's camp from beginning to end.  You can moralize about cheating, yes, but I believe what Ethan says - if no one's married yet there's still time to change your mind.  It was great to see a Rachel WIN finally!  Other than the marketing I have one major complaint about this film - the deleted scenes need to be IN the movie and at the very least should have been incorporated into the DVD version, instead of being relegated to the deleted scenes section, watch them and the film makes far more sense (no more deleted scenes sections on DVD!  Incorporate them!).  Finally high praise for the music because this film has one of the greatest soundtracks ever assembled.<br /><br />Go Rachel!<br />Go ALL the Rachels of the World!<br />Never take a back seat to a Darcy who'll steal & lie to make themselves feel more important (and do it at your expense!).<br />And Go Ethan!<br />(Loved Ethan)
0345803485|1.0|I am so confused as to why this book is so popular. It is poorly written and the story is slow moving and kind of boring. I kept reading it expecting it to pick up, but it never did. When I finally finished it, I could not imagine reading two more! Unfortunately, I found this book to be overrated, overhyped and a big disappointment.
B0086700CM|5.0|it took a while but its finaly here so exited this game is awesome I cant wait to start playing it again u should royalty get it
B007ZD17XO|5.0|super fun game! I haven't completely figured everything out yet, but that's a good sign about its long term playability.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day.  It's been really hard to stop playing.  Only complaint is that sometimes the controls don't work the way I want to until I zoom in.  Droid Bionic.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great app for hours of challenging puzzling. The squares could be a little bigger but truly is a lot of fun! Addicting for sure!

B00785P2QC|3.0|Very good game I enjoyed playing the version where I can move my buildings and objects. I also love the missions or goals to complete..but the old version was backing me into a wall
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|But I think it's an outstanding effort and a very interesting mix.  I don't care if he is using samples from other artists, the end-result is what matters to me and his mixes sound very creative.  I don't love all of the songs but I heard enough songs that made me pause and enjoy.  Finally someone is doing something innovative.  Favorite tracks:  2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally it's here!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been waiting FOREVER for this game to be on the android appstore!!!!!!!!!!!! And finally it IS here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =) =) =) =) =)

The original font, size, sections and everything was goood it is highly readable and i highly reccommend it.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Samsung Epic 4G Galaxy S1<br /><br />While this game is not best played on smaller screens, the touch sensitivity is remarkable for the app itself. The game as a whole is fun and addicting, and there are a good number of puzzles to keep a player occupied.<br /><br />Game occasionally freezes up my system. Couldn't not rate 5 stars based on that minor issue.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this on for the kindle fire. And I love this game so much its so much fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good to waste time and is fairly entertaining with the variety of games it offers so overall its just a fun and entertaining app
B0086700CM|1.0|It freezes and now I cant even play the game at all. Its so freaking annoying. When I bought the game I was super happy but once I played it for a while it started freezing up and choppy to where I could not see the place where I was and now I cant even open the file up. So annoying. If anyone has any advice to what I should do feel free to tell me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is pretty great, considering its price; its controls are quite fine and usuable, the games quite creative<br /> it is great for passing he time,  or entertaining a younster... enjoy!!
B0079R8KO0|4.0|This case is exactly as described.  The hard cover on the outside protects my Kindle while the soft cover on the inside keeps the screen free from scratches.  It also stands up beautifully while in landscape mode.  One thing that would have made this product even better would be the ability to stand up in portrait mode as well.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|It took forever for this film to come out, but it was worth it.  You can't have a great Easter film collection without this great addition.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app. the only problem is that u have to spend time and unlock each event. but overall it is an okay
