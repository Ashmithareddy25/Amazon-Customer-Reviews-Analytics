B0060D15AK|5.0|The acting is terrific, the story line is absolutely preposterous and the result is a great combination of fun and laughter!  This was an 'Amazon instant video' purchase that remains stored on Amazon. The streaming is smooth and the audio/visual is  excellent.  This is my preference as opposed to downloading the video to an electronic device. Simple, space saving and easy to access on multiple devices.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like facebook much better on the pc .  It is big on the Kindle so I don't use it very much
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The 5th book of this series begins before the 4th ends and goes from there as the story jumps from continent to continent, and from battlefield, to dark dungeon, to palace. It was a edge of your seat read that leaves you waiting for book 6.
0345529057|5.0|I love this series and HBO did a pretty great job adapting their mini series from these novels. I highly recommend reading the books before diving into the series.
B000003S5H|5.0|I received the goods in quick time and the wrapping was also suitable. The cd case was broken and I am not sure whether this happened in transit or was already broken upon sending. The cd itself is fine.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This album is a work of art- I haven't been this excited about music in awhile and I highly recommend both this disc and Paradise.
B008TA1SOU|5.0|A very good book that gives insight as to the Strategic Thinking that is required in running today's multifaceted Organisations.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game to play..like bejeweled but with bonus moves. the bonuses make the game more exciting and addictive to the player.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is great at simplifying the cleanup process. It is very intuitive to select operations with minimal selecting. Fantastic!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes my brain work. Great way to wake up in the morning and get the grey matter moving. Fun and free!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Let's bring on the 6th Season NOW!!! Can't imagine what they are going to do on the 6th season but whatever it is, I can't wait for it.
B00338QENI|5.0|The book itself was written very well regarding what transpired in Henrietta's life.  It's just sad that other human beings did really see her as one.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very entertaining. The last sentence of chapter 8 literally sent chills up my spine. Not grotesque, but there's some suspense. A fun break from reality.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|After about forty years of reading and studying everything I could get my hands on to try to make sense of the world, including Edgar Cayce, A Course in Miracles and Conversations With God I lucked out finding this little gem.  SIMPLE, clear explanation with experiments to help understanding and belief. I loved it and intend to pass it around.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|I and my daughter have been having a great time with this game. But I've gotten to a level that I can't get past... even with the tips. I figured the puzzle out before consulting the tips, but it was as I thought, and it just isn't working! The level I speak of is &#34;The Lost Temple&#34;.... I can't get past the eyes... I'm following the pattern, but nothing happens. :(
B0076DELIG|5.0|when the character exhibits the end justifies the means - its done in the right way - true examples of karma. Michael Connelly gets it perfect in every Bosch novel - another winner. my only suggestion for readers is try to start from the  beginning and follow the series as close in order as u can to truly understand Harry Bosch . NOW FOR Mr Connelly, plz plz on his last novel ( yrs from now) let him find his love, his soul mate, suited for him that neither has to change, with his daughter's blessing - we need to see his karma come true  & come around for all the ppl he has helped & fought, so they can b brought home to their family and friends &/or relief of the families finding closure. Both are so important to our hero- our harry :)
0143119680|1.0|I don't like writing negative reviews of books because I never want to hurt the authors feelings. I know that may sound ridiculous but that's how I roll. It's their art and very personal and I just can't write bad reviews. Until now. I'm about 100 pages in and I want my $12 back. This story had potential but nothing ever happens. The other negative reviews are correct. All the main character does is run, row a boat, stare at boring manuscripts in a library and do yoga. In a book full of daemons (demons???), vampires and witches, how could NOTHING happen? The author describes totally mundane events like 2 pages dedicated to a play by play of a uneventful pool game between a daemon and a vampire. I'm bored to tears and so annoyed I spent money on this book. I don't understand why it has so many great reviews. Does anyone have a recommendation for a TRUE adult Harry potter series? Something fun and thrilling but not too gory?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, and easy to play now away from laptop, but now it takes forever to get logged back into Facebook version.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I was impressed with this Blu Ray set for the Dark Knight Trilogy. This set includes Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises. Also included are bonus discs for The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, as well as a booklet containing concept art from the movie's creation. The movies by themselves are already wonderful masterpieces, and this set is a great option to buy all of them. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen these movies, it's a great buy!
078322737X|5.0|This has got to be the all time best  &#34;Teen Life in the 60's movie&#34;.  And talk about an all-star cast, a must see, for sure.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It is short and a comic book.boring. liked other diary of a wimpy kid books better. Don`t like this book
1476727651|5.0|Love this book! The last couple from King have been excellent. First Joyland and now Dr. Sleep.<br />I had hoped Danny would have grown up carefree but we knew that would never happen. Black House was a disappointing follow up to The Talisman, but that is not the case with Dr. Sleep.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad kindle fire finally added this app..have Ben sad without it on my kf..having more fun with my of now
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|...even more addictive now that I can play the REAL Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle! Great game, no flaws so far.
0385350864|1.0|I Loved Bridget Jones diary...and the movies...but this book is not good.Wish I had waited to get it and read reviews...not only is the British slang nearly impossible to decipher ,the whole premise of the book is just bad...get it at the library if you must!
1400032717|5.0|This story was recommended in a local newspaper article!  It is a story about a boy with autism and how his mind works!  He tries to solve the killing of a dog and, in the process, we learn how he thinks and approaches situations as well as the events surrounding him, family wise.  I couldn't put it down...........it was that engaging!  Highly recommended on an unusual and relevant topic!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|What can I say?  The wife likes Brad Pitt.  Surprised he isn't more selective about the movies he chooses.  You would think at some point you have enough money.  They did spend a lot of money on CG.
044024630X|5.0|Typical Jack Reacher stuff!  Not one of the best but still a good read as you try to understand, &#34;What the ????????&#34;.  If you like Reacher you will enjoy this adventure, I do/ did!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I AM SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME! I LOVE IT AND AT THE SAME TIME IT  AGGRAVATES ME!! GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!  :)
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I liked the movie mainly because it was an interesting mystery that was well told and not easily figured out. I find many movies telling the same story over and over, only with slight variation in characters and themes. This movie had a novel approach which I found refreshing. Will it make the century's top 10? Probably not. Also, if someone gives you too many details about it they move ruin seeing it for you. So, don't read too many detailed reviews. Order the movie, relax and enjoy. Oh, and I do think that it would be a nice family movie - if you children are at least 10 years old.
B0063IH60K|4.0|nothing to say about this product it is the same as the one on my computer that I play ok
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like it but a lot of things<br /> cost diamonds which are rare like in minecraft but instead of mining for them you buy them.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is the best app ever..easy to use..keeps my kindle in shape..lovely interface.<br />Even looks clean with its crisp blue colors...and its free.<br /><br />It can't get any better.<br />You won't be disappointed
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|If you're a gamer or if you use the latest Adobe CS6 tools with OpenCL support or if you use any other OpenCL capable applications this one will beat all the CPUs available on the market today even the latest Intel's Haswell CPUs.<br /><br />That doesn't mean you won't get a super fast x86 processor, but the GPGPU is the strength of this product over Intel's.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I usually don't write reviews on games... but this game is so fun... I'm 32, and I love this game. It is addicting... I could play it for hours. The sound effects are so cool. The  graphics are AMAZING!!!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|An easy way to remind yourself of things you want to get back to!!!  Love it and would recommend it, easy to do.
0141345659|5.0|Loved the book!!! Thought it was very well written. I loved the characters and the way they dealt with their illness.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Using her imagination to fill in the blanks of well researched recorded history, Ms. Gregory writes a spell-binding novel from the viewpoint of the youngest daughter of the man who was the power behind the throne in England in an age when women were valued for little more than their bloodlines which were perceived to give political power and financial advantage to their husbands.  It is a story of intrigue, fortitude and the survival of Anne Warwick in 15th century England when cousins and brothers stooped to murder and imprisonment of family members and raised armies to fight against each other for the right to retain or obtain the throne of England.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it it is awesome  I played a lot of levels I'm on level 10 so far waiting for the update awesome I recemend this app
B004CS7R70|5.0|I bought it for my mom, she's a low vision patient. Now she can read all the texts in the tv or cinema screen and see the faces clearly. She's happy and very thankful.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Can't stop playing it. My favorite puzzles to play. It don't take long to recharge your energy. It the kind of game that keeps you wanting to play. Hidden Mystery!!! Oh Yeah!!!!!!!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Rainbow Rowell writes beautifully.  The twins in this book reminded me so much of my nieces.  I work at a library and will be recommending Fangirl to adults as well as young adults.<br /><br />I've read all of this author's books and consider her an excellent addition to authors writing for our times.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy candy crush is now on Kindle! I've been waiting forever for it.to he on here. I hate playing games on my phone because with everything else on the phone it kills the battery so quick and I actually need my phone to be a phone so it can't be dead all the time! So happy I get to play it on my kindle now!!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|amazing 80's movie, a true original classic not to be missed a masterpiece in my eyes, a very sweet movie parents and kids can enjoy, goonies never say die!
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Really like this movie for the scenery and the story. It makes one think- what sacrifices would one make for true love?
B004I1K2NW|5.0|this is yet another great movie by Peter Jackson a must see if you enjoy nice movies with comedy and horror, nice to see Michael J. Fox
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read every book written and the shining was one of my favorites and Jack Nicholson was the perfect person for the part. My first book was Salem\\"s lot which scared the cheap out of me at 15. I am now in my 50's and still read and watch everything Stephen King has created! He is by far the most spectacular author out there! It was a great follow up to the shining and even leaves an opening for A bra' s future choices ( Rose' s replacement LOL). Keep on writing and I will keep on reading...I look forward to being a 90 something little old lady still devouring Kings works!!!!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Enjoyed a different take on the usual &#34;zombie&#34; movie that seems to be the &#34;new&#34; old type of movie these days. Worth the watch if you enjoy these types of movies..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had fun with this, want more. It had a few good puzzles that stumped me for a bit but not too hard.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting forever for this app for my kindle. My laptop bit the dust so I use my kindle for just about everything. Now I can play and catch up to my friends on candy crush. Yay!! Works great no problems.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I purchased this combo 3D/Blue-ray/DVD/Digital DL on amazon to see how well they did the 3D.  It turns out that the 3D effects were nearly non-existent.  Sure, the menus were done in 3D, but that was pretty much it.  There were no unique scenes or moments which they chose to make stand out, which you would expect if you were paying more for this 3D version.<br /><br />My advice is to get the regular Blue-ray combo and save some money.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul McCartney's latest offering \\"New\\" offers energetic, melodic, sturdy, inspired songs that are edgy and have a distinctly modern sound. It's been noted everywhere that Mr. McCartney has used the services of four different producers here, with Giles Martin putting it all together in a very cohesive package.      Paul works in two modes here, most of the songs he uses his cracker jack touring band and the three songs with Paul Epworth, it's just Mr. Epworth on Drums and Macca on everything else. These compositions contain lots of psychedelic flourishes with fat guitar in a very wide range of styles, there's virtually no one out there offering this kind of varied mature writing that is deceptively complex in its scope and execution.      Paul is all over the map with this one and it makes for quite a ride from beginning to end. \\"Save Us\\" opens the proceedings with a spiky punk rocker with a terrific vocal. \\"Alligator\\" is an acoustic driven  shuffle that is fast paced and edgy with great fuzz tone guitar hooks and a really cool, spacey section that comes out of nowhere.  \\"On My Way To Work\\" offers solid lyrics where the protagonist describes his daily commute and his girlie magazine reference is priceless, the musical highlight being the heavy oriental sounding passage with substancial guitar. The song \\"Early Days\\" is a narrative about his teenage days with John Lennon looking for both inspiration and an audience for their songs, moving and memorable, with a swipe at critics and biographers who weren't there, potent stuff.  \\"I Can Bet\\" is sort of a modern Wings song that propels along with cheeky vocals, a refrain to die for and a completely unexpected moog synth solo.  \\"Appreciate\\" is an unusual track that is based on one chord swinging between major and minor with a very modern beat and various psychedelic sounds that builds to great atmospheric guitar at the end.      This album is rich with superb songs, brimming with musical ideas that span across the spectrum;songs like \\"Everybody Out There\\" with its tasty acoustic guitar riff and \\"Queenie Eye\\" with the infectious chorus and mixture of retro and cutting-edge sounds.  The extra songs are essential, the catchy fast paced \\"Turned Out\\" continues the melodic innovative sounds and the great bluesy \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\"  that would be a perfect acoustic fit for Eric Clapton, you gotta love that self-effacing humor when Paul sings out, \\"I'm a Celebrity\\". Indeed.      Mr. McCartney biggest gift is his ability to compose melodic, inventive, varied music. What he does here on \\"New\\" is marry that gift to contemporary sounds and technology in a thrilling 54 minutes.    Additional Comments 11/14/14: Just bought the \\"NEW\\" Collector's Edition Hard Cover Book Version. The 3 extra songs: \\"Demon's Dance\\", \\"Hell To Pay\\" and \\"Struggle\\" are stellar editions to an already Stellar Album. The First two songs are piano based rockers and \\"Struggle\\" is an interesting Avante Guarde piece. The live tunes included are reproduced very well in his live act. The DVD isn't indispensible but the 3 additioanl tunes certainly are. A great CD just got better.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|The script and plot was weak.  Multiple times I guessed what was going to happen next, but it was an entertaining diversion.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Something that you should look & read into on your happy days for a reminder of the reality of the world around you. After that all the other days would look slightly less cloudier. It did for me ... I hope it would for you too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the fact that Candy Crush is now on my Kindle. It is user-friendly and very convenient. A great tool to help in my quest to conquer tree the levels.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie...get it.  It's one of my top 5 of all time.  Excellent, classic, amazing flick.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is the fourth Groban CD we own, and there is always room for his articulate, sensitive and just plain fun vocals. Having a down day? Groban will pick up one's spirits.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book certainly was magical.  The author's use of imagery and description were incredible, and oh... what an incredible imagination.  Having said all of that, I became bored with too much description, not enough substantive character development, too many characters and some baffling events which, even after finishing the book, I still didn't understand.  This book was recommended to me because I was a fan of the Harry Potter and the Hunger Games series.  I can understand the connection in that all three are of the magical sci fi genre, but I did not enjoy this as much as the others.  Toward the end, I found myself counting how many more pages were left.  Never a good sign for a book.  I would, however, love to see this made into a movie, though I fear that much would be lost in the process.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|One to watch over and over, the imagination of plot and the tight script, and the typical neurotic quirky acting in a Woody Allen movie makes it fun. It ranks with Annie Hall as an all-time favorite, and whether or not this plot is plausible, it doesn't mean it's not possible. My thanks to EM Forster's Celestial Omnibus for its component in this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|So tasty, so typically Stephen King!  A wonderful extension and reawakening of The Shining.  A vivid portrayal of the unimaginable fringes of those who may exist among us.
B00452J5IW|4.0|So typical of modern releases of old, good albums, are the addition of unnecessary extras just to fill space because it's there to fill. Sticking with the core album is needed.<br /><br />and...I love the original album, and it's hard to believe after 42 years since first buying it on vinyl, I still like it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|5 star service from seller, 4 star for movie. Haven't seen extras and probably won't view since it takes away from just enjoying the movie.
B0018BB20W|5.0|We bought the CD in time for hearing the current Moody Blues in concert in Denver, and I think I fully understand their complex compositions and instrumentals. Their distinctive vocal, bass and flute sound prevail beginning to end. In this case, their extras added to the original album compliment, not detract.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game. I love the puzzles. wish you could have more time to search in rooms sometimes. overall fun free game.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I have never seen the first show and have been hoping to do so.  So it was great to finally see it and I enjoyed it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|You can download this game at no cost, but playing is not free. I would much rather pay a nominal fee up front for a game rather than paying to continue playing.  I will not be recommending this to anyone.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|The Croods was a great family movie.  We saw it at the drive in first, and then had to rent it through Amazon again because my kids really wanted to see it again.  It was funny without being inappropriate.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for putting this on the Kindle....so much fun! I have been playing this on my phone and it's nice to have a bigger screen.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|I think Blondie was responsible for the best &#34;New Wave&#34; available  I give it partial credit for dragging us out of &#34;disco&#34;, which had to happen. Anyone who likes a talented woman fronting a rock group needs to listen.. Destri, Stein & Burke deserve more credit than they sometimes receive.
B003B02O14|5.0|Another smash hit for Mr. Grisham.  A true page turner, smooth plot and exciting read.<br />Keep up the great work and for the readers, Don't hesitate to jump into this one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad that the app is finally available for the fire. I use this game as a reward for myself once I finish tasks around the house. Good game to keep your mind alert and concentrated!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great story line, character development, action, and graphics.  Really enjoyed it.  Unlike so many films these days, this one provided something for almost everyone.
B00G24KKAS|5.0|I tried watching TWD in HD and did not like it: too much clarity can kill the show's visual aesthetic. If it were only available in HD I wouldn't watch the series -- it makes that much of a difference.
B005LAIIGM|4.0|Other reviews will tell you more about the plot of \\"Gravity,\\" a story about two astronauts, avuncular veteran Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and nervous rookie Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who get lost in space. I am not qualified to talk about the technical stuff and won't try. I'm also not a science fiction fan: I've never seen \\"2001\\" and if I saw \\"Alien,\\" I've forgotten it, which I mention only because so many other reviewers are comparing \\"Gravity\\" to those films. We saw \\"Gravity\\" because Alfonso Cuaron directed it, and he made \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" the least popular but our family's favorite film in that series.<br /><br />Everything you've heard about the physical beauty of this movie is true. The dialogue won't win any awards for originality. The characterizations are thin. I suspect that's intentional. By giving us cipher characters and words we are expecting amidst the stunning action set pieces and carefully chosen visual triggers (a fork, an icon of St. Christopher carrying the infant Jesus across the water, a Buddha), Cuaron makes it easy for the audience, male and female, to project ourselves into the situations and ask ourselves the movie's questions:<br /><br />What does an individual life mean?<br />Why would anyone want to live?<br />Is there independent value in human life, or is it just evolutionary imperative?<br />Can we be saved, or must we save ourselves?<br />Does God exist?<br />If God exists, is a personal God with us, or is God simply a causation that leaves us alone in the universe?<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that the panicky Ryan Stone character is annoying. You could say that, but I think it shows a startling lack of empathy and an obsession with the technical question of whether NASA would really send someone of that disposition into space that disregards the movie's themes. What should have been a routine trip for someone who is not an astronaut by trade has turned into the equivalent of telling a first-time boater that they're going rowing on a calm shallow lake and then tossing them into a raging hurricane on the open ocean. It's a metaphor for what happened to Dr. Stone back home: she sent her four-year-old daughter to preschool and the child died playing tag. Events of what should have been an ordinary day call into question everything Dr. Stone knows and feels about why she lives and why she would want to live. I'd  be freaking out and I bet you would too. I've never had much use for Sandra Bullock, but her performance in \\"Gravity\\" won me over.<br /><br />PARENT NOTE: The movie has some swearing and scary images. Our ten-year-old found the movie both interesting and frightening.
B0039208JE|4.0|There was so much hype back in 1989 that it's easy to forgot this is actually a good movie.  More a Burton film than a Batman film, the aesthetic is suitably bizarre.  Extra features are expansive, considering the best they could hope for in '89 was a spot on Entertainment Tonight.
B001AEF6BI|2.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Either I was way too old to see this movie for the first time or I have never fully recovered from being a high school outcast. Notwithstanding its cinematic merits (working with a tiny budget, writer-director  John Hughes gets some nice performances out of his cast) it struck me as pure fairy tale. If I'd seen it when I was younger, maybe some combination of my desire to believe in it and my angst-ridden sympathy with the characters would have made me love it. But at my age, I didn't. I still love Hughes's \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" because it does not strive to be more than the charming frothy fantasy it is. \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" despite a few jokes at the expense of the vice principal \\"supervising\\" the detention, takes itself way too seriously.<br /><br />You have high-school types: a quirkily attractive delinquent stoner (Judd Nelson), a conventionally good-looking athlete (Emilio Estevez), an affluent pink prom princess (Molly Ringwald), a straight-A nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and a misfit (Ally Sheedy). They all do a Saturday of detention together. Initially they dislike each other, but having nothing to do to alleviate their boredom other than talk to each other, they come to realize that each of them is more than a type as they bare their souls about their problems with school, their parents, sexuality and their cliques (or lack of a clique in Sheedy's case). They get high. By mid-afternoon, Hall's character says he now considers them all friends. Ringwald's character disagrees, certain that even though they may have bonded during their day of detention, on Monday morning, they'll be back with their cliques and ignoring each other in the halls.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, Ringwald's character makes over Sheedy's character and turns her from a black-clad, black-eyelinered pre-goth to another pink princess and Estevez's wrestler is in love with Sheedy. Virginal Ringwald is in love with delinquent stoner Nelson and plans to date him to get even with her parents. Hall gets over not getting an A in shop class.<br /><br />I was some combination of Hall and Sheedy's characters. Occasionally in high school I would be thrown in to a situation where I was alone with a girl like Ringwald's character or a guy like Nelson or Estevez's characters and have what I thought was a profound conversation that meant we could be friends, only to find that Ringwald's character was right: Within a couple of days, they stopped seeing or hearing me when I tried to say hello in the halls.<br /><br />I know I'm in the minority, and maybe I'm just bitter, but I thought \\"The Breakfast Club\\" was selling a lie and not selling it at all convincingly.
0307477479|4.0|Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad is a narrative adventure, often challenging and often perplexing. There's a minimally-defined cast of characters, some more prominent than others, whom we drop in on at various points in their lives. I recommend approaching Goon Squad more as a series of moments and moods than looking for some grand, all-encompassing design.<br /><br />But in spite of the tangled plot, I never once ceased to enjoy Egan's style. The stage she sets is enticing even if events start jumping around after a while. There's one chapter in particular, delivered entirely as amateur Power Point slides, which I feel works perfectly but is sure to frustrate most readers as unconventional.
B005L38QK2|5.0|probably the best deal i HAVE SEEN seen in awhile your getting a $70 mouse for dirt cheap because of branding what else could u want!!?
0374533571|5.0|I saw the David O'Russell film and loved it, but I never thought of picking up the novel. If I see a great movie based on a book and then read the book, I often find the experience underwhelming. My wife recommended this one and thank goodness I listened. The Silver Linings Playbook is marvelous.<br /><br />The most surprising discovery, if you see the movie first, is that the book goes in different directions around the halfway point. Fundamentally, the movie and the book are the same—similar character arcs, that is—but it's a treat to see how Matthew Quick originally envisioned the story. And I loved the montage scene!
B009RX8AQW|2.0|Never got the product.  What is Amazon turning into?  A rip off place?  That is 3 products I have ordered lately and only got one of them.  What is with this?
0345529057|5.0|I bought these for my husband as he is a huge fan of the TV show.  He loved them and couldn't put them down
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting and lots of fun.  Wish you had more than five lives to use but otherwise I highly recommend this game for all ages.
B00EV6T6DQ|1.0|Update 12-13-13:  There was some type of update pushed for this to make it read easier, I don't see a difference, I stick by my original review.<br /><br />I wish I would have read the reviews on this for the Kindle.  I bought it, but didn't try to read it right away.  It is impossible to enjoyably read on the Kindle.  There is a feature where you can tap on the comic cells and bring them up larger, but still it's not that large and it's a pain in butt to have to keep tapping the cells to read them.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I enjoyed this book about the forming of habits. An easy enjoyable read with great stories and examples. It has piqued my interest in habits in my life!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The device is fast, easy to use and had made watching my favorite shows 100 times more convenient. I look forward to more apps being released but it already world's with all my movie and TV show needs.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Previous PSB albums, except Yes, were more melancholic and laid back. I think Electric is completely different in sounds, production and lyrics, they return to dance music in a great way. The duo take a step forward in his career, the tunes sound more futuristic but without forget its roots from eighties. I recommend it!
0949551147|5.0|O.K. a fabulous book for any beginning or advanced yoga student.  Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha.  Do I need to say more.  Each topic is covered in detailed.  This book will make it perfectly clear what is meant by the terminology and will teach you everything about it.  Highly recommend.

B000002LGW|5.0|Already own this but bought it as a present for a relative. One of the best Depeche Mode compilations ever.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|I didn't expect much from a free video player but it locates the videos and plays them. What more could I ask for?
1250038820|5.0|I have followed Humans of New York's Facebook page for years. I am proud to be a New Yorker, and to support such a kind-hearted and genuine individual such as Brandon Stanton. This book doesn't disappoint.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|I won't go into a detailed review of this book because that has pretty much been done already. My one input into the book is this:<br /><br />Not the salon that I went to or the book has said what to do for your SECOND day.  How to get my hair to look as good the second day as first day without wetting and washing my hair again.  There is really no discussion of methods, only the recipes.<br /><br />Hence the 4 star review.
1465408681|5.0|This is a gift for my grandson.  He hasn't been given it yet but this is on his Christmas list.  I have to start shopping early for him since everything needs to be mailed.
B00FXEL00W|3.0|The book for me was a decent start for a new writer. However, the characters were a bit whiny and hard to understand. I felt like there was this huge build up and when they finally did get together it was a huge let down on how it was written. I really liked the idea behind the book but I feel like it could have been executed better.
B00A2H9WW8|5.0|When I left the theatre, the rest of the day all I thought about was this movie. Before any hardcore fan's of the original jump and call me stupid, realize that I love the original and I'm actually open minded to giving re-makes a try.<br /><br />Chloe Grace Moretz portrays her so well, that I actually felt so sorry for her and the brutal bullying she encountered by her peers. I was actually in awe when the ending came because I didn't want to see her die. Julianne Moore, wow.. she played Carrie's mother so well. The entire movie she came off as a over the top religious woman that was so enclosed by her religion that it was actually scary. This movie is not a 'jump and scream' type horror movie by no means. It's more of an emotional horror where you feel extremely sorry for Carrie and scared by the actions of her mother, peers and how she deals with it all in the end. Note: Creepy is an un-fitting word for Carrie's mother, Margaret White, whom is far worse than creepy. Psychotic? Definitely. The suspense or action doesn't take long to get too, which I loved. Why did I give it five stars, you ask? I gave it five stars because this movie DID indeed need a remake, well for me it did at least, and they hit the nail on the head with this one. I absolutely love it, and have watched it at least five times since it's release. Not everyone always likes watching a movie made in the 70's. I do love the original but I have to say that this one came pretty close in my opinion. Of course you have all the cult classic fan-boy's that will say no Carrie is as good as Sissy Spacek, which might be true but that's only because that's the first version they seen of Carrie and fell in love with that one. People need to realize that re-makes will be forever be made and just because the original cast isn't in it DOES NOT mean that it's automatically a horrible move. This movie is far from horrible. If you've seen Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass as Hit Girl, please know that her performance in this one steers a complete 180 away from how she was in that movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm an open minded person and I love giving new things a try. My review is that this movie is just as good as the original one with Sissy Spacek as Carrie. I say that because the 2013 version with Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie is far more in depth (story wise) than the original and the ending is much, much, much more heart pounding and more true to the book. All I can really say is I'm writing this review because I actually came on here to pre-order this movie on blu-ray (that's how good it was for me).in this one steers a complete 180 away from how she was in that movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm an open minded person and I love giving new things a try.

B00502ATUO|5.0|&#34;Streetwise&#34; a little know album here in the states but it did pick up a lot of underground radio play.  Brian Auger, was quite the young keyboard wiz kid.  If a band needed a keyboard fill in they used Brian Auger. You could here Brian on Cream albums, The Who, etc.  Julie much the same story.  A studio junkie, when a band needed a female to fill in,  there was Julie.  I'm not sure how they got together but when they did they made magic.  This was the first album that got picked up by a major label and boy did it get the positive reviews.  A lotta rock, some jazz, and some some really nice blues, &#34;Streetnoice&#34; had it all.  If you liked the music of the late 60's this is an album that will fit right into your collection.  I like Delanie and Bonnie a little better but when it came to the Hammond, nobody but nobody could outplay Brian Auger. Fast and fun, take a ride on &#34;Streetnoise&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would say I almost love it but, I have a tv in the family room and one in my bed room and every time you move it you have to reload it. It's not hard to reload it but it's annoying.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I have been told after level 13 I will either need to pay to play or play on Facebook. I do not use Facebook so I guess I will be uninstalling this game!!!!
B0045LK31Q|3.0|The Orb presents long grooves of typically groovey electro-ambient whatnots, but Gilmour sounds like he's snoozing his way through a 40 minite introduction to &#34;the Wall.&#34;  Not that this is necesarily a bad thing, but I was expecting something more from Gilmour.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This is short and sweet. I absolutely love this movie! It has a ton of action, great effects, great acting, and a great story. It made me laugh, jump, sit on the edge of my seat, and even cry. I would recommend this in a heartbeat.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|A perfect gift for a child of any age: it's Creepy, has independent leg movements, and is easy to control...my 5-yr-old loves it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was like sewing a beautiful quilt it intertwined two stories connecting Molly and Vivian.  I COULD not put it down as I connected with being an orphan of sorts myself.  I for most of my adult life have wanted to go visit Maine....in a way Mrs Kline sent me there even if not to real places I could see the sea from the mansion Vivian lived in I could smell the sea air.  Above all filled me with hope for the orphans.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|I like it protects my screen and phone at the same time....plus it is something everyone doesn't have and is an eye catcher

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Blah... this book was so over-rated. It was like reading a teenagers diary.  So far fetched.  And Anastasia is completely annoying
B0031RS9MU|5.0|Excellen read, immediately capable of implementing it.I finished it in one night and absorbed and practically put to use. I would recommend  for all managers and management students
0618918248|3.0|Somebody's got to write this way. He did.<br />It appears to me he is fighting radical religion the same way radical religion gains followers; highly opinionated while not providing anyone solutions to figure things out for themselves.<br />I think what's more important is the reason a person relies on religion, and how often throughout the day they rely.<br />Dawkins is delusional, to think that he can convince me he has a solution, without providing me what atheists do so that they do not rely on religion.<br />I write he missed the mark, because I think he left out crucial content. Find one person who was at one point radically religious, but now is content atheist. Write about all the reasons they relied on religion. Then write about how the person transitioned to not relying on religion.

1451650728|5.0|Bought this for my hubby at his request and he said it was great. Said it was a new twist on an old favorite. He's read just about every Star Trek book ever written so he ought to know. He read all three books and would recommend them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited I can play cc on my kindle fire!! Great game just wish we could get more than 5 lives and move up without tickets.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|1984 was/ is. This tries to be. It is provocative, no doubt, and surely deserves thought. The fantasy, however, is just that.only fantasy. It' a quick and good read but wholly unbelievable. A tribute to the writer for keeping the reader engaged. I doubt I would read anything else.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this calculator just fine. It only displays in the letter view however, not in the landscape view. I don't know why but that is a minor flaw and easily overlooked.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I waited a long time to get this.  The fact that it was on best book lists actually made me want to skip it.  I don't like mysteries that are also &#34;literature&#34;.  A friend read it & swore I'd like it, so I bought it.  It is a good book, with many surprising twists.  I do think it was too wordy, but overall I really enjoyed it.  I really liked the ending, even though a lot of others did not.  I like that it leaves you hanging & I've found myself thinking about it a lot, which I consider high praise.  If you're on the fence & enjoy dateline & 48 hours style shows, this book puts an interesting spin on them.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|Season 1 of white collar is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. I know this show has been out for awhile but I don't watch alot of tv and what I do watch I must have missed this one. All the actors are very good and the story lines have been so interesting that you forget about time cause it just goes so fast.<br />I would recommend this show to everyone who has never seen it you won't be sorry
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I started reading it and I didn't put it down till finished.  What a man, what a story, what a loss.  The book is well written and easy to read.<br />Wish it had a different end.  But this is life.  At its best and its worse.<br />Read it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I simply cannot believe this book could receive anything over 1 star. Maybe 2, on a good day.<br /><br />To start, the mass amount of spelling, punctuation and other grammar errors are completely unacceptable. It is obvious that this book was not proofread or edited in any way.<br /><br />The description of this book, in which it was likened to other fantasy epic authors such as J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini and J.R.R. Tolkien is a serious insult to each of those authors. In no way, in no universe, can this book or series of books ever be likened to said authors.<br /><br />I will admit, the first few chapters of the book had me intrigued. Typical fantasy plot, boy coming of age etc story, but interesting enough to get me to read a few chapters in. But, after a few chapters, the books major flaws became evident. For starters, chapters are around 2-4 pages long. I have seen better story and paragraph structure from high-school students papers. Intriguing plot quickly becomes garbage, riddled with cliches. Characters are not developed upon, simply generic and shallow. The plot itself, well there are not even words to describe.<br /><br />The title of the book is the most confounding part. &#34;A Quest for Heroes&#34;. By the end of book one, (which ends abruptly, absurdly even), there is no quest. There is no hero. There is a boy who hitched a ride in a wagon to a castle. The &#34;quest&#34; portion of this book took all of 2 sentences. Ridiculous is the only word I can use to describe this.<br /><br />The fact that Amazon would allow the sale of this book, and would allow the inflated reviews(outright lies), makes me question Amazon, Kindle, and the entire ecosystem here. I will be refraining from purchasing any books from Amazon for the near future. Absolute dribble in this book. Dedicating any more time to the review is giving it more time than it deserves. Stay away from it, and this author.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|Jimi was and always will be the man. This is just beautiful music and my personal favorite of his three original albums. If you want to get lost in great music, go and buy this album.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|works ok so far.  still need to learn on how to use everything yet.  had help to install.  thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game is awesome it is a perfect game for pepole that love horses and there is so many cool horses I totally recommend this FREE! game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game but wish there were more rooms. I got to level 10 and then it said to rate and more games soon.
B000VZD8TO|5.0|I lost my son unexpectedly and I was grieving and felt empty. My friend recommended this to me and I would recommend  this to anyone
B00ET9T2WK|4.0|It is a good game but I attacked somebody and when I tried to get my units back it kept going to the home screen of my kindle but otherwise it's a good game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|the game is so fun there's holiday bingo regular and slots you could also have up to four card's. the finest is two cards to me.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Story line good with twists and turns but a couple of somewhat odd notes to tie it all together. Won't say what but this seems weaker than the other books and the two problems I have with the book are probab<br />Y the result of a lazy editor or mr  child thinking he can put no foot wrong.  You will enjoy the ride but the after taste here is not satisfying.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Pleasantly surprised.  Kids loved the movie and it was clean enough for them to watch it!  About time there is a good themed robot movie without a scantily clad &#34;actress&#34; prancing around who can't remember lines like a similar movie....  Thumbs up!
B0083DJWGO|4.0|The Anti-Fragile idea remains just beyond the grasp.  Robustness becomes much better understood, and the principles of Anti-Fragile actually made me change my investment strategies (I have since made SDS about 10% of my portfolio).  But I have ended up recommending the book to several people whose life philosophies seem to verge on the Anti-Fragile.  Well worth reading to become a part of your life choices.
B000003BZ4|5.0|I freaking love this album.  I've been a fan of Government Mule for years now, and I finally got around to purchasing their debut.  My favorites on this one are Painted Silver Light and Temporary Saint.
1250038820|5.0|I gave this to my 11 year old for her birthday. We follow HONY online and this book was such a terrific and special gift. Buy it.
B009NX1YT6|4.0|This is an old favorite and for those who like musicals ... or dancing .. or remember in part the 50's ... it's a great glimpse into the past.  The actors are younger (we remember them as we remember ourselves) younger, more agile, a bity nutty and it's all reflected here.<br /><br />My kids enjoy the movie as well - it has a bit of something for everyone.  High school for most of us was a terrifying place and Grease manages to show the lighter - and sometimes the heavier side.  Its a bit flip about many of the issues -- but its a musical remember, and so it gets 4 rather than 5 stars..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So good ,it is a must have, you literally are some where different each week.it is sick ,it is really fun at Halloween + Christmas.if your looking for a new fun hobbie or activity ,YOU MUST GET THIS.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Protect the screen and keeps it clean.  Very stylish and not bulky.  I really like the Double Dip Flip option.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this while traveling recently.  It was well written and (spoiler alert) they kill Osama Bin Laden.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game; somewhat challenging. Definitely enjoyed playing. I would recommend it for anybody who likes brain teasers. The only drawbacks would be the small field of play on each level; challenge would be enhanced by larger rooms or carry over from one level to the next.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is a great Collection of all Rocky Movies in Blu-Ray format, It comes in only one small box. All are in excellent quality image and sound. Rocky I came in the original quality and sound quality.
B0049PNOMS|5.0|i love this i remember seeing this when i was a kid this DVD is a 2 disk set and i love the fact that it has A sleeve.  quite a bit of features.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is okay but if your`e not in a WiFi zone it cuts your videos short and sometimes it doesn't finish your downloads fully,but it runs really smoothly for me.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|a great kid movie about a house that this guy that uses his house as a plane to travel the world.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is one of the very few t.v. dramas with episodes that allow for equally enjoyable multiple viewings. The plotting is consistently well thought out and delivered surprises at almost every turn, unlike more traditional shows that basically spill the beans to even the dimmest viewer in the first ten minutes.  Some of the series success should probably be attributed to the casting director who hired actors every week that defied stereotyping: there weren't a lot of actors whom you could immediately suspect because you'd seen them play villains in other programs.<br /><br />An unexpected benefit of buying the first season was that, even though I thought that I had seen every episode last winter, I discovered four that I had somehow missed.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|this is a funny great new version of an old story.  quite a bit of features of each disk.  jim carry plays as most of the characters.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very cool adventure. Lots of hidden items. Definitely will purchase more of these games. The app has great hints and is easy to follow
B002M9WW30|5.0|The title should be all thats necessary. It's all the Rocky movies on bluray. If you love underdog stories and/or have already seen Rocky, you want to get this :) I got the whole collection on a golden deal sale for really cheap :) worth it
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|Son loved this set. So excited to get it because he is a Minecraft fan.  He used his birthday money to purchase.  It is a lot of tiny pieces but he didn't seem to mind.  He wants to collect all of the Minecraft sets now.  I think it was overpriced for the size and even though it has lots of pieces they are so tiny.  I would wait to buy this if it ever goes on sale.  $25 or less would be a good price to get these at.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Nice new ideas instead of the typical regurgitated love story. I really liked the main character. Definitely will read again and recommend this to others.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Good condition<br />I was disappointed . The DVD was made in Mexico.<br />Because I saw it at the theater, I knew some of the scenes were edited.<br />I wanted the theater version.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Wild, crazy ride. Graphic and intense. A real misfit of a lead character that I learned to love from the first page. Well done.
B00CV1PGUK|5.0|Classic Tom Keifer! Love it! Best work since Long Cold Winter! Tom sounds better than ever!  Very hard to say what's my favorite on the LP!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Not for the weak at heart. This is strong stuff, delivered with gut wrenching candor. I loved the lead character immediately. I was sorry to see the book end.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|It was a good movie with a good cast, but way too violent for me! And kind of predictable too.
B00CATSONE|3.0|It's like the cliff notes of a biography. You get a bunch of facts quickly and then you are done. The book ended rather abruptly. I'd love to have seen this fleshed out with something other than opinions about what is genius. Tesla was a remarkable man. Send the author back to the writers room to do it again. Same author mind you, he does a good job presenting what he does. He just doesn't do enough. Give me more more more.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Easy to play &amp; fun to create an under the sea paradise.<br />Beautiful graphics fun to play even without having to purchase extra items with cash.
0062283553|3.0|Would have liked more about the science, rather than his early childhood, altho that was interesting, it was too large a portion of the CD
B005K17RU0|5.0|One of the best apps on my Kindle.<br /><br />Precise weather info. Even hourly temperature readings.<br /><br />Get it. You will be glad you did.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|I have a few other movies with Simon Pegg and friends and there all very good .this one is not your standard dead movie i enjoyed it
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|There was more blood than needed. I would have enjoyed the movie if the blood was at least cut in half.
B0019I6WDG|4.0|The movie Juno is a good movie to show to people who are curious about what happens during pregnancy. It shows that sometimes, if you get carried away and you have unprotected sex, it leads to tons of hardships. Hardships like being judged by peers around school, being judged even by family and friends, financial issues that will arise, and also the big question of, \\" Do I keep it? \\" In Juno, that's what it depicts.<br />What I liked about the movie is that it does show some of the facts and truths about pregnancy and what people have to deal with. Something I disliked on the other hand, is that I don't like the idea of the medical finances being paid for, it doesn't really show how hard it can being during pregnancy costs. Not everyone gets lucky enough to find people to cover the costs. Another thing that was something I didn't like was how cheesy it got at some points, but that's just an opinion.<br />Would I recommend this to people? Yes, I would recommend this to people, especially those who can relate to the topic or are just curious at the topic in general. It can really open your eyes to the stress and hurt a woman can have while being pregnant. It also has some comedic aspects to it as well as a lot of drama and romance. If you're into that genre of movies, I'd highly recommend this movie to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a long book but its worth it. If you haven't read the hunger games yet read it I recommend it.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I have read this book a few times and still can't get enough of it. I will say that is starts out with a horrible tragedy, but turns into one of the best books I have read in awhile.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|This tale is a real sci-fi enjoyable one. Could it happen? Who knows? But wouldn't you fight to stay human too?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking Up Married is an interesting take on the Vegas nuptuals that happen everyday. Megan wakes up to find out that she is married to Connor after a good and drunk night, but can't remember anything that happened to get them married. They find themselves in the situation of one wanting to stayed married and the other thinking she made a huge mistake. They try everything they can to keep the feelings out of the entire situation, but find that they can't. It's a good book that makes you want this for yourself and it's very easy to fall into the characters in the book
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Still loving Chris Pine as Kirk. I wasn't a HUGE fan of the original series but LOVE seeing how the new take on these old characters plays out.
B0000WPADK|1.0|It came in a million little pieces!  Nowhere in the ad did I see that it said it came in so many pieces that would have to be put together and even if someone did have the time and patience to put it together, a child could not play with it.  I was looking for a small train that a 5 year old could carry around and play with on the floor.  I thought that would be what I was getting with a caption that read &#34;Big Boy Locomotive&#34;.  We were very disappointed and had to go out and buy my son another train that he could actually play with.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So glad that this upgraded to match Facebook.  Now I can play anywhere! It is hours worth of fun and I enjoy it so much.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I bought this CD for a friend and she loves it.  In fact, we're going to see him in concert soon.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited to see this app for kindle!!!  My son is excited too because I won't be stealing his iPod anymore, lol.  It also works on our original kindle fire.
0307593525|5.0|Received it in perfect condition. It is definately a good gift to any cooking person. I do even feel sorry, thta it is such a pretty book, because now I have to use while cooking, and I am afraid of spoling it with my ingridients, oil and etc.<br />But never the less, I love it and I will use it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book, but it is definitly focused on the teenage reader.  It's still a good story and the movies will be good, so you might as well read the series.  But don't expect anything spectacular.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Well written tale set in China as horror upon horror was about to become common place.<br />I recommend this book if you like historical intrigue!
159668139X|5.0|Easy to follow, comprehensive and a must for a beginner. Chandler took the mystery and apprehensiveness out of some basic weaving techniques
1451673442|5.0|If you can be consistent in your reading and following the simple steps in each lesson, your life is bound to improve.
B00008O89K|5.0|This was a must have for me. I was a big fan of the coundtrack, maybe it had something to do with the fact that I heard the music over and over again on saturdays growing up when Conan would play on the local channels.
B000VHXD7O|1.0|This movie we stopped watching after about 20 minutes of boredom. Poorly written and directed and acted. Not worth your time.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Conventional wisdom has led us to a dismal place of health.  Dr. Perlmutter has a compelling and well verified alternative to convention that can and will change your life.  Clear and devoid of hype, he makes the argument against a grain based life a compelling one.  Easy to follow and read, it's well worth your attention and as a counter to the hype of big Pharma, USDA, FDA, AMA conventional wisdom that does little but line the pockets of those peddling the latest snake oil.  Well worth the investment of time...
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a moving book about a young girl who has overcome tragedies and obstacles many of us cannot even imagine.
B001VNB54A|4.0|The second best HBO miniseries behind Band of Brothers. I didn't connect as well with the characters in Pacific as I did with Band of Brothers, but then I haven't watched Pacific 50 times as I have with BoB. Surely a classic, though.
B002N57KG2|5.0|laugh laugh laugh......great fun too watch, too bad not more out takes which were very funny. you can tell that<br />they had fun making this  movie
B00129H7VS|5.0|The best HBO miniseries ever. One of the best World War II movies ever. It is a must see if you are a war movie enthusiast.  Buy this movie!
B0016CVN02|5.0|I love the Stones -- what can I say?  I've seen them in concert three times.  They are totally awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game is ridiculous and frustrating because they want you to pay for additional lives to clear levels--this bums kids out because some of the levels are hard! $1 for 15 more seconds of game play? No thanks. Big thumbs down for this one.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|As any visual translation from a book it can never be precisely accurate to the source material but in this case it is very close. George R.R. Martin is involved heavily with the creation of the show so most liberties they take are often to help communicate points that wouldn't normally be able to be explained upon if trying to stay specifically to the book.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for a long time.  I have never played it before but all of you reviewers have been expressing that it is the game of all games so I will take you for your word.  I am so excited to get it.<br /><br />  Thanks for your advice.  Lana

B008ROG6E0|2.0|Logan's Run is a great 80s flick, but it is sooooooo dusty. It was made before computers really were making a splash in Hollywood. They used miniature models for a lot of the 'city' scenes. (Side note: Star Wars was made pre-computer as well. That is the yardstick used to judge movies using models of buildings, etc.)<br />If you have Prime, it's worth the price. (Free) If not, you may want to skip it.

B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|There is honestly no reason why this movie should not have 5 stars across the board! This movie, in lay terms, is powerful. original, sad, happy, insightful, educational and just plain the best. I grew up on this movie, and believe me, I am ALWAYS careful with my reviews. I do not even think &#34;Stand by me&#34; needs a review. The movie speaks for itself....

B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This definately is a great game. Although playing offline requires the in-game currency. It could also add some new modes. Such as a classic mode without power-ups. Otherwise&hellip; Great game.
B00589AYWW|4.0|This is the book that President George Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld should have read prior to committing the Folly of attacking Iraq.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for Amazon to offer this app for KFHD.  It runs great and offers the same quality of graphics that you are used to for this game. Wonderful app that will keep you busy for hours of fun. However, just like the Facebook version, you will be asked to purchase power ups. I have managed to get a 3 star rating for the 14 levels that I have finished so far, in just over an hour of game play. You needs to be patient while waiting for energy/lives between games. All in all, I think you will love this game. BONUS: It is a free download...just remember parental controls so the little ones are not  completing in app purchases on your dime.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|So many twists and turns. You definitely don't see them coming. At all. Wow. I really liked the heroine, Sophia.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|Finally got talked into joining face book, and started by downloading this app. Never have I downloaded an app that is so hard to try to figure out. When you finally can find the help section you find out how worthless it is. I spent several hours trying just to organize my friends and family until I just gave up. I can find someone and post on their wall OK or post on mine but trying to do anything else is a head scratcher.
068484267X|5.0|Eighty pages into 'Angela's Ashes,' it was brought to my attention that the book had stirred up quite the ire of the people who live in Limerick, Ireland. All memoirs have an element of intentional or unintentional fiction. Our memories are notoriously unreliable in remembering how actual events unfolded especially the further you go back into your own history. However, based upon the reactions of Limerick citizens, they are adamant that most of the late Mr. McCourt's work is pure BS. The author was just as adamant that it was all true. The hell if I know who to believe.<br /><br />What I can say is the thing sure sounds authentic when compared to my wife's and my background growing up Catholic during the 1960s and 70s in Maine. I, however, have been an agnostic for about thirty years now. College and critical thinking have a way of doing that to many Catholics. Ireland is well known for being deeply religious especially during the 1930s and 40s when the memoir takes place. A lot of the cockamamie Catholic superstitions and peer pressures are on full display in the book: unbaptized babies don't go heaven but some odd place called Limbo; you can't eat meat on Fridays or you go to hell; you can't masturbate or you also go to hell; all Protestants have a one-way ticket to Satan Central, blah blah, blah... the list of religious infractions is nearly endless. Add to that regional prejudices, abject poverty, oodles of uneducated adults, a high infant-mortality rate, an educational system that meted out corporal punishment to kids for the silliest of excuses, and lastly, a major-league-alcoholic father and, mercy me, you won't be mistaking 1930s-40s Limerick, Ireland for Shangri-la.<br /><br />There are also many funny adventures accompanied by the mandatory Catholic guilt trip. I enjoyed Mr. McCourt's memoir despite the controversy surrounding it. Even if many of these escapades were simply pulled out of the author's backside, the very well-written work certainly conveys the times and nature of poverty and religious mindset during the early part of the 20th Century. 'Angela's Ashes' deserved the Pulitzer Prize.the times and nature of poverty and religious mindset during the early part of the 20th Century. 'Angela's Ashes' deserved the Pulitzer Prize.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Lets romanticize a terrible time in human history where the rich lived on the backs of the poor and created strict social manners as a show of how much better they were than their \\"lesser\\".  This was a time where money meant everything and anyone without it was treated little better than a slave.  Yet hundreds of shows romanticize this time period and people eat it up and even worse look on as if it were a better time somehow.  All that chivalry, honor, and proper manners were merely a way of distinguishing yourself from poor people so that everyone knew who they were aloud to step on.  This show is yet another contrived piece of ignorant drivel that further glorifies a time in human history and a class of people worthy of reviling.
B00011CZRE|5.0|If you like detective shows with mystery, suspence and a little horror thrown in, than you will like this one. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both exellent actors and do a great and believable job portraying detectives. Gwyneth paltrow who plays Brads hot wife does an equally good job, but she has a bad habbit of losing her head from time to time. Kevin Spacey plays the highly intelligent psychopathic killer who keeps the detectives on the hunt. It's not that he just kills, it's the way he kills and the little clues he leaves behind, teasing the dynamic duo with just enough skin to keep them looking. Suspenceful from beginning to end.
B001XV3LSS|2.0|I saw this film in the theatres and recently when I had nothing to do I started browsing Amazon for something to watch.  Any of the new content I was interested in was either pay to rent or I had already seen it but this film came up as free.  I remembered having seen it and it not being terrible but not particularly good either but I decided to give it second try just in case I had been too critical or had seen it in bad company the first time around.  Unfortunately it was just as meh as I remember it being.  Rather than being used as a vehicle to debate philosophy the movie seems to try and cram the idea down the audience throats that science and religion (Christianity particularly) can be justified within a single equation.  I feel as though I am constantly told throughout the movie that \\"science is great but don't loose your faith\\".  This whole movie would be better served as the novel originally did not choosing a side and merely posing philosophical ideas that sometimes conflict and leaving the audience to debates these different ideas among themselves.  Aside from the overly preachy anthem of the movie it just isn't very interesting.  Its just barely entertaining enough to keep you watching till the end but never enough to leave you feeling satisfied or truly entertained.  It isn't bad enough to be good and laughable, good enough to be memorable and entertaining.  Its just meh, totally meh.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|A great way to pass the time. Juliette is a very we'll crafted character. Looking forward to the next installments.
B0026O475M|4.0|I realized my boyfriend has never watched it, and I made him...  It had been years since I had seen the movie and while I don't plan on watching it again any time soon, it is a classic!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First, the con:<br />It has a limited selection of apps.  I cannot watch my Dish Anywhere DVR recordings through Chromecast.<br /><br />The awesomeness:<br /><br />Set up is ridiculously easy.  The instructions are ridiculously easy to follow.  Everything is pretty much plug-and-play.<br /><br />Once it's set up, the Chromecast does everything for you.  You don't even have to change inputs - as soon as Chromecast detects your device it boots up and switches your input for you.  The only thing you have to do is hit the power button on your tv and open the Chromecast app on your device.  After that, you can use YouTube and Netflix and whatever to your heart's content.<br /><br />I really look forward to seeing more compatibility with other programs and apps.<br /><br />I love this thing.  Too often I have to hunt down the remote to change the channel while watching tv, but since I always keep my phone in my pocket I can play, pause or rewind no matter what I'm doing.<br /><br />Best 35 dollars I've ever spent.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|We have a divided household. Half Apple and half Android. This means that there is always one charger cable lying around or getting lost in the car. Now we can keep both plugged in all the time and charge them simultaneously. This is a good strong charger, so no worries about using power faster than it can charge like some other adapters I have used.<br /><br />I got a second for my wife's car.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|So far it's the same as the original Twilight fanfic from Twilighted. The references to the names are thinly disguised, but it's still a good read nonetheless.
B00E7SXRHY|5.0|For $50 you better expect a pretty amazing record collection, and for $50 this completely satisfies. The album itself is stretched out over 2 records, in very high fidelity 45 rpm, wide groove format, and the entire album has been remixed to very great effect. While I do by and large like the Albini way of doing things, the remixed version of this album shows a subtle side to Nirvana that was not as noticeable on the original version. I believe what they were going for was a closer approximation to what the band actually sounded like live, and the songs are definitely more dynamic overall instead of Albini's quiet verse-loud chorus formula. Definitely worth the cost of admission.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Would be more fun if we could escape different kinds of places, but still the game is enjoyable. Even so I don't run to play the game.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Sinead Oconnor has a beautiful voice and she can express so much heartfelt kickass rockin emotion!! At times her voice just explodes (we all know shes really good at that) Some songs are funny others so touching. This is a true artist! I have been a fan since I was 12 years old. I am so greatful that when I was growing up this was the kind of stuff that would come on the radio. Unfortunately, today it seems that's almost lost. You can definately hear Sinead mocking the industry in Queen of Denmark. I love every song on this album! If I had to choose favorites I say Track 1 to track 3 and then Track 5 to track 9 (I really can't choose favorites:) I can't wait to see her in concert on her American Kindness Tour!!!
B00D6DVSAE|1.0|Bought all of Sting's albums--this one is the worst, unless you are looking for an album of autobiographical Irish-type songs.<br /><br />Save your money unless this is the type of music you want.  Skipped through all the songs on both CDs---could not let even one finish and can not imagine any being played on a American radio--unless of course it was highlighting Irish songs about living next to a shipyard.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I normally don't like 3-D movies, but this one is excellent.  We recently bought a 3-D TV and DVD player.  Therefore, thought this was a great movie to test our new system.  It is certainly that.  The package actually has three verisons on the movie in 3-D, digital and standard DVD.

B00ARPMIJE|1.0|I admit that I uploaded the book because of the 1 star rating by Emily.  Seriously, how you could resist reading a book with a review like that? :)<br /><br />Anyway, I won't go so far as Emily in her review, but I can't understand all of the 5 star reviews and wondered, often, as I was skimming through A French Girl in New York, if we were reading the same book at all.<br /><br />The story was very Cinderella-ish, of course, that's no surprise.  But the characters were more like caricatures of people than real people.  A good editor might have made some suggestions to tone down the caricature-ization of the characters and that would have been a good suggestion for the author.<br /><br />As it is, I finished it.  Unlike reviewer Emily, I don't want to die now that I've read it, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I certainly don't want to read any sequels to Maude's story.

Instead, we're treated to Cath's real problems as she learns how to cope with college and life without her sister being by her side.

Perfect in its simplicity.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

B001ANSS5K|2.0|I wasn't going to write a review of Paper Towns, but I changed my mind. The more I thought about it, the more I wondered, \\"Why do people really like this book?\\" And I guess I'm hoping someone will tell me. The other two books of John's that I've read were pretty good, and I got that. But, with this one, I'm completely baffled. Completely. Was I supposed to like anything about Margo? Was I supposed to be sad when Quentin thinks she's dead? Was I supposed to be shocked when he solved the mystery?<br /><br />But, I don't want to stay on the negative (and that's why this is going to be short). I just don't get what's so great about this book in general.<br /><br />What did I like? I loved the road trip. I loved Radar and Ben. They're what saved the book for me. I loved the progression of Quentin's relationship with them and how his search for Margo somehow makes his friendships better. I could have read an entire book just about this friendship between the three boys and would have been much happier than I was reading the actual book. The road trip had me laughing all the way through; I read that section at least twice as fast as the rest of the book.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much I'm getting across in this review past my confusion as to why close to 80 percent (according to Goodreads) gave this book four or five stars. What am I not seeing? To me, Paper Towns feels contrived, quirky just to be quirky, intellectual just to be intellectual. I just don't get it.

B008JFUO4U|1.0|***NOT FULL SCREEN HDTV VIDEO***This Blue Ray DVD does not fill your entire screen leaving black bars on the top and bottom of your screen. It is my understanding all Blue Rays are 1080p which would naturally fill your entire screen and serve as the current standard in Blue Ray quality. I instead received an inferior blue ray product that will not fill my entire screen on a 2012 Samsung PN64E8000 3D HDTV as though it were formatted for 720p pixel resolution or less. I also used a 2013 Sony BDPS7903D Blue Ray player which was also formatted properly. This Oblivion Blue Ray purchase is not True High Definition as per today's standards. This is a 2013 movie so apparently the Blue Ray provider did not think filling up your entire screen was important. When I called Amazon to complain about this conundrum, the customer service representative was courteous but she had never heard of this problem, but I let her know in detail, how my HDTV screen and player was formatted correctly and that other Blue Rays perform fine but not this Oblivion Blue Ray. I don't think it is a defect because I found another Oblivion movie version advertised on Amazon with the letters \\"HD\\" printed at the top of it's Blue Ray jacket. I suspect some kind of fraud by the Blue Ray manufacturer until I get a full explanation from someone. Amazon did offer to look into the matter but Amazon never contacted me back on this. Maybe the truth was too costly for so many inferior Blue Rays that were produced. I don't know...Tim L Thornton Springfield, IL

B00FEJIVRQ|3.0|I went in to buy a DVD movie and came out of Amazon with this in the cloud. I really wanted the DVD for our library in the mountains because we cannot get &#34;the Cloud&#34; up there, too rural and no phone line cable because it's microwaved. The only reason I gave this a three!<br /><br />But, to the movie, it was thoroughly entertaining and I felt the best on yet. Acting was fun and natural, computer enhancements were fantastic and felt almost possible, but the entertainment value was a 9+.

B00023BLXK|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from the title, maybe a continuance of the origional Dirty Dancing. But this movie stands alone. The dancing, the location and the people keep you on edge. The streak of violance against those who dared to play music, dance and sing in public was a shock. I loved this movie and will probably watch it over and over just like I do the origional!  Buy or rent this movie, you won't be disapointed!
1439190976|2.0|I find this to be one of the most tedious books I've ever read. The author is trying to present an unbiased historical documentary on the Company but fails in every respect imaginable, switching back and forward between praise and scorn, sometimes in the same sentence. The author does not present good examples of McKinseys affects on the companies it was hired to serve. I have read other books which have done this effectively so that the reader can understand the  good and bad effects of management consulting.<br />The author instead decided to focus almost exclusively on the bankrupt lives of the executives and partners of the company itself. And to that I say , WHO CARES!

May come back at later time just dont know right now.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|This most be the most funny, interesting,entertaining, well written book that I have read in a long time. It is a must reading, can't put down kind of book. Emma Chase truly rocks. Loved the story told from the male point of view. I cannot wait for her other two books to come out!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who has read Peter: A Darkened Fairytale. These clever poems take us back to the mysterious land of Peter's journeys. Many of these poems reminded me of creatures and scenes from the fairytale, and I enjoyed them very much. There are also some new things presented here, leading me to believe that there is more to come in Peter's fascinating journey. Among my favorites were Cauldron, Brownies, Devil's Wish, Farigehr, Quengorn, and last but not least, Tosis. I couldn't get enough of Mr. Hally Tosis in the fairytale and seeing him again here brought a smile to my face. These are well written and contain plenty of magic. This is a must for anyone who has read the dark fairytale. Fans of Lewis Carroll will enjoy this. I can't wait to see more of this delightful series.
B004UPANAI|2.0|From playing Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, I'm a huge Deadpool fan, and this film did him no justice.  Gambit was cool at least, but the whole movie just fell a little flat. In a word, meh.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is fun and crazy happy. you have fun making a town from the old west.<br />;)  :):);)&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  howdy yaw&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;
B002LANLDK|4.0|I had given up on this series before they brought The Rock in so I actually skipped it when it was new, but after liking 5 and 6 so much, I decided to go back and give it a shot. A step back in the right direction after 2F2F and Tokyo Drift.  Didn't quite reach the levels of awesome of 5 and 6, but sets those films up pretty well.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love rescuing the beautiful wildlife in this game very much.  but today I am having some troubles getting the site up? :(
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I'm not exactly a comic book historian, but I have enjoyed many of the comic book movies. I really liked the way this film served as somewhat of a history of the X-Men.  Great for those of us who do not have the full background stories from the comics.  The cameos are really cool too!
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Wathced this on a whim with the family.. Full of good visual jokes as well as some slapstick. Adifferent twist on history.
0525478817|5.0|Love. When we think of a love story we think of over dramatic connections between the characters that never could be realistic. John Green did the complete opposite. In his beautiful writing Hazel Grace Lancaster was a normal teenager, until she diagnosed with Thyroid cancer  when she was thirteen. Now at the age of sixteen her mother feels Hazel is depressed and makes her go to a support group for teenagers with cancer, but one meeting when Augustus Waters shows up unexpectedly, her life changes. Through out the book we see Augustus humorous attempts to attract Hazel, and watch their relationship bloom into a heart wrenching love story. I thought John Green gave us a tragic love story about the fear of loving someone when you know the chance of living is minimal, but he show us the sacrifices we will do for love. John Green really made me feel the characters pain, which is hard for an author to do.<br /> There is a lot of controversy of this book saying Hazel and Augustus are not normal teenagers, because of their mature vocabulary, but not all teenagers are the OMG type of people. I think John really opens our mind to expanding our vocabulary instead of OMGing everything. This book can open our minds to really appreciate every moment of everyday. Instead of complaining about waking up early to go to school, we should embrace and appreciate the fact we can actually go to school. If we ever have a bad day, we have to think about the positives about every second. John Green's writing could really inspire us to become better people in our action, and our thoughts.
B008JFUR10|2.0|Good movie, too bad the digital download is a UV download and won't work in iTunes.  In the past I have been able to get them into iTunes but, it does not work for this title.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|In my opinion this game is a one of a kind game and is fun and challenging. This game is very fun especially if you can get the expansions but even if you can't it is still fun and all that
B0083Z614S|5.0|Awesome read. Great message . I recommend for kids and adults alike. Mary, Dickon , Colin, Mrs Sowerby , and Ben touched my heart.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Well I have a (kindle fire)  and when I would go to look at the reviews on the YouTube videos my screen would go black and I cud not get the SCREEN TO GO BACK NO SO IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS MAKE A REVIEWER ABOUT IT SO I NOW IT IS NOT ONLY MEEE!!!!!!!!!
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Loved this book, he tells it like it is and hardly any fluff, I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Would recommend this as it has very valueable information a begginer needs to suceed.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have to get to my classes really early and this really helped me wake up and stay up. You will love this app. You can add you own music as a alarm or listen to the cool songs the have on there already.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Love any type of comic book brought to life as it is always awesome to see a writers thoughts put to good use.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|The story is a bit long and blah, but it's a beautifully shot and produced piece of cinema. The onboards are superb, as is the work of Saul Bass (who did the opening sequence/credits and was maybe Director of Photography?).<br /><br />The disc and packaging were perfect...no issues with quality or playback,
B005I3PAUO|5.0|Baldacci has come up with a fast-moving read which combines murder most foul with the world of top level subterfuge. A great read from beginning to end!
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|This collection is the culmination of a six year project between two men that sometimes worked together and sometimes alone around the world.<br /><br />People looking for an objective film on the history of film will be disappointed or confused. I myself, a fascinated cinemaphiles, would have chosen quit a few different films. But I have a fraction of the skill of Mark Cousins. It is like using someone else's eyes.<br /><br />Not only is it interesting to see a different view of film, but every now and then there is one film that I missed and looks like I must purchase to see what it is really about. I never heard of \\"Queen Kelly\\" (1929).I watched a lot of Carl Theodor Dreyer films but never thought of his fascination with \\"White\\" I was to intrigued in the films to notice. I watched \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" (1919) and never got the impression it had anything to do with the German State. Now waiting for a copy of \\"Kurutta ippêji\\" (1926) that is not in 3D. For people that gave up on the series by this time missed much as Mark Cousins is just getting off the ground.<br /><br />Hang in there as he may diss your favorites but will bring up several films that you may have missed in life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:186205942X The Story of Film]]
B009LXEBD4|4.0|CD wouldn't load.  Loaded 15 CD's in 1 day and this was the only one the computer spit right back out.  Brand new CD.  Amazon did a wonderful job in meeting my customer service needs.  Very pleased with their telephone service.  So even though I ultimately did not get the music I ordered, I'm so impressed with their customer service that I can over look the inconvenience of needing to order another copy.
0240810961|5.0|This book showed up right on time. It's so beautiful! There are examples from several Disney artists (including my favorite, Glen Keane)! Even if you don't do animation, this kind of information is really important to add life to any drawing. I draw comics and find the information really helpful to give the look of movement. Really, any artist can benefit from these lessons. Thanks, Walt Stanchfield!
B0067TGSOK|4.0|I found this book has helpful, practical advice for anyone looking to take advantage of the new &#34;boundary-less&#34; economy where one can basically call the shots and create one's own income anywhere, anytime. It's not for everyone (the book or the lifestyle), but if it calls to you, this book will help.<br /><br />The book is very easy to read and offers all the information you need to get started founding your own venture. The ideas are concrete and as I said, practical. I'll be referring to the book frequently for advice, especially in the PR/promotions area.<br /><br />The only critique I'd make is the book makes it seem (I think at least) that starting one of these ventures is easy. It's not really. Like any startup, it will take perseverance, pivoting, challenging one's beliefs about what they want to do (and why). But in the end, if you persevere, it's certainly worth it. And this book provides a lot of what you'll need to make it!
B0012HEB32|5.0|Loved the story line it is a shame the 2nd season is the end of the story line Make more
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Good music, great person, and a well made documentary. It's allso nice to see something about Detroit. It would be great if Rodriguez played in the States more. I looked online and he plays sporadically.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally on kindle a long waited wait but I'm happy :) and I haven't had any problems yet I still hate that you have to wait to go to the next level
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|play it all the time on my LG and now that it is out for kindle fire makes it even better...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to finally see the game on the Kindle!!!  Beware, as this game can be highly addictive and cause loss of sleep.
B000002GBB|4.0|Very polished work, great songs and performance from beginning to end. This really does encapsulate what fans of this flavour of rock music love.  And the critics cannot stand it. This is good music.  Turn off the lights and enjoy a glass of whatever your poison is while you soak this up.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|So much fun.  There is always new dragons to try and get. I like the new light and dark magic they just added, I'm just not sure what I'm doing with it yet, lol.  Over all, very fun.  The reason for only 4 stars is cause of some of the glitches that happens periodicly which sometimes is annoying but usually doesn't happen that often.
B000001ESN|5.0|I initially ignored this album, wasn't that keen on the commercial sheen that others have spoken of.  Listening to the album itself, and live versions of the tracks, I finally get it.  The album represents the best of the old and the new Rush.  The band deliberately moved away from the approach used on Hemispheres - much to the disappointment of many.  On Permanent Waves, however, Rush found what I think was a sustainable way of making music on into the eighties.  This album sits right up there with Moving Pictures, and I can't separate the pair.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This was on my bucket list! I Watch a few episode every day. The price was very reasonable, too. Delighted with the product and laughs.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|Neill Blomkamp is a pretty clever director in that he has had two major sci-fis out over the last few years and they both have been pretty inspiring and most original (almost) both District 9 and Elysium are pretty bold and breathtaking in there scale, Elysium certainly hits the spot again with a clever and unique story, amazing visual effects that really make you think this place can exist, great casting of Matt Damon, im not a massive fan but he does fit in very well with this movie, Blomkamp certainly has a very specific vision of the future, one side is a paradise and the other side is a slum very much like in District 9, if you love a bit of sci-fi then this is a must, personally I still prefer District 9 as Blomkamp's best movie, the only downers I had with this were actor Sharlto Copley who I thought was awesome in District9 but did not deliver as great a character in this and some of the camera work was way too shakey to enjoy certain scenes,check it out for sure its still great fun!!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|not a gamer, but i can actually ply this. yes, i do like it. would i play it if i had to pay? nope!
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Totally and absolutely brilliant in every way, im a massive, massive kick ass fan its probably one of my favourite movies of all time so was hyped for this sequel and it certainly delivers the goods, the story is great and takes the film in a slightly different direction as you would expect, the characters are older and going through changes but still stand for the same principles at the end of the day, the way the story has developed is fantastic, Hitgirl is amazing as usual and again really steals the show, Chloe moretz shines again as Mindy and shows that even though she's aged a few years she still is a potty mouth badass assassin, there are several new additions to the team now with superheroes crawling out of the woodwork everywhere, the best of course of the new faces is Jim Carey who is absolutely brilliant, this is probably the best he has done in a long, long time, Christopher Mintz-plassse has really made changes as he is now a badass super villain out to kill kick ass, I loved every single second of this and never took a smile off my face, pure entertainment from start to finish, great cast, great story, funny, violent and tons of fun!! It's a huge breath of fresh air compared to every other comic book movie out there, give marvel a break and watch this instead!!!! Dont forget to wait until after the credits for one final scene!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is fun, but seems like bejeweled....don't like the time limits, but it's first day playing. Since its so popular, I probably don't know all the rules!<br /><br />.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|This is actually a very surprising sci-fi movie and I for one like others wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it as its based on the novel by the same author as twilight, this is certainly nothing like twilight so rest easy, it has its level of romance of course in the story but it doesn't smother the story to the point of vomiting like twilight does, romance aside this is a beautiful looking sci-fi movie with an original concept, great locations and settings, and good looking effects, the cast is very good, Saoirse Ronan as usual steals the show and makes a perfect lead, a very beautiful actress with so many sides to her acting talent, she makes the movie very comfortable to watch, Diane Kruger is also amazing as the seeker who is trying to stop her, the villains are very stylish with their visually cool costumes and smart looking vehicles and gadgets, they really stand out against the surroundings where the movie is filmed. This is certainly worth checking out if you like a good sci-fi, it's not heavy on action but its well paced out, the bluray has great picture quality.<br />  (Runs for 2hrs 6mins)
B002DKGWSO|5.0|****** No Plot Spoilers *******<br /><br />  My girlfriend Tammy had a pleasant surprise for me when I visited her condo this past Friday.  She had purchased the 2009 remake of the classic Wes Craven shocker, \\"The Last House on the Left.\\"  This is the infamous film in which the vacationing Dr. John Collingwood and his wife Emma seek revenge against those who brutalized their daughter Mari and her friend Paige.  I found it just as gritty and disturbing as the original 1972 film.  Therefore, if you didn't enjoy the original, you probably won't tolerate the remake either.  They are very similar in plot; however, they are dissimilar enough so that those who've seen the original will still enjoy the remake.<br /><br />  It has been over twenty years since I've seen the original but it still remains forever etched in my memory.  The 2009 remake had more brutality than the original; however, its ending was more agreeable.  In the case of this shocker, you need an ending that lifts the feeling of doom and gloom that settles on one's shoulders while watching it.  The remake has a \\"happy ending\\" in which the surviving characters literally sail away into the sunset.  Furthermore, one of the ruffians experiences a rather grisly, highly creative death at the hands of the revenge-seeking Dr. Collingwood.  Viewers will understand his anger and not be too quick to judge him.<br /><br />  The acting was great from all those involved.  Garrett Dillahunt (\\"Looper\\" and \\"Winter's Bone\\") was especially good at reprising the role of the amoral, ruggedly-handsome Krug Stillo.  Originally, David Hess (\\"House on the Edge of the Park\\" and \\"Swamp Thing\\") portrayed Krug.  Hess had a special gift for playing the ruffian who terrorizes innocent people, especially attractive women.  Not only was the acting great, perhaps even better than the original, but the sets in the remake were more lavish and appropriate.  In the remake, the large, isolated lake house is a couple of miles from the nearest neighbor.  The water also plays a more vital, significant role.<br /><br />  I have not seen the remake of \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" which is another controversial revenge shocker that was originally released in 1978.  The original stars the lovely Camille Keaton, granddaughter of Buster Crabbe, as Jennifer Hills who is renting a secluded cabin in upstate New York; she seeks a gruesome, bloody revenge against the local rednecks who rape and brutalize her without mercy.  Either the originals or the remakes of \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" and \\"The Last House on the Left\\" should be watched together as a double midnight feature.  Both films pose the question:  How far would you go to get revenge against the thugs who harmed you or a loved one?<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyosighbor.

B00E4W40C4|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this after the last wolverine movie was absolute garbage, but surprisingly they have redeemed the character and brought him up to speed with a decent story and a good looking setting, the movie does have its weak points but no comic book movie is perfect for any of us, Hugh Jackman is probably at his best at playing the character since Xmen 2 at least and has certainly built himself up more physically, he is now surrounded by a very good supporting cast too and this time the story is much better, set several years after the last stand he has given up killing and his wolverine name and is still haunted by the death of his love Jean (who has many new dream sequence flashbacks etc) he is tracked down by a man who's life he saved and taken to Japan for one last dying wish then the trouble kicks off and Logan is thrown into a world of Japanese Yakuza, Ninjas, beautiful women and betrayal, from then on its plenty of ass kicking time with cool fight scenes and fun action pieces, great scenery, good soundtrack too to carry the action, the only real downer was the villain silver samurai, the story arc was very underused and the character could have been a lot better so you kind of get a great movie then a slightly weak ending but overall its great fun and you should just go with it, you wont get a better wolverine movie than this! Don't forget the after credit scene that sort of ties into the new Xmen Days of future past movie!! This movie is darker and grittier than previous comic book films which also sets it apart, he kills a lot of people!! Not perfect but still great entertainment, make sure you completely erase Xmen origins wolverine from memory.
B008JFUR10|5.0|An action movie with heart and a warm message that it doesn't beat you over the head with. Visually spectacular. I couldn't stop smiling in the theater.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|At last a GOOD superman movie!! I'm not a massive fan of the character and he has certainly not been done justice in the past especially with superman returns been utter garbage hopes seemed lost but man of steel more than delivers the goods at last, the movie has a stronger story than ever before, very epic and very well paced so it does not feel like over two hours, the movies villains are very good and much more apposing than any before, you can feel a lot more effort has gone into making the character more interesting than before, amazing special effects very epic and powerful fight scenes, a great cast that really helps too, this is certainly worth a look for any fan and anyone who before didn't think a decent superman movie would ever get made, the character has certainly been done more justice than anything in the past, lets hope a sequel wont ruin it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is my second time reading the books. I hope the movie does the book justice!!! I love Christian Grey.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is exactly what it says on the tin!! You know for a fact if you're going to enjoy this or not before you watch it, it has everything a blockbuster summer movie could possibly need, its action packed from the start, amazing special effects, the cast is great no big stars as such which certainly makes it much better I think, of course it's far fetched but its sci-fi and anything goes!! The story is great and we start off already in the action instead of a build up which is good then its non stop machines pounding monsters trying to save the earth, completely epic with a great music score to accompany it, the effects cant be flawed they look amazing throughout, this is quite a big bold film for Guillermo del Toro and he pulled it off obviously with its success and great reviews! Extremely fun movie make sure you don't miss it!!!<br />The Blu-ray is region free and packed with extras!
B007L6VR12|5.0|This was an offbeat fun kind of movie was clever, funny that had good underlying messages.  Was glad I got it.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|Vin Diesel is back playing one of his greatest roles, Riddick is the third instalment to the franchise and is certainly one of the best, it goes back to its pitch black roots on a dark and desolate planet surrounded by danger at every turn, great visual look to the film, amazing effects, very violent as usual as you would expect it is certainly better going back to R rated territory, the story is very cool, great cast all round, exciting action and effects, a top Sci-Fi really worth checking out, its certainly stands apart from most of the other comical so called Sci-Fi this year!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I really enjoyed reading it and was sad when it was over. So hard to find books that suck you in like this one did.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very much extras options in the aditional discs, excelent 3D quality. A great adquisicion for my super hero video collection.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|Gret movie, we couldn't go to sleep after watching it!  My wife said it was the best movie she had seen since Titanic!
0061122416|5.0|We forget to dream or do not allow ourselves to dream.<br />This book made me stop and think what life is really about.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have blasted this in my vehicle wherever I've gone since I got it and I just simply can't get enough of it.  Lindsey is extremely talented and I can't wait until the next album.  I only own 4 CD's and this is one of them.  Typically I just use Pandora, but I had to have this and it was well worth it.
0812983459|5.0|This book has a rather incredible premise but once you accept it, the rest flows beautifully.  I also had some trouble with the reconcilliation of husband and wife. It didn't seem adequate given the lead-up. There is still too much unfinished business between Harold and his wife for the book to really work. But it has some excellent bits as Harold wends his way on his pilgrimage.
B00F36ZHHC|3.0|The pictures are old so i was slightly disappointed....you don't get much for fee anymore.....LOL  it was interesting tho the last time i tried it could not get it to work right.
0375842209|5.0|This book is very popular and has been made into a movie. I read it twice and thought it told an important story about The Holocaust. I think it will resonate with many readers and highly recommend it.I can't wait to see the movie and hope it does justice to this excellent book.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It only streams Netflix as YouTube. If you already have that in your tv or Blu ray player, this item is unneeded. That it streams anything in Chrome is an exaggeration.<br /><br />I'm hoping more distribution companies like Netflix make deals and all our Chromecast software is updated to show and handle that.
B001BANK32|5.0|Very enjoyable. Good story line and a lot ways to use new words.<br />  Minimum use of profanity which added to the feeling of reality while increasing the reality of human conversation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best of the trilogy. I read it in nearly 3 days. Completely engulfed in the story. Another hit! Now it'll be hard to forget and find something else find to read.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Cosmic,  introspective  and  artfully done . is\\" NEW \\" the CD .. Could this be Paul McCartney's  swan song ?  It is  magical, fun and magnificent  in development. Very good and may be his best work.<br />It is a must have...  For it takes you on a journey of  rock, love songs ,ballads and memories of old friends. All done in the collage of perfection  known as Macca.  Thanks to Paul ...for this is something special for us all to ...\\".appreciate \\".
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This dark comedy shows what most comedies are like from the &#34;villains'&#34; point of view. Absolutely hysterical, definitely one of my favorite movies.
B00915G6SU|4.0|I'm really glad I caught up w the show.  I enjoyed the season. The season was emotional, scary, and nerve-wracking as usual.
0345529057|5.0|George R.R. Martin will keep you guessing all through the series. Masterfully written. I would definitely give it an &#34;R&#34; rating if it were a movie. Lots of sex and violence. Keep that in mind if it's going to be a gift for someone.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|I'm not a horror fan, not a zombie fan. I don't watch TV, I don't even have cable. BUT...I caught a few episodes of The Walking Dead at a friend's house during the marathon before Season 2. I was hooked. Much more than just your sci-fi, post apocalyptic gore fest, TWD is an ensemble drama. The cast are all great actors, the characters and story line are well written and believeable. That's what really drew me in- this is plausible, this *could* happen to us in the real world. The intense survival situation brings out the best and worst in humanity, and it makes the show interesting. That I can purchase the shows on Amazon 24 hours after showing, for a couple of bucks, is awesome. AMC really has a monopoly on great TV. (I also watch Mad Men, but getting a little bored with it) Not so TWD. Sure, it has blood, guts and gore, and enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat, but it's the people, not the zombies, that make this show great. Oh, and everybody makes fun of the redneck until the zombie apocalypse! :)

B003IDMUWC|5.0|Tonight around 1 a.m., Grisham's new book [[ASIN:B00D8CSVLW Sycamore Row]] will appear on my Kindle as if by magic. In it, he revisits the people of Ford County who appeared in his first book, 'A Time to Kill', all of 24 years ago in 1989. I couldn't remember if I'd read it, and even if I had, the plot had faded completely from my mind, so a refresher seemed in order. As it turns out, I haven't read it before, though I've certainly seen the film.<br /><br />The story begins with the horrific gang-rape and beating of a young black girl by two white men. The two men are quickly arrested and there is no doubt about their guilt. However, Carl Lee Hailey, the father of young Tonya, is not ready to let justice take its course and sets out to take his own revenge. When he is in turn arrested and charged with murder, he asks Jake Brigance to defend him. While there's a lot of sympathy for Carl Lee, especially amongst the black townsfolk, there is also a sizeable slice of opinion that vigilantism, whatever the provocation, is wrong; and then there's the minority of white racists who think Carl Lee should be lynched. Soon the town is plunged into fear as the Ku Klux Klan take the opportunity to resurrect the days of burning crosses and worse.<br /><br />Grisham doesn't give any easy answers and doesn't paint anyone as a complete hero (and only the rapists and the KKK are seen as wholly villainous). There's a huge cast of characters and we get to know their flaws as much as their strengths; and it's an indication of Grisham's skill that we can still like so many of them even when we are bound to disagree with most of them at least some of the time, whatever our own views. As the case proceeds and conviction looks increasingly likely, Jake has to decide how far he can stretch his fairly elastic ethics. And he also has to consider whether it's worth the danger that he's inadvertently brought on his family, employees and himself.<br /><br />In the foreword, Grisham tells us that the book didn't have much impact when it was first published but that over the years it has grown in popularity. I can understand both of those things. Firstly, it's an enormous brick of a book, the first chapter is a graphic and shocking description of the gang-rape and, being based in the South and with racism as a major theme, the use of the n-word is liberal from the beginning and throughout. If it was my first introduction to Grisham, I'm not sure I'd have gone past the first few chapters. However, it is Grisham, and so I read on...and how glad I am that I did!<br /><br />This is an ambitious, sprawling book that looks at racism, ethics, fatherhood, friendship, politics, gender and, of course, corruption and the law. As always with Grisham, the writing is flowing, the plot is absorbing, the characterisation is in-depth and believable and there's plenty of humour to leaven the grim storyline. The sheer length of the book gives Grisham plenty of room to explore his themes thoroughly and he carefully balances his characters so that we get to see both sides of each argument, particularly on vigilantism and capital punishment. Grisham doesn't peddle his own views - he lets his characters argue each side effectively and so the reader is left to decide. Grisham says that often people he meets tell him this is their favourite of all his books - if I ever meet him, I think I'll be telling him that too. Now I can only hope that 'Sycamore Row' lives up to the standard Grisham has set himself...the book didn't have much impact when it was first published but that over the years it has grown in popularity.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one!!! I did not want to put this book down once I started reading it!!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I fell in love with the television show.  The characters were gripping and all the actors did an amazing job and the story line was informative, dramatic, and had a good level of humor/sarcasm/irony at times.  The book left me wanting more spice/drama from Piper's experience.  I felt like Piper bragged about her attributes and how much she was loved and looked up to and it got on my nerves at times.  I also wish she would have elaborated on her ideas of how the prison system could be improved not just how it was lacking.
0307744434|4.0|Erin Morgenstern's book &#34;The Night Circus&#34; is definitely worth a read. It is not a long book, so most fast readers can finish it within a week, which, in my opinion, is the perfect amount of time for this book. It is a fast ride into the world of a mystical circus with twists that readers find themselves more and more deeply wrapped into as Morgenstern takes them around every circus tent. In the end, I did like this book a lot while reading it, but once finished, it falls on my shelf among several other fantasy-drama novels that I probably won't ever read again. A good story.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and my Acer Lap Top running Windows 8.  Didn't think I'd ever be able to print from my tablet.  Also works with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7&#34;!  The only I don't like is if I print from my phone, I have to forward it to an email address, then it prints.

0060555661|5.0|My husband is enjoying it and learning from it.  He has been in the business of investing for years and for him to learn from it I would say it is very good.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|It had a great start, a great previous book and a great potential...<br /><br />But then if fizzled to meh.  The big climax scene was not very exciting, scary or easily understood.  WTF was Momo doing?  Why/how did that work?  Why did the monster in the box do what he did?  Why why why???  So many loose ends were not tied up or explained.  Even how Dan helps people die... something simple not even touched upon.  Kinda weak.

B00BPDR3F6|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Reading this book was like peeling the petals off of a flower, each petal a little more beautiful than the one before.<br /><br />This novel is a complex family saga surrounded by the beauty of the budding botanical world.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Gilbert's writing style. I haven't read her other books so I wasn't really sure what to expect with her writing style. I was thrilled that it was so smooth and lyrical. She has a talented way of wording complex ideas so that any reader can understand and see the depth of what's being said.<br /><br />I loved her storytelling style, absolutely breathtaking and engaging from the first page. I actually feel like I rush through the first part of this novel. I read the first third of the novel quickly because I was anxious to know what happened next and what was to become of Henry and about half was through the novel I wanted to go back and restart it so I could enjoy every word of Gilbert's story!<br /><br />See my full review here: [...]
0670024856|3.0|I'd read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" and enjoyed Ms. Gilbert's writing. The beginning of the book was wonderful, but as I passed the midpoint I couldn't help thinking the story would have benefited from some stern editing. It's like watching a four hour movie that you know would have worked better at ninety minutes. By the time I finally reached the ending of this book, I felt like I was overgrown with moss like one of Alma's beloved boulders.  As I said, I wanted to like it...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me wanting to come back for more and  more! I never wanted it to end!! Can't wait to read the next book!
0385486804|4.0|Ordered this for my high school kid's english class because his teacher would not allow a kindle version.  He seemed to like it.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Good movie but too many things didn't make sense in regards to efficiency and economy of motion in combat that seemed like they didn't want to sacrifice it for the sake of action.  Look for HISHE (How it should have ended) on Youtube and look for Pacific Rim and you will know what I mean. Eye candy is great, story line was ok, combat could have been better.

B0002IQOZA|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas albums, I make sure to listen to it every year during Christmas time. Her rendition of &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34; is my favorite track off of this album. If you're a Christina fan, I feel like this cd is definitely a must-have.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Great sound, High Quality. Enough Said. &#62;&#62; Paired with Canon Rebel T3i<br />Worth upgrading to Pro from the Standard Video Mic?  If you need a Db boost, absolutely, especially if you like adjusting your audio levels manually.
B000002A46|5.0|I make sure to listen to this album every year, it can automatically put me in the holiday spirit. Her version of &#34;O Holy Night&#34; is my favorite version (besides Celine Dion's powerhouse version) and that whistle note she hits during it....just incredible. &#34;All I Want For Christmas is You&#34; is also now a classic song that you'll always hear during Christmas time. Mariah has such a beautiful voice and it really shows on this album. A must-have for Mariah and Christmas lovers alike.
0765348780|2.0|This book is not worthy of the acclaim the series has so widely garnered.  If the rest of the series is anything like it - and I just purchased Book 2 - I can only conclude that my tastes have fallen clearly out of the fantasy genre mainstream.  Even if this book were substantially better, Erikson would still not be worthy of his name being mentioned alongside Tolkien, Martin, and the like.<br /><br />The central problem with this book is so obvious to me that it trumps all its other problems and is reason enough to avoid this series: after 657 pages, I just don't care about any of the characters.  You simply cannot have even a mediocre fantasy series if you have nobody to root for, or against for that matter.  Erikson is one of the worst character developers I've read.<br /><br />Erikson seriously erred beginning this story in medias res without giving us one central character to anchor us.  In my view, you either throw yourself into the midst of an intricate plot through the eyes of one charismatic player - think Achilles in The Iliad - or you offer a wide cast of characters who take off together at a clear starting point (think the Starks and the Lannisters and the Baratheons all meeting together at Winterfell).  Erikson opted to begin with a wide cast of characters, each in the middle of their own loosely linked conflicts; going this route, we learn next to nothing about each character or the wider plots.  This is frustrating.  The redeeming quality of this book might be its 'epic' moments, but those moments fell hollow on me because I didn't care much for the players or the context in which these events were playing out.<br /><br />In these 'epic' moments, the subpar character development is exacerbated by Erikson employing magic and religion in a very deus ex machina approach.  Erikson has so many wheels spinning that he never gets around to explaining the &#34;rules&#34; governing the metaphysical powers in his universe.  Consequently, we never really know what the risks are or who is truly at risk because overbearing, impersonal magic is brought to bear at every moment possible.  George RR Martin wisely pointed out that magic should be used sparingly, and that its reckless use could ruin a good story - he pointed out that Gandalf rarely busted out magic in LoTR.  Conversely, this book is littered with spells and incantations resolving conflicts in lieu of genuinely human moments.  The story builds up to some epic conflicts that resolve themselves in a short paragraph with one guy casting an anonymous, stereotypical spell.  How are you supposed to build attachment to a character in this kind of setting?<br /><br />Nor can you really hold affection for characters if they are indistinguishable.  I am fine with an author throwing thousands of characters at a reader if the characters are creative and serve a purpose.  Unfortunately, Erikson gives us something like half a dozen cliche assassins; another dozen mages accessing an incomprehensible magic system; and handfuls of veteran warriors.  They are all forced into some kind of regimented system like an Assassin's Guild or a Wizards' squad - juvenile devices familiar to any teenage dungeon master - and they belong to a dozen or so races which Erikson bothers to mention, but not describe with any detail.  All this stuff is just &#34;there&#34; with the inefficiency of an amateurish author who doesn't understand that less is more.<br /><br />I could go on: the story is applauded for avoiding strict good v evil dichotomies, but in reality the bad guys are well-established and unambiguous, it's just that the good guys are unknowingly pitted against one-another.  Erikson is praised for his world-building and for employing an archeologist's background - but all this really translates to is impersonally having one guy be 10,000 years old and another be 100,000 years old...does that distinguishment really resonate with readers?  I guess I just see most of the praise for this storyreferring to half-baked attempts at real character development.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by reading so much GRRM and expecting human subtleties to be portrayed in a fantasy setting with Chekhov-like precision.  I'll continue this series because I keep reading that I'll be hooked after a few books - but really, a series so highly praised should NOT take that long to lure you in.

B005LAIIGW|3.0|I went into the Imax theater expecting Apollo 13/2001 type entertainment. Instead I got a couple \\"A\\" list actors reciting a script.<br /><br />Before the entertainment starts you have a retiring astronaut leisurely flying around the shuttle with no purpose only have as much fun before he returns home to never return to space again. This is quite normal for military pilots to have a last thrill ride before retiring or separating from the service but to burn up so much screen time with these antics seemed to me the writers and producers were trying to burn up screen time from the beginning.<br /><br />Then you have a mission specialist who specializes in whining and crying about keeping her last meal down; again quite the norm for astronauts but why spend so much time with the norm.<br /><br />A few minutes later Houston informs them about the satellite target practice. Missiom Specialist asks if she should be worried but Mr. Silver Fox tells her that Houston will do the worrying for them. A few more minutes of Mr. Fox cruising around the shuttle and Ms. Specialist holding down her cookies the feces hits the rotary device.<br /><br />After the onslaught of debris which kills everyone but these two and renders the shuttle useless as a reentry vehicle they try to make a plan.<br /><br />Instead of the bungee tether dance which used way too much fuel (not to mention all the fuel he wasted during his pre-catastrophe joy ride) they should have held onto each other preferably with him holding her in front so he could drive and navigate to the conveniently parked International Space Station. This resulted in disaster for him because he felt she couldn't save him after slamming into ISS deadstick because they ran out of fuel. She was tangled up in wires and he was still connected to her via tether but he felt he couldn't be saved so he unhooked his tether and he floated away.<br /><br />She makes it inside, strips down to her astro undies and floats around trying to get the radio to work. In a few minutes the ISS is approaching the debris field again and she makes it to the Soyuz capsule only because there was an unrelated fire that was started on ISS. Remember she's in her undies and she's getting into another spaceship with no spacesuit. As the debris rains down on ISS she has enough time to quickly go through the simple checklist in Russian and undock. Unfortunately the shroud lines from the chute has her all tangled up so she has to do a spacewalk in this debris rainstorm and cut the Soyuz loose, fortunately the Russians left a spare cosmonaut spacesuit in the capsule.<br /><br />After cutting free she gets underway for the Chinese space station that's in the neighborhood around the corner. She makes it to the Chinese space station and changes capsules because the ISS Soyuz doesn't have a chute. After getting away she discovers the Chinese capsule doesn't have any fuel to fire the retro rockets so she can come back home. So she starts getting weepy eyed and cuts her oxygen and takes a nap. End of movie.<br /><br />Nope she wakes up due to Mr. Fox tapping on the window. She has her helmet off but he opens the door anyway so she holds her breath until he closes the door and it repressurizes. They have a talk about the school of hard knocks and he asks her if she thought about the maneuvering thrusters which has plenty of fuel to execute the deorbit burn. After a few more comments she has an epiphany and wakes up. She looks around and Mr. Fox is no longer there. Realizing it was a dream, she turns the oxygen back on, and starts the deorbit burn with the maneuvering thrusters.<br /><br />Unfortunately there isn't a checklist this time and all the buttons are in Chinese so she starts pushing buttons at random. Fortunately the Chinese planned for this scenario because when she pushed the wrong button she got a bad tone and when she pushed the right button she got a good tone. So why do we need checklists when all you need are toned buttons?<br /><br />Fortunately for her everything is automatic because the deorbit burn goes perfect, the capsule separates and orientates itself perfectly for reentry, the chutes deploy at the right altitide, and she splashes down.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Soyuz both Russian and Chinese were designed to land on land not splashdown in the ocean. She must've forgotten the history of the Mercury program when Gus Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 hatch was blown prematurely when he splashed down and quickly sank in the Atlantic Ocean and he almost drowned. Unless she was short on air she should've stayed put instead of blowing the hatch. Fortunately she splashed down in a very shallow sea or lake because she was able to strip down to her astro undies after her capsule quickly sank and took her with it but she couldn't get to the surface because of her heavy suite so the striptease was warranted in this occasion.<br /><br />So after rising to the surface she makes a quick swim to shore and crawls out of the water. I guess she was crawling due to an extended time in space thereby her muscles were atrophied or she could've been tired. She did however look pretty good in those wet astro undies.<br /><br />This was the movie in 3D and it will be the last 3D movie I pay to see because it did nothing for the movie, the same thing happened last year with Prometheus, it looked much better and sharper in 2D.<br /><br />The movie pretty much happens in real screentime so you have to take that into consideration. My review is the whole movie in a nutshell without getting into every scene or what little dialog, meaningful or meaningless, there was.<br /><br />This movie did have a somewhat happy ending but in reality it would have been a total loss of all hands but the writers and producers took the deus ex machina approach to this movie from the beginning.<br /><br />I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie unless it's mostly the people from the studio making those reviews especially those that appear cookie cutter.<br /><br />My 3-star review is for an okay or average if you don't think too much. Had I stuck to my guns when first hearing about this movie, I would've waited for it to come out on video and maybe buy used. Instead I saw an interview with a couple real astronauts on TV last week and they sold me on it.s?<br /><br />Fortunately for her everything is automatic because the deorbit burn goes perfect, the capsule separates and orientates itself perfectly for reentry, the chutes deploy at the right altitide, and she splashes down.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Soyuz both Russian and Chinese were designed to land on land not splashdown in the ocean.

B001230RKC|5.0|this is a must have for any Jackson browne collector.  all of my music was on cassette's.  I replace each item with digital music.  my collection was missing this stellar album.

B0053O89WY|5.0|This was a gift for a former foreign exchange student from Vietnam. I sent it to him because they do not get that show over there. He loved it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun little game, that exercises cognitive reasoning. It's alot of fun and want a part two :) '
B00BIVN82M|5.0|He is a fantastic singer with a great presentation of the music he sings.  I also love to listen to his Christmas music which I have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Been looking for it on Kindle Fire for months and now it's here.  Endless hours of fun.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|As a Paul McCartney Fan I like it. But He can't top the last release of &#34;Kisses on the Bottom&#34;!
B008JFUQ16|5.0|Love this movie,  I didn't think that I was going to like it but I did. I enjoyed it better than the first.  I guess I am just sentinental, and the minions are great
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I have all the versions of Wuthering Heights, and I loved the Laurence Olivier version as well. But this well adapted film has the passion and acting which is truly satisfying! If you love Bronte and the classics, this is a great addition to your film library.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I was kind of over the anachronistically Victorian schtick after the second novel, but thought I'd give this one a try, since it was only three bucks.<br />Unless you love their 'style', save yourself three bucks.
B00ELD3MUW|4.0|I thought this would help my kindle fire HD work with the adobe connect to no avail.  Decided to remove it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hooray amazon finally got candy crush saga I have been waiting for this game forever. I think it's an awesome game you should definitely get it
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I thought once these versions were downloaded, you wouldn't need to be in a WIFI area.  Works great and luckily there has been free WIFI wherever I have use it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My mom loves it! It's a great investment! It's a whole lot better price than you would pay any where else!
B0091THRCU|5.0|I really love this over because it's thin and it fits so snugly, pun intended. I don't use my phone for texting and rarely need to take it out of the cover for calls since most are from the Bluetooth in my car. It may not work as well for someone who is constantly using their phone. You do need both ands to remove it from the case and as I said, it does have a tight fit.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|The animal pieces are so cute and durable at the same time. Good for my little girl who is learning the names of the animals at 20months.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|While I do believe you have to have a natural enjoyment of the time period to fully get into this book I thought the story creative. The writing was imaginative and even if lacking in historical accuracy was enjoyable and entertaining.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time they have it on the kindle, I've been waiting!!! I kept searching and found some pathetic games LOL
B002VRZEYM|5.0|What an eye opener. A very well put together documentary on the crisis that is our national diet. Very inspiring to promote a change in one's diet and food choices for the better.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a nice clear fun game with a good interface and easy controls, great for passing time. Has many options for card skins and game play. never crashes.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|With a family full of boys the Iron man trilogy has become a fast family favorite. We love the action and the dialog doesn't  disappoint! Robert Downey Jr was the perfect choice for Tony Stark. Extremely entertaining and I absolutely recommend it to anyone with a little super hero love in their heart!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is really fun and relatively easy to play. The colors and combinations make for a great way to kill time.
B001HN697M|5.0|Underworld is a gritty and action packed kick butt kind of movie. I've always enjoyed the Underworld series and this one doesn't disappoint! I like seeing the back story a little more!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Just about a perfect tale of goodies and bad guys set in a distant star system, if you like adventure and fast moving action then<br /> this is for you<br />Highly recommended
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This is my first introduction to Lady Antebellum and I'm impressed! I'm not a country music fan but I really enjoy their talent and sound I would recommend it to anyone!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I got my Kindle fire HD last Christmas and was bummed when I found out that Candy Crush wasn't available in the Amazon store.  I did find another way to download it, but i could never use all my helpers.  Thank you for finally offering it for the Kindle Fire!  This has made my whole night!!  :)
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A great classic that no matter your age it will not disappoint! Very entertaining to see the many layers of each character. If you want to have a classic 80's movie marathon this is a must have!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Like hidden picture games. This one has a unique twist. Got rid of my other 'create your own town' games. I even have friends.
0143122010|3.0|Just before the Iraq War started, I discovered using almanac data that in spite of various pulses of irregularity, American deaths in combat had generally declined throughout this country's history.  I had never heard this fact stated explicitly through any form of paper or electronic medium, even though I suspected that many highly educated people must have already known it.  When I discovered that Pinker's \\"Better Angels\\" book was available, I ordered it immediately.  When it arrived, I was surprised by its dimensions, about three times as long as I would have thought an optimal impact size should be.  It is enlightening in two important ways to compare this Pinker book with the world-impact book titled \\"Silent Spring\\" by Rachel Carson.  The first comparison involves the Carson book's optimal impact length, beautiful writing and whatever editing allowed this book to be a blockbuster with news of it spread primarily by person-to-person description and advice.  The second comparison involves using the Pinker-Carson comparisons to reveal how the book publishing industry has changed from 1962 to 2011.  In Carson's time, publishers were looking for excellent to great manuscripts and willing to overlook the author's  position as a low-ranking government worker, lack of a PhD or unqualified to be an assistant professor in a below-average university.  In Pinker's time, publishers are willing to overlook excellent to great manuscripts to link up with authors who have excellent to great platforms, meaning having one's own TV show, high position in an elite university or anything else that could convince prospective readers the author's words are worth considering.  This Pinker book is not a final draft ready to be edited, although buried within it is good news for anyone who can read.  Maybe the best solution would be for a new author to tackle the same topic with Carson in mind, possibly with the platform-loaded Pinker as the second author.  This would do an unnecessarily misery-mired world a big favor.misery-mired world a big favor.
0064430227|5.0|I love this classic book. I love the imagination it encourages and Harold's resourcefulness with his crayon. I like to think my interest in art stems from many nights being read this book as a kid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a fun and addicting game. Go to the app store and look the game up and it should say update. That is how you update.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game a recommend everyone should play this game. good time waster and I cant put it down. fun fun fun fun fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THANK GOD!!! SO SIKED THAT THIS IS ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD. NOW I DPNT HAVE TO SWIPE MY SONS IPAD NOW. SO WE ARE BOTH HAPPY KINDLE NOW HAS THE REAL CANDY CRUSH
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am already hooked! I love it. I wish you didn't run out of lives but I know that's what keeps you coming back for more. Way to go King.com
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Not impressed with the plot or the characters.  I was hoping for more from Arnold but there where no quotable lines.  I saw it a few weeks ago and even now i struggle to remember something about the movie. blah
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very interesting.  Before reading this book I had read several of the reviews, then a few more, trying to determine what the allure was, as everyone said that they couldn't say much about the essential premise without giving it away.  I agree.  It kept my interest all along, and I had thought that I had figured it out.  But no.  Just read it yourself.
B00471TLZS|4.0|Have you seen this movie? It is very different from the on you describe in the synopsis.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />A living person
B0099114WO|5.0|I usually don't buy movies. But felt this one was worth purchasing. I would watch it again. on a cold winter night. When laughter is needed.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I did not buy this for myself but for my 8 yr old grandson, and he's totally in love with this game.  He plays it every chance I let him on MY kindle. heh  He can play for hours.  It's been a good purchase!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Well who wouldn't love these cute little minions? This fast paced game really cracks me up. Gotta love those minions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app game is definitely my favorite and I've been waiting so long for it to be available on Kindle!
B0021L9MJG|4.0|This is probably the best horror anthology I've ever seen.  I only recently watched and wish I had seen it many years ago.  Each individual story in the anthology is rather interesting and some are quite a bit creepy.  The story with Stephen King is probably the weakest of the bunch but it still isn't terrible.  Everyone should have this in their blu ray collection.  If you haven't seen it, or even if you have, buy this Blu-ray!<br /><br />Grade: A-
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I&#34;ve watched all of season one and am now watching season two. The characters are engaging and endearing. The costumes are gorgeous and the setting is beautiful. Story line is wholesome and interesting without being filled with sex and vulgarity. I love everything about this show...only sad that it was only filmed for four short seasons...
B00AGH54XK|5.0|The sequel to one of my favorite movies of all time. The prefect sequel if you ask me. And the song &#34;All Alone on Christmas&#34; is oone of my favorite holiday songs of all time.
1444714562|5.0|great book series my son loves to read them we plan to read more when we can get them at discounted prices
B0035HKWM6|5.0|This movie made me laugh as a kid when it came out. And after a few years it still does. To me it is just a fun. With the combination of musical choreography, cartoony special effects (like Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and Jim Carrey make this one of my favorites.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Good value for the price but can be a slight challenge to hold for large hands. It sharpens just as advertised.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I can't wait for the sequel. Looks even better than this one, and I really, really liked it. Actors who played Thor and Loki were meant to play this characters.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|My first Brandon Sanderson, and I am absolutely going to make sure it is not my last.  A fun, quick read that pulsates with vitality and the little profundities that can make this genre sing.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|I bought this hood as the 18-70 is my work horse lens and was a second hand buy - so it did not come with the hood. Material is as described. Fit is also perfect. Does its job perfectly. Note that the zoom ring is not 100% accessible with the hood folded inwards.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|it sort of different\ from other zombie movies.i very much like the scene when the zombies are going over the wall.i give it a c or a b
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY love this game. I loved it on my phone and now I get to play it on my kindle n I'm so happy to start over just to play it over again. I recommend this to anyone who loves puzzles.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Had heard about the show and my wife wanted to get caught up so I bought the set. Now she's hooked ... The show is great and we're so into that on a trip to England we went to Highclere Castle (the real Downton Abbey) and Bampton (the town where the church is) ... It was amazing. Can't wait for series 4!!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|As best I can tell, the Kindle Fire version will go no further than Level 35, at least not without paying 99 cents to unlock the next set of levels.  Let's see: 440 levels @ .99 cents per 35 levels = $12.57.  Kinda pricey for an app, particularly when you consider how many match-3-type games are out there.  It would be nice to know what the pricing structure was--I could see paying $1.99 or even $2.99 for a game where all levels were theoretically accessible, even if in-app purchases continued to be available.<br /><br />Obviously, it *IS* possible to solve the initial puzzles without purchasing extra lives, moves, or boosters.  It remains to be seen whether this is true at higher levels--and I imagine it's not something I'm going to ever find out.<br /><br />Perhaps if I were in the Facebook majority (seems to be a requisite for this game), it would be more appealing.  As it is, I find it appalling from an ethical point of view, and diabolically clever from a MBA's point of view.  After all, fools and their money deserve to be parted. And who am I to say whether or not people are getting their dollar's -worth of utility each time they choose to cheat at a video game?<br /><br />10/28/2013 UPDATE<br />A kind commenter pointed out that it's possible to unlock the next set of levels by successfully completing \\"Mystery Quests\\"--in the case of level 35 and 50, there are 3 \\"quests\\" (which are just like game levels). The next quest becomes available 24 hours after successfully completing the one before.  The first set of quests unlocks the levels up to 50--meaning that you can rack up quite a bill if you're impatient and pay to unlock levels. (440-35=405; 405/15 = 27; $26.73).  You can therefore view \\"pay to play\\" as payment in money or incovenience.  Pick your poison.<br /><br />What seems to make Candy Crush different from other match-3 games (e.g., Bejeweled, Jewel Star; former FAOTD \\"Around the World in 80 Days,\\" Heroes of the Kalevala,\\" and \\"Call of Atlantis\\"), otherthan the social-network connections (and associated peer pressure) are fairly trivial:<br />1) On most levels, the limiting factor is MOVES, not time. One can contemplate the position of the pieces at leisure and find and plan for 4- and 5-piece matches.<br />2) The special tiles resulting from 4- and 5-pieces matches (roughly equivalent to bombs and lighting bolts in similar games) can be combined for an amplified effect.<br />3) When there are moves left over after achieving the goal of a level, the game goes into a hypnotic autoplay mode in which it simulates the effects of special tiles and adds thousands of points to the score for that level.<br /><br />There's a moral in there somewhere, but I don't know what it is.<br /><br />P.S. Does it look to you as if developers are not only paying for reviews, they're also paying for those reviewers to mark all 5-star reviews as \\"helpful\\" whether they are or not?  I hope this can be reined in before the review system is rendered completely unhelpful.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|Pretty one dimensional zombie flick that doesn't hold a candle to 28 Days Later but enjoyable escapism nonetheless.  Hopefully sequel might have some more depth to it and less plot holes - otherwise switch brain off and enjoy.
B00746O3X8|2.0|This camera harness is very much like the cotton carrier brand. Unfortunately, it is cheaply made. The stitching started to come undone after the first couple hours of using it. I would save your money, and get the cotton carrier.
B002RI9YCI|4.0|Alan Bennett is an excellent writer. I enjoyed the subject matter and the clever way of using the library to be the introduction into the story. This was a very charming look at the Queen and much of it could be true,.
B000RJO578|4.0|Simon Pegg plays a straight-laced police officer, Sgt. Angel, who has been transferred to the sleepy little town of Sandford, England.  His new partner, Danny (played with gleeful ineptitude by Nick Frost) loves nothing better than to toss back a pint or two at the pub.  Soon enough some extraordinarily suspicious fatal \\"accidents\\" begin to occur on a regular basis, and Sgt. Angel is on top of things lickety split.<br />Timothy Dalton gives a surprising performance with a flare for comedy!  Jim Broadbent and Bill Nighy add their comedic genius touches.<br /><br />Grab a big bowl of popcorn and a couple of friends because this is an awesome Simon Pegg comedy!  Anything from the mind the man who wrote \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is worth giving a shot!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed this game & had a hard time putting it down. Not sorry I purchased this game. It is challenging without being too difficult.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When you meet this group of genius nerds, you will be hooked on The Big Bang Theory!  Dr. Sheldon Cooper is played BRILLIANTLY (excuse the pun) by Jim Parsons and has more quirks than a hedgehog has spikes (but he's not crazy, \\"his mom had him tested!\\")  Penny (their \\"normal\\" neighbor) is adorable and charming and has the patience of a saint while putting up with her very strange group of friends.  This is an intelligently written sit-com.  I highly recommend this series!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|No one can keep writing songs like the master he is.  It seems his song writing and music get better and better.  This is another example of some Dylan hits and new songs moving along the next step in his ever evolving music.  To characterize Dylan as any one type of music is foolish; he is music.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|I LOVE me some zombies!  And The Walking Dead does zombie brilliantly with a treasure trove of characters you will care about and lots of scares and chills!  Andrew Lincoln (Rick) plays a strong leader for an interesting, wonderful group of survivors whose number changes with every season.  You never know who will be next...or how.  The zombies look ridiculously real and terrifying.  Every time the group begins to get comfortable, a fantastic new situation arises that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|While it provides a review of the life of Henry III in wonderfully prepared scenarios, thrilling action and enormous posturing of the king, a moving lesson, it has two flaws. 1. Technical issues: The DVDs skip from time to time, or stall if you prefer, and some features don't work or I failed to enable them correctly. For me subtitling is necessary due to poor hearing. While I make it work with other products, I can't make this one work.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, I immensly enjoyed the fine acting, excellent costumes, realistic looking sets and the great lines that were spoken. 2. The flesh: I thought the flesh and sex scenes went too far. While the king was obsessed with sex, we really didn't need to go that far with him.<br /><br />I plan to keep and enjoy my set many times. But, based on the sex scenes, I cannot show them to children in my family. The producers must try to understand that in using movies to teach, they must reach the family too.
0385344228|2.0|Within the first couple of chapters you know precisely whodunnit.  You'll slog (albeit fast-reading-pages quickly) through another 300+ pages till you arrive at the 'unexpected twist'.  It's a long way to go to reach a payoff.  And the payoff ain't that compelling.  Which may also be said of the cliche characters, the underdeveloped plot, and the lackluster writing in this novel.  As an exemplar of its genre, Defending Jacob rates high enough I imagine.  As a piece of literature in its own right, it's a bore.  An in-flight read for sure.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I bought this for my teacher-spouse, who laughed all the way through the movie because the teacher's attitude is spot-on!  Great movie!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This a great book that made me contemplate about appreciating each day given to us! It is a blessing to be satisfied and enjoy each moment we have.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|Watched it on my iMac with pretty decent screen resolution and even though we didn't purchase the HD version it was not too pixelated. I have read the book, not the same, but still a great movie - I would say enjoy it for what it is, not what it's not.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game - didn't realize energy restored without paying. So far very happy with it. Intend to continue on. Rooms are exciting and diffrent each time you enter. Does seem to have a little more social media push than I usually like, but willing to overlook at this point.<br /><br />Djnixd
B003UESJH4|5.0|My grandson stutters and this was very inspirational to the entire family. It made us both laugh and cry. Thank you for the speedy service.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is good for all different people to play.<br /><br />The only thing that is getting a bad reviews is that when u have to wait for energy levels to go up
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|This CD wasn't quite what I was expecting. I don't really enjoy the slow Bluegrass songs. I love the ones where the music really get going. The last couple of songs are better.
B00F35BV64|2.0|I've been a die hard Star Trek fan since the very first series and seen all of them- original, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise - and the movies. I was disappointed with the first movie with the new \\"old\\" crew at a younger age because they were untrue to the characters. I find the public necking between Spock and Uhuru \\"high illogical\\" for one thing, but what really gets me about that movie and now this one is that is is focused on 11 year old boys that play video games. Way too many special effects and fights do not cover up the fact that there is nothing substantial for a plot and the characterizations of the cast is mostly just wrong. Except maybe for Sulu. Scotty is a whiner to the annoying degree, Checkhov sounds like he has something stuck in his cheeks. Probably won't bother with seeing any more. They have gone where no Star Trek has gone before...into the reject pile.
B002N57KG2|2.0|Just too stupid. What a waste of talented actors. There are some spots in it that are funny, but it is just too silly for my taste.
B002IE2JF0|4.0|Had not heard of this movie before but noticed it was rated highly so took a try and was pleasantly surprised.  Was better than I expected.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD. I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED TONY BENNETT. HIS MUSIC NEVER GETS OLD TO ME, HE CONTINUES TOO REINVENT HIMSELF.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game and am so happy its finally  on the my kindle fire !!!!!  yippy! !!!!!!!! love it!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story kept the reader interested and wanting to turn page after page.  However the content is graphic, so I would caution against young readers choosing this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book for me is a 4 star even though I do have one criticism.  First the good stuff.  I just love the feelings and the authors talent in the way her main character Star told all the emotional interactions with the love of her life and her friends and this is the reason the book for me gets four stars.  The reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because in the end of the book Stars teen age boyfriend has the insight and dialog of a decreed mental councilor which was pretty unbelievable. Trust me, I have had therapy and you would never get that level from that young and unschooled young man.  I think the counseling that this young man gave to Star was amazing and wonderful and healing and well written.  So it is not what was said or expressed it is just the very unlikely character it came from that got me a little on the I can't believe this side of things.  Other than that I still really enjoyed the read a lot.  A solid four star book for me !
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game started off strong, but as levels advanced, the clues started to make absolutely no sense. I found myself tapping aimlessly on anything and everything. But it was still fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is definitely my favorite of this series. Ender is a very sympathetic character and his journey was exciting and thought provoking. highly recommend to anyone who likes Youth fic and/or Sci-fi.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book should delight fans of &#34;The Shining&#34; as it reintroduces familiar characters but introduces new challenges for Danny Torrance, who has grown up --not altogether successfully-- in the time between the first book and the present day.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Officesuite 7 ask you to download the font package. So I purchased it and downloaded it but when Officesuite tells me to install the fonts it freezes before it is done.I removed the app from my device and then downloaded again. When I was ask to install it freezes up before it is done. Terrible app. Needs to be removed from the app store. Waisted my money on it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I thought this movie was great. I really loved the first one. Into Darkness give back story on the Kirk/Spock relationship. Sort of a spin from Wrath of Khan. I can watch it over and over. I can't wait for the next one.
B00065GX64|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies and it was time to own it. classic film in the genre. i highly recomment.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Oh, I so enjoyed this book. It was beautifully written. Our hero, Harold, goes on this impossibly long walk, believing that if he walks to his dying friend's bedside, she won't die. He leaves his wife, Maureen, at home, and as he makes his way towards Queenie, we are privy to his memories and regrets, learning more about his relationships with Queenie, Maureen and his son David. We also get glimpses of Maureen's memories and thoughts.<br /><br />We meet interesting and real characters along the way, as Harold's walk becomes a pilgrimage and he is joined by more and more people, with different goals and aspirations and expectations for the walk.<br /><br />The ending was perfect.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the writing - there was some clever imagery, and the descriptions of people were fantastic.
B009JZSC9S|3.0|Interesting, but morally murky.  Cheating on husband does not make one a Good Wife, the fact that he cheated on her does not make it OK.
B002X6PTH8|5.0|Great Classic Movie. They should have made a part two with Jim Carrey. Just like they failed to make Dumb and Dumber to - 20 years later.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed this book because my favorite book in the world is Battle Royale. I should have realized I wouldn't like the next two when this book ends with a mild cliffhanger. This author does not know how to write suspense. People die in a small paragraph with no suspense, same for the next two.<br /><br />The thing that soured me the most is the epilogue. She only writes about Katniss. Second & third books are just, OMG Who do I love??? and plot holes.
B00ELU7A4E|5.0|Katy Perry has one amazing voice could listen to her the whole day. She just comes out with hit after hit.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My daughter loved cd and is always playing it. I enjoy it as well because it is upbeat and positve.<br />We recommend it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great play. No internet multi just blue tooth. Controls are perfect. Really fun!!! Worth the money. Hope they keep making expansions.
0895260131|4.0|All Christens especially Catholics should read this book so that they learn the real reason for the Crusades. It should also be read by people of the Jewish faith as well.
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|I've listened to John on this album, and to be honest I do not know whether I like it or not. He done something different and when you are as talented as John you are going to use your creative juices, He to me might have gone to deep for me on this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I loved this game since I was 6  years old so I would recommend this game for all ages
1454704225|5.0|I love this book. You can let your imagination run wild and create . I am using this book for my art journaling club at the Middle School.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|The Cid was just a cog in the wheel of wealth and power.  He did not let that power and wealth corrupt him.  He did not answer to the politically popular beliefs of his time.  The Cid had principles and his allies and enemies grew to respect him even when they did not agree with him.  He fought and died for what he believed in and in so doing became a legend:  &#34;The Cid&#34;.  At the time a title of &#34;El Cid&#34; was an honor conferred on someone who both enemy and friend respected and who did not bow to the political whims of his day. Unlike today's politicians, he was a man of his word.

1476727651|5.0|As an avid Stephen King fan, I was more than excited when I found out he would be writing a sequel to \\"The Shining.\\"  However, I was a bit skeptical.  I worried that this new novel would turn into \\"The Shining: Part 2\\" and there would be too much focus on what happened at The Overlook.  I worried that \\"Doctor Sleep\\" would become the mediocre, trying too hard sequel we've all read and that it would be an abomination that would ruin my fondness for \\"The Shining.\\"  After beginning to read \\"Doctor Sleep,\\" I was pleasantly surprised at the balance between Dan Torrance's past and the present, the explanation of what his life had become, and paving way for the reader to become enveloped in a new character and her uncanny ability to shine.  \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is very different from it's predecessor, but in a very good way.  It gives the reader the chills, but in a way different from \\"The Shining.\\"  \\"Doctor Sleep\\" shows that Stephen King is at the top of his game and that he is still able to entice his reader as he did all those years ago.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited Candy Crush is available on my Kindle Fire.  I have waited so long for this!!  No complaints at all!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive! I love to sit and play it. Just as fun on Kindle as it is on my phone.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Always loved John Legend. It's great what he is doing to promote the album (singing his hit song at someone's wedding). Makes me wish I was getting married.

B001CTGQBK|5.0|it a great movie, the creation of the movie was great, the setting was perfect. the actors were on point.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I'm sure it was the reality in South pre-Emancipation, but the story and imagery were disturbing. Very well told of lives intertwined.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Captivating, great acting. Wonderful clothes!  Ha Ha Ha.  Love the show and look forward to seeing it every week.  Thanks!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|A pretty good detective novel. Not stellar. I could pick up and put down. Setting and murder plot was interesting.
1603427244|2.0|Unfortunately I found this to be just a few ways to bind off repeated with slight variations in how to hold the yarn or needles.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Spoiler alert  -- we like to think our kids are perfect. But what if they aren't? Intense psychological thriller. Read at your own risk.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy I can finally play on my kindle HD!!! I play on my computer and my iPhone too. Best game out there to play!
B00C5R8364|4.0|I love spending time with a little brain candy now and then. Not a serious subject, but fun ride while it lasts.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not sure if, at this point, another review of this book will make a difference, but I liked Doctor Sleep.  It was solidly written but I can't consider it one of King's best (too much competition).  I became very involved with the characters but the plot was a bit thin.  The whole novel was just a setup for the good guys to meet up with the bad guys, and the climax was a bit of a letdown.  I felt as though there should have been more of a struggle between two such powerful forces, but it seemed very short, and the story wrapped up too cleanly.  Regardless, this is a must read for any King fan.
B00C7E3ELE|5.0|Perfectly restored. Anyone would be happy to have this on there collectors or DVD shelf. Look out for the fog.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a fun game. I wish you could have infinite lives or maybe not have to wait so long for another life when they run out. Besides that I like it.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It was a slow read for me too many unnecessary chapters especially about the Berlin Wall.  It was kinda predictable to an extent

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Get it! Its fun! Sooooo much fun to play and good for your brain. IT IS A MUST HAVE APP!  This is a jigsaw puzzle with more than enough levels to keep u busy for those long car rides and anything that takes a long time.

B00BAXFAOW|5.0|All of Malcolm Gladwells’ writings are worth reading, including his articles in the New Yorker and his four books. He shows countless examples where what we think is true is not so. In Outliers, for example, he notes that people think that success is based upon intelligence: Orientals are more intelligent, therefore they excel in academics; the poor, living in slums, are not bright, therefore they achieve little or no success. Gladwell demonstrates with many examples that this notion is wrong. This is not only academic information, it shows readers how they can succeed.<br /><br />The biblical tale of David and Goliath is Gladwell’s first example in this book of where people fail to evaluate situations correctly. People – including the Philistines and Israelites in this story – think that the strong, many, wealthy, and educated can always overcome the weak, small, uneducated, and disabled. The phrase “David vs. Goliath” has become an idiom for the unusual and unexpected victory of the underdog. Nothing is further from the truth. A careful analysis of the story shows that David found an easy way to defeat the giant. David couldn’t defeat Goliath in hand to hand combat, the way the giant wanted to fight, but David was a slinger and he used his sling to kill the giant. Slingers were important soldiers in ancient armies along with archers. They could accurately hit a target from as far as 200 yards. Goliath had no chance of hurting David when he stood so far from him. Gladwell shows how we too can learn ways to overcome giants. He also reveals that Goliath was not as formidable as one may think; the very fact that he was taller than average created problems for him.<br /><br />In part one of his book, Gladwell gives other examples of the advantages of seeming disadvantages and the disadvantages of seeming advantages. He tells, for instance, how a basketball coach was able to get his team to win despite his players being somewhat inept and playing against winning teams. Also, how despite common thought larger class size is frequently better for children than small classes and less prestigious colleges can be better than ivy league.<br /><br />In part two, he has three chapters that show that difficulties, such as an inability to read effectively because of dyslexia, can be desirable. He gives examples of highly successful people, including a lawyer, with dyslexia.<br /><br />In part three, he shows how repeatedly powerful people and institutions can be beaten. One of his many examples is how a French clergyman saved many Jews from being killed by the overwhelming power of the Nazis.Also, how despite common thought larger class size is frequently better for children than small classes and less prestigious colleges can be better than ivy league.<br /><br />In part two, he has three chapters that show that difficulties, such as an inability to read effectively because of dyslexia, can be desirable.

B000I9YWDO|5.0|This is truly one of the funiest movies I have ever seen.... hilarious!!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh.
1455527475|1.0|The greed which is so prevalent on Wall Street comes through very nicely, but the reason for only one star is the following contradictory information which greatly reduces Greg Smiths credibility.<br /><br />On page 83, Greg Smith writes: \\"With the memory of the eight-dollar error fresh in my mind, I began to pride myself on my reliability and accuracy.\\"<br /><br />Considering that this book was published in 2012 it is difficult to believe that he actually believes what he wrote on page 43,<br />\\"Osama Bin Laden had attacked America's financial center, only blocks from the New York Stock Exchange,..........<br />and further, on page71, he writes:<br />\\"This was during the lead-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and I could tell at once that all the Rhodes judges, and particularly the justice, were critical of the U.S. response to the 9/11 attacks. America, they all agreed, was rattling its sabers, and worse, it meant to take the sabers out and use them. It was an imperialist power on the order of ancient Rome, bent on a foreign policy of colonization. Someone at the table actually said this to me.<br />I disagreed--passionately. I had experienced 9/11 personally, I told the judges; I had keenly felt its terror and heartbreak. The United States had to hunt down the perpetrators and punish them.\\"<br /><br />Greg Smith makes these statements without explaining how Osama Bin Laden managed to bring the thermitic explisives into WTC1, WTC2 and WTC7, nor does he explain how Osama Bin Laden so elegantly managed to do all the other things including the ongoing coverup.<br /><br />I would encourage Greg Smith to do just a little bit of research before making such ridiculous claims in the future. Because the controlled media states these things does not mean it is true.<br />For an uneducated person to make those statements would be excusable, but not for someone who prides himself on his own reliability and accuracy.<br />A good place to start would be to understand \\"Solving 9-11 The Deception that Changed the World\\", by Christopher Bollyn<br /><br />Or, at least look at the AE911truth website.<br /><br />Without having made these grave factual errors, I would have given Greg Smith 4 stars.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|woot! season four begins.....off to a great start. The kid is starting to become irritating. wished they had saved the crazy lady.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Ive been using this for playing games like bf3 and planetside 2 getting 60+ fps on high-ultra settings and Ive never had any problems with it and ive had for about 4 months now. It ran the battlefield 4 beta with no ploblems. If all your wanting to do is play games or anything less then that, this is all you will need for a while.<br /><br />I plan on buying more.
B00AGYM0DU|3.0|I listens to the recorded version as read by the author and I'm glad I did since she speaks Japanese with a convincing accent and it goes a long way to conveying the story.<br />The first ten disks tell a beautiful, fantasy like story from two perspectives, which I won't go into since so many have already commented on it.<br />In the last disc the story just totally falls apart, when the story tellers's boring husband explains how how the story is possible since it fits into the theory of quantum mechanics. Also, we learned earlier where Neo ends up, from a letter which they now seem to completely overlook, as they speculate on where she ended up and is she alive or not.<br />A fantasy story like this needs no explanation and bringing in quantum mechanics, jolts us out of the world of fantasy into the world of hard science fiction. It's just a dumb ending which seems tacked on for no reason whatsoever. I would have given this novel four or five stars but for the stupid ending.
1609611543|5.0|My husband and I have changed the way we eat by eliminating wheat. The difference in how we feel is like night and day. We both dropped about 30 pounds each right off the bat, and my weight lose was without exercise. You are what you eat is so true.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Great case, you can really tell the difference compared with the stock case, the quality underwater is amazing. Adding a red filter for tropical blue water really helps correct the colors.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Repetitive action, like Angry grandma runner or so on.<br /><br />Minions seems gorgeous, and levels seem really beautifully crafted.<br /><br />Move fast on my cell, but, It gets hot too quickly using this game.<br /><br />Negative point : is a run, jump and slide game. I was hopping something more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is a great game that makes you think very quickly i just enjoy the different challenges  it is a very fun game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Play this on Facebook and love this game. So happy that Amazon finally has it for Kindle. Try it and you will like it.
0307277887|3.0|If you've seen &#34;Dexter&#34; season 1 than there really is no reason to get the book.  There are a few details that are more explained like most books based on movies or shows but not enough to really warrant (for me anyway) to purchase this if I had to again.  I hope that rest of the series of books that Jeff Lindsay has available on here are not just copies of the other 7 seasons of Dexter but different stories written to give a deeper look into the character of &#34;Dexter Morgan&#34;.  I give it 3 stars based on the facts that I do enjoy season 1 and there is a bit more depth to certain parts.  If you're one like me who doesn't need to read something after you've seen it, I'd avoid this, but if you like reading and seeing to see the differences or what not, than you should go ahead and buy this and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
B005HS00NW|4.0|I love Midnight City! The rest of the CD is pretty sweet. M83 is definitely a new sound for a world of pop clones.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love the &#34;Rocky&#34; series.  I watched these as a kid and I still to this day love the movies.  Getting this all in the 1 complete collection, it was an instant buy for me.  The story of a nice guy who knows how to throw punches but has a big heart with such loyalty to those close to him that he fought wars because of them, how can you not get behind a character like that.<br /><br />&#34;Rocky IV&#34; still to this day is one of my all time favorite movies, I don't listen to the critics who try to point out its flaws, I just watch it and enjoy every minute of it.  While 5 gets its harshest reviews, I do understand why it was made.<br /><br />If you liked these movies growing up like I did, you have to get this so you can relive the great stories over and over again.
031623480X|5.0|So informative, helped unpuzzel the food jumble that the food companies have created to keep us sick. Read it. It could save your life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful show.  Entertaining and riveting. I just want to go from one episode to the next to find out what happens.  I can't wait for season 4.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator,  easy and comfortable to use. Moreover, it is free of charge. It's a pleasure to use it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have had this app for about 3  weeks now and it is brilliant.  If you like puzzles to make your brain work then this is for you.  It starts by teaching you the simple rules of the game and away you go.  The 15x15 puzzles are the hardest but start with the 5x5 ones to learn first.
B003E88TKS|1.0|I had a friend whom thought I would like this, REALLY? I'm unemployed and it sorta twist the knife for me in my current state. :-(
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTING. IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS FRUIT DROPS . I .CAN'T PUT IT DOWNi. I CAN PLAY FOR HOURS AND HOURS. HOPE THERE IS A NUMBER 3
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Thank you Marware :-) it works fine. Would like more colors, like pink, red, yellow, purple. Actually the white kindle case goes with my cell phone.I think it's cute :-)
B008M87GJK|3.0|The software works smoothly. But I don't get the all the news in the world. It is better than nothing.
B001NTJV6G|4.0|I was still in H.S an loved to here this album before going to school an when I got home. Actually this album was 1of her best albums. 4 Leaf Clover was my favorite :-)
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This cable exceeded my expectations for the price.  It is a very nice, sturdy cable.  It works beautifully to connect a keyboard and mouse to my computer I keep in the closet.  I don't notice any lags even while gaming.  I would definitely buy another if I found the need for one.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's so annoying you have to wait a while to get life's.This game is very colorful and fun otherewise.You should get the app.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Great movies! I thought After Earth wasn't going to be as good as it was by the reviews it has, but after watching it i was surprised. I recommend this to anybody that wants to have a good time.
0552769762|2.0|The package consisted of the books independently. It was not a boxed set. There was no box showing it was a set.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this app. It is challenging but not too hard where you get frustrated and give up.  I like how you have to search for clues to uncover what you need to open the door.  I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more floors but look foward to new updates. It really is a good game if you like a challenge. It's fun and very hard to put down. I couldn't stop until I opened the door. Try it.  What do you have to lose?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The world's best app is finally on Amazon for the Kindle Fire. I've been hearing so many positive feedback about this game, and it was irritating that I couldn't play the game. And now, I can play the game. Excuse me while I praise the Lord for this beautiful miracle.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I was really pleased with the selection of songs on this Hits CD.  All of the Phil Collins classics. These songs bring back great memories.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|My first Jo Nesbo novel that I read was  Redbreast.  This is apparently is his first Harry Hole novel and frankly it was worse. The writing is uneven, the plot poor and the love interest scenes were more worthy of Mills and Boon. (Having never read a Millls and Boon book I am here making an assumption). To call Jo Nesbo the Norwegian Stieg Larsson is doing a grave injustice to Stieg Larsson. I doubt if I will read another Jo Nesbo book.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We are hooked and watched the whole season in 5 nights. Gripping and very poss. to happen in this country. It opens eyes and minds, we should never forget what happens on our watch and with in our country.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its about time!!!! Glad its finally on kindle. was tired of the bootleggers pretending the game they were selling was candy crush
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|Love it!!! Its an awesome album for anyone into this music! All the tracks were good and it sounds original.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Have been hearing of it for awhile and finally downloaded. Only thing when I play a game want to do it for as long as I want to. Don't like being cut off unless you pay for extra lives.
031623480X|5.0|I have been searching for five years to find a solution to my health situation after I gave up on the western medical world. I found help via acupuncture however, my situation got better but never healed.<br /><br />Changing my diet was something that I did on my own based on how I felt physically after eating. I eliminated grains, refined sugars, carbonated beverages and anything that made me feel bloated and miserable after eating.<br /><br />Then I found this book. I bought it and then found that my instincts were correct and found the medical reasons behind why my body was reacting poorly to so many foods. Basically I changed to a 80/20 Paleo diet and I am trying the foods in this book. I feel better, have more energy and believe that this information may be what solves my medical situation. I have lost 13 pounds in the process without dieting, but by changing what I eat.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am thrilled to finally have my favorite game on my Kindle. I was playing it on my phone and now I have it on a tablet and I won't play it on my phone again. Candy Crush has AWESOME graphics and sound. My progress on my game on my phone transferred perfectly to my Kindle. I LOVE this game! Thank you Amazon for getting the real Candy Crush application. I'm smiling.
B00EJ9RIXA|5.0|This is good for school and science too. This is awesome for kids and adults to. I need a computer but since I found this I'm so happy!

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|this game is amazing anyone who says otherwise is a loser that has no life and can not notify a great game
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I ordered this for my daughters 3rd birthday way to late. It showed it would be here by here birthday (5 days after the order) but with my experience of ordering things online I never get them on time. Well much to my surprise I received it in 4 days it came with a special zipper pull (I think my daughter was more excited about that then the movie) and I seemed like I had things together. Thank you so much
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this game to come to kindle. It is very addictive. It has been running great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Such an awesome addicting game! I wish there were nore levels in the beginning son we do t have to keep writing reviews to keep playing, but overall really vreat game. So fun!
B005PK57IK|5.0|It is a great series and it is so much better watching it on amazon prime so you aren't interrupted by the endless commercials.
B00D014E4Y|5.0|Very good for any age....I highly recommended this movie for kids that like Legos and Batman.  It is very funny.
B003QTSMXE|2.0|Disney did (another) good job with creative filmmaking.  Characters and graphic effects are great.  Terrible message of the-world-is-coming-to-an-end-because-you-didn't-recycle-your-used-toilet-paper.  Doomsday messages that are not based on reality don't help anyone.  The world is in God's hands and His sovereignty.  Consequences (good or bad) come not because of how well we take care of dirt or exercise or how non-materialistic we are, but whether we fear the Lord, and obey and love His statutes.  For HE will bring calamity if we do not love Him and worship Him, not &#34;Mother Nature&#34; or any other false god.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Good combination of Tom Cruis and Brad Pitt. And the best Horror movie I hv ever viewed. Strongly Recomand ~
B007SGM084|2.0|To sum it all up- Better love story than Twilight.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this series was the introduction of LIGHT BDSM. That's right for all you Vanilla readers. The BDSM described in this series isn't really that hardcore to begin with. Not saying it should have gotten deeper into that scene but for all the Hype its getting...<br /><br />And the sex really didn't save this series- it was used as a device to cover up poor writing and a plot line that felt like it was thrown in. Book one is by far the best of the series, the other two pick up only if you want to waste money. Book one even isn't that great- reads better than Twilight, still not written well, very repetitive- as repetitive as the comments on this page stating how repetitive it is. It's that repetitive. See how repetitive it gets? Point for repetitiveness?<br /><br />We have Mary Sue and Gary Stu here- Perfect Mary Sue Ann Steele and Flawed Gary Stu- but still by the time descriptions are over and you blaze by the first sex scene you've read 80% of all three books.<br /><br />Good read? No. Good read when your bored on a airline flight or have nothing else to do? Yup. Good read for those Vanilla readers who wonder about BDSM? No- try L.A. Banks or Laurell K Hamilton- granted they do paranormal but still an exponentially better read.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 4 year old can play this without trouble and he is more inclined to eat his real fruits. The older kids like it too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have resisted this game until now, it is fun, love the colors and the difficulty.  Works perfectly with my kindle hd. A little more explanation of the bonus candies would would be better. The sound track is so simple but perfectly fits the game.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Good fun each s y mechanics amazing graphics...run for fans of CCG everywhere. Ware the pull of buying too much.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|It is very unlikely that me or anyone else will have this much talent when they're 72.<br /><br />This is one of the top three blues guitarists alive on this planet.<br /><br />The other two would whack on me and call Buddy Guy number one.<br /><br />As a guy, I recommend CD2, Track 3 &#34;Evil Twin.&#34;
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I watched the unrated version before finding the rated version on Netflix. I'm a fan of the PA series, and I highly recommend, if you're a fan, skipping the unrated version and watching the theater release.<br /><br />As for the theater release, I'm not sure why there's so much hating on this film. It seems to follow the same formula as the others -- an examination of an average family's reaction to paranormal activity in their lives, with a backstory of possession. There are fake scares and practical jokes, just like in the other movies. And there's a tiny parcel of new information about the world we're in, just like in the other movies. Attacks on the family  are as brutal as any we've seen in the other films, perhaps more extreme. So I'm not sure why people see this film as not scary. The main difference in PA4 is that there's someone smart enough -- Alex -- to understand right away that something dangerous has entered their lives. Perhaps that gives the film a less mysterious tone.<br /><br />These aren't big special effects films. These are films about families and human reactions. Which is why I find them interesting.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film relates to bad special effects and the hamhanded use of infrared recording. The recording itself isn't a problem for me. I don't care whether x-box is featured, it makes sense for the film. But the  special effects revealed through infrared are poorly done, to the point of being comical. This is not a small problem; it breaks the mood of the film. But it doesn't mean the entire film should be trashed for it.<br /><br />I have to give the filmmakers credit for finding new ways to create found footage. I'm curious what they'll come up with for installment #5.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies growing up.  I was glad to see it show up on Amazon Prime.  It is amazing how much the world has changed and the adventures kids can have without digital devices.
B000W93CHC|5.0|It is Ken Follett, there is nothing more to say. A genius at work. I have enjoyed everything he has written.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love the whole album, not just the singles with radio play! Treasure is my three year old nieces favorite song, so I wish there was a version w/o the intro, but we just turn it down for a few seconds at the beginning.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It starts off as just something to do on your free time, then you just get sucked in!  Great fun and the characters are cute.
B004J4WNL2|2.0|I read this book for a book club assignment.  The topic naturally generated considerable lively discussion, but nobody in the group felt the book itself was worth recommending to others.  Interesting topic, but the research and examples cited didn't seem very well organized.  Most found it difficult to finish as the repetitive style definitely failed to hold one's attention.  Even our &#34;introverts&#34; were unimpressed (although admitted it was nice to read a book all about them).  Disappointing treatment of an interesting subject..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had many friends playing this game on Facebook and had about 100 invites before I decided that I would see what all the hype was about. Turned out that I can't put the game down and continue to look forward till the next time I can beat a level and also beat my friends scores! Highly addictive and worth the download! I recommend this for all ages 150%!<br />JGoins
B008UX2UIO|2.0|I would never have read this if not for a Book Group Selection.  And really did not like it at all.<br />Some have felt it was funny - it will be interesting to discuss at next gathering.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think this is the best game in the world. If u like games with dragons in them than this is the game for u. All of my friends love it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My opinion of the book was that the book was written with the supreme judgement of Jeff Kinney.  The book was one of the best books l ever read in my 10 years of life.  So in conclusion I vote this to be a five star book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I gave this book four stars because it is a good story with. Intrigue and many different stories wound into one . I wished the author had told more about Polly's life after the accident.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game. however. not worth putting money into. There are so many free games out there just wouldn't pay money to play a game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's easy fun just like all the other ones you have to upgrade your town or place it's a nice kills time fast to
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Brilliant. This book put all my spiritual thoughts into print. It's comforting to know that others feel the same. Inspirational reminder to live according to the path...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an amazing app that will challenge you but not frustrate you I ant wait for more levels btw only ten levels
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|The first Iron Man is still my favorite of all the Iron Man's, but, this movie is really good.  It is way better than the second one and definitely worth a watch.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It will have you busy for hours. I had to share with everyone and they loved it too. To everyone that love games you will love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I play on my phone, laptop and now even my kindle. I had been watching for when I w would be able to get on the kindle.<br /><br />I love it!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Like the title says, this app was better a while ago, and if the developers stopped the &quot;money grubbing&quot;, it would be considerably better. That's in quotes because everything you could spend money on is totally optional. There's absolutely no need to spend any money at all, but they've taken away a few things that we used to be able to do (such as choose the starting zone) for free. Now, it costs coins that are few and far between without actually spending cash.<br /><br />All of that said, it's still a cute and entertaining game, I'm just seriously turned off by the micro-purchase state of the app store these days.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|Great movie. Both me and my 3yr old daughter loved it. Very adventurous and can't wait to see the sequel.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Like most great teachers she entertains you and teaches you what you think you want to learn while filling you with a more important knowledge.  A pleasure to read a gift to have read.
B005544V6A|5.0|The shows were interesting and easy to watch.  Really enjoyed being able to watch them with NO COMMERCIALS!!!  This made it especially wonderful!  Also, the rest of the family could watch whatever they wanted to watch!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Kept me very entertained on a 5 hour plane ride. I'd highly recommend it for a book club or just a fun read.
B000W967UQ|5.0|This was my first foray into the Disc World universe and I am utterly entranced.  The world Mr. Pratchett has created is rich with detail, full of layered characters and ripe with satire and social commentary that is as apt today as when the work was first written.  Mort is the perfect embodiment of Everyman while Death's lonely life is poignant.  Add wonderful humor to the mix and Mort is indeed a creative masterpiece.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Without giving plot synopsis, I will say that the book excelled in one very important regard: I never, at any point, was disengaged.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a romping thrill ride that actually merits the clich&eacute; \\"couldn't put it down.\\" I literally had family members frustrated by my lack of willingness to do just that. The story and plot line and characters grab you and pull you willingly along.<br /><br />There's one deus ex machina (albeit not at the end) to keep the plot moving that I felt was a bit of a reach. Locke extricates himself from a seemingly impossible situation, but even as I write this I find myself smiling and cheering \\"Bastard!\\" (read it and you'll get the reference) as I think about it - and I definitely can't bring myself to dock a star because of it.<br /><br />Overall, thoroughly enjoyable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Initially it took a while to get into the story, especially when he kills off one of the characters early on. But then the story drew me in to the point where I dreamed about it at night, and looked forward each day to finishing work so I could get back into the silo world/story. I was genuinely sad when it ended, as I couldn't return to that world each night - I hope he continues the story with more books!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was amazing!!!<br />I loved it It was an awesome series!!! I absolutely love love love<br />love the Hunger Games!!
B00EO10M54|4.0|My favorite tracks on Bangerz are Adore You, We Can't Stop, Maybe You're Right, FU, Wrecking Ball, Drive, Someone Else, Hands In the Air, Do My Thang, and Drive. This is only because I know most or all the words to these songs. Overall I really enjoy this album.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love Battery HD. It's really helpful in figuring out the charge life and how long it would last if I'm playing video or if I'm online or if I'm doing whatever. Its a must have for any kindle User.
0316228583|3.0|There is no doubt that Rowling's can write and weave a tall like the best of them.  She is masterful in her darkness.  I did not love it.<br />It's funny how in the depth of poverty she was able to write with so much hope and while abounding in wealth wrote with so much despair.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I ordered this Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition DVD last year in February 2012 after all the stores sold out of the Toy Story 10th Anniversary DVD back in 2009. I was glad Amazon had this DVD. Even though, both DVDs have scratches on it. But it still play good. I had the Toy Story movie on VHS from 1999-2009. When I saw the Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition DVD on Amazon, I had to order it. The Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition DVDs had the Special Features and the Toy Story VHS didn't. This is a good product
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I must say I wondered how the movie would be after reading the books..............It does seem to rush through the storyline. However what it does cover is done well.....................
B001DHXT20|5.0|my boys loved this dvd. They watched it a couple of times in one week and enjoyed it every time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am currently about to be enrolled for Indoc after basic for CAR in the USAF. This book has inspired me in so many ways and I look forward to serving my country with every ounce of patriotism I have.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What KIng does best- insinuate the paranormal into everyday life. A heartfelt relationship between the now grown Dan Torrance of The Shining and a kindred spirit who's more than his equal--a young girl who has been communicating with Dan since she's an infant. Spookly tribal nemesis the True Knot. It's all here and a touching ending to boot.
B001EC3JME|5.0|The holster that came with my flashlight/stun gun had the stitching come apart only four days after I got it. This holster is so much better quality and its performance far exceeds what I thought it would. I recommend it highly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! And have played it on my phone for so long that when I play it on my kindle I'll never go back !!!!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|My wife and I can't help but give it a 5 star rating.  Loved this movie growing up, and when ever either of would go to the store and to buy it, of course they either sold out or didn't have it.  Saw that amazon had it for Blu-ray and yelled hooray... we've had it for maybe two weeks now and we've watched it 7 times at least together.  I swear she's watched more when I'm at work.  Even though it is very much a 90's movie dated with the fashion, it has great memories for us and we still know the words to the Bette's song.  Love, Love, Love this movie.
1423113497|5.0|im older than the average percy jackson reader (mid 20's) and still find the series a good read.<br />ive continued on to the 4th and 5th book and the hero's of Olympus series.<br /><br />i'd recommend it to anyone. way better than the movies. (they miss a LOT of the details)
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|I love it great mind game I love playing it with friends its a great challenging game to test skills and tactics knowing how to defeat ur opponent
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|well this app is by far way better then all the other hungry shark games. But you have to pay to unlock different sharks early and add a couple more sharks to. but yeah overall really great app :)
B007V4QLY2|5.0|I didn't have this CD and I absolutely love it. Uploaded to all of my devices and I can now rock out to P!nk where ever I go.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Old Films about Superman are great, so why is the story aboth Superman told again a little different, and so agresive? Such a disappointment! I really miss new ideas. \\"Superman returns\\" was a new story, with old charakteristic - gentle Supermen, les agresive story, and I think the moral of well known Superman is missing. Such a disappointment!!!!
B005VPRDAY|3.0|My daughter enjoys it but the pieces are a bit too small and the large box can be deceiving.<br />The booklet of instructions has simple steps that my year 5 old can mostly follow but it only has instructions for 1 type of structure and not the other types that are displayed.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This is by far the best movie version of Judge Dredd out there.  The art direction is spot on and Mega City One is a central character in the movie.  Karl Urban (appropriately) leaves his helmet on all the way through the film .  Lena Heady (a.k.a. Cersei Lannister in HBO's Game of Thrones) is really terrific as the film's chief baddy Ma Ma.  The cinematography is excellent and inventive.  If you like the Judge Dredd and Judge Anderson graphic novellas, this is a must watch.  This is the issue where Judge Anderson is first introduced and given a field trial to determine her fate as a judge.  I hope that the British team that put this marvelous film together on a shoestring is able to make many more films in the series.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|This is the most action-packed Iron Man movie in the trilogy. There were 3 amazing actions scenes in this movie that I re-watched a few times. The Blu-ray is full of extras including a nice prequel to the TV show SHIELD. Its hard to find fault with Iron Man III--it had all of the prerequisites for an outstanding super hero film.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm, literally comes with all the bells and whistles, it good enough to pat .99&cent; for. I give it five of five, and suggest it for you.
B008MM9630|3.0|I don't often play games like this, so I have no comparisons to use for this review. However, I do believe things are a bit haphazard in when they happen compared to when I am supposed to complete tasks involving them. For instance, I have one task that asks for things I can't grow until level 34, yet I received the task way back when I was in the single-digit levels. It has taken me a bit to figure out where things are, and I'd like to be able to see more info on objects. The short descriptions that fit in the space are just not enough. I believe that I have complained enough about a free app now... :-)
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|A neat, cool looking game & free app. Only thing I do not like is you only get one life. It is kinda fun still. Whoever made this did a nice job. Best thing is &#34;FREE&#34; phone app. !  O_o
B008QLXSG8|5.0|I THINK THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD SO IF ANYONE WANT PLZ JUST BUY THE BOOK THIS WILL BE VERY NICE
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Loved this book. Stephen King is as good as ever, loved the characters and the way they interacted it was also good to see what happened to Dan
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I just downloaded it and have not really spent time on my tablet trying it out.  I still have trouble understanding Facebook on my PC so I have to learn that first. 8-(
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|my kids love it, made by Rovio just like angry birds and badd piggies. keeps them entertained in the car for trips.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I have the Google Chrome already and am using that.  This was not really what I expected.  Maybe others will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it's here on the kindle, I have been waiting for this day and it runs so smooth and great the picture is great
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|well the idea of this item is cool.  I have Hulu and Netflix streaming now.  I was really hoping to use this on my IPAD which is not currently suported.  It does work and it is nice to use on my laptop.  But realistically it is not that great of a device.  I know they say Ipad use coming soon.  But the item is ok and we do use some..<br /><br />We might use more if we did not already have a roku device.  But overall it is cool. But still some kinks to work out!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun to play and fun to watch. Y can get it on any app. Y play it with friends or without friends.
0399226907|5.0|All three of my kids adore this book.  We lost our first copy so I purchased another for baby boy.  It is a sturdy board book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the best game ever and I highly advise you to double tap FREE. It's the best game but it's really hard and logical.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app and worked perfectly the very first time.<br />I would recommend this app to anyone who wants an alarm clock on the go.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I barely made it through a 1/4 of the book....too much bad, vulgar language. Really disappointed. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have. What's more disappointing is my children's school librarian suggested it to me. I even asked her if it would be considered an &#34;R&#34; rated book due to the language & she said NO. If you are ok with the F word every other word...then have at it. The vulgar language was really unnecessary. Sad to see that this is ok language in our society. Besides the language the characters weren't very compelling....trashy actually.
B004RJZ9YC|1.0|We didn't realize that we wouldn't be able to play the dvd and that was why we had to return it.  They refunded our cost inc s&h.
B00DW5IM9Q|2.0|Bob Dylan's Bootleg Series has been a legendary franchise in music history. Dylan's vaults are obviously filled with fascinating outtakes (for example, Blind Willie McTell) and sizzling live performances (Volume 4's Live:1966, for example). I have immensely enjoyed each of the first nine volumes. But no more.<br /><br />I initially hoped that this release would shed light on the 1970 albums Self Portrait and New Morning. And yes, I was excited to finally get an official release of the long-bootleged Isle of Wight concert. Dylan's live work with The Band has always ranked among my favorites. So when this set arrived, I decided to delay the gratification of listening to the IOW show and instead set about giving the Self Portrait outtakes a listen. And then another. And finally, because I just was in denial about these, a third listen. And, after three listens, my understanding of Self Portrait and New Morning was unchanged.<br /><br />Self Portrait is the worst Dylan album ever. Worse than &#34;Good As I Been To You.&#34; Worse than 1973's studio revenge album &#34;Dylan.&#34; After listening to Volume 10, I can say that the last thing the world needed was to hear the outtakes from the Self Portrait sessions. Yet here they are. Dylan's Nashville Skyline voice is still at work, and while a few tracks are listenable, some of the other tracks - specifically Little Sadie, Railroad Bill, and Tattle O'Day - are tedious and trite. I think that's what is most disappointing about this release: the amazingly unique talent that is Bob Dylan is reduced to coming across as a very mundane performer. The New Morning-era tracks are no better, a very mixed bag of a few listenable songs and some tremendous tedium. And the tapes of one track - Sign on the Window (With Orchestral Overdubs) - should have been burnt.<br /><br />Imagining what material might have been released instead of this stuff is a frustrating exercise. So let's move on to the Isle of Wight show presented here.<br /><br />IOW has been bootlegged many times, but never the complete show and (as usual with bootlegs) in varying forms of audio quality. So it is very nice to get the complete show in a very clean audio mix. As always, Dylan and The Band are electrifying. Robbie Robertson's guitar licks are crisp and popping, Garth's Hudson keyboard resonates, and The Band's always-enjoyable backup vocals are perfectly mixed. The live rendition of &#34;I Dreamed I Saw Saint Augustine&#34; is worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />It was hard to grade this overall, because I like the IOW concert so much but I doubt I will ever listen to the studio tracks here again. I decided on two stars because the material taken as a whole just doesn't represent the potential that you know Dylan's unreleased material still has.<br /><br />I really hope The Bootleg Series gets back on track after this derailment.r />IOW has been bootlegged many times, but never the complete show and (as usual with bootlegs) in varying forms of audio quality.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Awesome game. It is a really fun and good game for kids. Would definitely, totally recommend for kids of all ages.P
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Cute movie.  All have watched it at theaters but they wanted it here.  Even my little ones like the songs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for this game Amizon! I was beginning to feel that my Kindle was to boring. But now I have my Candy Crush! Thank you!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love &#34;deleted scenes&#34;, bloopers. And all the 5th season episodes ! Great design, great quality. I recommend it to all the Castle's fans and addicted.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|This Band sounds fantastic! Its nice to be still be able to find some good music out there. With Vocals a bit like Jackson Brown and writting similar to Dylan (But in its own way). These 4 muscians really work well together. I recently went to see them Live at Terminal 5 in New York, Had V.I.P. Seats right over the Stage.<br />Taylors guitar playing really impressed me.He sounds good on all the cuts on this Disk, bit I would highly reccommend to see these guys perform Live.(He was improvisiong himself which really, really impressed me).  His brother on Drums has awesome Harmonies and can really play those Drums (and I loved his expressions while playing them)<br /><br />I am having a hard \\"time Not Playing this C.D.\\"<br /><br />Go buy this Disk and their previous disk, and see these guys while they are still  Kinda an \\"unknown act\\" because these guys will be BIG! SOON!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Anything by Jane Austen offers a commentary on her culture. This book critiques the gothic novel on the whole, but is also entertaining. It was her first novel, so it is interesting to see how she progressed as an author.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Excellent Production, Great Artist on all tracks, Great Guitar work by all on Disk & John Fogerty, Would recommend to anyone that likes John Fogerty & C.C.R.
B008Y212PI|3.0|I loved the free versions of these puzzles and decided to dive in and buy my first app.  Very disappointed.  There are no 20x20 puzzles which are my favorite, and the images are a bit predictable. Fun but not challenging at all. These puzzles by gabysoft are still the most user friendly out there that I have found.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy to be able to play candy crush on my kindle. Been waiting for it thank you
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Did not like this game. When I read the reviews I thought it sounded like a fun and interesting way to kill some time. Very disappointed it was much more difficult and really gave no clues as to how to get from level to level..
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|5+++++ stars! This book was AMAZING!!! I loved every minute of it. I was one of those people who skimmed over the psy politics in the beginning of the series, only focusing on the \\"romance\\". And i STILL LOVED THIS BOOK! I loved the political games, the strategies, and all the dark aspects of this book. And i LOVED Kaleb! I loved the flash backs and their growing love. I swear he's one of my favorites now lol I don't want to give anything away because i feel that everyone should experience every piece of this book and not be forewarned. This book was Amazing and a MUST read for everyone. This is one of my favorite series and I have not once been disappointed by any of Nalini Singh's books. Can't wait for the next book! Sad this series is coming to an end (i think only 2 or 3 books left). I loved it and can't wait until next year! ^_^
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I went to Hawaii last year and this CD brings back all the senses and emotions of being in that magical place. Absolutely beautiful and gentle voice.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Loved it.. was full of action with a story line. The story line was different from other alien films that we have seen.. My family and I loved it.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This CD provokes so many emotions in me: dimly lit jazz lounge or a stroll down a Paris street on a spring afternoon. Perfect for any listening occasion.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Suspense galore. But in the end it seemed as if the author just got tired of writing about the characters.  All in all-vacuous.
B00FHNBDC4|5.0|I have always been a fan of his, but this album is an &#34;on repeat&#34; album! A true pleasure to the ears.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|But maybe that's why I don't love this game.<br /><br />Is it good? Yeah, it's decent. But as a good player, there are several things that bug me:<br /><br />- on the hardest setting, playing the longest matches (15 pts), I have lost once in 50ish times.<br />- Doubling issues. the game often accepts doubles when there is NO reason to. And at the end of games, even if it is clearly in the lead, it never doubles.<br />- Dumb moves. On the hardest level, there are often moves that make NO sense. I don't think it has ever moved 2 guys onto my 5 pt with an opening (response) roll 4-4. It moves 2 to his 9 and 2 to his 2 point (!), even if I haven't split my back guys!<br /><br />If that doesn't make sense, then go for it...it's probably a good game.<br /><br />I got it for free and I'll keep playing it, even though the ai is too weak. Is there a really good backgammon game out there?
B0073PPKNM|4.0|Most of her music I love instantly. I didn't love this one right away. However, it grew on me after a couple of listens and it's delightful.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I've read this book twice and on both occasions I have learned and found  new meanings in the read.  It is very well crafted and keeps you wanting more and finding out where it is going to end.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pretty good game sort of simple for the first part maybe harder as I go.  Will see but could get boring.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this alarm clock...it's simple and easy to use.  No trying to figure things out, just open and set. I'll keep this one, don't need another.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It is easy to adjust the alarm to whatever you want. It is Eco friendly as it is from the cloud
B003O86FMW|5.0|Now I have to read the third book.<br />The faster I write this review, the sooner I can start reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|.  Very addictive.  Absolutely love it!!! So glad I can get it on my Kindle.  Playing a lot more than I should but can't help it.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|DEAR PAUL, PLEASE GET A NEW GRAPHIC DESIGNER - SOMEBODY WROTE ALL YOUR LINER NOTES IN CAPITALS AND IT IS DAMNED HARD TO READ, EVEN BLOWN UP WAY BIG! YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER, OR AT LEAST CHECK THEM YOURSELF - ALL CAPS IS RUDE, AND HARD TO READ, AND LOOKS STUPID. DID I SAY IT IS HARD TO READ? I HAVE TO GIVE UP AFTER ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE LINES BECAUSE I LOSE MY PLACE AND IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE ANYWAY.<br /><br />I like the pictures in the booklet, though, especially the upright Steinway with the mics in from of it in stereo.<br /><br />Thanks, now to go listen.<br /><br /><L>
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was really skeptical when I picked up this book<br />, I was prepared for the clich&eacute;s but they were shattered once I started  reading. Highly recommended it. Love liberates!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please hurry and make more levels!  I am hooked and can't wait to play more!  Thank you for making such a fun game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting and hours of fun. Good for all ages.  Every level of this game will challenge your mind.  Once you play you won't be able to put it down. And it's a free app.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My grandson has so many of these he loves his little stuffed animals with the pacifiers. I think he has just about everyone that has been made.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I strongly suggest this book for someone who wishes to better gauge the credibility of others.  Mr. Navarro is an excellent writer.
B00BMYHU7Y|5.0|I got this for a gift for my husband.  He loves the tv show.  He said the books where even better, of course.  A easy and amazing read. Got the package really quick.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Every book by Neil Gaiman is a work of art and this one is no exception. The story never went where I expected it to and I am grateful. Beautiful book well worth the read.
0061537969|5.0|A very special person lent me this book and I really enjoyed it both for the way the dog thinks and comes to life and for the great message it portrays.  I bought it to share with the right person but now I am thinking of keeping this one and ordering another if and when I meet that person.  This is a great book with a great message for anyone but even more so for a dog lover.  Enzo is a very, very special dog.  This book is really a treasure.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|We purchased this for a Retina MacBook Pro that was not playing well with our Cisco wireless network at the office. (That's a different story.)<br /><br />I'm happy to say this worked beautifully. I plugged it into the laptop, plugged in the Ethernet cable, selected the new adapter in Network settings and everything has been going well since!<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any MacBook Air or Retina Macbook that is having wireless issues with certain networks. We spent a long time trying to figure out the issue, but $30 was a great deal for a more stable network connection.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|My Kindle tells me i got 51% of the way through this book, but it felt like I was standing still.  I still hope to finish it one day, but it is quite an undertaking.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|It is so difficult to find shows on the &#34;main channels&#34; that the whole family can watch together.  This is one of those shows.  A spin off of the Avengers franchise, this shows gives you an idea of what happens on the side where the more &#34;normal&#34; people are (as opposed to the Super Heroes).
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|The microphone is fine but the wire is so short that it renders it unusable for a camera.  Should be advertised as &#34;best for computer use&#34; or something like that.  For me, it was a waste of money.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Lost my Kindle charging cord while traveling- this is the perfect replacement.  Works exactly as I expected & wanted it to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|WONDERFUL so glad to have it on Amazon and so much better, it's free!! Enjoy everyone!<br />We all love candy crunch s as ha
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I read it every day.  I listen to it most days while I am driving.  I read the daily message and it is a great blessing.  I use it for Bible study and preparing sermons.  I have recommended it to many people and they love it too.  A great blessing.
B0065QUD8W|4.0|I have read the first two books in the collection, and will be getting to some short stories next.  I found the books surprisingly readable for old novels (not with bulky old-fashioned language).  I am really enjoying them.  Picturing Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes does not hurt, either.  There are a few Kindle-related errors, with letters wrong, but it is not too bad compared to some I've seen, and not too distracting.  And the price was wonderful..
B00005JNS0|4.0|Got this for my grandson he loves it. He wants to watch it every day. It's cool and has a great story behind it. Just like other Disney works it's great.
0553296981|5.0|This nearly 700- page book (on my iPad) was finished within 5 days! I loved how interesting and descriptive it was. And to think that this was a real girls life! It was such a great book, but with it being a diary, it ended very suddenly. I would have liked to know more about later on, but thats impossible because it is a diary. Great Book!
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Like most of America I succumbed to the knee-jerk reaction brought on by the WSJ article when this book first came out. I kept meaning to read it for myself and make my own decision, but it was much easier to make the same sweeping generalizations and play to the FB comment applause. Then, when the term &#34;Tiger Mom&#34; came up in conversation again recently, and a friend said, &#34;did you read the book? It's not so bad&#34; I had to give it the chance it deserved. So grateful I did!<br />Yes, it details the ways we can build excellence in our children, score by score,musical movement by movement, but it's also funny, smart, self-deprecating, witty satire on the lengths parents are willing to go to insure their children's success. And ultimately it calls for not giving up on parenting when it gets to be too hard, about integrating choice and free will with a genuine love for the WORK of achieving excellence.

B0030V0PEW|5.0|Most people are so concerned with giving an impression of competency or independence or being the star, that they can miss simple things or fail to be part of the team.<br /><br />The Checklist Manifesto is a great introduction into how we can each be part of simple routines that ensure all conditions for success are a go, and what preparations or procedures to implement I case something does go well...limiting damage and liability.
0143142364|5.0|<i>World without End</i> is the sequel to <i>Pillars of the Earth</i>. It is set in the same fictitious England locations approximately 200 years after the events of Pillars of the Earth, and features many descendants of the original characters, along with many new ones.<br /><br /><i>World Without End</i> is very similar in the basic structure of Pillars: an enigmatic event happens at the beginning of the story, which has long-term repercussions, and is brought to light again at the end to put everything in a retroactive perspective.<br /><br />As with the first book, <i>World Without End</i> is told over a period of about 40 years, and concentrates much of its storytelling around a few major characters. As with <i>Pillars</i>, there are wonderfully relateable characters, as well as loathsome ones, and those who are victims of their own manipulations and ambition.<br /><br /><i>World Without End</i> has a bit broader geographical scope than its predecessor, telling parts of its story in the main fictional town of Kingsbridge, but also moving focus to the small village of Wigleigh, the battlefields of France, and the opulent Florence. Once again, the travails of merchants, monks and nobility combine like the wisps of smoke from nearby fires. At times the familial connections, political alliances and adulterous indiscretions are overwhelming; there are a LOT of characters in this book. There is a wonderful spoiler-FULL &#34;family tree&#34; of sorts on the author's website, but it really will ruin some of the surprises that come up.<br /><br />There's a great additional character that keeps rearing its head in this book: The Great Plague. It has a significant effect on many of the characters, and provides an incredible adversary against which the staunchest defenses are found weak and useless. And yet the plague brings out the best in some people, which itself leads to very nice character developments.<br /><br />As with Pillars, there is a bit of a negative slant tothe 14th-century church and its views on moral superiority, the roles of women and the infallibility of its clergy. These aspects are respectfully treated, for the most part, but almost all clergy are depicted as corrupt and power hungry.<br /><br />This book is simply amazing. It's a wonderful story that stands on its own, but also builds upon the magic of the first book. It's encouraging to know another sequel is on its way in about 2016 or so. I look forward to it with great relish.<br /><br />Audiobook note: Once again, John Lee's voice acting is beyond reproach.
B006LSZECO|4.0|very creative and a quick read- enjoyed the story line and the fun twists and turns right up to the end of the book

B0071XO8RA|4.0|A good story line & good character portrayals. When the story moves along its a fun read, however there are points where it lags and gets a bit tedious. Jules also seems to be bullet proof (not necessarily a bad trait in a heroine) although that makes much of what happens to her - predictable.

B005LAIIGM|5.0|`Gravity' is the sort of movie I would usually be railing about because of the over usage of computer generated special effects, but `Gravity' is the exception. Those special effects are there for one reason and one reason only, to serve and highlight the acting.<br /><br />I could give you a point by point synopsis of the film, but that might make the movie seem pedestrian to someone who hasn't seen it. So here's the general plot: during a space walk on a shuttle, three astronauts are working on fixing the Hubble telescope when its reported a nearby satellite has exploded, first reports indicate there's no danger, but soon enough the shuttle and crew is being bombarded by exploding satellite parts at 25,000 miles per hour, only astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) survive and they're separated from the shuttle survival is the rest of the movie. It's Bullock's film as she moves from a scared mission specialist to someone that runs the gamut of emotions as she struggles to survive in an environment not suited to survival.<br /><br />Director Alfonso Cuaron could have easily been overwhelmed by the computer generated effects or let them be the star. While he does give you sweeping panoramic shots of the astronauts floating in space with the earth serenely revolving beneath them, that is only to give the viewer a sense of what it's like to be in space. Quick flashes of Clooney's and Bullock's characters show how quickly the peacefulness can be swept away by the realities of space.<br /><br />A note, while it's true that in space no one can hear you scream it also seems true that if you're a woman in space under your suit you need to be in form fitting panties and a skimpy t-shirt, true for Sigourney Weaver in `Alien' and true for Bullock in `Gravity.'
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Reluctantly, I wanted to read the second book of the Fifty Shades series hoping that the story line and writing would get better, hence warranting all the hysteria. Unfortunately it did not and was very repetitive to the first book. The story pretty much dragged right on from the first book and the author used the same words and setting to describe almost every scene. Don't bother reading!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, but the CGI and the Action is pretty good. so glad it wasn't a flopper :)
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|Downloaded the trial version and thought not bad.  At the time my incentive was to find a decent player with equalizier (more than a five band).BTW, I'm kind of an audiophile. I purchased the product and adding more features made it sounded terrible.  Not all is to blame on the player but in the case of Rocket Music Player, Don't buy it.  Waste of money ... even if is sold for $5.00. Hope this helps.
B000002GYI|1.0|NOT PLAY ON MY 3DO PLAYER? EVERY CD I OWN WORKS ON IT EXCEPT THIS ONE. ANY GOOD IDEAS ?
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This is a good story, but it seems to be more properly aimed towards the teenage crowd, and it is definitely not a novel, but a novella.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Enjoyed. Highly recommend . Would read again. Best book I've read in years. Blolololololololoooooppppp ppppppppppp. Need more words. Sorry. Ttyl
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing so much hype about this book, I had to give it a go and read it. I can see why people were buzzing about it since it has the crazy love story of a shy helpless girl who captured the heart of a young hot wealthy guy. Throw in all the S&M in there and it becomes interesting... I guess. This book is basically a teen novel with really bad corny writing. Story line AND writing were whatever.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this humorous and so sad tale of such a lovable decent man,whom was so abused and needed love so desperately.this author tells the story with such feeling and understanding.apalling  treatment.he endured and still had a sense of love for his fellow man.I cried and smiled and twas really a story not forgotten.loved the dialogue.the despair.the humor.and the author made it so real with her choice of expression..great read.

B00AEFXXMI|5.0|I love Ferris!  I have loved this movie for years and I had a VHS for years but as we have moved to DVDs and since the picture quality on the VHS is not a good as the DVD, this was a smart buy!  Great price!

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was very clever and original! We all enjoyed it and I even let my 10 and 13 year old watch it.<br />It's about 4 magicians robbing a bank and there's a hidden plot underneath. full of spectacular tricks and wonder. Did not expect the ending. Suspend your belief and GO SEE IT :-D
B00000IQMT|4.0|When \\"Star Wars Episode I:  The Phantom Menace\\" was released so many years ago (well over a decade now), the majority of filmgoers and Star Wars fans berated the film for being too drawn out and dull for all of its political jabber, the weak acting/writing/direction/effects/whatever you hated about the film, and the swift entry and exit of Darth Maul.  I was one of those people, but with both age and time I have grown to really enjoy this chapter in the Star Wars saga.<br /><br />The one thing that I heard no one complain about was the music.  Of course, composer John Williams probably trashes soundtrack ideas that are ten times better than most other soundtrack music thats produced these days, so it is no surprise that TPM's soundtrack was excellent.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this disc hoping to add the music to my Star Wars collection.  The music contained on the disc is brilliant, but it is not the complete soundtrack.  Heck, it doesn't even include the 20th Century Fox fanfare that begins every Star Wars film (until now, since I'm sure Disney has a little something to say about that).  Now I do understand that there is an Ultimate Edition available that includes the entire soundtrack, but if you can look beyond the tracks that are missing here, you'll find that this album is sufficient for filling the Star Wars music hole in your life.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"Duel of the Fates\\" and \\"Augie's Municipal Band and End Credits.\\"  Yep, I'm one of those people who actually enjoyed the Gungan marching band music that ended the film!<br /><br />Overall, a decent purchase, but if you are a completionist, go for the Ultimate Edition.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was wondering when this game was to become accessible for the kindle fire hd and now I have it I don't know if I can or can not sync the level I was on with my cell but that's ok I like the game and I will suffer through the levels again for I am not weary of the matching and correcting the chaos this game offers. For me I would gladly waste unmanageable time to enjoy this game. The end....
B004E5GG50|1.0|This product was a lot of money and I used a combination of points and cash to purchase the item. I received Season 3 only and have consistently contacted the seller who would not say when they shipped my order.  After answering their questions their only response is and you just contacted me on this day?<br />I would never recommend the Digital Vault to anyone.  I'm calling my attorney!!!!!!
B00005JKGK|5.0|Beautiful cinematography and gripping drama brings Amy Tan's classic to beautiful life!  I wish we could see these amazing actresses more often but ALAS, Hollywood does so many formulaic &#34;blockbuster&#34; flicks casting predominantly white actors and that fact makes this an even tastier treat!  Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think but is not too difficult.  Fun, fun, fun!  Really enjoy for a relaxing evening at home.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!IT IS AWESOME!!!I f your gonna buy I recommend you buy it. But it's 7$ but it's worth it!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Full of action. These are fast moving zombies. Brad is good, also. For people who like zombie movies this is a winner.
B003GK21OE|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, it has a fast moving story and keeps you guessing the whole way through.  As always the humor and<br /> one liners between King and Maxwell  keep you amused.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book, adventure and excitement all in one! I gave it a five because I loved the action in this book, it isn't boring it is amazing! Read all about Percy, Annabeth, Grover, Luke, Kronos and the Gods.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|If you have ever seen the movie you get what I mean when I say you will hurt your side laughing!  We watch this every Christmas! Its physical comedy, sight-gags, and the crazy Griswold extended family make this a priceless annual treat!  If you have never seen it--you are in for a real treat!

B00CCEHR80|4.0|I'm a fairly staunch Grateful Dead 70s snob, and this recording kinda knocked my socks off. It sounds like it was mixed live to 2-track (on the fly) and it does get a little ambient sounding at times, but there is also lotsa power throughout. The playing really catches fire on the second disc. The short Bela Fleck segment is a completely new flavor to me and if a little tweedly in his solos still nigh on fantastic. Even better, the band goes over the top during &#34;Think&#34; and the momentum from there carries the next two songs. It may be more difficult to find gems like this in the later GD and JGB material, but they are out there and this is one fine example.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|If you like a fast paced thriller this is a great book.  The characters are interesting and it keeps you guessing the whole way through.<br />I couldn't put this down an action packed read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|l love this game it is a challenge and very exciting. it is a good way to help older adults with eye and hand cordination and good brain function.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have only used it twice but it worked just as I needed it to.  I love that it charges all my USB accessories!  Slips into pocket or purse quite neatly!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I didn't get this product because of all it can do right now, but what I hope it will do in the future. Netflix, Youtube, Play Music, Play movies and Hulu plus is about all it does. I expect support for Plex in the future and alot of other things. If you don't have a Roku or apple tv, this is perfect for you. Until they support more apps, you might wait on buying one if you can get your netflix somewhere else.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I must say, I have seen all these movies before, but I enjoyed them again, and will keep them around for awhile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely, positively the most fun I have ever had playing a game. And it's great for all ages. High recommended!
B008OP32M6|5.0|coolest set ever! i absolutely love this. it is so fun to play with, anywhere, anytime. i think that everyone should have this.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Get everything you need weather-wise with lovely sky shots. The go to app go first<br />thing in the am. Love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. I read it multiple times. Katniss is a character that i love, that frustrates me, that needs balance, that everyone needs... all at the same time. Truly awful times requires truly extraordinary people.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I do like it. It works well. But...I did have to file down the sides of the LED (the metal part, not the actual LED) as it was a fraction of an inch too big. Which meant that while focusing the the light, the entire LED assembly would twist right out and would require taking the whole thing (the flashlight to reattach the LED) apart and then put it back together. I did that 3 times. Then I busted out my trusty Greber Tool (which is over 10 years old and still works like new) and lightly flied the edges. Now it works prefect. I don't know if Nite-Ize got their math wrong or MagLite changed the inner diamiter and didn't tell anyone. Either way, if you get it, you will like it....after you mod it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a so much fun. I've had a blast playing. Still trying to figure out a few things with the game though
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining so many years ago and like many fantastic books, it has lived with me as I often wondered what happened to Danny and Dick.  And as true in life, what I imagined as their story is not their story, but an even better one.  As a sequel Shining fans will not be disappointed. But what makes a good sequel all the better is when it has legs of its own and can stand as an excellent read if the reader hasn't read the prequel(s). Doctor Sleep is all that and a bag of potato chips.  A must read for every King and/or Shining fan.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read the book in two days. In seminary I served as a student chaplain for the three months..much of what the author said resonated with what I experienced in a medium women's prison. Her realism in being truthful was refreshing.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This story is filled with suspense. The reader is able to get involved with the characters lives as you read. I was not expecting the surprise ending. Great story.
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|Only poses as a Google earth app. Looks ok at first, but when you search don't even try for specifics, because it is incapable of doing the operation you are looking for this app to do. Another low budget horrible apps in my opinion. Please do not waste your time on this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for making it available on the kindle. My obsession with this game, just got serious. Lol but seriously a truly great game.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I was hooked by the second page.  From the first to the last word you feel as though you are part of the book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I really like watching this on my tv & sharing it with family.  I turn up the volume & enjoy, although a sad movie, it was a great one esp in Blu-ray.  Must see & keep for your library.
B0018RWD6S|5.0|loved the album 100%.  it does not  get any better than this for great music.  if stress is your problem, throw away your<br />pills and sit back and listen to this album. guarantee it will relax you.<br />coltrane and hartman together make a perfect pair, very smooth.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a bit of a mixed bag. At its best it deftly illustrates how the implied can be more effective that the explicit, but at its worst it suffers from poor pacing and a thin plot line. Nothing much happens in the first 70 minutes apart from a fair amount of bickering between the (often annoying) two main leads. Then, in the final reel, it suddenly becomes truly creepy, and the ending, although somewhat obvious, will bring you out in goosebumps. It’s far more effective than The Blair Witch Project (which I found very dull) but would have benefited from a more fully developed script. Oh, and why don’t they immediately turn the lights on when things get scary? I know I would.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|It's easy to see why the networks wouldn't touch this brilliant political drama.  Full of all the conspiracies, sleaze and naked ambition that drives the power and politics of the nation - of every nation, in fact.  Great writing, terrific acting, especially from Kevin Spacey, and bone-raw plots and language.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|i love playing this on my friends ipad however it wont let me download it i have deleted many apps just so i can get it but it wont let me.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is really awesomeness. Even though some costs money, I can still have fun. I have a lot of ponies, and saving your gems really helps. I am actually 13 years old, and a huge pegasister. If your a pony fan, I strongly recommend this game.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of those rare books that truly rocks the way that you think.<br /><br />The book is less Science Fiction, and more of a question on morality, psychology, compassion, courage and strength.<br /><br />Ender is a child who may be the world's only hope to survive but he must sacrifice his own happiness to protect those he loves.  An emotional rollercoaster, Ender's Game takes readers along through the loneliness, despair and courage that it often takes to do what is right.

0812550757|5.0|Enders Game challenges readers to persevere against all odds.  Speaker for the Dead challenges you to look at things through another person's eyes.<br /><br />A terrific stand alone book, Speaker for the Dead follows Ender as he attempts to understand a seemingly friendly yet savage race.  It is only through understanding these beings that he'll be able to truly appreciate them.<br /><br />It draws strong parallel to differing cultures in real life.  Speaker for the Dead reminds readers that we may all seem like savages to those who dont share our knowledge.

B00EV4EUT8|2.0|This film presents itself as a story about a wonderfully knowledgeable and humble person who served several Presidents.<br />Instead it veers off into passive aggressive racism.  I wish I had not spent the money and reinforced this kind of film-making.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|In what world is a picture that is &lt;1MP considered HD? They are grainy, you can't set an auto timer to step away from arms length, the video doesn't work and the app crashes for no reason, constantly. Don't look at it the wrong way, it will crash. Good luck capturing any video. Better advice, don't bother with this time wasting and frustrating app.<br />-Kindle Fire HD
B00340ESIS|4.0|It's a useful book for those who want to get closer to genre, commercial films. The book pretends to be a formula, and a pretty good one. But the book does not teach talent... Or imagination. It is what it is.<br /><br />Snyder has an interesting and humorous attitude. Many things can be learned.
1608862801|4.0|I received this as a gift in the reddit Adventure Time exchange. It's one of my favorite gifts I've gotten in any reddit exchange! I'm a huge fan of the cartoon and this definitely lives up to it. The story is a lot of fun and the drawing is superb.

Not only was the dog adorable, but it had good actors in Richard Gere and Joan Allen.<br /><br />The movie started out very very good. The first hour was enjoyable, entertaining and at points, funny.<br /><br />To me, that's when the movie stopped. Richard Gere died suddenly. The film then takes on a new perspective and that is of a grieving dog. It shows the dog, Hachi, going down to the train station day after day waiting for Richard Gere to return home. Heartbreaking indeed.<br /><br />However, it goes on like this for TOO long. The last 30 minutes of this 90 minute film basically shows the dog sitting outside the train station.<br /><br />The other part of the film that I did not like and where the film lost it' for me was toward the end. Richard Gere's daughter decides to take the dog. Then, soon after taking the dog in, she decides to let the dog loose, allowing it to spend the last 9 years of his life roaming the streets of a fairly heavily populated suburb.<br /><br />One other scene which also blew it for me was when the dog, an Akita, which is a Japanese breed, is being talked to by a Japanese man. The man speaks to Hachi in Japanese and the translation on the bottom indicates that the dog, a Japanese breed, understands Japanese.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy this movie and parts of it were very good. But overall, a let down.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: Watch Marley and Me, My Dog Skip or Homeward Bound instead

B008RA3X5E|2.0|I purchased for the wake up to music feature only to be disappointed that you can only select one song to play when the alarm goes off. You are able to set the sleep timer to a playlist, why not the morning alarm as well? Only four clock options to choose from, two of which are digital face in either white or blue (other color options would be nice), one an ugly 'retro' face and the last a ridiculous face telling the time in words sounding like a stuffy British aristocrat from the early 20th century. The weather option is not very accurate so I turned that off after one day. This could be why an obnoxious pop-up appears suggesting the download of a separate weather app every time you open this app, not impressed a paid app has this feature. For a clock app that isn't free, none of these should be issues. Glad it wasn't more than $0.99 or I'd be more grumpy with my first morning interaction than I already am.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This app does the trick! It works great as a central place to keep notes and information. The private notes feature is nice.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|I loved the first two Iron Man films and of course the Avengers.  I was really looking forward to this film with Tony and a whole gang of new Iron Man armor.  Instead Tony is a basket case of fear and self-doubt.  He is out of the suit for most of the film and at the end he destroys all of the cool suits that he has made in the course of the last few years (hello and goodbye, we never knew you).  It was kind of a bummer for me and I hope this isn't where the series ends.  Bring back the Tony/Iron Man that I know and love.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this on my laptop and phone, but have been waiting for it to come on Kindle Fire.  Couldn't believe it. Love this game.  Can be very frustrating, but can't put it down.  Thanks Amazon! You finally came through.
0375869026|5.0|This was a spectacularly well-written book.  The character development, the human emotion, the points of view were superbly expressed.  All of our children were captivated by the story on a recent road trip (everyone wanted to take the long way because they wanted to keep going with the book).  You have no idea what private drama an individual may be experiencing and it is always best to choose to be kind.  RJ Palacio, thanks for a great read with a timely, valid message.
159463176X|3.0|Like so many of you, I loved Hosseini's first two books and anxiously awaited this third one. He is truly a gifted writer who has given us insight into Afghan culture. That being said, I found And the Mountains Echoed to be a disappointment. I felt like I was reading a collection of short stories. I would just get into one story when I was jolted into the next, with another cast of characters I had to sort out and remember. There was a slim commmon thread that connected them, but it was sometimes too thin. I found myself skimming through a few of the chapters because I just didn't care about the characters. But the writing is beautiful and for that I give it 3 stars.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Good price for one of my favorite shows from the 90s. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed watching the show when it first aired.

0525958002|4.0|I just recently found out that John had written his autobiography and, since I've always been a big Duran Duran fan (and especially a John Taylor fan), I decided to read it.  I really enjoyed the behind the scenes stories of life on the road with Duran Duran, but I found myself wishing he had written more about how he was feeling during that time...it seemed a little generalized.  A lot of emotion (both good and bad) does come through, though, in the actions that take place.  I was thrilled to read about his recovery from drugs and alcohol, and found that part of the story to be quite inspiring.  All in all, I thought it was a very good read, well-written, and at times, quite funny.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|If so, we surely will!  It would have been nice to have the COMPLETE soundtrack, but we watch the movie often enough to hear what the CD is missing.
0307743659|4.0|I'm a rabid King fan and love/like just about most of his work, even stuff many fans dislike with a passion. When I first read The Shining I felt disappointed. As a film buff I did have the Kubrick film in my head to an extent but I'm smart enough to separate a movie from it's novel counterpart. I knew the film deviated from the novel and I knew to not expect the film but for some reason I couldn't help but feel the scares in the book were too hokey for the most part and not as cerebral as the Kubrick film. I struggled to finish the book and tossed it aside as the one beloved King book I simply felt was overrated.<br /><br />Due to the recent release of Doctor Sleep I felt compelled to read The Shining again and found it much more enjoyable the second time. The book moves at an effortless pace and there is a sense King had a certain confidence while writing it. The characters is what really makes this book tick. Jack Torrance is one of Kings most fascinating characters because he's kind of a bastard some of the time, even when he's not yet taken over by the Overlook. On a purely character level, this is as strong as Kings other famous works.<br /><br />I still do have some reservations with the scares. There is a joke in an older Family Guy episode (The show used to be good, it's crap now) where it shows King talking to his agent or somebody about a new book and King says it's about a \\"lamp monster\\" and proceeds to thrust the lamp on the agents desk at his as if to showcase how scary it is. The agent then says something to the effect of: \\"You're not even trying anymore are you?\\"<br /><br />This was a crack at his later career where a lot of his fans and critics became disenchanted with him. I feel this joke is more aptly suited for The Shining, only his third novel, than anything else in his later career. The young boy Danny with the titular gift of The Shining is frightened like mad at at a fire hose at the hotel. I get what King was going for here, how children can find something sinister in an everyday object, but it just doesn't work here. He goes on about this hose, even has Jack have a small encounter with it later, for a good long while and it comes off as laughable and makes me shake my head. It's just a hose. A hose.<br /><br />The topiary animals is another slightly disappointing aspect. The fist passage with them is effective and creepy but he goes on to over use them to the point where they are the main \\"spooks\\" of the Overlook. Three of the four main characters have encounters with them and they just aren't compelling scary beasties imo. The scene with Danny in the concrete tube right before the hedge animals is much scarier. King needed more things like that and the woman in room 217 in this novel and not hoses and bushes. Thankfully Jacks descent into madness and the Overlooks activity toward the climax make up for these two, imo, frankly lame aspects.<br /><br />These issues (which are small because I did enjoy the book very much overall) are what makes me shake my head at so many fans calling this Kings most scary book. Not that you are all wrong, I just don't see it for myself is all. I wouldn't even put this is his top 10 scariest. It, The Stand, Pet Sematary, Salems Lot, Needful Things, various stories in Night Shift, Skeleton Crew and Nightmares and Dreamscapes, Misery, Gerald's Game and Desperation all scarier if you ask me.<br /><br />Even with these complaints I still think The Shining is a strong effort from King with great structure, wonderfully realized characters and when they work, good scares.<br /><br />4/5

B0042FZOFU|5.0|This is exactly how the seller described the product. I got it on time. The only thing that was wrong with it was that the box corner was slightly dented but i am sure that happened during transportation and is barley/ noticeable on my bookshelf.
1442362537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book . I've  been a King fan for well over 30 years; this book delivers like so many of the past. Terrible and touching , bizarre and other worldly and then very close to home, as always the story draws you in. I listened on audio book version and long trips flew by!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such a great game. Thank you Amazon for bringing it to Kindle.  Can't get enough of it!  I had been waiting for it to play. I can play this game for hours.

B009LDCZ7I|4.0|This show has great acting and I won't spoil it, but it goes in a slightly different direction in season two. I would say it is a lot like the show, 24, in surprises and plot and would get a five star, but it is hard to find the hero in this show.

Marvin Gaye's voice is so smooth and the lyrics are so wonderful and applicable to today if you can get yourself to not listen to the beautiful, beautiful music and really listen to the<br />lyrics and what the deep meaning is and what it would mean if we all just do our part in the Eco., field as well as just flat out treating people right..after all right is right and it don't wrong anybody!  Sit back and chill and listen.

B00D02Z1EA|5.0|This was my first time buying something from amazon music, and I'm not disappointed. It's easy to find the actual files in your computer if you know what you're doing, so there was no difficulty just uninstalling amazon player and transferring the tracks to winamp.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|the control is very bad, i hate it, dont buy this!!!<br />this product is really bad, is uncomfortable and retarded,
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I am a sci-fi fan, and I am willing to ignore corny plots, stories, costumes, lines, special effects and acting to appreciate the better parts of the movie. However, I am only willing to ignore so much.<br /><br />The acting was okay, the costumes good, and the special effects great. However, there was so much lacking in the story that I was appalled. It's hard for me to pin point exactly what I hated about the movie, but little was done to make the story believable.<br /><br />Combine three movies that I thought were stupid: Godzilla, Ghost Busters, and Power Rangers and that is about the cheesiness you can expect from this movie. If you liked all three of the movies I just mentioned, then you'll probably like Pacific Rim.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just keep<br /> all the new levels coming I love this game it helps pass time and keeps me focused. The is some out there like it  but there is only one candy crush saga.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was quite interesting to read Doctor Sleep since it is a continuation of the story of Danny from the &#34;The Shining&#34;. As usual, Mr. King develops the characters so you easily relate to them and find a strong interest in their well being. I do think the title is slightly misleading as this has little to do with the story line but none the less........ Always love the King!
B00EQRMAJW|1.0|I thought I was ordering a compact disc not a download. Never would have paid 10.99 for a download. would like a refund
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm really impressed by this book. It gives well researched, thorough information about all aspects of building muscle, nutrition, supplements, exercise form, and more. So often I'll read something online or hear something from a friend and have to do a bit of digging to find out if it's actually true or not, and more often than not I'll find a ton of conflicting information. BLS explains exactly how to get bigger, leaner and stronger and why those methods work, with citations. I've realised that a lot of what I've been doing has been wrong (too many reps in a set) or insufficient (only protein powder as my post-workout meal), which explains my lacklustre results. I'm starting Mike's program today, with the goal to compete in a bodybuilding figure competition next year, so I'm looking forward to trying out his recommendations and seeing some progress!<br /><br />As a side note, Mike really does mean it when he says to fire any questions to his email address. I asked him a question and he answered very promptly the following morning. Nice!

0345803450|3.0|This was the October 2013 read for our book club, and we were nearly unanimous in our reaction to the book - we found it unremarkable.  I am generally so goal oriented that I feel I must finish any read I've started.  In this regard, the book did not deter me.  I finished it in good time, so, apparently the writing flow was okay.  The plot was weak and simply convenient, and the character development felt sub-par to me.  The characters, however, were sufficiently developed for me to decide I truly didn't like any of them, didn't care what happened to them, and was relieved to be done with them.
0316228583|4.0|While the storyline for this book is completely different in every way from the Harry Potter series, Rowling's pure writing talent shines through as stromg as ever. She takes a narrative that, in the hands of anyone else, would be boring (small town politics and gossip) and makes it fascinating and difficult to put down. Barry Fairbrother is the character who dies at the very beginning, setting off the events of the book. And yet...Rowling makes you care about him, a character you barely meet. She makes you care about all of the inhabitants of the town, and makes you see the motivations and passions driving all of them - there is no objective right or wrong in this little world of Pagford, no true good or evil. It must be said, however, that Rowling does not gloss over harsh realities of life here.<br /><br />The one flaw I found with this book is e sheer number of &#34;main&#34; characters. I am not great with names, so it took a little time before I was truly engaged in the story because it took a while to figure out who was who. Once I did, I was very glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book to any reader of modern fiction, but if you are interested solely because of her past works and not her style and talent in general, you will be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very happy that this game is finally here!! Thank you:-) when playing Candy Crush you will find time goes by quickly. Very sweetly addictive!

B008Q0D32S|5.0|Sergio Leone without Clint Eastwood.<br />This being a 60s Italian production, it will seem slow for the modern viewer, used to quarter second edits where characters must be doing something.  Here, long, slow, staring cuts, a hallmark of the Spaghetti Western, serve to rachet up the tension, and have the viewer wondering about the motivations of the characters.<br />Exceptional characterizations from all concerned.  See it, stick with it awhile, and it will grab you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game so much and would recommend it to all for their enjoyment. I can not stop playing this game.

0992251656|5.0|Every part of this game was made with love and attention to detail.  It is rare to find a game, merchandise, or much of anything these days that are a labor of love instead of a labor of capitalism and a quick buck.  This game was clearly made by people who love the show for people who love the show.<br />It is fully immersive, you BECOME a ship's captain and you must make tough calls on how to live it out in the black.<br />Every few turns feels like a new episode, a new job, a new challenge.<br />The game can take a while to play, but for me that's wonderful.  I don't mind taking a break and coming back later to continue with a thorough adventure.<br /><br />My favorite tangible game piece is the money and the board.  The money smells like real currency.  I am tempted to try and exchange it at a local bank.<br />My least favorite is the storage and just the sheer amount of objects.  The game has a ton of little tiles, and no way to store them that isn't in a jumbled mess.<br /><br />My favorite game play element is the solo/single player option.  It's nice to be able to enjoy a round in the 'Verse without having to wait for other people to be available or catch on sometimes. It's peaceful in the black.<br />My least favorite game play element is the cumbersomeness of the many ports and card decks for said ports.  It makes sense and is very realistic, and I do enjoy that, but sometimes it feels like a bit much.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoy the reality aspect of travel, Niska's immoral but well paying jobs, the futility of the Alliance, and the consequences to my choices as captain.<br />My crew could actually die...<br /><br />Wonderful game, I will be sure to share it and play it for as long as the wheels are spinning.
B0091VTISO|3.0|Then, after watching half, I forgot to finish it again the next day.<br />It's that forgettable.  If Ron Perlman did not appear as Conan's father, doing his usual great job at making everyone around him look half size, I'd be wondering why I was being asked to rate it.<br />On the other hand, while watching it, it's fairly entertaining.  The young man who plays Conan as a boy (I'm too unengaged to look up his name) is excellent, visceral, and more or less perfect.<br />They would have been better served to just wait for him to grow up, rather than cast the nonentity who plays Conan as an adult. He's the George Lazenby of Conans. No matter how good the rest of the cast are--and they are quite good--this guy dooms the whole affair to insignificance.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is by far my favorite app of this type.  All the puzzles are in color and there is a great variety of level of difficulty.  What sets this app apart is the feature that puts a slash mark through the number clues as you use them which makes mistakes easier to spot - this is especially useful in the very complex puzzles.  I highly recommend to people who love analytical puzzles using logic.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|I was going to NY to see Rodriguez's performance at the Barclay Center and Radio City Music Hall, the end of his tour.  I wanted to see the documentary before; and I was so touched by this unbelievable story.  He is such a humble and simple man who put on a wonderful and memorable concert.<br />I recommend this documentary to anyone and everyone; a confirmation that nothing is impossible! \\" Rodriguez's Time\\", came 40+ years later.  A Rock Star at 71!  So refreshing and heartwarming to see an entertainer full of gratitude with a sense of humor, what a treat!  Best of all his voice was not a disappointment.

And then for whatever reason they hear it said again & everything makes perfect sense & things click at last.  This is what happened to me with this book.  It works. the humor in this book floats the serious message right up to the top of understanding.  Love it
B0051ZH9AS|3.0|I'm really thinking 2.5 stars would be right.<br />This is for die hard Ella fans.<br />The CD has horrible sound and the songs are in no particular order that I can tell. Ella sounds tired and these are songs you've heard a million times, I'm sure better.<br />The DVD is much more entertaining. Four different performances from 1965 to 1977. Ella was sweet on stage but she was no Judy Garland. She had a way with a lyric but she's more a musician than a performer and without Sinatra or Nat Cole to bounce off of, she's not all that compelling. But she's Ella and sometimes that's enough.<br />I wish I hadn't purchased this.<br />Someone earlier mentioned the sound quality for the times was adequate but all you have to do is listen to any Verve recording to hear that this just isn't the case.<br />By the way, the beautiful 1950s cover photo is very misleading.

1623650003|5.0|Alex is well translated and well written. I am a voracious reader of fiction and non-fiction and have been looking for a book to capture me the way the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy did. Earlier in the year I explored the Andalucian Friend which was a bit disappointing as much as I tried to like it. When I heard about Alex I was excited but doubtful. The book does not disappoint it is gritty with a good plot real characters and nice twists and turns. My biggest disappointment is that this book is the second in a trilogy and the first installment is currently only available in French and Cantonese. I can only assume what the first book is about but I certainly look forward to a translation into English (or Spanish for that matter). Pick this one up you will be glad you did!
0143124153|5.0|This is the text of 100 fifteen-minutes talks originally given on BBC Radio Four, and it is an absolute delight.  Each object (they are all in the British Museum of which the author is the Director) gives clues to the cultural and/or political world in which it was produced.  They come from every continent, and range in time from around two million years ago to 2010.<br /><br />To give a flavour of MacGregor's treatment, here is how he deals with Object No 30, a bronze bell made between 500 and 400 BC and found in Shanxi Province, China.  We learn not only about the importance of sets of bells at ceremonial occasions and even before battles, but of the importance of music, which Confucius considered as \\"playing a central part in the education of the individual - and indeed in the shaping of the state.\\"  Music reflects diversity and harmony: each bell, like each individual, has an assigned place in the whole.  There is then a verbal description of the bell, of its great size (\\"about the size of a beer barrel\\", much larger than any bells that were cast in Europe before the Middle Ages),  of the way it was decorated, of how it was played (not with a clapper, but by being struck from outside with a long wooden pole in a particular way), of the way the different sizes were standardized.  For good measure, MacGregor begins the piece by seeing some significance in a part of the ceremony accompanying the hand-over of Hong Kong in 1997, when the British played The Last Post on a bugle (\\"a solo instrument connected with war and conflict\\"), while the Chinese played a piece on a set of ancient bells (\\"a group of instruments playing in harmony\\").  He thinks the choice of music was \\"on both sides, entirely characteristic.\\"<br /><br />MacGregor frequently brings out how interconnected our world is, either by how the materials of an object came from different countries, or by how it has travelled, or by how it was influenced by ideas that came from far away.<br /><br />Each object is described in about five pages, and this is an ideal bed-side book, to read about a couple of objects each night.<br /><br />But while the text merits five stars, the black-and-white illustrations at the head of each piece in the Penguin paperback edition are an absolute disgrace: small and so indistinct that the details described in the text are quite invisible.  Only 28 of the 100 objects are in addition illustrated with fine colour plates.  Perhaps the publishers thought that as the original radio talks were entirely verbal, these little black-and-white pictures were scarcely needed and were an additional bonus.<br /><br />However, there is a superb website, which not only illustrates each object in colour, but allows you to zoom in on details, some of which  have additional commentaries:<br /><br />[...]is described in about five pages, and this is an ideal bed-side book, to read about a couple of objects each night.<br /><br />But while the text merits five stars, the black-and-white illustrations at the head of each piece in the Penguin paperback edition are an absolute disgrace: small and so indistinct that the details described in the text are quite invisible.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have this book 5 stars because it gave me such an emotional response throughout the entire thing. The author did an amazing job and the book was so unique. What a wonderful read for anyone high school age through elderly.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|It is a good canteen, It does its job. Only complaint is that for the price of it you would think they could make it to where it has a better seal on the cap because it does leak.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Never had an issue with this app. No forced closings. Easy to use even for older folks(lol) an it is current not hours behind
1401224806|3.0|A story involving Bigby is always entertaining... yet this one is not the best of them. Worth the buck, though.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|Asimov takes some ideas that are now taken seriously by physicists - parallel universes and differing laws of physics in each - and plots a great story.  Excellence from a grand master of scifi
B008NW67E0|5.0|It is a good product and of high quality . I liked it a lot . quick shipping and good service . Thanks so much . this takes to many words . cat dog  good car
B00BGI086Q|5.0|The Box set showed up exactly when I needed it to, as it was a birthday present.  It was perfectly shipped and easy to get into.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been watching minecraft videos for 3 months and I finally got my dad to git it for me . It's awesome.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I loved this game so much... and I was really excited for the update. But when I got it my entire game was erased, like I never even played it. I was at level 37 and had just gotten a moon Dragon, about to get a bronze Dragon. I had my account connected to Facebook and I'm hoping there's a way to get it back... but I don't know how.
B006DGOV9Q|5.0|I needed to replace the battery in my new phone and this one worked better than the one that came with my phone
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The story pulls you in and doesn't let go.  I usually don't like alternating narrators, but found it worked really well in this story.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Great movie! Brad Pitt is amazing. Strong movie with an incredilbe story. Really kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is my Third Invicta watch and I am impressed with this one as well as the rest.  So far it has kept perfect time and is very pleasing to the eye.
0399230033|5.0|I like this book because it has very little text and the reader can make their own story to go along with the pictures.  Less text makes for more talking about the pictures between the adult and child, which as a speech pathologist I like this feature.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Nice big buttons and very easy to use for day-to-day arithmetic.  I have no need for exotic calculating.  This may not be the thing for that but it works great for 99% of us.
1781162646|5.0|I enjoyed it and loaned my copy to a co-worker. Good story, but I wish it had been avaialable for the Kindle.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I say the above about the book and also the encroaching dystopia it envisions.  Eggers' heroine is a normal young girl who is coaxed into becoming the figurehead for an emerging conscienceless totalitarian dictatorship.  In the process she even supervises the demise of someone she once loved.  But how subtly the tyranny approaches, with even its foremost proponents shockingly innocent in the face of the complete loss of personal privacy they will impose upon the world, a world where the majority will happily succumb to its mastery.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Super excited this finally came to kindle. I love this game and it's ridiculous addicting. The only thing that kills me is that they want you to pay money to advance. I do not have a Facebook account nor do I want one. So, I can't get any help from friends and have to wait for lives and unlocking levels. Should be a little easier.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved the pictures. And loved the magic of this book. I will recommend this book for sure. 5 star rating
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|i have always enjoyed the 2nd and 1st hunger games, but suprise, i actually found it boring. certain parts of this book were amazing, but it would later turn to a complete bore.<br />though the details wwre amazing, and the plot was ok, i thought the atemp of &#34;pulling readers in&#34; didnt work as well in this book as it did in the first or second book.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This book really held my interest even though it was choppy in some areas.  I loved the idea of making a list of wishes!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|My grandson suggested this movie and it was funny and clever enough to entertain the intellectuals in the family as well as the two year old twins. Great animation! Highly recommended as a family movie!
B0085BNIXM|5.0|Tom Berringer - enough said.  The movie is fast paced with many rememorable lines. My son and I quote lines form this movie all of the time.  Fun! Fun! Fun!! and did I say Tom Berringer?
0446530573|4.0|The meals that you can cook in this cookbook is Great & very delicious when you have A full house
B001RPIYV4|5.0|I used certain scences for my English class, college.  I just love the movie and the entire situation, and I believed the class did so too.
1594202559|5.0|Great book. Gives good insight into how the game is being played, morality is obviously subjective. knowledge is power, if you put the knowledge to work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting - not so patiently - for King.com to finally release Candy Crush Saga for the Kindle Fire HD. I had considered using a round about install but decided against it. The app seems to work well and it is a treat to play on my Kindle instead of my phone. Thanks, King.com!
B005HSL626|3.0|This game was not as challenging as I thought it would be. I think would be more suitable for a younger set.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun game..never gets old and I love the graphics and the music. the games from this series are all grea
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for candy crush saga to come in the app store and i love it!!!!!totally recommend this game for anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price this device is amazing. Not only is it very quick to send things from other devices, it loads a separate version of the media sent (in most cases) so you are able to continue on doing other things with your computer,laptop, phone or tablet!<br /><br />By far the best thing about the Chromecast though, is the ability to send all sorts of video files from your PC via the web browser by simply going to the drives network location in the address bar. (C:\Users\Public\Videos\Clockwork Orange)<br /><br />Anyway, I highly suggest it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This brought back the same feeling to me that I had upon reading Salem's Lot, Carrie, etc.  It seemed to be back to the old &#34;Stephen King&#34; manner of writing that I grew up with.<br /><br />Very, very good book.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This smart thrilling film shows again why Christopher Nolan is such a great director. A rare summer blockbuster that is amazing in every way. 2 thumbs up!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is really great.I'm surprised it's free.This app is NOT bloody only tiny drops.I would get this app if I were you.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Well, I didn't see THAT coming.  (They want another 12 words, but I don't want to spoil what &#34;THAT&#34; is)
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|I loved this story. So good to see what had become of Dan Torrence. At the end I could not put it down although it put you really on edge and all you wanted to know was that everyone was going to get out of it alright.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THRILLED that this is available on the Kindle Fire.....FINALLY!  Hate that I have to start all over again with level one, though, since I am so far on my iphone.<br />This game is so addicting!!  LOVE IT!!
B003E88TKS|5.0|Best movie I've seen in sometime. Well written and acted. Excellent plots and ending. I will definitely recommend this movie.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|An excellent mixture of culture and different styles of upbringing... brought together in a concise video format.<br />Excellent source of understanding growth an development from different perspectives.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I am an avid &#34;Castle&#34; watcher and have been interested in what his books might be like.  Of course, only the names are changed to protect...but the characters are very similar, yet dissimilar enough to separate from the TV actors.  I've just ordered the next Richard Castle book.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|It's a good game. I like the music that they play and the graphics on the game. my two favorite players are Kobe and Labran James.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good graphics, nice pictures and sounds. Challenging but not impossible. COULD use more levels but still worth the purchase. Would recommend and can play over and over.
B004N868DS|5.0|I'm very impressed with the feel of it silky smooth and fast (flip it over and it has the slow slide on it for those who don't want as fast a reaction)
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really fun easy to play<br />I would recommend this game for all ages a great game to play when your bored easy to earn points with easy set goals
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you don't like it,delete..it's free...try...I am having fun without spending money...sometimes it's hard and sometimes I get lucky...I refuse to spend money but honestly  I am having fun.....worth trying..nothing to lose!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it and it keeps me entertained as I keep tryin to beat my high score. I would recommend to anyone
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|these decals were the perfect addition to my 4 year olds princess room.  my only complaint is that there is a lot of decals for ariel and Cinderella, but not as many for the other princesses.  only three stickers for tiana.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|This is a great series. Bryan Fuller, who developed the series, said he wanted to create elegant horror and that's what you get. It is beautifully shot and brilliantly acted by all but special credit to the bromance coupling of Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikklesen, great casting. I count Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs as two of my favourite films  but seeing these two onscreen you can't imagine anybody else embodying the roles. Then to have Laurence Fishburne as Jack Crawford - icing on the cake.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote for all work notes and personal records. it is great for checklists and meeting minutes.  I do not use many of the advanced features yet.  it syncs with all my devices.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game . It is one of the most realistic hunting games I have played so far. The graphics are the best  I have seen so far. I would recommend this game to just about anyone. I especially like the variety of game. I hope you  continue to produce this quality of gameplay. Love big ed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for Amazon to add CC, and right when I was going to give up on y'all, you came through and made my day.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome, love it! Character's are so cool, need to learn to move quickly through objects. Then beat Vector, El Macho & Meena. Just can't put it down.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Lots of puzzles of various sizes.  Some are easy, others more challenging without being frustrating...yet.  I'm only on the second set of 100 5x5s.  Overall, great entertainment anywhere.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Started this game when my daughter said I couldn't play it just once. She was right. Very fun even though it's aggravating.
B004P7CMDM|5.0|I'm so glad i bought this movie and very happy with it and so glad to have it in my collection
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Love the improvements from the first game. Very time consuming and losing sleep from this game. Highly recommended for procrastinators.
B0000A2I1B|4.0|Have really liked this album for quite awhile. Left cassettes a while back and this was one album I really liked but took a long time to get on CD. Wish I hadn't waited. Ranks right up there with Abraxas. Caravanserai is about 4.75 stars to Abraxas being 5 stars. Santana's newer stuff is pretty good with Guitar Heaven being best of newer stuff by him, but I really like Abraxas best, Caravanseri second and Guitar Heaven third.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you have a life you won't after playing this game it is so addicting. I wanted see why everyone loves this app and now I can't put it down except to wait for more lives.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game really gives you play time. It really nice to be able to play with your ponies an get to know them. It would be really nice if we could have spike as character. He talks and gives quest but you don't see him walking around and you can't play with him. Just something I wish it had in there besides that I love it.
B00ES3X9Q2|5.0|I remember Reading this as a kid and now i can read it again just like i'm reading it for the first time all over again.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Ive been a Jetthead since 1981 and this album just proves why she is the God Mother of Punk Rock!- Love it- every song kicks ass!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is everything I knew it would be!!! the app works great!!! I am super happy that amazon finally put this game on here!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just exactly what I needed - very clear and no frills which is so often not the case these days
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this about a dozen games a week.  I do not mind the adverts at the beginning of each game as this is a free app.  readable cards. easy play. nice app.
B0085A9HU6|5.0|Just like i remember the movie when i watched it years ago. It brings back memories. This is such a good movie
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This is a very good book a little creepy but funny. And I would recommend It as a book to read.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Khaled Hosseni's work. His writing reads effortlessly yet the stories are rich and complex.  That being said this novel is more ambitious than his first 2. Its more disjointed but still an excellent read.  If you are a fan of his, you will like it.<br /><br />But, if you've never read Hosseini before, zip recommend reading Kite Runner first.  Once you know his style, I think, its easier, more apparent, to appreciate his work.<br /><br />I enjoyed it.
B000P0J09M|1.0|the copy is double sided so half the movie is on one side and halfway through the movie you have to flip it over to watch the rest of it. save yourself the trouble and go to walmart and buy it for $5
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|There are soo many different stories going in its hard to get through. Im only a quartrr through but I dont want to finish
B004XISI4A|5.0|What an amazing book. You cannot assume to know what's to happen next. You are always left guessing. Magic stuff!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great. I get so got up looking through the various things that interests me that I lose all track of time. There's my interest in gardening by the square foot and container gardening- Well all the information that I have found is mind boggling. Then there's my crafts- need I say more? I love it! Thanks for coming up with the idea.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and easy to follow with great graphics! It's fantastic for children and for those of us who never grow up and love horses! It's free, but if you want to quickly advance in the game, you will have to pay for gems and/or coins. If you want to earn everything, it takes time but it's super fun! It's great for passing the time!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I couldn't find this in stores anywhere and this helped me to complete my series. Thanks for making it available.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love the fact that Dragonvale is simply a fun place to breed dragons. Great for all ages (even Mom plays it)!  Build your islands up with decor and dragon habitats and have fun ( and sometimes frustration) trying to get the special dragons. All in all, a more interactive app that seems to keep my teen daughter occupied and is Mom approved.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Zombies who move more quickly than I care to think about. Shhh! They'll hear you. Pass me a disease please.
B00006B1HH|5.0|im a super fan of grease and i love it, this came in time and it came in good condition. the corners are a little worn but it was a good deal and im glad i made the purchase
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. So glad to see that Kindle now has the app!!  It's a very addictive game and I play every day!
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Its good entertainment,  But some of the special effects are too surreal and unrealistic (though this movie is about magic) and it makes it look cheap. The end does not have the excitement and the crescendo which it builds up to. Mark Ruffalo and Michael Caine are not the ideally suited actors for their parts nor for any part in this movie (and they are excellent actors btw). I would say as a family entertainment its 75% enjoyable and very colorful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book and really well-written. But I hated the ending. This was one of those books that you can't put down.
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|I ordered the 3 disc version, Bluray 3D, Blu Ray and Dvd, but they only sent me a 2 disc version Bluray 3D and DVD. Thats really bad..
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Enjoyed Candy Crush until recently.  Been stuck on one level for over a month.  Had been told by other players that I would have to buy more moves to win but I didn't believe it.  Now I think they must be right.  How disappointing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought it was really good until the end when it felt like the author was like, &#34;I got to wrap this up.&#34;
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I came so close to not even buying this book because the title sounded a little cheesy and what was up with that flower on the cover? But I am so glad I did read it. At first it was hard to keep track of who Rachel was and which one was Cecilia and Tess, but I quickly got to know them. And I felt for them.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This is by far the best scan tool for your phone or tablet. If you regularly take pictures for your work, this is for you. Capture documents and automatically align them for optimal viewing with this ingenious app.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can hardley wait to see what happens in season four. Can't believe that it appears that Mr. Crowley was killed.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|A thrill ride with many twists and turns!  It is very well written, with such excellent descriptions that I could feel the story as if I were there!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|the best show ever has everything your looink for and the best part its family friendly. I highly recommend it. a must see
0307455874|1.0|Here is the greatest piece of fiction since Lord of the Rings. The part where Fro-bama climbs to the top of mount dhoom and throws the ring of capitalism into it, why it brought a tear to my eye. Not since Mein Kauph has a person written such truth while being locked away in a civil war death camp<br />The real truth is in the line used in the movie Ace Ventura \\"Fiction can be fun buti find the reference section much more enlightening...\\"<br />Dont waste more of your precious money poon such drivel like this hes stolen enough from you already
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|This is an amazing world the author created and there are treatments of sci-fi here that i've never seen done anywhere before. The depth of the background civilization, the treatment of A.I. and what might happen if they ever developed a conscience goes way beyond the the usual take over the world scenario. It's doesnt have the most exciting scenes, though there are at key moments, but if you like to immerse yourself in a futuristic tale of redemption and coming to terms with who you are, doesn't get much better than this.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This was a decent sci fi movie.  Everyone has their Will Smith meter set way to high.  The movie was good aside from being way to eco-preachy.  People need to stop judging movies based on who is in them.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I want more of it! More of the series, more of the movie. I can't believe the bone head studio execs cancelled the series. The should be banished to Point Barrow for the rest of their miserable lives!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Great show. Excellent plots and character development.  The dynamic between Castle and Detetctive Becket is captivating. The supporting characters add to the atmosphere and are outstanding.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|I love Supernatural.  I know some fans don't like the angels story lines or the mythology heavy episodes.  But, I love those.  In season 8, the brothers embark on a mission to close the gates of Hell.  It's a great season and the closing images of the season finale` were amazing.  I got the Blu-ray so I could have the Ultraviolet code.  I like being able to watch it through Flixster and Vudu.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A good read and excellent reminder of Faith, and the importance of always listening to \\"that little voice,\\" no matter where we are in life.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Hard to read, yet so compelling. The descriptions of life in North Korea are brutally graphic, and difficult to digest. Yet, Jun Do remains a stalwart spirit, taking praise and punishment equally - and understanding that each is but a temporary situation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator for emergencies.  Works just like a normal calculator, but on your kindle.  It's saved me many a pretty penny replacing cheep or broken calculators.  Doesn't have scientific functions, though.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|After watching the earlier Iron Man movies I expected this one to at least be a solid action flick.  Instead I was bored silly. waste of money and time!  There were a few good action scenes, but they were meagerly parsed out amidst a lot of mildly comedic chit chat.  It was hard to believe, but they really failed to make a good movie.  It seemed like a lot of out takes that could be edited down to an okay trailer but as a full length movie it was a dud. What a dud! Don't get burned, watch something else!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Greetings All, So happy I bought this hit show! Copy is nice and clear and the sound is great! The show keeps on getting better and keeps me wanting more! I would buy from seller again! Cheers! William
B001CQONKY|3.0|I am rating the first eight seasons in the series with this review.  I never really liked CSI to start with but needed something to watch during the day so I got the first ten seasons due to their reasonable costs.  The season six dvds were horrible in playing.  Two of the discs &#34;digitalize&#34; in nearly episode and stop playing in spots.  Plus the case in which they were housed must have been crushed at some point as all the plastic teeth on the &#34;center holding posts&#34; were broken and the dvd's won't stay in.  I had to order new dvd covers for this season and for season eight which seems to have the same problem.  I believe at some point these dvds will be given away as the packaging is so poorly done.  Each season is in a slip case that is hard to remove, I had to tear season seven's case off as I couldn't remove it any other way.<br /><br />As for the show itself, I never really liked any of the characters except for Nick Stokes.  The others always seemed to be self centered, arrogant and just downright disobedient to their boss.  As the seasons progressed, it seemed these attitudes got worse and worse until most of the original characters left the show and new ones came on board.  Currently I do like Ted Danza and that roster of characters in their roles.<br /><br />As stated before, I only got the dvds because of the reasonable price and was disappointed in everything else
B00EDF43MY|2.0|This Dr. Panda game is very slow moving. Takes too long to change from one scene to the next. My 4 year old niece loses interest in it
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I would buy this in a hard cover so I could underline, flip pages and dog ear better.  This may change your life!  I have movement disorder and I am on some seriously bad for you meds, planning to get off them now!  My daughter is OFF her seizure medicine and has been seizure free!
0307476073|4.0|I really loved this book!  It wasn't too &#34;sappy&#34; like other self-discovery books (I had issues with Eat, Pray, Love).  I really enjoyed Chery's character.  It was perfect for our book club!
0786915749|5.0|So, I've finally going to review Dragons of Autumn Twilight. I've wanted to do this for a long time, it is a fantastic book. I first heard about it from a friend, who was mainly describing Raistlin's character. I picked up an omnibus edition, and got sucked into the fantastic world of Krynn. Now, for those who don't know Dragonlance was a setting created for the famous fantasy roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. This novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight along with the other two novels in the series were based on Dungeons and Dragons game that the authors participated in. I also believe it was a milestone in fantasy literature. Remember, this novel came out in the 80s. Back when it was written it was not cliched; as some reviewers claim. I still don't believe it is cliched, it is a fantastic novel. This novel is very different from Tolkien. There is a larger cast of characters, all well developed. They range from The grim yet noble Sturm Brightblade, the cheerful and naive Tasslehoff Burrfoot and one of my favorite characters of all time The sarcastic and dark mage Raistlin Majere. I honestly like this book better than the Fellowship of the Ring, and I am a huge fan of Tolkien. This novel is paced  better going from scene to scene and holding my interest, Whereas the Fellowship becomes a bit drawn out in the beginning. Also this book contains some amazing imagery. Undead warriors, Dragon-Men, a Unicorn, and multiple dragons. This is on top of a sense of a world steeped in history and legend. I highly recommend this novel.
160774418X|5.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great cookbook from two of my favorite chefs. The food is incredible. I own around 300 cookbooks and Ottolenghi and Tamimi have written my favorites. BUT, this '\\"new\\" cookbook is a republished version of their very first cookbook. Somehow, somewhere, I bought the English copy and now find that I've just bought the International copy of the same book. I've been looking forward to this since it was announced and never expected to be buying something I already had. I never heard any mention about this being a rerelease. What a ripoff.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Orphan Train and have already recommended it to family members. The story was very well constructed and quite compelling. It also introduced me to some history that I was not familiar with, and  I intend to explore the orphan trains in more depth.
0739352687|5.0|My grandson loves to have stories read to him and it is all because of these books!  He often listens to these books when in the car. They often travel long distances and the first thing in the car are these disks. He has just finished the newest Rick Riordan book on CD and I think it had only been out less than a week!

B00CWEQ62S|1.0|In the fine print it says it is a comic book, but that is not what I wanted.  I feel ripped off and it is not worth the hassle to send it back.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars by John Green is truly a book worth somebody's time, even if they aren't a big reader. When a friend first told me to read this book for an independent reading school project, I hesitated. I only had about a week and a half to read a book, and The Fault in Our Stars is three-hundred pages long. However, as soon as I read the first page, I was immediately captivated with the life of sixteen-year-old Hazel and her life of hardship due to cancer. I finished the book within a few days, and I am certainly not big on reading books.<br />  The number one reason why I absolutely love this book is simply because I can relate to Hazel. No, I haven't had cancer, and I'm not quite sixteen. In fact, I myself am not really like Hazel at all. However, the way that Hazel thinks and narrates her life (the book is written from her point of view) is completely understandable and relatable.<br />  Something that throws me off about other various reviews on websites is the fact that people are calling it a love story. Yes, the main character and the supporting role are in love, however the book puts more emphasis on their true friendship rather than their romanticizing. For that, I would recommend this book to girls AND boys.<br />  The Fault in Our Stars can be bitter at parts, and emotionally sensitive people like myself will probably cry while reading the book. Nonetheless, the reason why the reader may become sad is naturally because he or she is guaranteed to love and make connections with the characters. This book, a bittersweet page-turner, is sincerely one of the best books I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who has feelings. It may seem like too trendy of a book to some people, however I can promise that it is an excellent read. READ THIS BOOK!
