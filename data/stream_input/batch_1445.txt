B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a great game, I can spend hours just playing it, the only problem is that when I try to visit other villages it says I need the update, but I click it and there is none,  ive talked with others who have had the same problem
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this games gives me and my kids hours of play time cause if I am not playing my kids are when go on long trips this really occupy my kids. really hope that that this game will not update and and I lose all my saved games cause I saw were someone else said that the game updated and they lost all of the games they played that would be a bomber
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I borrowed the print version from a friend. I'd seen the movie and thought it was a bit much for me, so I wasn't overly enthusiastic when I started to read the book. The violence and grit is very present in the book, however, without the excessive visual images like in the movie, it's considerably more tolerable. It's enough to make you very uncomfortable, not enough to turn you off on the the story. In hindsight, I wish I would've read the book before watching the movie because I think it would've been that much more intruiging, but I also wonder if without the knowledge of the plot from the movie, if I would've instead been confused for 75% of the book. I read it in two sittings on one day. Definitely worthing look at.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its an awesome game and it really feels like ur in the ice age world so thats why i want u  to by this awesome fun active fantastic game thank you
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|if the wifi you are using if it is filtered for no facebook that. message will pop up just try a different one
0385342063|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and I've Got Your Number now currently sits up top with my other favorites Twenties Girl and Can You Keep a Secret. I laughed, I got teary eyed, I noticed my heart skipping a beat here and there(1) and it could not have had a better ending... What more can you ask for?<br /><br />I highly recommend I've Got Your Number for a lovely bit of escapism which will end with a big smile on your face.<br /><br />(1) Not giving anything away.. But the wood scene?! Wow. :)
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|As you have already read, no doubt, this is an amazing show. I have not read the books, but as a stand-alone series for television it is filled with depth of character, action, intrigue and wonderful fantasy elements. I don't have HBO so I am eager for the second season to come to Blue-ray. If you thought shows like Walking Dead kept you on the edge of your seat, you'll be shocked at how this series excels above all others. Having the whole season at your finger tips is wonderful: no need to wait week to week to watch them. The only downside is that I now must wait for the next season to carry on the fascinating story. This blue-ray is well worth the purchase price. Get it. You'll love it if you enjoy intelligent cinema mixed with the fantasy genre.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be on the Kindle for forever! I absolutely love this game, it's so addictive! For those wanting to delete a game just hold down on the person and slide to the left. A delete button should pop up. It took me forever to figure it out so I understand why so many people are frustrated. Come play with me sugi55
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great series.  I honestly could not put the book down.  As a mother of 3, I don't think that I would recommend it for preteens, as it was a little too graphic.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love it :) simple, fun, and addictive... with mini games! ive enjoyed hours of entertainment with this game its really fun!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I love these type games and this one is great. only reason I gave only 4 stars is because I have worked on the chapter 5 clock forever and can't get it to set right.  any hints anyone. I just think its ridiculous to make it so hard to get one puzzle right on the precise spot. its not fun like that, its just frustrating!! someone help!!!!!
B001TWT0AE|5.0|this is one of john wayne's best by far, a very well writen story line. if you have a john wayne collection like i do you need this movie! i like it just as much as red river.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This is not just a cartoon, or a film...it is art. Story-telling at it's best. For most of the movie, there is barely any talking and yet you are able to follow along with every emotion and thought of the characters. It also carries a very positive message about taking care of our planet. I didn't really look at the additional features, I just wanted to own this work of art.
030746363X|5.0|I have been reading and using the methods in this book for 2 weeks now, i have lost 7 pounds, sex drive is through the roof, and i dont have to take blood pressure meds as of now.. my bp has been perfect for the last week and a half...im only really just touching the surface of this book and already have these results.. i hope to do even better when i start my exersize and supplement program..as of now im just eating what and when it is outlined to do so...  i have never written a review before, so sorry if im all over the place.. im just very excited about how easy my new body is changing.... thank you Tim for putting it all together in an easy to follow guide...<br /><br />Josh
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Don't read this review if you haven't read book two there are spoilers in here if you haven't finished book 2.<br /><br />ok so I got these books from a friend and started reading the first. I liked it a lot, spent the whole time reading it with a flushed face and kept looking over my shoulder to make sure no one could see what I was reading. Started the second book and read the third in not time flat. What I didn't like was after the first book I wanted to really get down to the nitty gritty of why Christian is the way he is. But I just felt that all the book had was sex,sex,sex and then more sex,sex, sex. IT got to the point where I would just skip over the sex parts trying to get to the story line. By the third book I was tired of all the sex scenes and I think so was the author because I could tell she even started to skip over the detailed sex scenes. There were some time line issues I had with the book as well. Too much happened in too short of a time. She would have done better to have stretched out their courtship and not make everything that happened in both book one and two happen in about 5 weeks of meeting and getting to know each other. To me it's just too fast a time line. If I read the timing correctly they meet, she graduates college, they start their relationship, she ends her relationship, he's devastated, she has to fend off an ex girlfriend stalker running around with a gun, she has an ex-boss stalker and she moves in with Christian, and then gets engaged all in 4-5 weeks?? Also and I guess this just might be nit picking, but the author also made some mistakes with her own story. SPOILER ALERT!!!! Don't read this section if you haven't read the entire series because I'm about to say stuff that may tip you off to what happens in book three! BE FAIR WARNED!  OK so when they go off on their honeymoon they take his private jet over to europe, but then when they come back from their honeymoon they fly first  class???? What happened to their private jet? I also can't stand how the author writes this all the time in the book,\\" Christian stood there naked, except for a towel wrapped around his waist.\\" or \\" Christian was in the bedroom naked with those faded blue jeans on that I love on him.\\"  WELL THAT'S NOT NAKED IS IT NOW?? Don't know why that bothered me so much but it did. Don't get me wrong it is a good story, and the sex scenes are hot, but after a while I wanted a better story line.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Excellent basic game of solitaire. Don't ask me if the game is Yukon, Canfield or whatever - it's just Solitaire. There are better apps out there but this one does the job.
0545265355|5.0|The books arrived sooner that i expected, and in perfect conditions...i totally recommend them...they are totally awesome!! If you are a fan of te saga, you should have this collection...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a great fan of Speculative Fiction, and a voracious reader of post-apocalyptic novels.  I expected this to be another set of ho-hums of which there are MANY, but I was gratefully surprised by the splendid story, writing, imagery and concept.  Love, love, love this series and can't wait for the next installation.  What's going to happen in Silo 17?  What's the teaser with Silo 40?  Are any of the remaining people actual New Order members?  Do they get a lateral tunnel dug?  Is Juliette going to be mayor of 2 silos?  Quick, quick!  I need more!  Thanks for the lovely read.
B0077PBPY6|5.0|I watched Birdsong on PBS the last two Sunday nights and was completely captivated. The lighting of the French peace-time scenes drew me in. The character development was slow and deliberate...I really cared what happened to these people. I am a pacifist and this show confirms everything I believe in. Our leaders should watch it as a reminder of what a horror war really is.
B005GCCJME|3.0|My family owns several different pairs of croc's in the original style as well as some loafers and a couple of different pairs of sandals, and I have to say that this pair is the least soft out of them all. For the price I was expecting something a little better and in the future will just stick to the original which I know are soft and comfortable.
0345803485|1.0|My first comment is that I'm annoyed that there isn't a \\"zero\\" stars rating, as that is how sad I think this book is.  If you prefer books with even an ounce of intelligence, don't listen to the hype. The writing style is so poor and amateurish that it becomes comedic in its stupidity and repetition - which was the only thing that allowed me to finish the book.  While the author was attempting to seduce with an erotic romance, all I can say is that I was too distracted by counting how many times words such as \\"murmur\\" or \\"groan\\" could be used on one page to notice.  And I won't even talk about all the references to mussed hair, inner goddesses, low slung pants, or, the worst, the look in Christian's eyes. Even the sex scenes became so redundant and repetitive that I wondered whether entire sections were just cut and pasted to create others, with only a slight word tweak here or there. In my mind, a total waste of time.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love games like this...although it does ask to buy things with money...you don't have to you can still get things you want...I guess its up to the person playing...def 5 stars for me
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space is a very entertaining game. New twists with gravitational pull and orbits!!I liked it so much, I couldn't put it down, literally! I finished all levels in 3days. The black hole is a great surprise! All in all I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|\\"John Carter\\" is based on Burroughs' first book, \\"A Princess of Mars.\\" That title is important, because the action centers on a strong, intelligent, beautiful, young princess who refuses to follow her father's will, which she believes will subjugate her people to the evil prince her father wants her to marry. She sets out to find a way to save her people, and this is where John Carter comes in. It's 1868, the Civil War veteran has just discovered a cave of gold in Arizona, and while exploring the cave he is suddenly and mysteriously transported to Mars. There he finds the Red Planet's reduced gravity gives him superpowers, and when the princess first sees him in action she sets her sights on winning the very reluctant soldier over to her cause.<br /><br />This film is an exuberant, romantic adventure with a giant heart. The special effects are original and well done, but they are merely servants of a gripping story. Strong writing and first-rate acting are by far its greatest pleasures. I have seen this movie many times and look forward to enjoying many more viewings.
B00785P2QC|3.0|its a fun game but I wish you could do more at a time and I wish it was more free. it could also use some more help suggestions in the beginning of the game.
0062073281|3.0|After reading all of Lauren Conrad's novels, I can say without hesitation that they are all basically the same. Same premise, similar characters, comparable plot lines. It was enjoyable to read insider information into how reality tv works a few years ago when Ms. Conrad's first book came out. Now, not so much.<br /><br />All that being said, I still enjoyed the Fame Game which is a novel that follows Madison Parker and several other female characters as they sign on for a new Hollywood 'reality' tv series about struggling actors and musicians looking to make it in Hollywood. It's a quick and easy read which fans of Ms. Conrad will enjoy. But it isn't anything you haven't read from her before.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This was a well done app, seamlessly streaming any of my apps or movies of my Pc. I would recommend it to anyone on the go.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 games + 23 is a fun &amp; challenging game. It is VERY VERY addictive. I could play it ALL day! I LOVE 101+23 GAMES!!!
0307352145|5.0|I had my doubts, but this turned out to be a very engaging read. It covers the intercultural differences in extroversion, the rise of extroversion as the ideal in American culture, the different needs of extroverts/introverts in the workplace, how it's possible to fake extroversion for the right cause, and how a parent might go about engaging a kid who's on the other end of the spectrum from themselves.<br /><br />I have no idea whether the ideas presented here are backed up in the literature, but it made a lot of sense to me, and really gave me food for thought.<br /><br />These days, I tend to just order books at the library, but I'm glad I ponied up for this one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Seriously captivating! Thought this would be another twilight but it was far better. Story has great depth and will leave you wanting more.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I've played all of the Alawar games available for the Fire and, while I liked most of them, this one is far and away the best. It has great graphics and a nice long story with plenty of puzzles. A real bargain, too!
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Awesome movie!  It was better than the original, and I can't wait for the next one to come out.  A must buy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|sony s tablet<br />runs great no issues<br /><br />nice ambience the background is a nice touch.<br />Puzzles range in difficulty and are very addicting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely. positively. love this app get this app you wont. be sorry.and I'm not kidding seriously. get this app .................
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book, along with a lot of people. Read the entire series in one weekend - I couldn't put it down. I thought it was a bit expensive but in the end worth it. I've recommended this series to at least 20 different people and even caught myself discussing it with someone in starbucks. I hope they make this into a movie that won't disappoint.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I've had this on my iPhone4s for the last 3 months and it's been great. Might be a little bulky for some, but when the phone falls out of your hand, you'll appreciate the extra protection. No, it won't likely protect from hard surfaces. Got one for my girlfriend after she saw how well this was doing.
B007X04N7G|5.0|I was going to buy this on Amazon first thing this morning, but didn't have a chance before running out. Glad I didn't because on the way home I stopped off at Target and they had the Deluxe Edition with 5 extra songs. None of the 5 songs are available to purchase as a single on Amazon or Itunes. Songs are \\"September Song\\", \\"Our Day Will Come\\", \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses\\", \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Run\\". It frustrates me when they do this, and I have to remind myself not to make an impulse buy before checking all outlets for the one with the exclusive, which one of them almost always does.<br /><br />Hope this helps, sorry Amazon. I was already to purchase from you, but Target won out. Better luck next time.<br /><br />Toddles
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was really excited about this game.  It is similar to some of those on Facebook, but I could play on my Kindle Fire without having access to the internet.  I was really getting into the game when my energy stopped refreshing and all of my building timers changed to over 100 hours!!  I tried giving it a few days to see if it would correct itself, but finally uninstalled.  I gave it a second chance and didn't even make it past level 15 without the error again (I had made it to level 38 the first time.)  Therefore, it will remain uninstalled now unless a new version comes out.  :(
1401233066|4.0|This is the section of Fables that becomes sort of meta. A comic book aknowledging other comics exist by having the characters become super heroes and act as if they're part of the comics canon. Dizzying and interesting. The disappointment for me was the treatment and conclusion of the Dark Man storyline. I felt that the purpose of this section was to wrap up that part of the storyline and I feel like it did so somewhat offhandidly. Overall I still enjoyed this collection, heck it's Fables, it's hard not to.
B007JRUA7K|5.0|A very heartfelt, touching look at Marilyn, the person, and her role as the character actress she created.  Superb acting from everyone!
B000RD0RDU|5.0|Nice little fan...bought it for my graphics card that didn't come with one and it appeared to be running a little warm. This teenie fan worked great!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is a great movie to add to your collect. If you enjoyed Mission Impossible I & II then you will definetely like this one. [[ASIN:B004EPYZV2 Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo +Digital Copy)]]
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|I don't have it but I have an app just like it and its only 0.99 cents so this app is a total rip off don't get it
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is an exciting story. I couldn't put it down read it from beginning to end in one day. Rebecca Hamilton does an amazing job with this story she draws you in making you feel as though you are the main character Sophia. You get taken on a journey throughout history and the modern world that at times will leave you pondering if this story is more truth than fiction. I was truly amazed at how caught up in The Forever Girl I became, I felt as though I had been transformed into the emotion and power this book shares with it's readers. The forever Girl is a truly captivating story and one I would highly recommend as a must read. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series as I am sure it will be as good if not better than this one. I truly thank Rebecca for the chance to read her work she is a very talented author whose work I will continue to look for and read more of!
B000067QMD|5.0|Having a newborn means that you live in world of disarray.  It also means that you are perpetually and endlessly washing bottles and making formula.  Half the time we can't find a nipple and just need to seal the bottle and get it in the fridge--ENTER these bottle sealing discs.<br /><br />They create a tight seal and pop in and out easily.  They will also prove useful later on if we want to use a bottle to hold cheerios or fruit loops:)
B005Z271Y6|3.0|The audio is amazing, and this concert video makes full use of the audio fidelity available via the Blu-Ray format.<br /><br />The video editing leaves something to be desired.  I found myself wishing the camera would just... keep... one... angle for one solitary line.  Adele doesn't sing more than 3 words per camera angle.  It's distracting.  You can't get lost in the music, because your eyes are always popped over to a new frame of reference.<br /><br />Zooms in and out, pans, etc. aren't as distracting - but changing from a front view to an overhead view to a crowd shot to a side angle - all on one line!!  Its simply out of pace with a slow tempo, heart wrenching song. That type of rapid \\"pop pop pop\\" camera sequencing would be more appropriate for something like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, or Kesha.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  It's my 2nd favorite concert Blu-Ray.  I guess I'm frustrated in that the raw material was there to make this a reference concert disc - bar none.  Close your eyes, relax, and take in the great music - and glance up at the screen every once in awhile.  If you try to watch it intently, you'll fry your eyeballs.<br /><br />For a point of reference: my favorite concert Blu-Ray is Stevie Nicks, Soundstage.  Compare the video editing on these 2 discs, and you'll understand what I'm talking about.
B0058VW36U|1.0|...Can't get it to function on the Samsung Fascinate?! All it can do is load the beginning clip w/ the door that opens to a package that says &quot;Feed with candy.&quot; Once finished, it loads again, &amp; takes me to the front screen with 'Play' &amp; 'Settings' options. Please, ZeptoLab/Amazonapp, put out a patch that can let me play it on my Fascinate Galaxy S! I so want to! At least I got it when it was free.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|An easy work around for the inability to access the Kindle photo gallery directly is through the use of the free ES File Explorer app. Download and install it. When you select &quot;gallery&quot; in PicsArt it will give the option to access files using ES. Then go to the &quot;picture&quot; folder to find your gallery pics.  It also shows the PicsArt folder. If you have dropbox that works fine as well. I imagine they'll fix this oversight soon, but this will work until then.<br />The app works very well and does most of the things that I actually use on my desktop editor. ES file manager is also a five star app.
0439023521|2.0|The biggest thing that bothered me about this book is that the plot is a copy and paste from the 2000 Japanese movie Battle Royale. I'm angry that the book is so successful for being a knockoff.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i think this is great game. I have lots of fun. not complicated and really easy to just pick up and play.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really liked this book the whole way through. The ending was a little off the wall, but I was so invested in the characters that I didn't care.
B007UXSPK2|1.0|If Tom Cruise wants to get out of his suck hole, he's needs to do something other then rehash this crap over an over again.
B0071BY1PG|5.0|I have seen this movie before in 2d and enjoyed it, but the 3d in this movie like most of Dreamworks 3d has what you look for in a 3d movie. Lots of 3d pop out effects. Well worth the money to spend on a 3d blu ray movie. I would highly recommend it.
0764141201|5.0|Great condition and really interseting it is a must-have book. Its explain blow to blow how to use Phrasal verbs in many different contexts.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun to play. While you guys are stealing, steal GameLoft's control system. The game is pretty good nonetheless. Keep up the good work.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Don't stop and think if u should get it. Just do it! This is an awesome game. I'm always playing it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is going to sound bad but I use to fall asleep reading the Bible because I didn't have the right version for me And honestly I want to read my Bible more because how smooth this app works... Its a great app and amazingly someone thinks in human and gave this app for free... Thanks!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|with its zen inspiring peaceful music playing soothingly in the background its easy to forget you are playing a game...a nice way to unwind.  The background music provides a relaxing cathartic experience;while the puzzle gently tugs at your brain. It's an enjoyable experience that I would recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|well this game is really fun and all I just don't like when people accept your invatation to draw, and they like don't draw back!! I mean if your gonna play, than play!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was quickly hooked and found myself reading through all five episodes.  I really like an author who isn't afraid to change things up midstream.  Highly recommended!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Seriously, there's not one thing I don't like about this movie.  The heart wrenching scenes, the awesome story, great acting, perfect cast and overall, it made sense.  This movie isn't one of those 2012 movies, where it's completely BS.<br /><br />I was hooked from the start of the movie.  This has be to J.Foster's best movie.  Has to be.  Anyways, even though the movie is over 2 hours long, you will wish that it was longer at the end.<br /><br />Sorry I hate writing reviews and don't have the time to leave more info but I had to give this a 5 star rating, hence, the brief, \\"Drank 100 cups of coffee\\" review.<br /><br />Happy viewing!
B0009S4IKQ|1.0|AsI watched this movie, restored to unbelievable sharpness, I was reminded of the quote by Bea Arthur:  \\"There will never be a generation as naive, and gullible as my was\\"  The woman knew how things have changed since the Great Depression.  Garbo, was just an incredible bore and Barrymore who I heard read so much about was not much better.  I had no idea that Joan Crawford was so beautiful when she was young.  I was impressed with Lionel Barrymore & Wallace Berry they were the only real actors in this story.  To think that in only 8 years, Hollywood would produce \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and Gone With The wind, both of which to this day are entertaining and match anything Hollywood is cranking out today.  Since 1977 when \\"Star Wars\\"<br />came out, it seems to me for a brief spell only there was good movies.  Today, it's nothing but Noise, Noise,explosion all directed to Teenage boys.  Well you can just keep all the movies<br />T.V. stories are better it's just all the commercials that makes it unbearable. My last thought about Greta Garbo she repeated and repeated in this movie \\"I Vant to be A lone\\" in a thick  accent and over acted to point it was laughable.  How in this world, she ever got so much press after she left the screen is beyond me????  I VANT to forget she ever existed.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Within Temptation is the best female fronted gothic/metal band on earth. Amy Lee can only pray to write material this good.<br />I would say WT is the best gothic/metal band on earth but we all know no one comes close to Moonspell. I own every WT disc.<br />They don't have a bad disc. Over the years, they have changed, however, when it comes to WT change is good. This is a concept record. The first and I hope not the last for WT. If you haven't bought any Within Temptation, go for it. You won't<br />find a middle of the road record in the bunch. They are all great. If you're a die hard Evanescence fan, you can finally<br />find gothic perfection with Within Temptation. The heart of everything, the silent force, mother earth and enter by<br />Within Temptation are all leaps and bounds above anything evanesence has done or has the talent to do. The major labels<br />here in the states don't want you to hear bands like within temptation and moonspell. If you do... they can't push the<br />crap they want to force on you like (let's see how stupid we can make the human race) or as it is know in most circles RAP.<br />DON'T LET THE MUSIC INDUSTRY DUMB YOU DOWN. DEMAND ACTUAL MUSIC, NOT SAMPLES OF THE SAME BEATS WITH DIFFERENT WORDS.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting book that I enjoyed muchly but I would like to have just given it 5 stars and be done.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's just what it says, the 8 movies on 8 dvds.  It's the most affordable way to own all the movies.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This might be Radiohead's darkest, most nihilistic work.  Many of the songs focus on the pointlessness of life and the futility of struggle.  \\"I Might Be Wrong\\", \\"Dollars & Cents\\", \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", the brutal \\"Knives Out\\", and the epic \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\" all reflect an existential angst concerning the essential meaninglessness (and meanness) of life.  Many songs deal with oppressive forces that hold people down and make all struggle futile.  Even the outwardly defiant \\"You and Whose Army\\", comes off less as a challenge to authority, than an empty boast by a defeated and hopeless victim.<br /><br />However, Amnesiac is also one of Radiohead's masterpieces - in fact the division among fans regarding Amnesiac astounds me.  It is clearly much more than some toss-offs from Kid A.  Some of Thom's best vocals, as well as some of the most haunting melodies of the band's career, are on this album.<br /><br />Bottom line, Amnesiac is a must-own for any Radiohead fan, and probably serves as an end point to the darkest material of their career.  More recent works like In Rainbows and King of Limbs show Thom and the boys softening a bit... there is acceptance, and even a message of oneness with the natural universe.  Whereas Amnesiac is dark, depressing, and hopeless.  It is a monumental work of genius.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very useful app that occasionally surprises me with a Bible version I didn't know it had.  Sometimes the interface is a little confusing, especially if I've not used it for awhile, but that's just me being forgetful. Overall better than I expected and a valuable addition to my Kindle.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|J. Edgar, 2011 film<br /><br />This film begins with a quote and a picture of a building. The voice warns us against Communism. Hoover wants to tell his story from the beginning. In 1919 A. Mitchell Palmer was Attorney-General. A bomb explodes outside a home at 11pm. Targets of Bolshevik Communism! Hoover's eyes were opened! [Hoover's father was sent to a mental asylum, his family did not get a pension, and a teen-aged Hoover became the breadwinner of the family.] Hoover has an indexing system to quickly locate facts about people. [His first government job was at the Library of Congress; he went to law school at night.] \\"My work comes first.\\" The story of Hoover's early days continues. They need proof to deport a foreigner. But what about a citizen? In Centralia Washington a man shoots at military veterans. There is a strike in Chicago! The deportation of Emma Goldman set a precedent.<br /><br />[There was a recession after the War.] There is a raid in Paterson (\\"Silk City\\"). [The dim lighting hides the events.] \\"Enough.\\" Nearly 4,000 were arrested and 500 deported. The agents involved in this raid lost their jobs. [The election of a Republican meant new patronage jobs.] Harlan Fiske Stone appointed Hoover as Acting Director of the Bureau of Investigations. Hoover wants a more professional organization. Agents would be lawyers and accountants, and obey the 18th Amendment. [\\"Loyalty\\" may be the opposite of \\"professionalism\\".] In the 1930s Deputy Sheriffs were hired if they were good with a gun, but they don't tell you this. A personal introduction led to Clyde Tolson's hiring. [No mentions of Hoover's Masonic lodge.] Can they create a `confidential file' on powerful people? We see how he uses these secrets to influence RFK! Hoover chooses fine suits to be well-dressed and impress people. In 1930 (the Great Depression) there was the Kansas City Massacre, where police were killed to free a gangster. Hoover warned about \\"Public Enemies\\".<br /><br />\\"The Most Famous Manof the 20th Century\\"? The Lindbergh Baby was kidnapped in 1932. Lindbergh trusted the local police rather than the FBI. Hoover asked for a Central Registry for Fingerprints, and armed agents who could make arrests. Hoover had a file on Eleanor. Lindbergh put his trust in criminals to solve the kidnap. [These had \\"lines of information\\".] Questioned Document Examiner Osborne identified ransom notes. J. F. Condon delivered the ransom money to a man in a cemetery. Hoover meets the new President and gets new powers to investigate without a warrant! Tolson is the new #2 man. The discovery of a child's body tells about the missing baby.<br /><br />Hoover sought scientific experts in various fields to staff the FBI Lab. \\"But did he ever make an arrest personally?\\" No. We see Hoover's jealousy against Melvin Purvis. So Hoover goes on actual raids to arrest criminals. [Does the president of General Motors work on an assembly line?] Hoover obtains a letter from Lorena Hickok to Mrs. FDR! Hollywood movies popularize G-Men. Shirley Temple kisses Hoover in public. We hear about a \\"daffodil\\". The ransom money is traced back to store owners in the Bronx. There is a license plate number. Hauptmann was arrested, they had forensic agents for the trial. Hoover is first to learn about the shooting of JFK, and he calls RFK.<br /><br />Hoover attended a racetrack. [Did he get tips on fixed races?] Hoover spends week-ends in New York. [He collected on an expense account but was not charged!] How real is that argument with Tolson? Tolson had a stroke, Hoover needs to lose weight. Hoover plans to attack a Nobel Peace Prize winner with an anonymous letter. [Didn't he use a top agent for this?] We see the trial of Hauptmann again. [Did he do it alone?] Hoover sees MLK as the \\"greatest domestic threat\\"! The scene of Hoover putting on a dress is unbelievable! The election of Hoover marks a new era. [and a threat to Hoover's power]. Hoover wants his private files destroyed when he is gone. Nixonwants more wiretapping, he is a menace to Hoover. Is it time to retire? Did Hoover grab the glory from other agents? Tolson tells the truth about Hoover!<br /><br />[The ending seems worse than the rest of the movie, but that seems to be deliberate.] \\"Goodnight.\\" Miss Gandy gets a phone call and goes about her business. Nixon is told about Hoover's death. \\"I want those {expletive deleted} files!\\" [But he didn't get them!] Nixon delivers a tribute. [What was he really like? Read \\"Nixon's Darkest Secrets\\".] Gandy shredded the \\"Private and Confidential Files\\" and their contents will never be known. \\"Only a few misfiled items have ever surfaced.\\" Clyde Tolson inherited Hoover's estate. They are buried in the Congressional Cemetery, in separate plots. \\"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover\\" was a better movie and history. Curt Gentry's biography is the better book. There are books that question the guilt of Hauptmann. At least one other tried to defraud the Lindberghs by making a false claim for the ransom money. The dark tones of many of the scenes detracts from the story. This movie is an argument for an age and term limit.<br /><br />Like other Eastwood films this movie runs on too long with too little. It could use better editing. Or it could have included more historical scenes from Hoover's life. From the Civil War to the 1930s the Secret Service (as its name implies) was in charge of Counter-Intelligence. Their investigation of Teapot Dome led to the conviction of a Senator and Congressmen. Congress retaliated by cutting their budget and reassigning Counter-Intelligence to the FBI. Hoover realized the way to protect himself and his agency was to gather up the dirty secrets of Sentors and Congressmen to forestall any attacks. Business as usual? FDR loved to hear dirty secrets gathered by Hoover (so did LBJ). Hoover's powers were mostly gained while FDR was in office.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Yes that's right, this book is romantic. It starts off and continues throughtout most of ths story as a woeful tale of how much Rachel has messed up her life due to her drug addiction. Which is why she is now involuntarily receiving help for her addiction. But by the end of the book the love she has lost then refinds is almost so real that it made me cry, proving that sometimes if someone loves you they never stop loving you.
B0072440OE|5.0|I absolutely love this album!  The production is what you would expect from Danger Mouse and the lyrics are dark and almost emo but I like the change.

Norah I love ya and can't wait to see you or tour!!<br /><br />Oh and I was totally impressed with the vinyl package. The double white LPs are awesome and the poster is perfect.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Blade Runner is a great movie.  Unlike a lot of movies, though, it's not the kind of film you can just put in and sit back to watch.  It's not raw entertainment.  It's slow and doesn't have as much action as some things might lead you to believe.  The film really wants you to think instead.  It's one of those kinds of movies that asks a lot of questions but rarely gives you the answer.  So you definitely have to be in the right mood to watch it.  When you're there, though, it's quite a powerful film.<br /><br />Fortunately, the collector's edition comes with a few cuts of the film (legacy of the film's troubled development).  A few people might enjoy the original theatrical release a bit more because it adds noir-style narration that explains a lot of things you'd be otherwise left to interpret on your own.  On a personal level, I prefer the latest 2007 \\"Final Cut\\" as I think it makes the strongest statement, even if it makes the movie less \\"casually watchable.\\"<br /><br />It's not the kind of movie everybody's going to want on their shelves but it is incredible and, when you really get into it, it's easy to see why it was so incredibly influential on the genre.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I love this product.  I used it for my i7 and AMD CPU.  It comes with thermo paste so you don't have to buy your own.  The ability to add an extra fan is always nice.  It works and it is reliable.  Strongly recommended.

0345803485|1.0|Reading the excerpt from this book which included some so called intimacy left me cold. There was no sensuality, no real eroticism. I didn't feel any attraction or sexual tension between the characters that led to them coming together. I could tell this guy was a calculating stalker, an emotional abuser. I have to laugh but to call this an erotic novel is an insult to great writers out there. Do your research and if BDSM is your thing, then read from the masters of it because not only do they deliver on the BDSM lifestyle but you actually get transported into it as well as the sensuality that goes along with it.<br />I will certaintly not waste my hard earned money on this one here. I know a good one when i read an excerpt. The writing is so mediocre a teen could have written this.  All these women going crazy over this mediocre BDSM wanna be lifestyle have obviously lived a very shallow sexual lifestyle to get this excited. When you have truly lived a sexual fantasy reading 50 shades of grey will leave you cold, not excited!

0143120530|5.0|Mr. Foer has written a very enjoyable book on the fascinating subject of memory and mnemotecnia. Not only is the subject fascinating, but it is very well written by a good writer that balances the deeper philosophical meanings of having a great memory with the lighter side of the geekish subculture of mnemonists (memory champions).<br />The book is remarkable because it straddles the worlds of academia and the scientific studies of performance and memory training, and the world of practical techniques, and of competing \\"mental athletes\\". The style used by Foer to explore these subjects and subcultures is one that I enjoy a lot, and is similar to the style used by writers like Neil Strauss in his books about pick-up artists and survivalists (see my review of Emergency): It consists of the writer immersing himself in the subculture he is writing about, and becoming an elite member of it. In the case of Strauss he became the world's best pick-up artist and then a top survivalist, and in the case of Foer, he became, from being a smart, but regular guy (by his own description, suffering the same malady that voracious readers like myself suffer from -we forget 80% of what we read, and wish we could just remember more-) to becoming the U.S. memory champion in just one year of studying the techniques and training for it(there is such a thing as memory championships, with multiple events, in which competitors perform astonishing feats of memory).<br />The book won't teach but a few techniques, which I suspect won't do you any good unless you actually practice them (like reading a book about marathon training won't help you run a marathon, unless you actually go out and train), but it is, ultimately, an optimistic book about how by pursuing simple principles and a rigorous practice, very quickly you can become an elite participacnt in some valuable disciplines. It gives us, life-long learners, some hope: if you can learn to memorize three decks of cards in 5 minutes, then you sure can become proficient at many skills.<br />A last point I want to make about good writing is that Mr. Foer is the younger brother of another Foer who wrote one of my favorite books: Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close. I discovered this later, searching online for some of the very interesting characters in the book (including the author). Good writing runs in the family.sure can become proficient at many skills.<br />A last point I want to make about good writing is that Mr. Foer is the younger brother of another Foer who wrote one of my favorite books: Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close.

B0077ATSZE|5.0|I waited what seemed like forever to see this. It was well worth the rental. I couldn't believe that the kid had never been in a film before.  His portrayal of a kid with mental health issues and the loss of a father was so intense to watch.  At first I we so irritated by his behavior then when he stated what was happening in his head, it was obvious.  Simple put a  beautiful rendation on trauma and recovery.  I hope students study this in college.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Last December, my friend's daughter was wrapping a book for a Christmas gift for her brother. It was volume one of \\"the Game of Thrones.\\" I asked her about it and she asked if I liked fantasies. I said that I did and I immediately ordered the book. I tore through it and ordered the second volume. I'm halfway through volume 5 (which as yet to be released here, but I bought it from India. When the DVD set finally came out, I put off watching it until I read all the books. Finally, I just couldn't wait. I watched the first two episodes, back-to-back, and was enthralled. The production is superb, as is the acting. It's every bit as good as the books. It's only 8pm... I have time for another episode. I can't wait for the Second Season! This is a modern masterpiece. Highly recommended!

1451629184|5.0|I am so impressed with Dugard!  We all know her story and probably have the same questions: why didn't she run when she finally started being given some freedom after years of captivity, how could her existence in a sex offender's backyard go undetected for 18 years, how did she get away, and how are she and girls coping now?  And for me, this book provided most of those answers, although not in a straightforward way.  In fact, I doubt a straightforward telling would have answered the first question at all, because most of us will have no experiences we can use to compare with hers.  Instead, she uses multiple small chapters to highlight the main events she recalls, as she remembers experiencing them, interspersed with reflections on her memories from today's viewpoint.  There are also journal entries which add to the overall sense of sharing how her inner life changed over the years.  I picked the book up to read about how she's doing since being freed, and ended up reading the whole book in a few hours.  I simply couldn't put it down.<br /><br />If you read this, start on the very first page, the \\"author's note\\".  Every single page is worthwhile, even the acknowledgements at the end.  Most important of all, though, is Dugard's warning in the introduction: \\"My goal is to inspire people to speak out when they see that something is not quite right around them.  We live in a world where we rarely speak out and when someone does, often nobody is there to listen.  My hope is that society changes in regards to how we treat someone who speaks out....For many, it is so much easier to live in a self-made 'backyard' that it can be tough and scary to venture out and leave that comfort zone behind.  It is so worth it, though.  You could be saving a person or a family who is not able to save themselves.\\"

B007J4T2G8|3.0|**SPOILER ALERT**** Am I the only person that thought this book was a total rip off of the Twilight books (w/o the vamps)? Hmmm, let's see, there is the impossibly beautiful man. Clumsy girl who thinks she is nothing special. Said girl has a flaky mother on a third marriage, who tends to move around, but the girl is close to her \\"Dad\\". Girl has a male best friend that the beautiful man has a problem with b/c the best friend has a crush on her. Impossibly beautiful man has more $$ than God (but of course the girl doesn't CARE about the money or want his expensive gifts). Beautiful man makes waitresses blush and stutter and also is a great pianist. Beautiful man is possessive to the extreme and has a low self-esteem, feeling like he is bad or evil. Which book has all of the above? BOTH! Then throw in the Miss Steele/Mr. Gray talk when they want to keep some distance from one another (Karen Marie Moning Fever series, anyone?\\") The only difference between the two series is that in Twilight, Edward introduces Bella to the world of the paranormal, and in this, Christian introduces Ana to kinky sex. Otherwise it is a parallel and Ana is almost less likable than Bella, as she is not a well rounded character at all.<br />Overall, a nice, mindless entertaining read, don't expect pulitzer prize priting here. Some grammar mistakes and the constant use of \\"Inner goddess\\", \\"subconscious\\" and the smirking and lip biting is distracting from the story itself.<br />After friends and family raved over it, I knd of expected more. But like I said, it is entertaining enough if you don't have super-high expectations in your novels (I usually don't. I like to simply be entertained.)
1451627289|4.0|Two things you need to know about me: first, I admire the hell out of Stephen King. I can think of very few writers, living or dead, that capture the essential nature of humans better than he does. No matter how fanciful the story, he never, NEVER forgets that he is writing about human beings: they speak, act,and react in a very realistic manner. They are never pure saints or pure sinners. They are HUMAN, and damn the consequences if you don't like to see characters act in a natural fashion.<br /><br />Thing number two that you need to know is that I'm honest. I don't candy coat, though I do know when it's best to be politic.<br /><br />So here goes.<br /><br />I didn't care for Mr. King's last novel, \\"Under The Dome\\". It's not too much of a stretch to say that it bored me. I still liked his characters, but the story needed a good editing, frankly. As a result, I put off reading this book for months, a little afraid that it would be two clunkers in a row, and I would have to go into \\"he's lost his mojo\\" mourning (like I have for Larry McMurtry). I was also hesitant because of the announced subject matter. I'll be a little more honest: I'm sick to death of reading about Vietnam and cynical about Kennedy worship, both factors that have figured heavily in the later works of many of my favorite authors (people shaped by their college age experiences in the 60s and early 70s). I was born in the very late 60s, so these themes don't really resonate with me. I had an expectation of a bombastic novel that hammered away at both of these themes.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" was a lovely story. Of course, it's stated right on the jacket that the story is about a man who travels back in time to try to stop the Kennedy assassination, in hopes of creating a better today; King gives us that, but so much more. Instead of the political bombast that I expected, he's given us a small story about a man who finds himself in a time long before his own. The prevention of the assassination is always there, of course; it is on the surface the story's raison d'etre. However, it is secondary to the story of the life Jake lives in the years leading up to his big move.<br /><br />Comparisons can be drawn to Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\", and we all know how screwing around with time usually ends, but I found myself thoroughly charmed by the protagonist, Jake, and indeed with all of his supporting characters. Surprisingly, even Lee Harvey Oswald gets a better than usual novelistic shake. He is by no means a hero, but the reader can find a modicum of sympathy for him. I enjoyed the way the past is evoked without worship (though depictions of how hard it could be for some are admittedly slight. Still, it is one, educated man's story, not the story of a time). I found myself smiling often, in tears more than once, and thoroughly engrossed at all times.<br /><br />There isn't much to criticize here. I noticed one place where the story started to drag, but it was over so quickly that I can't even remember at what point I noticed the effect. I'm unsure about the visit of some characters from an earlier book (not saying which one). Though I did enjoy seeing them again, I couldn't decide if it added to or distracted from this story, if only because I found myself thinking about the earlier book and neglecting the one in my hand for quite a while.<br /><br />At 842 pages (849 with the afterword, which I ALWAYS read in a King book--some of his most wonderful thoughts come in the forewords and afterwords of his books)this is a big book... but it felt shorter. I rarely have much time to read these days (getting ready to pub my own book-lol), but I read this one in two days. If you like early-ish King (think \\"It\\", \\"The Talisman\\"), this book will be your cup of tea. He's left behind some of the... older man nostalgia, I think is the best term... of the last few novels and recaptured a sort of softer wide-eyed innocence of the earlier books. He hasa better feeling for loss and grief now, though, and he's used his experience to craft some very realistic scenes...and that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />Well worth a read. I'm sorry I waited so long.a better feeling for loss and grief now, though, and he's used his experience to craft some very realistic scenes...and that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />Well worth a read.

B001NA6096|5.0|I (almost) love this movie. While I agree with most of the reviewers who comment on its romantic nature,at the same time, I think most miss the point. For me, the beauty of the movie is the suggestion of the fact that romance, by its very nature, is ephemeral. Romance exists only as a concept, any attempt to ground it in reality must ultimately end in failure. The final scenes, which are a revisiting of the sites of earlier scenes, serve to underscore this. Kudos to the writer, Mr Linklater.

This book is about a sex trade, and rape. the Psych, on dr. oz said everyone has rape fantasies! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!? I can't believe that women would even think rape is sexy. Bondage is sexy and kinky part of sex. but it is not rape! and nothing like it. This book is disgusting and I cannot believe so many people think it is \\"empowering\\" shame on you for writing this......

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have always admired those that could make the difficult decisions, even if it meant condemnation and possible suffering.  We saw this from the first book, Katniss's ability to do what was right without flinching and with great self sacrifice.  And we saw it at the end, when Katniss threw away what could have been a life of celebrity status, in order to stop the continuous killing and sacrifice of young people.  She helped change the course of her people's human evolution.  I keep remembering in the second book when Haymitch told Katniss to never forget who the enemy was.  At the time, it was easy to think one-dimensional and view President Snow as the enemy, for he was the one who commissioned the Hunger Games.  But the enemy was bigger than that.  So I am extremely satisfied in that even if it took till the end for Katniss to come to grips with it, she realizes that her purpose isn't about seeking revenge, it's about stopping what's wrong.  A lot of people died in this book. Katniss makes their deaths mean something!<br /><br />A true leader is one that is never looking for what's in it for them.  That was Katniss's strength in Book 1, in Book 2, and even more powerfully in Book 3.  I thought is was a very happy ending.  I actually went back and read it a couple times in that I was extremely pleased.  I was left with hope, both for Katniss and for the people of Panem.  And as a father, I think Katniss's father would have been extremely proud of her.  She was the warrior leader that her people needed.  And the life she thought would never be possible for her, became so.

1439102732|4.0|Jodi Picoult tackles gay rights, a controversial subject, in her latest novel. Zoe, a music therapist, has just suffered a stillborn birth. This is another tragedy in the midst of infertility treatments, miscarriages and financial and mental stress. Her husband, Max can not handle anymore and asks for a divorce after Zoe announces she wants to \\"keep trying.\\"<br /><br />Zoe, then meets Vanessa and is comes as the biggest surprise of all to her when she discovers she is falling in love with a women. Eventually Zoe and Vanessa want to use the frozen embryos from Zoe and Max to start a family of their own. However, Max is now a part of a deeply religious church group who decide to support Max in his quest to retain custody of the embryos. What follows is a battle between two groups at odds with each other.<br /><br />I thought the story was pretty good. It was interesting to see how the story would play out in the courtroom. I would have liked to see how Lucy's story ended, that was left pretty unresolved. But the story was moving and kept me wanting to read more.

I've tried multiple times to add friends but it either tells me I need to update or that I'm not connected. both cases I am connected or ill say yes to update and it just circles back to first screen.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I purchased the DVD set, and I received it a day earlier than expected.  The DVD set contains 5 DVDs, and each worked perfectly.  Each DVD was free of scratches, and there were no playback issues at all.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Great story line and epic.  The story is very engaging.  Production is superb.  It could've been 5 stars but there were too much unnecessary sex and nudity, hence, 4 stars.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It told an engaging story of a future world where skills of primitive existence play a major part in the outcome of a contest of great importance.  It moves at a brisk pace and the contest end is quite horrific.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is a delightful movie and I enjoyed it for so many reasons. First, as an author myself, I could completely understand how the characters came to life in Miss Potter's mind and how she loved to tell the stories of each character. Secondly, this movie contained all of the elements of a great story: romance, drama, and a bit of humor.<br /><br />Miss Potter is based on the life story of author and artist Beatrix Potter, known for her best-selling \\"Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" books. Having a gift for art since she was a child, Beatrix continued to hone her talent and seek publication as an adult. However, as one from a wealthy and upstanding family in the early 1900s, Beatrix was expected to take a different route with her life - to marry, have children, and host social events in her fancy home. She, however, had a different dream - to see her stories published in book form.<br /><br />When Beatrix receives an acceptance from a large publisher, she is ecstatic. However, her mother is less than thrilled, and we see the conflict throughout the entire film. Her publisher assigns the publication of her books to the youngest brother of the owners of the company, a man named Norman, who is almost as excited as Beatrix is about her books. Will their partnership blossom into something more?<br /><br />This movie is appropriate for all ages, although those under 8 or so will not likely understand the story line and might become disinterested.  There is nothing objectionable in this movie, although there is an incident where Norman is less than honest when he slips a bit of brandy into the elderly governess' tea.  Spoiler alert - be sure to have a tissue box because there is an unexpected tragedy woven in the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, which contains a delightful story line,  a bit of wholesome romance,  and encouragement to follow your dreams. I have added this movie to my list of mom-approved movie reviews on my wordpress blog.<br /><br />Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of \\"McKenzie.\\"Penny Zeller, Author of \\"McKenzie.\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very addicting.  One of those that you start and just can't put down.  I ended up buying the next 2 books in the series and had them all read within 4 days.  I highly recommend them!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book was pretty funny, laugh out loud funny in some parts! She is so smart, and I liked how she complemented the people she's worked with. It's a very honest book. I recommend it!
B007X15GRQ|1.0|I thought since this was advertised as an \\"action\\" movie that there would be some actual action and suspense. But, no. It was LAME and I DO NOT recommend watching it.<br />waste of time.
B007X10OLE|3.0|I realise that I should be looking for quality and not quantity, but this is just too short.<br /><br />What is there is good, but at 42 minutes for $12.00 (mp3 download) it seems to be a rip off.<br /><br />Presumably disc 2 will be out next, with the other songs that were not included on this one.<br /><br />Not impressed after waiting so long for it to appear.<br /><br />And also not impressed that the DeLuxe edition has extra songs on it, and at the time of writing, Amazon are not offering that version.
B003CM368Q|5.0|Have a Toyota Solara convertible - talk about an old-guy, mid-life crisis boat - but with the Sound Racer, it sounds like it's gonna kick butt and take names.

0743277465|5.0|This is a good book on learning.  Just like study skills are essential for getting good grades in college, knowing how to learn is essential on learning new skills.  \\"The Art of Learning\\" is a rather fun book to read especially since I like martial arts.  In this case, the author discusses his experience in becoming a world class practitioner and competitor in Tai-Chi.<br /><br />Learning a skill requires focus and soundness of the mind.  It is as though everything is in slow motion.  This is conducive to learning and even mastering a skill.  That inner game that goes on between our ears needs to be settled and calm in order to achieve victory or in this case mastery.<br /><br />Yoga teaches about living in the present.  Learning is a skill that anyone and everyone should practice with astute and mental focus and calmness.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing story! simply put it is a must read for all sci-fi fans.  5 great books all in one edition
B004LROMSO|5.0|instead of following the story literally and in its deep fantasy setting like so many others, this show reinterprets it as a true legend.  like all myths the true story is a grim reality told through exaggerations and blatant lies for the purpose of propaganda.  STARZ's Camelot takes this into account tells a gritty version of king Arthur that's not epic or heroic (at least not in the typical way).  chivalry does not come easy to anyone and Arthur truly is just a boy manipulated by Merlin into a role that he may not be suited for.  It truly sucks that this show got cancelled but i guess if your going to label it Camelot, expect most intelligent fans not to give it a chance and the D&D nerds to get pissy because there are no hobbits.  the scene when Merlin gets Excalibur and then relays the story to the knights is the best example of how great this show could have been.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I just don't understand how a book this poorly written could be such a huge bestseller.  The diction was completely wrong for characters who were supposed to be Americans.  People raised in this country simply do not say, \\"I've not\\", they say, \\"I haven't.\\"  They say ass, not arse.  It's not that British diction is bad, it's just jarring when the setting's not in the UK and the characters aren't British.  I also couldn't understand what Christian saw in Anastasia.  She was insipid, not particularly bright, and unrealistically naive.  The whole story was pretty silly.  Finally, if I ever start another book that uses the phrase, \\"my inner goddess\\" again, I'll demand my money back.

If you think you know everything there is to know on the subject, I highly recommend you buy a copy ASAP.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I recently started watching the Spartacus season 2 and loved it, so I bought season 1 and the gods of the arena. I'm almost done with season 1 and I have loved every minute of it! The acting is pretty good and the storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat and ready for more. Fantastic series and I'm sad that the main character passed away before we could see more of his work. Definitely worth the money and amazon was great during the whole process.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not my usual kind of story or book, but out of complete curiousity I read the trilogy. The broader premise is interesting.  While the book is written in Ana's voice, the story is really about Christian, how his life evolved and led him to where he is, how his personality supports both his success and failure, and how he finds the self awareness to understand what he is, how he got that way and how he wants his future to be.  There is a real potential for themes of evil, obsession, power, control and redemption. In the hands of a much more skilled writer this could be an excellent story, but as written it gets buried in a lot of gratuitous and unnecessary sex (which she tries to make shocking but can't quite bring herself to really follow through on to seal the deal on just how damaged and violent Christian can be.) If the author doesn't know how to resolve a situation or end a chapter, they have sex.  Unfortunately, the writing is not up to the themes available in this book and it ends up being too many plot devices and not enough development.  The epilogue is really poor as it ends everything with a fairly simplistic \\"happily ever after\\" not appropriate to or supported by the story.  The appended chapters written in Christian's voice are really unnecessary, written simply to try (unsuccessfully) to shock but they do give a hint of how much better the books would have been if the writing had been done in both his and her voices.<br />I understand the movie rights have already been bought.  I'm hoping a good producer, director, writer and actors can make this story what it could be instead of settling for what it is, and not just about \\"rough\\" sex.
B004HW7JMY|4.0|I had started to watch Spartacus season 2 and liked it so much I decided to purchase the first season and the gods of the arena. I loved this series-the storyline is excellent and the acting isn't too bad either. Definitely worth buying and very pleased with amazon throughout the process.
B005K2YZ5E|4.0|Its exactly as advertised. It could do with an additional section for the cord but overall for $20 its a great deal.
B006FS22Y8|4.0|As much as her personal life was out of control, her voice was the opposite. Such a unique \\"throw back\\" sound for this day and age, and very much in control. This album is worth listening too...even if you weren't a big fan, simply for the melody she was able to create.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story! Couldn't put the book down. Ordered the following book immediately in the series. Good story for all ages.

B007MC868M|5.0|Reason for Reading: Next in the series.<br /><br />Wow!  I hardly know what to say about the 9th Harry Hole book.  It is dark, gritty and goes to depths of unbelievable character with the main character in this series.  The story is action-packed, full of twists, and shocker upon shocker, one of which will leave you numb; it is so unexpected and incredible.  This book is equal parts personal story and the actual mystery case.  They are so intertwined that it's impossible to separate the two.  DO NOT read this book, if you have not read any other Harry Hole books.  These books are recommended to be read in order as Harry develops as a character and his life is part of  a continuing story that runs through the books.  That said I haven't read two of the earlier books, or the two not yet released in English, The Bat is coming in Oct 2012 to the UK (which means Canada, too!) but my recommendation is that at least \\"The Snowman\\" onwards must be read in order or you'll miss a great connection between the storylines.<br /><br />This book is just absolutely fantastic.  At just over 450 pgs, I had the book read in 2 days because I just could not put the thing down.  If you are a Harry Hole fan, get yourself caught up with the series and READ THIS BOOK!  Tremendous!  Very dark throughout with a dark ending but this is what Harry Hole fans expect.<br /><br />Looking at Nesbo's website, he doesn't have any new titles in the works at the moment but fortunately, I have a few back titles left still to read and he has a few other books that have not been translated into English yet either including a short children's novel, a non-fiction title, and a short story collection (yes!).  Can we have these too please, Mr & Mrs Publishers?!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|super fun...! easy to get lost in a fury of mini games if you like any Mario games you will love this game'
0345803485|2.0|This book  is  trash.  All the hype  about it  is sooo over rated.  If  you're  interested in  kinky sex,  but are terribly  bored  by  almost  500 pages<br />of  nothing  BUT  kinky  sex,  then  this  book is for you.  At  first  I was  wowed  by the  \\"uniqueness\\"  of  sexual  techniques  I'd  never  heard<br />of.  But  I had  to force  myself  to  continue -  if  only for  \\"educational\\"  purposes.  After  I finished,  I  threw it into someone else's  trash.  (If I died unex-<br />pectedly,  I didn't  even  want  it  to  be  found in my home.)  And  the ending was horribly disappointing.  This  book  could've easily  been condensed<br />to 150 pages,  it's  so  repetitive.  Save your money.<br />LH Neyland
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|as I said, getting more energy as I type only so I can go back and play this addictive game.  don't let the kids get a hold of it because they'll spend all the cash like my son did, LOL!
0345803485|2.0|I must say the only reason I decided to read this book was after I saw the Dr Oz show on this trilogy. The hype and the enthusiastic praise for this book being able to revive a 'woman's libido' and improve one's sex life got my attention.I think the book was overrated. I think by now the whole of America (and even the rest of the world perhaps) knows this book is on BDSM. I kept an open my when reading it.I am a kind of person who enjoys romance of ALL kinds. But this left me unimpressed. The 2 protagonists share nothing else more meaningful than sex. The zillion \\"oh my's\\" and talk of the 'inner sex goddess' started to get on my nerves when i completed about 200 hundred pages. I  am abandoning reading this after page 236. I skipped to the end to see if it gets any better or different from what any normal rational person would predict. The ending again boring, and somehow I felt no compassion or sympathy for the female protagonist Anastasia.  There wasn't much depth of storyline or good writing in it for me.

B005RJ6AIK|4.0|This is a great CD to get a taste of a variety of Hawaiian artists and their beautiful music.  A little too much Gabby and not enough Ozzie, but overall a delight to listen to.
B007R41E8O|5.0|hard to download but worth the time it took. great game and lots of fun. well worth the money.  easy five stars.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game had a chance to be good but they want too much money. When your character runs out of energy they want you to spend real money to buy energy but the real problem is that your energy does not last long at all.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm not an expert on BDSM so unlike others I cannot comment on that part of the story line. I feel the writing could have been better, I guess anything can get published. Some of the story was unbelieveable, how can someone get through college nowadays without a computer. As long as you don't have high hopes for the story line and writing, it should be enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good to play in school. quick and simple games. not boring at all. I recommend for people of all ages.
B0024CEY36|5.0|The Man From St. Petersburg is a wonderfully, excitng suspense novel with fast paced action and a gripping plot. Every character will draw you into their story. Even the villain is someone that you will relate to! This Follett novel is in the same genre' as Key to Rebecca, Jackdaws, Day of the Jackal etc. You will love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|more fun then a two ton woman in a hole filled with flower and then rolled down a hill ya ya ya
B000JML7EC|4.0|Gotta love that Jack Hawkins kid. What a LUCKY boy. Long John shoulda been hanged though. If I had been that British Captain I know I would have been reprimanded at least for having had lost him and if Jack confessed to having had \\"let him go\\" then I would have seen to it that he paid the price in a jail cell with forfeiture of his share of the loot sending it (all 20 doubloons, hehehe) to the crown as a penalty for his treasonist act. GREAT BOOK, even without my addition to it &lt;grin>.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Brought this book and fell in love with it from the start and couldn't put down.  Enjoyed it so much I downloaded the other two and read them all in a weekend.  I hope she writes more.

0061928356|5.0|I loved this book.  It paints a picture of modern-day India that is heart-wrenching and beautiful.  I will certainly be looking for this author's next novel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. Very easy to use. The temp is accurate. Gives detail and long term forecast.<br />I use it everyday. No other app is better.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I seriously do not understand why this book is so popular.<br />This book is part erotica and part romance and does not do a particularly good job at both.<br /><br />While Christian, the male figure, is somewhat sexy it's the female character Ana whose characterization made me want to stick needles in my eyes.<br />Clearly, the author did not do much research or put much thought into what typical 21 year old AMERICAN girls are thinking/saying.<br /><br />The bizarre combination of constant italicized \\"Holy Crap!\\" and \\"Argh\\" (because, we all know when we lost our v-cards - a hearty, pirate-inspired 'ARGH!' was the first thing out of our mouths) juxtaposed against NEVER-used-in-the-American-vernacular \\"fetched\\" \\"proffered\\" and \\"shall\\" was so distracting I began to lose faith in my fellow Americans for enjoying this poorly written drivel.<br />Why Christian is so beside himself over heels over this weirdo is a little too much of a stretch. I can suspend my disbelief for a lot of things but to believe any girl like this could exist is beyond me.<br /><br />So, this Twilight-based erotica has it's \\"Edward\\" and it's \\"Bella\\" - so where's Jacob?<br /><br />Oh he's the almost offensively two dimensional Latino named - wait for it - Jose. He says \\"dios mio\\" a lot, just in case you forgot he is Latino. Seriously?<br /><br />The sex is ok but eventually is hitting you over the head with a mallet.<br />I am a huge erotica fan and the ONLY positive is that maybe this will help people open their minds to erotic fiction as a more mainstream form of fiction. But there is SO MUCH good (free) stuff out there on the internet that the success of this book is almost painful and extremely difficult to understand.
0345803485|5.0|This book was recommended to me.  I devoured the entire trilogy in just a few days, so excellent! It was great fun watching the characters grow and mature (and HOT).  I missed them when the story was over.
B007V9YF5E|4.0|'Haywire' is a fairly well made, female fighter flick!  We need more of those.  Furthermore, young teens can watch this film without polluting their minds with overt sexuality, bloody gore, and wincingly raunchy expletives every fives seconds.  Seriously, it's got more going for it than against as long as you're not looking for an Academy Award winning picture.  It's fun, thrilling, has great fight scenes that are fairly realistic and isn't so convoluted that you lose sight of the plot.<br /><br />I say give it a go for a great R&R with family or friends on a Saturday afternoon or evening.  Solid 3 1/2 Stars!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|People may be complaining, but it's  still an amazing game. Just like the other versions of Angry Birds, this one will be updated when new levels come out. Everyone whining about how short the game is should have waited until the developers at Rovio made more levels, not whine about how it doesn't have enough. With the new software to make the game, I'm surprised it's not taking longer. Overall great game, but not alot to do right now. Not recomended if you are very impacient...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not sure about the series with the bad reviews but after a friend told me she loved it and that i would to i got it. I started reading it and almost instantly fell in love with Christian, he can be over bearing at times but really he just needs the love and attention a good woman can give him. All three books are awesome and i would recommend them to anyone. i hate that they ended and hope she writes more. at times i did get frustrated with Ana but it is all good.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very fun game esp for a free app. Don't try to rip you of for paid extras to enjoy it either.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is my very first review on Amazon although I have purchased many, many books.  I read constantly, at least a book a week.  Well, I must admit that I fell into the trap of this book.  I started seeing it everywhere, facebook friends, online reviews, an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.  So I looked it up on Amazon.  Wow, over 2,000 reviews.  Must be good!  NYT bestseller list....that says something.  Amazon top 5....what am I missing?<br /><br />I read a couple of reviews on Amazon and poo pooed the negative ones.  After all, there are always some people who can't be pleased.  But this seemed like the new Hunger Games, the new Fire and Ice, the new Harry Potter.  OK...go for the trilogy, hit the quick buy kindle button and the three were mine.<br /><br />I settled in for what I thought would be a great read...one that would capture me from the beginning.  I was so excited as I flipped to page one, as I am with only a few books that promise to be great.  I began my journey into the Fifty Shades.<br /><br />OK, after 10 pages I thought, \\"it's only the beginning\\".  After 40 pages I thought, \\"It's gonna get better\\".  After 75 pages I began to wonder what I was missing.  And after 100 pages I thought \\"This can't be just me?\\".  I logged back onto to Amazon and started reading in earnest all the reviews.  Thank goodness there were many like me who could not understand the allure of this book.<br /><br />For anyone thinking of purchasing this book I would say think about these things.  Can you read a book that seems like it was written by a junior high school creative writing student?  Can you bear dialogue that is so sophomoric as to make you want to puke?  Can you stand characters that are so incredibly boring that you can't possibly be engaged by them?  Can you stand a story that goes nowhere fast?<br /><br />OK, in all honesty I couldn't finish the book.  It was too painful reading such trite dialogue and hoping against hope that something interesting and engaging might happen.  But 100 pages was enough.  I just kept thinking, \\"How in the world did this book ever get published?\\".  And then thinking, \\"I'm not a writer but if she could do it I certainly couldn't do any worse!\\"<br /><br />So readers....think before you leap.  Don't listen to the hype.  At least try a sample chapter.  If that grabs you, so be it.  If it doesn't, remember it gets no better.<br /><br />Kudos, though, to E.L. James for an astonishing coming out party.  Don't know how you did it, but please hook me up with your publisher.  I have a story I've been working on that I think he/she will really like!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Me Before You is such a wonderful read.  Many books, even best sellers, just don't seem to be so well crafted - this one is beautifully written yet still a page turner. Will make you laugh and cry - guaranteed.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|My pre-teen crush, former Beatle Sir Paul takes on standards. Bound to happen once Rod Stewart did it!  There is some truly fine musicianship here, especially guitar work, on this CD. It's the perfect accent for relaxing, romancing, having a fine glass of wine or a classy dinner party (does anyone do that any more?)<br /><br />Paul's voice is nice and light and easy. The orchestrations are lovely and not overbearing. He seems very at home doing standards and it just goes to show: standards ARE standards because they've stood the test of time. Like many of his compositions will (think Yesterday).<br /><br />Very enjoyable and delightfully recommended.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|wow is a great word for this game, its easy yet challenging its a great game for children my 5 year old nefeu love to play and its great for rlteens and adults.
B003KVNV4S|3.0|High Violet is the National honed to perfection and in their element.  If you are a fan, you will be a big fan of this one.  If (like me) you're struggling to know what all the fuss is about, you'll still struggle.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|All the reviews are right totally addictive game, hours of fun and would have given it 5 stars except it seems to freeze after awhile. this game is so much fun I will uninstall it and reinstall it just to play it just wont spend any money on it untill the glitches is fixed
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This is a great application only if you have Internet access all the time every where you go otherwise it doesn't work.  would be nice to at least access the Bible anytime and the extra features with Internet access.
0345803485|1.0|I am almost embarrassed to admit that I read this book to the bitter end.  I think I did so because, for me, reading the whole thing was akin to watching a mongoose dance around a cobra for hours and then finally go for the kill (the kill being the final realization, as I read the last word, that nothing out of the ordinary was actually going to happen).  Or watching paint become completely dry on a newly painted wall (the color of paint changes ever so slightly as it dries, but you still end up with the same color you started with).  However, I won't be reading the rest of the \\"trilogy;\\" mainly because I just don't give a hoot what happens to the any of the characters in this book (with the possible exception of Ana's mother and stepfather - their story might be interesting to read).<br /><br />This book evoked for me the notion of what a clumsy \\"almost\\" erotica version of Jersey Shores might look like - with a young, attractive, filthy rich, mentally and/or emotionally disturbed visiter (with a taste for fine wines) from across the country thrown into the mix.  I also hope never to use some of the most-repeated terms and phrases in this book again - my inner-goddess suggests to me that doing so would provoke associations with the characters that would just be too painful for me to deal with.<br /><br />I read some of the glowing reviews of this book (and other books in the series), and am happy for the joy this story seems to have brought to so many other readers.  The author and publisher will become richer for that fact; and in todays economy that is surely a good thing.  For my part, I didn't see this book as having an actual story in it, and am thrilled that I won't be \\"punished\\" for not reading two more books worth of the narrative.

B00729GQ0A|2.0|Well, The Forever Girl was better than Twilight. Unfortunately, that's really its strongest selling point. I didn't hate it. It simply wasn't anything special, and I probably won't be reading the next books in the series.<br /><br />I had some problems with Rebecca Hamilton's characters. Frankly, Sofia annoyed me. She had a few witty things to say occasionally, but for the most part, her sarcastic dialogue came off as whiny. The fact of her being Wiccan, the most prominent feature of her characterization, seemed thrown in as an afterthought, and wasn't all that crucial to the plot. From the start of the novel, Sofia is portrayed as a woman exiled from the approval of society, and a believer in the supernatural. Given this however, she takes a suspiciously long time accepting and becoming a part of the supernatural world. Even then her actions are only aimed at her own problems and protecting herself. On several occasions (and I'm being vague here to avoid spoilers, if you'd like more specifics, please ask me in a comment) I found of her assumptions and actions extremely selfish if not downright insulting. Otherwise she was bland and typical. Had these characters been placed in a high school setting, they would have easily fit in.<br /><br />The love interest Charles, was sadly only that, a love interest. If you removed the fact of his being ridiculously good looking and hopelessly in love, he has nothing left. Now I like picturing ripped, muscled guys with luxurious hair, swearing their eternal love as much as the next girl, but they have to have something else too! He was interchangeable with Edward. Just another extremely hot immortal who, for some reason is hopelessly in love with an (almost) teenage girl with no life experience and not much to say for herself.<br /><br />There was one side character I did like. Actually, only one, whose story had substance and real epic sadness. Unfortunately, her story was not well explored, and her character was treated, in my opinion, harshly and without any consideration of her feelings. The other side characters were all the typical stereotype villains or heroes as usual.<br /><br />As for the plot, it was predictable. Hamilton does have some imaginative ideas here, but it doesn't go beyond giving new but names to the old fantasy standbys. The setting wasn't particularly memorable. If I were a centuries old immortal with some serious magic, I wouldn't be hanging around dive bars in small town Colorado picking up girls barely out of high school if you know what I mean. It is clear however, that Rebecca Hamilton really did try with her writing style. Many of her descriptions were cleverly worded, and for a debut self-published author, it was a pretty good effort. Clearly some thought went into this.<br /><br />All in all, The Forever Girl is a fun read that may have had potential with a few more rewrites. Even though it isn't young adult literature per se because of the brief, tame sex scene, I would limit my recommendations for this book to those pursuing a high school education. My experience was similar to that of watching an old episode of Charmed. Simple, cute, fun, but ultimately forgettable.<br /><br />(Side Note: If you're reading The Forever Girl in the hopes that the beautiful cover art might have something to do with the story, you can forget it. It's completely irellevant)opinion, harshly and without any consideration of her feelings.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun. new adventures at every turn. keeps me playing for hours on end. definetly recomend this game
B007SGM084|2.0|I was all set to download this trilogy onto my new Kindle and realized it's just too much for an e-book.  I'm dying to read it, but 29.95 for an e-book? Really?
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I love this game on my kindle fire. I played it till like level 12 then it stopped playing. I could hit the option and other games button but the start game button wouldn't work. so disappointed.
B007SGM084|2.0|If I never hear those phrases again I'll be okay.  I will say that the first book was fine for me.  I was interested.  But by the second book it was all redundant.  Reading the same sex scenes over and over and over on every other page really took away from any plot these books could have had.  If she had taken out 3/4 of the redundant sex scenes, I think she could have had ONE fine book.  There was no need for three books in my opinion.  I cannot tell you how many times I began to roll my eyes.  \\"He touched my sex.\\"  Seriously?  I understand that the author is not American, but if the scenes are set in America with American characters, you'd think the author would at least study up some on some of the terminology.  Do people really say \\"He cupped my sex?\\"  Also, I found it laughable that this virgin became such an expert in the orgasm department that she was able to give multiple orgasms when told to.  I have to say I also felt really weird reading this as an adult.  The book itself read to me like a teenager's thoughts.  Not a twenty-something's.  So when I'm having to trudge through sex scenes where the character seems to think and act like she's 15 it was really kind of odd and weird. Also, the man is a billionaire.  Does he only have two outfits?  Was there really a need to constantly let us know what they were wearing?  I think her plum dress is probably worn out by now.  Does she not have any other clothes?  Also, the bit part in the last book about the kidnapping, etc.  That plot just seemed thrown in there to me.  It was almost like she was desperate to keep the books flowing, but lacked in the imagination department.  I honestly expected the book to finally end in the second book thinking it could have easily ended.  But it just kept going on and on.  Definitely was not worth the thirty dollars I paid for this series.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This book \\"stirred\\" my imagination, made me think, and will stick with me for a long time. The problem for me was the fact that it was a little too believable. Scary, but far-fetched? I'm not so sure! I think that there are those out there that would like to control our world...just think, no conflict on any level.(Now I'm sounding paranoid!) I  certainly don't mean to imply that I agree with the book, because I don't....but..well, food for thought. I didn't realize how far the control went until I got to the part about the colors. Wow! I thought at first that I didn't like the ending all that much...I like to have things spelled out for me. But, once again, the more I thought about it the clearer the final picture became. Really good read.
B007HO392S|5.0|The true mark of an extraordinary album is that when the listener experiences it from start to finish, he or she is taken on a journey through positive and negative stories and can feel the emotional connection behind each track. This is what Carrie Underwood accomplishes on 'Blown Away' - her latest, and greatest studio effort made possible by her collaboration with producer Mark Bright. While Underwood's three previous albums are all excellent in their own way, 'Blown Away' fully encompasses what the country superstar has been able to do in the short seven years since we were introduced to her.<br /><br />In true Underwood fashion, 'Blown Away' starts off with a bang on \\"Good Girl,\\" but instead of drawing from her past experiences (a la \\"Before He Cheats\\" or \\"Last Name\\"), she is positioned as a mentor giving advice to a girl who Underwood clearly identifies with. Interestingly enough, there are hardly any songs that sound similar to each other on 'Blown Away,' and so the album's other upbeat tracks do not follow suit, particularly the maniacally fun \\"Cupid's Got a Shotgun.\\" Instead, Underwood opts for a handful of mid-tempos and power ballads, alternating between traditional country and modern country themes.<br /><br />One aspect that 'Blown Away' has going for it is that a good number of its tracks are more serious, and as seen in their lyrics, cover somewhat darker topics than Underwood is used to. This is the case particularly on the title track (\\"There's not enough rain in Oklahoma to wash the sins out of that house / There's not enough wind in Oklahoma to rip the nails out of the past\\") and \\"Two Black Cadillacs,\\" which explores a funeral setting where a dead man's wife and lover both arrive in two black Cadillacs after plotting his death (\\"But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry\\").<br /><br />Still, there are some lighthearted tracks that provide balance, especially the sweet, sing-songy \\"Do You Think About Me,\\" the earthy, gritty \\"Love Leave Alone\\" and the Jimmy Buffet-esque \\"One Way Ticket,\\" which is an absolute must-be-released single. But the album's most overlooked track is probably \\"See You Again,\\" a rousing piece that was intended for the 'Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' soundtrack. While it is the most pop-friendly song on the album, Underwood's precious vocals fit the positive message and catchy chorus perfectly, and it does not sound out of place amidst the more country fare. The other more somber, serious offerings on 'Blown Away' - \\"Good in Goodbye,\\" \\"Forever Changed\\" and \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" - are all beautiful in their own right, with \\"Changed\\" being the most touching due to the subject matter, and \\"Whiskey\\" being the most radio-friendly of the bunch.<br /><br />While none of the tracks on 'Blown Away' are bad, there are a few that are more generic than the others, such as the na na na-filled \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" and the nice but slightly \\"been there, done that\\" \\"Thank God for Hometowns.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Underwood closes the album with the Mutt Lange-penned \\"Who Are You,\\" a powerfully belted ode to her faith, which is an excellent way to tie up any loose ends from earlier tracks.<br /><br />There are few artists out there that can be placed on the same pedestal as Carrie Underwood at the moment, and with the quiet confidence and humility displayed on 'Blown Away,' she continues to remind people of how despite al the success she's had, she's still the same personable girl from Checotah, Oklahoma.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I freely admit to loving this book - the whole trilogy in fact, but for me all the sex and BDSM stuff was just decoration and really not the point. I was drawn in by how very flawed Christian Grey is and wanting to know why, and then by the drama surrounding the couple.  I thought the whole BDSM thing was used as more of a device to show the difference between the two main characters personalities and exemplify Christian's inability to relinquish control in even his most personal relationships; more of a hallmark of Christian's \\"damage\\" than of being an Alpha Male. I also love Ana's quiet strength, she's clearly the stronger of the two in the pairing, but she doesn't need to be butt-kicking or super-high powered to be that.<br /><br />I think that if you're reading this book simply as erotica then you'll be disappointed because it's really more of a story of finding what you need in the person you'd least expect. The worst criticism I could make would be to say that the \\"healing power of love\\" theme is kind of cheesy, but sometimes we need a little cheese in our lives.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This film will be a classic, and will not go away in years. They should make a director's cut, but I think because the DVD is still selling very well the owners of this movie will not.
0345803485|1.0|I finally took out a pen and underlined the word \\"grin\\" every time it was used - sometimes 3 times on a page. As other reviewers have said, the writing and style is  painful.  The biting of the lower lip, the mouth forming a \\"hard line\\", and every thought ending with \\"he scowled\\", \\"he smiled\\", \\"he whispered\\"', \\"I grinned\\", \\"he grinned\\", ugh.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|My small book club chose Sarah's Key for our April selection. As retired teachers and librarians we were able to learn more about the round up and execution of the Jewish community. I did not know that Jews were rounded up in Paris. It frightens me that such history is not known and not taught. We liked the history and current telling of the story than came together at the end. Some of us knew Sarah committed suicide and others thought there was truly an accident. It is wonderful when a book evokes different emotions. As a follow-up, some of us heard a Holocaust survivor the next week! He also told stories that are not generally known or taught. His message was never forget, lest it could happen again.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I have been hearing lots of great things about Max Brooks and those praises have been growing a World War Z' prepares to launch in theaters. Being a zombie loving book nerd, I thought I'd check out the survival guide before I delved into 'Z'. I found this book amusing, it fit well with the logical notion of how 'real' people would live in the fight against the undead. We even have zombie threat levels. This book was made to be amusing in its How to information, and it is....for a while, then it gets a bit tedious, and redundant. Even through some of the tedium the book is still entertaining. I like the bit about serrated knives, the best, for some reason that just stuck out to me. You have to be a pretty hardcore zombie fiend to get through the book though. So casual zombie lovers might not really enjoy reading this survival guide.

B006ZZANG0|5.0|Listening to the opening pair of songs on Rufus Wainwright's new album \\"Out Of The game\\" and \\"Jericho\\", one could be forgiven for thinking this is seventies Elton John.<br /><br />The album is produced by Mark Ronson who brings his trademark lush horn-peppered sound on board, as well as a few guests, Wainwright's sister Martha, Sean Lennon, a few Dap-Kings, Wilco guitarist Nels Cline and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner.<br /><br />\\"Rashida\\" channels Queen. \\"Barbara\\" is groovy breezy seventies Soul. \\"Welcome To The Ball\\" mixes strings and horns charmingly against an ornate harmony backdrop. \\"Montauk\\" is a doleful ballad, followed by the gently pulsing \\"Bitter Tears\\" (with a lovely wall of harmonies), the slow shuffle of the Country-tinged \\"Respectable Dive\\", the upbeat Funky \\"Perfect man\\", the ruminative acoustic \\"Sometimes You Need\\", the Blues/Pop ballad \\"Song Of You\\", and the closing epic ode to his late mother \\"Candles\\", almost hymnal in parts with sprinklings of accordion.<br /><br />A charming collection of songs that grow and grow with repeated listening. Should broaden his fan base introducing more to his spectacular tenor.
0312588887|5.0|I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I loved it! I have since reread it, and plan to do so again. I fell in love with the main character, her many strengths, and her honor.<br />I was delighted with the follow up books in this series. Of all the books I've read, this one stands forever as my favorite! Barbara Taylor Bradfor, thankyou for such a wonderful book, and series!
B00723NWJE|5.0|\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" finds Norah Jones pairing once again with Brian \\"Dangermouse\\" Burton. The pair had previously worked together on 2011's cinematic \\"Rome\\" (which also featured White Stripe Jack White).<br /><br />Opening cut, the twinkly lullaby-like \\"Good Morning\\" isn't far off from her earlier stuff, a comforting introduction. \\"Say Goodbye\\" is when things start to sound different. It's a groovy number with choppy beats. The title track is a moody number with quivery guitars.<br /><br />The lyrics are built around moribund relationships and heartbreak, hence the album title. The melancholic \\"She's 22\\" finds her asking \\"Does she make you happy?\\", \\"Take It Back\\" is a haunting acoustic number, while the spectacular \\"After The fall\\" is Dub with shifting beats and is a perfect showcase of both Jones and Dangermouse.<br /><br />Everything is brilliant really; the cinematic \\"4 Broken Hearts\\", the spare \\"Travelin' On\\", the upbeat Americana \\"Out On The Road\\", the Country/Pop \\"Happy Pills\\", \\"Miriam\\" which finds Jones menacingly singing \\"I'm gonna smile when I take your life\\" over strumming guitars as she threatens the woman that snatched her man. Closing is the groovy bass-heavy \\"All A Dream\\" with a spaghetti western-style guitar solo, a carry over from \\"Rome\\", perhaps.<br /><br />Heartbreakingly beautiful! Oh, and the cover art is my favourite so far this year...

1439127700|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book. I had read he authors book on Billy Graham and thought this would be a treat. Boy, was I wrong. The book has hundreds of pages about Richard Nixon and is an apology tour for Bush 41. Read Richard Ben Cramer for the real scoop on Bush 41. The assault on President Carter is a disgrace. Barely any mention(or no mention) of the long list of great work done. Not one sentence about the one man defeat of Guinea Worm and River Blindnes. The greatest of all post presidents deserved better than this hit job! The authors should be ashamed of themselves but shame rarely makes into the Beltway media elite.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|A not so great remake of the Alec Guiness/LeCarre classic, I did not enjoy this at all. Dialog is murky, hard to follow, acting leaves much to be desired. Stay with the original.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Bought this book the other day, after hearing about it on a forum post,comparing it to 50 Shades....Well, it was not money wasted!  I could barely put it down, and was rooting for the characters the whole way.  Evas' roommate, Cary, is an interesting character, as are most of the others.  I can't wait for the sequel!
0439023521|4.0|It's not that I fell victim to the hype; \\"The Hunger Games\\" was recommended by a coworker at least a couple of years back - the recent release of the film is what moved it up on my reading list. The story represents for me something of a parallel universe that takes Reality TV to the next level.  It reads like a fusion of sci-fi adventure and romance, neither genre alone is typically enough to draw much interest from me; but the subtext, as I read it, provided a much richer experience of the story.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking about the similarities between \\"The Games\\" and the Reality TV show, \\"Survivor\\".  Both are televised events featuring contestants (tributes) who compete for a prize (fame and fortune) by voting off all other competition (or killing them).  Through this lens, the story becomes a cautionary tale warning us of the dangers of a society desensitized to violence; where viewing the most atrocious scenes of human debasement becomes entertainment for the nation. Where the manipulation of human emotion - by The Gamemakers (entertainment industry) and tributes (the romance back-story of Katniss and Peeta or any number of \\"Survivor\\" contestants who've manipulated fellow players to stay in the game) - is commonplace; expected even and ultimately, if you're really good at it, rewarded with the prize. Today's prize is a million dollars and the potential to earn more if your celebrity status is sealed due to a particularly vile form of manipulation and cruelty.  Some years from now, the prize could be your life.<br /><br />The potency of the former statement is magnified when I recall my feelings towards one of this season's \\"Survivor - One World\\" contestants. While I don't recall the guy's name; I clearly recall his persona and particular brand of cruelty. A young, privileged, southerner and - by all indications of how he played the game - well versed in the ways of subjugation and manipulation to get what he wants; to win. During a tribal counsel; he attacked a fellow contestant with the most despicable assaults to the other guy's profession (a comedian), economic status (underemployed, barely making it - could really use a million dollars!) and character (called him lazy, needing to get a \\"real job\\"). His tone was sharp, sassy even; condescending and belittling beyond the point of cruel and rife with racial stereotype. In the following episode, he fell ill with appendicitis. I relished in his pain; told myself I could care less if he died and in that moment realized the failure of my humanity.  In that moment, I was one of the people from the Capitol.<br /><br />Both stories will forever be connected in my memory, the preferred being Collins' imagined portrayal of the ultimate survival game.  Her writing is accessible and efficient - perfect for a teen/young adult read - while well paced and sufficiently nuanced (there are elements of government control, genetic engineering and social repression here as well) for a broader audience.  Although I don't plan to watch another episode of \\"Survivor\\", I'm sure to read the next installments of Collins' trilogy; imagined, fictional cruelty is much more entertaining than the real life version.

B00656C6KK|2.0|It's the dawn of a new Day. And we're pretty scared. Now, please: We love Doris Day. She was the one who told us that \\"four-legged animals are so much nicer than the two-legged ones.\\"<br />  The last time we spoke was on January 28, 1986, the day the space shuttle Challenger crashed, and she was sobbing uncontrollably.<br />  The last time we were in Carmel, we saw her sprawling \\"house\\" was from the local golf course (I am not saying which hole gives the best view), and even spotted Doris in her station wagon lugging her dogs into town.<br />  Then . . . nothing.<br />  For years, nothing.<br />  When she won a lifetime achievement Grammy award in 2008, she refused to attend the ceremony.<br />  Now there's news that Doris will release a new album of original material this fall called My Heart. The record will be her first CD in 17 years (and her 29th original recording), and will include four new compositions, three rock \\"reworks\\" and several classic Day standards. Somehow she got Beach Boyer Bruce Johnstown to get involved; before his death in 2004, Day's son Terry Melcher produced several of Mommy's new tracks including \\"Happy Endings.\\"<br />  Gulp.<br />  \\"These songs all mean so much to me,\\" Day coos. \\"They bring back happy memories of my friends who appeared on TV with me, my animal friends and most of all, my son Terry.\\"<br />  Sorry, but Day \\"singing\\" rock and roll at 87 sounds a bit scary. We heard she's a bit gaga, so does this make her the original Lady Gaga?

Supposedly she became prime minister only due to her stubborn bullying during a backlash against the labor and liberal parties.  It's obvious these filmmakers hate her with a passion.

B003XT60KO|5.0|Amazingly prophetic book.  Could have been written yesterday.  So far, a very educational read.  I can see why so many people are recommending this book.
B0079IEPHA|2.0|I absolutely love Suits. It's funny, clever, heartfelt, and its characters are vividly written and portrayed. The two leads have amazing chemistry, the women on the show are stronger characters than you often see on TV, and Rick Hoffman does not get the credit he deserves for his work as Louis, believe me.<br /><br />But this DVD is useless. I'm unsure if it's a defect or some DRM lockdown, but the DVD refuses to play on a computer. There's no autorun program to unlock it either. So I bought this for nothing and will be returning it until a more functional format is available.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because I hear the commentary tracks are genuinely fascinating.

B000VD5I94|5.0|This isn't going to be an 02 in film or a 20 years ago review. I'm going to review The  Robocop movies. I reviewed all 3 on my old account but I didn't give them the treatment they deserved particularly 1 & 2 & The Prime Directives which I'll finally review. Released in 1987 directed by Paul Verhoven he directed Total Recall, Starship Troopers & Hallowman. Stars Peter Weller as Alex Murphy & Robocop, Nancy Allen as Officer Ann Lewis, Kurtwood Smith as Clerance Bodicker, Ronny Cox as Dick Jones, Mingel Ferrer as Bob Morton, Robert DoQui as Sergent Warren Reed & Daniel O'Herilihy as The Old Man. The story is Detroit has a high crime rate the cause is Clerance Bodicker a crime boss pretty much runs things & he is protected by Dick Jones an executive of OCP Omni Consumer Products. OCP is now running The Detroit PD & a Cop Alex Murphy has been transfered to Metro West headed by Sergent Warren Reed. He is given Officer Ann Lewis as partner. OCP is trying to find ways to rid the city of crime. Dick Jones unveils ED 209 an enforcement droid. Unfortantly it messes up & shoot this executive to s  h  i  t it's extended in the unrated version. Bob Morton a rival to Dick Jones asks The Old Man the go ahead on The Robocop project. Then you have Lewis & Murphy respod to a call Clerance Bodicker & his gang have robbed a bank. You get a well done car chase scene. Murphy shot 1 of the gang members in the leg Clerance asks \\"Can you fly Bobby!?\\" They toss him out. Murphy & Lewis continue their pursuit they follow them to an abandoned Steel Mill. They split up to to go after Clerance's gang. Lewis runs into this guy taking a leak she tells him he's under arrest he says \\"Mind if I zip this up?\\" He knocks her out. Murphy is about to make an arrest but he's cornered by Clerance's men. Clerance comes in beats him down & shoots his hand it's blown off. It is very gorey back then & now. Clerance says \\"We'll give the man a hand!\\" The gang take their automatic weapons & shotguns & riddle Murphywith bullets. The rated version of this is gorey even. They try everything at the hospital but Murphy dies. Later on Robocop is created he has 3 directives serve the public trust protect the innocent & uphold the law. So at the police shooting range Officer Lewis notifies that Robocop has some of the same characteristics as Alex Murphy. Robocop is going around & cleaning up the streets. He starts to have flashbacks using the police computer he finds out that he was Alex Murphy & he goes after the people that killed him. He goes after 1 of them at a gas station & another at a night club. Then he goes after Clerance Bodicker he busts into a dr  u  g lsb he runs & he lets the secret out that he works for Dick Jones. Jones hired Bodicker to kill Bob Morton cause Robocop is taking care of the crime in Detroit & ED 209 is going to be cancelled. So Robocop is going to arrest Jones but he informs him of Directive 4 he can't arrest a member of OCP. Then ED 209 attacks him & Robocop makes his way outside where a SWAT Team fires at him Lewis manages to get him out of there. Jones gets Bodicker out of jail he tells Clerance that Robocop needs to be destroyed. He lets Clerance & his gang have Cobra Assault Rifles. Robocop is at The Old Steel Mill where he was killed Lewis tells him his wife & son moved. Bodicker tracks Robocop to where he is at. Then you get a shoot out with Murphy & Lewis taking on the gang. 1 of the gang member trys to run Robocop over Robo gets out of the way he crashes into some toxic waste & that guy is messed up. Amazing effect. Lewis is chasing after Clerance & his car flips over. He survived as Lewis gets out he shoots her several times. Robocop calls him out. 1 of the gang members takes advantage & drops metal debre on Robo from crane. The hurt Lewis takes The Cobra Assault Rifle & fires at the crane. Robocop takes his data spike jams it into Bodicker's throat nice amount of blood squibbing. Robo tells Lewis \\"They'll fix you they fix everything.\\" Robogoes to The OCP building there's an ED 209 there he takes The Cobra Assault Rifle & blows it up. He goes to the board room he plays what Dick Jones said. Jones holds The Old Man hostage The Old Man says he's fired Robo says thank you & shoots Jones out the window. The Old Man says nice shooting what's your name? Robocop says Murphy. Awesome awesome movie Paul Verhoven at his best. Great job directing by him. Peter Weller was great & he gave a full performance unlike what Joel Kknnaman said. Nancy Allen did a good job. Kurtwood Smith was great. Ronny Cox did a very good job. Daniel O'Herilihy was did a good job for what he was given he'd be given more to do in Robocop 2. Mingel Ferrer was good. The effects were amazing too no CGI  practical effects will always be the best. Robocop is a classic if you've never seen it watch it sometime especially the unrated version. I will review Robocop 2 soon.
161293028X|5.0|The first twelve stories of Sherlock Holmes form the groundwork for a great compilation of short stories. Written shortly after the \\"Moonstone\\" Doyle was dappling in a new realm, the realm of mystery. The book is separated into short stories due to being put out serially in a magazine in the late 1800s and early 1900s. I really enjoyed the stories because they were each an individual story yet together, they had an underlying theme. Many modern day shows are based on the work of Doyle and it is really interesting to see the origin of many mystery scenarios. The show \\"House\\" is actually based on the Sherlock Holmes short stories so if you end up reading this novel, be sure to check out the show.<br />The level of reading is not extremely high, nor low, so the language is easy to understand so that the reader can focus on the mystery. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and I highly recommend this to any high school student interested in some \\"spare-time reading.\\"
B006ISJQ3K|4.0|After a two year hiatus from the recording studio, the album \\"Diana Ross\\" hit the store shelves about four months after her second movie, \\"Mahogany\\", had been released to mixed reviews.  While the film didn't quite capture the critics nor the audiences the movie studio (and her fans) had hoped for, what did capture everyone was what turned out to be Diana Ross' next #1 hit...the theme song fronm that movie:  \\"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\\".  While the song was included on the soundtrack album for the movie, it was also included on this albun as well.  Timing is everything.  By the time \\"Diana Ross\\" was released to the people, the radio stations already had \\"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\\" in an what seemed like an almost un-ending constant rotation people were starting to tell the DJ's where to go if they heard the song one mnore time.  Luckily Motown and Diana Ross had a hidden gem up their sleeves and on the album.  Since the majority of the pop songs recorded by artists back then barely lasted over 3 minuts and going over 4 minutes was almost unheard of, Diana Ross exploded into what would eventually become known as the \\"Dance\\" genre with the song \\"Love Hangover\\" clocking in at over 7 minutes long.  Listening to the song, at first you have the sense she was taking the song very seriously, then once the tempo picked up from the ballard part, you got the feeling she was just having fun with it, but by the end of the song you realize she was seiosly having fun with it.  Hearing those few opening bars also opened the flood gates of people fighting to get to the dance floor so they can be there when the song goes from a very sexy and sensual feeling to the thump-thump-thumping of the disco sound.  Ironiclly, Diana beat herself out of the top spot of the charts because another song from the same album had already been released (\\"I Thought it Took a Little Time\\") and was just about to reach the coveted top spot when \\"Love Hangover\\" basically left that single behind with it's own hangover.  (A piece of trivia:  how many people remembered or even knew The Fifth Dimension had also recorded and released their own version of \\"Love Hangover\\"...at the same time?  On that same token how many remember Diana's version of a few songs The Fifth Dimension had recorded?)<br /><br />A nice little gem that ended the album was her rendition of Charlie Chaplin's penned song \\"Smile\\".  The rest of the songs on the albunm are okay and of course hearing other versions of the songs that made the final cut I've always found interesting and can understand why the version that did appear on the final albun was chosen.  Case in point...the expanded versions of Diana Ross's original albmums \\"Touch Me In The Morning\\" and \\"Surrender\\".
B007FH9GT2|3.0|David Fincher version's of \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" is, from a cinematographic point of view, better than its Scandinavian counterpart: more sophisticated, better edited, visually stunning. You get a taste of the \\"Scandinavian noir\\".  As thrillers go, there's a lot of action and information packed in those 2 hr 40 minutes to keep you on the edge of your seat; just blink and you are lost.<br /><br />Fincher takes some liberty with the book, and why not? Stieg Larsson's novel is dense, and to translate it into movie choices had to be made.  Besides, directors are often tempted when lifting a story from a book to stamp their own seal of originality onto it.<br /><br />So... Where is the grief? Well, taking ownership of a story is fine as long as it does not betray the author's original intent; especially if a director keeps the same title for their movie as the novel it comes from. That brings me back to the novel, which original title in Swedish is \\"The Men Who Hate Women\\". The main thread Larsson develops in his trilogy is the violence women are still subjected to in our male dominated societies. The reason his novels are so popular, despite their gruesome violence, is because of Lisbeth Salander, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Otherwise it would be your average Scandinavian noir, and there are a bunch of them out there.<br /><br />Lisbeth is the heart of this story. As a victim who refuses to be victimized she answers violence with violence. She has her own code of ethics outside of society's conventions, and will take revenge whenever she feels it is justified. She does not show any vulnerability and does not seek to be liked.<br /><br />Fincher's version betrays Larsson's novel in subtle and no so subtle ways. Starting with the poster (it's Daniel Craig's face up front) vs. the Swedish one (Rapace is the sole character on it). Mara's Lisbeth does have her quirkiness, and her IQ; but she is also shown more vulnerable, and her violence has been dialed down a (big) notch. Her interaction/relationship with Craig's Mikael is rebalanced so that he comes through as less \\"passive\\", not as out staged as he (willingly) is in the book. One telling example takes place towards the end of the movie. In this version, before going after the serial killer, Mara asks a half dead Craig what she should do with him once she catches him up. Lisbeth would never have asked because she knows what revenge she will exact against this women killer; she does not need anybody's permission, or worse, approval.<br /><br />In the end this version has been designed to appeal to the American (male) audience. A woman can have an edge just enough to stray from the conventional brain dead bimbos Hollywood plagues us with, but certainly not as to challenge the established order (even in a movie) of our male dominated societies. Exactly what Larsson's was fighting against.

By far the biggest problem is that some fool put echo on every single one of Nora's vocals; instead of hearing that fabulous and very special voice, we hear what sounds like any so-so female singer trying to boost her \\"presence\\" with echo. Sigh. I won't be listening to any of these tracks a second time.

B007YYY4WK|3.0|Parts of the episode were remarkable. It was the first episode in forever where sally draper was actually used well and was something other than a pathetic victim of the writers and an eternal martyr. But by the end, everything accomplished was wrecked. And the worst character in the history of the series was back: Glen. Glen's part in the show is a sign of ego run amok. Its a bad thing to cast your own children in your series. Its something Aaron Spelling did. The transition of Glen from proto Ted Bundy into every little girls special friend is as false as it is remarkable. The more Glen is around, the more he undermines the part of Sally in the show.<br /><br />The business dinner with Heinz was great. Megan working so well together with Don at the dinner was great. The part where is directly told off by the exec about the price of his award in lost business was not well done. It should have been done as a cutaway said behind Don's back rather than to his face. Peggy was back to usual uninteresting self. Megan's parents were each interesting in their own way too.<br /><br />So much to like. But making Betty and now Sally into punching bags week after week is boring. Its all the worse because they showed the potential for Sally to do better work in the episode before going back to the same old same old.

1400069289|3.0|Charles Duhigg's book has made the role of habit in our lives a topic of much discussion lately, and that's perhaps its greatest value. In trying to fit AA into his &#34;habit loop&#34; formula, however, Duhigg helps to reinforce two popular but seriously mistaken views of a program that, as he recognizes, has rescued millions from the ravages of alcoholism and helped millions more through the influence of its 12 Steps.<br /><br />According to one of these views, AA amounts to little more than group therapy; according to the other, AA is only concerned with drinking. We alcoholics go to meetings for mutual support so we can quit and not pick up again. End of story. To this Duhigg adds his habit loop twist. AA works because it helps us to exchange one habit for another: going to meetings instead of going to the bar. This, he claims, is AA's way of applying the &#34;Golden Rule&#34; of habit change: use the same cue (feeling lousy) and deliver the same reward (feeling better), but insert a new routine (meeting instead of bar).<br /><br />This has all the appeal of simplicity and all the pitfalls of oversimplification. Presented as part of the truth, Duhigg's description is quite acceptable. Except that he presents it as the whole truth and what AA says about itself (in its basic texts) and countless alcoholics believe and try to practice, is of little consequence. He either dismisses or diminishes it as being, well, unscientific, a charge Duhigg uses as a trump card against an AA which he says remains &#34;frozen in time,&#34; left behind by the advance of science.<br /><br />Duhigg sets up a conflict between science and AA which enables him to reduce the latter to group therapy. This follows from his understanding of science as a materialist enterprise. Duhigg recounts how when researchers asked recovering alcoholics what made their new habits take hold so that they were able to stay sober even under the direst of circumstances, their answer was always the same: God. They hated that answer, says Duhigg, because &#34;God and spirituality are not testable hypotheses.&#34;<br /><br />Yet that is AA's answer, repeated throughout its &#34;Big Book&#34; and &#34;12&12&#34; and echoed in tens of thousands of rooms throughout the world each and every day.  It reflects the view that humans are material and spiritual beings. Reject the latter and you end up treating men and women in controlled experiments the way you treat mice. But being subjects and not only objects, we humans have our own idea of what's going on inside of us. Thus either you accept alcoholics' own account of their experience and honestly try to learn from it, or you reinterpret it to fit your materialist bias.<br /><br />The Power of Habit does the latter. It's therefore not surprising that the researchers eventually &#34;figured out&#34; that &#34;It wasn't God that mattered.&#34; Instead, &#34;it was belief itself that made the difference.&#34; As their materialist preconceptions required, the researchers tweaked Step 2 to take the spiritual out so that it ends up making me my higher power once I work up enough self-esteem to believe in myself. This is philosophy masquerading as science, and it dovetails back into pop psychology and the therapeutic commonplace that we drank because we didn't feel good about ourselves. Those who know the 12&12 will recall a memorable passage which lays such notion to rest.<br /><br />Seeing spirituality and God not only as unscientific, but even as &#34;odd&#34; and &#34;strange,&#34; Duhigg tries to exclude them from the AA story. Where AA sees alcoholism as &#34;a threefold disease,&#34; physical, mental, and spiritual, TPHO admits only to the first two. Where AA considers itself a &#34;spiritual fellowship,&#34; TPHO sees only the communal. Where AA talks of &#34;spiritual principles,&#34; TPHO talks of methods and techniques.<br /><br />We are left with a spiritually deprived and almost dehumanized portrait of AA as a &#34;a giant machine for changing habit loops&#34; which &#34;forces you to create new routines&#34; through &#34;a system of meetings and companionship that strives to offer as much escape, distraction, and catharsis as a Friday night bender.&#34;<br /><br />Such characterization distorts and trivializes what we alcoholics do. We go to meetings to share &#34;our experience, strength, and hope&#34; and to tell others &#34;what we were like, what happened, and what we are like now,&#34; and thus to &#34;carry the message&#34; that &#34;there is a solution,&#34; which is understood to be spiritual. We go because we want to give back &#34;that which has been so freely given us.&#34; We don't all understand spirituality and God the same way, but neither do we try to deny or belittle them. As for the language of coercion, none of us would associate it with AA. It is totally foreign to its spirit.<br /><br />Duhigg's scientism (to borrow a term from C.S. Lewis) also helps to explain why his book tends to perpetuate the notion that AA is all about drinking. It's a view that's been around from the start, and when people act on it in the rooms, we give it a name: two-stepping. They stop drinking and they tell others they stopped drinking. We sometimes call such people &#34;dry drunks.&#34; They never move far beyond physical sobriety.<br /><br />But AA is no drying machine, as by extension Duhigg's arid metaphor would have it. Not drinking is only the first step in a process leading to a &#34;spiritual awakening&#34; which enables the alcoholic to carry &#34;this&#34; message and &#34;to practice these principles in all our affairs&#34; so that we can &#34;grow along spiritual lines,&#34; gain emotional  sobriety, and live in harmony with God and neighbor. But you wouldn't know that from TPOH. Duhigg is mum on the Steps that make that process abundantly clear, and when he mentions two of them, he bends them out of shape so they'll fit into his habit loop scheme.<br /><br />Thus he cites research to the effect that to do Steps 4 and 5, a person &#34;has to create a list of all the triggers for their alcoholic urges&#34; and that &#34;When you make a self-inventory, you're figuring out all the things that make you drink.&#34; He adds that &#34;Then, AA asks alcoholics to search for the rewards they get from alcohol. What cravings, the program asks, are driving your habit loop?&#34;<br /><br />Steps 4 and 5 have the alcoholic to do these things only in Duhigg's book. His account seems plausible to the uninitiate only because of the way he quotes Step 4: &#34;to make `a searching and fearless inventory of ourselves.'&#34; The person in AA will immediately notice a curious omission: the word &#34;moral&#34; is left out. Again, not surprising, since morality is among the &#34;not testable hypotheses.&#34; But it's a &#34;moral inventory,&#34; because AA is concerned not with the circumstantial habits surrounding our drinking but with the character and emotional habits that cause the harm we do to ourselves and to others. These constitute &#34;the exact nature of our wrongs&#34; which we then admit &#34;to God, to ourselves, and to another human being&#34; in Step 5.<br /><br />This self-examination and admission of wrongs are among the exterior habits we cultivate in AA as we strive to acquire such interior habits or character traits as honesty, humility, and forgiveness. They proceed from a spiritual awakening which transforms the perceptions and concerns which drove our old habits. We try to practice these new habits daily in all we do and through repeated action the traits are gradually ingrained in mind and brain and develop into habitual dispositions. Right thinking, right feeling, and right action slowly become second nature to us. This is the understanding of habit formation that underlies the 12 Steps of AA and is distilled in the phrase &#34;practice these principles.&#34;<br /><br />The chain of events that led to AA started when a psychiatrist, Carl Jung, humbly admitted to the limitations of his trade and told one desperate alcoholic that there was no hope for him except in a spiritual experience. Through this man's agency psychologist William James helped another desperate alcoholic understand the spiritual experience that had just set him free. Bill W. was then led to another man of science named Dr. Bob, and AA was born.<br /><br />Other psychiatrists, psychologists, and medical doctors would join with men and women of the cloth to support and encourage AA as it borrowed from science and religion and grew into a spiritual fellowship that would launch a different kind of experiment, an experiment in faith. The results are there for everyone to see, in the rooms of AA as well as at home, work, and church. They are every bit as empirical as those little graphs of rat brain activity that adorn TPOH.<br /><br />We alcoholics are indebted to AA for nurturing such a fruitful tradition of cooperation between science, religion, and the spiritual, a tradition which Charles Duhigg has unfortunately chosen not to follow but which developments in science since the advent of quantum physics are sure to strengthen. It's not AA that's being left behind, but a hubristic and triumphalist conception of science that remains stuck in the 18th century.<br /><br />Being open-minded, especially about spiritual matters, is one of the first habits we develop in AA.

B00756GKBA|2.0|The first album I ever bought was Madonna's first way back in the spring of 1984. (Yes i was -10 years old at that time ;-) )  I have been a huge fan of her work ever since, I buy the Cds when they are released and get each different version. I remember many times over the years that people would discredit her work, saying she is over and is no longer relevant, to which she would follow up with a revolutionary new perspective, topping the charts, and silencing her critics. An example to this would be her \\"Erotica\\" album, that put off many, only to be followed with \\"Bedtime Stories\\", containing her longest number 1 hit \\"Take a Bow.\\" However with this CD I find it hard to defend her. The disk is uninspired, the lyrics weak and laughable, the entire production seems rushed, as if this was some weekend project she recorded in her garage. Madonna being a worldwide cultural Icon has a huge reputation to live up to, and MDNA just does not work. Madonna needs to take more time with her work, she is an amazing artist, but a disk like this does not display any of her talents. She has the ability to produce a cleaner, more polished work, whether a dance track or emotional power ballad, but her vocals are incoherent and lost, the music itself is generic. I am disappointed in this album, but I am NOT counting her out. More than her music abilities, Madonna is known for  reinventing herself and her music style. I look forward to her next album and seeing where she is going to go, but as for MDNA, it maybe best to pass on this CD, and wait till she does something better.

B003IPC5UC|5.0|Kylie has put out a lot of great work (and some not so great) over the years, this disk is one of the great ones. Not as successful as her \\"Fever\\" album, this is still a great CD for diehard, and casual Kylie Fans.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am enjoying the trilogy but I do think this book is the best of all three.  My favorite is that it is a well written and no profanity.  It is so hard to find good books without such language weave through out it.

B002AKPECW|3.0|I have enjoyed all of Reynolds books, but this one fell short for me. I felt 99% of the book to be engaging and captivating, but then I reached the end and felt cheated. There did not seem to be any actual resolution, or even a decent opening for a further book. It was as if Reynolds became tired and decided to stop writing. I am hoping there is another book so I can find out where this creative and suspensive novel leads, but for now it hits a wall.

The last 2 songs, Ready to Love Again and I Run to You were both messed up at one point, no more than 15 seconds so I'm not worried about that. But I was looking for the song Something about a Woman, but I don't have it on this cd, instead I have Lookin for a Good Time. I Run to You is a bonus track on it. Why would this have happened? Did they remove the song later? IDK...I was just wondering why I have the song I have instead of the one listed.

055358894X|5.0|There are many different types of people throughout the port city-state of Camorr. You've got the gentry who living high above the filth and grime of the lower city. You've got the yellowjackets patrolling the town, who seem to be more willing to take a bribe than to actually do any policing. There are priests and priestesses of the Twelve, some more pious than others, but all respected by the cityfolk. There are pawnbrokers and money lenders, sailors and spice merchants. There are many people in Camorr, many honest folk trying to make an honest living. And then there are the thieves.<br /><br />Locke Lamora has had a knack for stealing things ever since he was a young lad. Taken by the Thiefmaker at an early age, the orphan boy proved to be more than the Thiefmaker could handle. Locke was traded (sold) off to another man, the Blind Priest of Perelandro named Chains. Here, under the tutelage of the \\"blind\\" wizened man, Locke began to learn the true art of thievery and deception.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is a fast-paced yarn that guarantees to keep the Reader up long past bedtime. Locke is a fascinating character, instantly sympathetic and charming, but he's not the kind of man you'd necessarily want to be hanging around with. He's gifted at slight-of-hand, as is obvious from his introduction to the story, but he's also got a knack for bringing trouble. Lies is, at its simplest, a heist story about Locke and the Gentleman Bastards (the name of his gang) trying to rob a certain wealthy noble. The story is, however, not simple, and when one man tells lies for a living, life's bound to get complicated.<br /><br />There are many memorable things from the book. What comes to mind first is the humor. Scott Lynch writes bloody brilliant dialogue (albeit rather blue) that more than once had me cackling like a loon. What's more, the dialogue comes across as genuine, almost as if Lynch spent some time with some con men in his day and picked up on the lingo. Even under pressure, Locke never loses his sarcastic mouth, and it was this humor that really shined.<br /><br />Another piece of the book that was equally enjoyable was the fantastic world building. The city-state of Camorr is built on the ruins of some ancient civilization known as the Eldren. Not much is revealed about these mysterious ancients other than the ubiquitous glass structures that they left behind. Man does not know how they lived or what they did, and Lynch doesn't offer much (any?) assistance to the Reader, either. He hints at magic and arcane secrets, but hints are all we're given. This offered a lot of depth to the book, but it also leaves one a bit frustrated, too, as answers aren't forthcoming. I could go on and on about the world building, but I'll leave it with just this one piece, so as not to spoil anything.<br /><br />Scott Lynch has sold me to his world from just one book. I'm curious to know so much more about so many things, but I'm also eager to get back with Locke again, too. The book is presented in an interesting way, following a Chapter-Interlude-Chapter method. Each chapter deals with the present, that being the heist story, while each Interlude deals with something else. For much of the book the Interludes are like a flashback for different characters, but as the book progresses, these sometimes become folktales or history lessons on the world. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and felt that it did wonders with the pacing of the novel.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora has been out for a few years now. If you've not read it (or never heard of it, for that matter), then I suggest that you remedy that. The story telling is impeccable, the characters are unforgettable, and the action is high. There's humor aplenty, but sadness and despair aren't strangers, either. All in all, I'm not sure why it took me so long to read this book, but I'm ever so glad I did.

B000XR4OC0|3.0|I admit that I love flats and comfortable shoes.  It took me a few months before I gave in to all the hype and boy was I glad.  It's a very comfy shoe and it does stretch a bit but I don;t mind.  I have wide feet.  It feels like I am walking in slippers.  Since I loved them soooo much, I wore them everyday to work and to do errands.  The first pair I bought were navy blue and I wore them for about 4 months before they started getting little holes in the top toe area.  I thought maybe I wore them too much so I bought another pair in grey (the classic canvas).  I started wearing them everyday and everywhere.  Seriously, when your feet finds a comfy shoe, its like love at first sight.  Any other shoe (other thsn my UGGS) seemed hard, uncomfortable and I think I developed a weird walk when I wore other shoes.  But getting back to the TOMS, I wore the grey ones for about 2 months and guess what?!  HOLES!!!  AGAIN!!!  Not too happy about that.  I dont do strenuous things in my day-to-day lifestyle so I really dont understand the hole problems.  I found a cool website that suggested sewing lil patches on the shoes and it looked rather cute, but really, its silly that people spend about $60 bucks per pair and within 2-5 months, there will be holes.  One of friends commented and said she liked the holes in my shoes and gave it character.  I laughed and said hmmmm, thats interesting.  But, quality-wise, these shoes are not good.  Comfort-wise, its excellent.  It reallt goes with everything especially skinny jeans and leggings.  I dont think I want to spend another $60 for a pair of \\"holy\\" shoes.  I was thinkng that perhaps the other styles other than canvas would be better but do I even want to pursue it?  Maybe not.

0547569653|5.0|Scott Jurek combines a traditional memoir format with recipes and information about his training and the plant-based diet which has contributed to his success as an ultramarathoner in such a self-effacing way that the already-active reader's take-away is likely to be, \\"I can do this\\"--maybe not win an ultra, but challenge oneself beyond the 26.2 mile marathon distance.  I, for one, am now eager to try.<br /><br />The dilemma for a plant-based distance athlete is that the food on offer at aid stations isn't likely to conform with a vegan diet.  Jurek answers the eternal, \\"What do you eat?\\" question with recipes which sound so delicious and energizing that I am eager to try them even for indoor consumption.<br /><br />This book will be a great gift for any active person, particularly one who is dedicated to a plant-based diet, or just considering one.

0345803485|1.0|First of all - I wanted to like this.  Having read Anne Rice/A.N. Roquelare's Sleeping Beauty series years ago, I thought \\"what fun! - mainstream erotic literature!\\"  Hooh, boy was I saddened by this nonsense.  In addition to all of the bigger picture, narrative inconsistences and issues, this book series (and I did not make it through the 3rd one) is an absolute horror because. . .<br /><br />1.  Inexplicable anachronisms: College graduate in 2011 has no email addy until rich boyfriend buys her a Mac. Huh?<br /><br />2.  Geographic references in Seattle area totally wrong. Editor? Hello, editor? Anyone there?<br /><br />3.  British-isms run amok (ordering tea \\"bag out\\", ring instead of call, bloody hell, satchel, etc.)<br /><br />4.  Unrealistic physical outcomes (ex: slender virgin deflowered by well-endowed man not in pain, totally up for more later and next day. Riiigghhttt. . . .)<br /><br />5.  Her repetitive lip-biting.  Like 40 times in first book alone.<br /><br />6.  I just . . . really dislike both of these people.  Annoying, shallow, dull, stupid, self-obsessed.  I don't want to do CG, I want to stab him in the eye and shave his stupid head.<br /><br />7.  Their parents are horrible adults lacking in any common sense. All of them.<br /><br />8.  Author must never leave her house. Rich people do not refer to their parties as \\"our charity ball.\\" Fundraiser, gala, event, celebration. . . And it would have a NAME/theme.  The humiliating first dance/slave auction of<br />the young women?  That does not happen anymore - did she read about that in some old book? Also the crowds gathering to watch his sailboat leave the marina.  Even a huge, very nice sailboat isn't that big a deal,  not in a town with a big marina anyway.  And the manner in which he spends money is just weird and totally lacking in dignity.<br /><br />9.  Main character who is usually very formal in speech, keeps casually referring to his birth mother as \\"the crack whore.\\" Um, that is not a jobtitle, it's a highly vernacular crude insult. Even if he hated her (which is not clear), it demeans the speaker, not the (deceased) subject.<br /><br />10.  Unrealistic time frame. These people are engaged within 3-4 weeks of meeting? And the (horrible) parents are all cool with this?<br /><br />11.  For a book that is supposed to be all sexed up, those scenes ultimately become SO BORING (I came to this conclusion after the first 5 or 6. . .because I'm patient and also naughty.).<br /><br />12.  27-yr old corporate mogul multi billionare? Literally impossible.  It would take at least a decade/15 years to amass that kind of fortune in that manner, even if the person was a business genius. 27 year olds get rich by doing one awesome crazy thing (e.g Facebook), not by carefully selecting companies to turn around.  Just make him 35 and make her 27 and a grad student. Still young enough to be hot, but more believable.<br /><br />13. All the \\"holy crap!\\" and other silliness.<br /><br />14. She is worried about getting in trouble for riding a jet ski.  Not from her horrible parents. From her man.<br /><br />15. She actually wants to ride a nasty old jet ski.  Perhaps the only age-appropriate behavior in the entire book, it stands out in particular contrast to the fact she's riding it off a giant yacht in some exotic spot. Like the French Riviera or somewhere else that no one who has ever left their house thinks is the ultimate in a fancy pants beach vacation spot.  And why would CG pick a public beach if he was so into keeping her to himself (gross)? Couldn't he find a nice private island somewhere?<br /><br />16. ONCE AGAIN, the nice, hot dark-skinned \\"ethnic\\" friend gets shafted for the sparkly jackass.  I am so Team Jacob, er,  Team Jose.<br /><br />17. Author named the Jacob-y character \\"Jose Rodriguez.\\" That's like \\"Bob Smith.\\" Yawn. I can come up with tons of mas sexy yet easy to pronounce Hispanic names without even thinking of  it. . .Antonio Rivera.  Gabriel Vargas. Santiago Ruiz. See? Easy.<br /><br />18. Now that on the subject, Jose's random Spanish one-offs are distracting.  Noone talks like that, especially to their guerita crush. Hijole.<br /><br />19.  The predatory boss.  Noone who has ever worked a day outside of their house would write a character this dumb.  Even the worst of sexual predators don't make their move the first WEEK of the target's employment.  It's a much slower buildup with boundaries tested and crossed, etc.<br /><br />20.  \\"Down there\\"?  Really? And I'll buy the virginity for story sake, but we're supposed to believe she made it to 21 without being kissed? Or masturbating? Please.

B007P6VM04|5.0|About time! A fantastic CD of the best of SMASH, the NBC series about two actresses fighting for the role of Marilyn Monroe in a Broadway show. To be REALLY honest, there is another version with 5 added tracks elsewhere, and not via Amazon or iTunes, but for the chance to grab the real CD, here it is, and worth every penny. Megan Hilty, an authentic Broadway voice, is possibly working on her CD debut this year and Katherine McPhee, the girl who lost that certain TV song-schmultzfest, is flawless. Some covers, some original work, and lots of amazing talent.<br /><br />When people say they don't write great songs anymore, this is proof they still do... and even better.<br /><br />If you've never seen the series, grab the disc and hear what you've been missing.

B007G5O3K0|5.0|First of all, I have to say I'm blown away by the beauty of this album.  It's worth buying for the song \\"Quiet\\", which is wonderful - I can hear it on a movie soundtrack.  Other songs I really like are Lightening, Burn Money Burn and Listening, as well as Out of My Hands.  There is one huge disappointment, though - the best song of the album, \\"Undecided\\" is missing!!  If you listen to this song on U-Tube you will see how fantastic it is, and it's not here.  That is a real drawback.  The best song of the album and it's missing.  But the others are so good and Morten never sounded better.

B007HNFREW|1.0|I'm a huge fan of fantasy and scifi, and I've heard so much hype about the Game of Thrones series, that I was ecstatic to see it available on-demand from Amazon Prime. I ponied up the extra buck to watch it in HD, sat back, and prepared to be amazed. Well, I guess I was amazed, but not in the way I expected. This episode falls amazingly short of its potential. There are plenty of elements to grab and hold attention: characters facing tough choices, boys coming of age, a young girl more suited for combat than cross-stitching, mysterious and outrageously evil enemies, etc... I mean, sure those are old stand-bys, and maybe a bit trite, but they work. Production and casting are also quite good. But things quickly go from promising to pathetic. Gratuitous nudity, coarse sexual content, scenes demeaning to women, and foul language, all of which turn my first (and last) episode into a real dirt sandwich. Wish I had my money and time back. Not recommended.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Cool! I get to live out the dream of being the first to review a popular product AND give a rave to the third season of one of my favorite shows on TV. I have to say: I have given a pass to nearly every network series of the past ten years, preferring the more complex and adult dramas and comedies found on cable-TV. But THE GOOD WIFE fulfills all of my requirements for great entertainment: gripping plotlines, complex characters and brilliant acting, writing and directing. Julianna Margulies anchors the show beautifully as Alicia Florrick, and Season 3 gives her great new material to play, particularly at the start of the season with her boss, Will Gardner (Josh Charles). How their affair plays out - and draws in her ex-husband Peter (Chris Noth) and her OTHER boss, Diane Lockhart (the always amazing Christine Baranski) makes for great drama that never descends to soapiness. Alan Cumming expands his role as Eli Gold, now practicing law in Alicia's office even as he juggles his career as a political consultant, and he provides many of the comic highlights throughout the season. Matt Czuchry deepens his portrayal of Cary Agos, having switched sides from defense to the D.A.'s office. And of course, there's my (and probably most other viewers') favorite character, Kalinda Sharma (Archie Punjabi) whose friendship with Alicia went up in smoke at the end of Season Two. The fallout of this event, as well as the other troubles she encounters, make Kalinda appear more vulnerable than ever before. By season's end, several intriguing questions about her character are answered, even as new mysteries surrounding her past begin. Chris Noth and Mary Beth Peil round out the exceptional cast of characters, with Jackie's antagonism Alicia providing some stellar moments. Great talent, great court cases, great season ending cliffhanger. I, for one, am eagerly looking forward to Season Four. For those of you who have NEVER watched this show before, BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING! The rest of us can revisit and savor the highlights of this fine program's latest season here.
1843106698|5.0|When my son, Cameron, was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome in 2009, I searched for every book that I could find on the subject. This book is the most helpful that I have found. Tony Attwood's book gives detailed descriptions of what to expect and how to deal with specific challenges. The book is not overly-clinical and is definitely not boring.<br />Mr. Attwood offers help and hope. He is an inspiration to all those who read the book. He made me feel that I was not alone in this battle, and that none of this was beyond my ability to deal with.<br />I have recently come out with my second book. It is called Cameron's Journey. It is about my own child and our challenges with his Asperger's Syndrome. It was my goal to touch hearts and lives, as Mr. Attwood has done. It is our story, the story of one family's attempts to make this world as wonderful for their special needs child as possible.<br />Mr. Attwood is a true inspiration to parents everywhere. If you buy no other book on the subject, buy this one.

B000001FDQ|5.0|Yngwie Malmsteen is by far one of the greatest guitarists that ever walked the face of this earth. His genius in composing classical pieces arranged for guitar are beyond anything I've ever heard. \\"Black Star\\" is one of the greatest songs ever. As I stated above, the intro classical guitar piece that Malmsteen improvised would truly amaze Django Reinhardt or Andres Segovia if they even heard him in this generation. There is no doubt in my mind, Malmsteen would have been a composer of classical music a couple hundred years ago in the leagues of Debussy, Mozart, Chopin, and Bach. \\"Icarus Dream Suite Opus 4\\" is a truly mesmerizing song. \\"Adagio\\" one of Malmsteen's best known compositions, proves that he is not just a shred guitarist. He pours his heart and soul out on this song and to me, one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written.<br /><br />For Yngwie's debut album \\"Rising Force\\", I have to give this a solid five star rating. I think it towers even higher than \\"Marching Out\\" and \\"Trilogy\\" the next two records he recorded. I love his use of the harmonic minor scale and the phrygian dominant he incorporates. He is also what I consider the \\"master of the modes\\".

0761158820|5.0|I cannot say enough about how this book has captured my 8 year old sons imagination and how he has spent many hours by himself putting these together! He got this book as a Birthday present and we put one together but I was frustrated when we used regular Elmer's Glue and had to hold them to dry - took too long and warped the paper, so we put the book aside. We then discovered glue dots at a kids craft party went out and bought some glue dots for use with this book and in less then a week we are halfway done with the book. I just bought several of these books for birthday presents but I also included glue dots with the gift so no one else has to go through the first round of frustration we did. The designs are wonderful and they include blanks so kids can color/design there own. I still have to help my son with the more advanced designs and sometimes the designs rip when you punch them out of the book if you aren't careful but I still give it 5 stars since it is just a fantastic book that everyone I show is just in awe of the final outcome, especially my son.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I must tell you a secret. While writing these books, scribe Rick Riordan made a grave mistake. He accidently recorded Percy's close female friend to be Annabeth Chase. This is false. The real Annabeth is a decietful, power-hungry harpy who is not fit to even know someone as amazing as Percy Jackson. Percy actually has another girlfriend, the love of his life who will not be named (And no, it isn't Voldemort). So, reader, beware the Mist which keeps Mr. Riordan from seeing the truth, and know that not even amnesia, two gorgons, and a pack of hellhounds could keep our beloved demigod from his one true love, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

B003WWZ1R0|5.0|I love the mood yoga cd's set. This cd however, has all the rest beat. Putumayo Presents Yoga is by far the #1 yoga cd out there. My recommendation for this album is extremely high.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I purchased the hunger games trilogy on my kindle. I have been on the third book for about a month now! I do not want to finish reading it because I like it so much I don't want it to end!! The movie is good, but the book adds way more detail which helps you get into it more. LOVE!

B001E45XT4|2.0|Sound quality was above average for the price, however, the item was basically unusable because it was so uncomfortable. Even after days of stretching out the headset, whenever I would put it on it gave me a splitting headache from being too tight. The cups were somewhat comfortable but even the padding on those was not enough to keep this from feeling like it was crushing my head. Ultimately I sold the item to someone else because for me, it was unusable.
B0071R43MG|5.0|Hands down the most enjoyable Blu-ray concert disc in some time. Some reviewers have mentioned that they aren't fans of \\"live\\" recordings, I on the other hand ONLY purchase music related concert videos, mainly because I think the better ones have REPLAY value beyond typical Hollywood movie releases - which back in my DVD purchasing days, would end up gathering dust after one viewing.<br />So with many detailed reviews already posted here, I'll keep my reasons bullet-pointed.<br /><br />1. Tasteful editing. Thank you Joe and Lamoureux film-makers for understanding that NOT EVERY CAMERA ANGLE needs to be seen at once. No split screen nonsense and .5 second shots here. Shots move gracefuly from one to the next and there is a pleasant fluidity. Close-ups are present when you want them to be and you never feel as if you are NOT seeing what you should be. Also - minimal crowd shots!<br /><br />2. Joe and his new line-up are AWESOME. Talent, enthusiasm and flawless execution always present. A welcomed change from previous tours, with the addition of Mike on keys. Set list is great too, understanding we'll all have some omitted favorites, but Joe does have an extended library to choose from.<br /><br />3. Video and Audio quality are SUPERB! This is a reference quality disc, people. Playing on my (2D) set-up of Pioneer Elite BD player and Kuro plasma, I have NEVER seen picture quality this good. Blacks are inky and shadow detail and nuances in shades of grey and black are all enjoyably evident. I noticed not a spot of grain even in the darkest scenes. And man, the colors on this disc simply POP. Within a few minutes of watching this blu-ray recording, I noticed how much Joe's guitars were just SATURATED in color. To say the final video product is perhaps \\"over-saturated\\" could be debated, but nontheless, intentional or not (it is titled \\"Saturated\\" after all), this disc is simply beautiful to watch. Eye candy if there is such a thing. It brought out the best of my HDTV.<br /><br />My reasons for recommending this disc could go on and on, but these are my top 3 and we'll keep it at that.><br />My reasons for recommending this disc could go on and on, but these are my top 3 and we'll keep it at that.

1402786360|5.0|This is such a phenomenal book!  It isn't a simple cookbook--it begins with a section titled \\"Getting Started\\" that has lists of useful baking equipment, art supplies and decorating tools, and \\"Baking Commandments\\".  There is a wealth of information in those seven pages alone. Every chapter of recipes begins with \\"Things to Keep in Mind\\".  Some of it is common sense.  Other parts are things I had no idea about, even after being an avid watcher of The Food Network for years.  I was so excited to see her Macaron recipe in this book.  She has simple recipes for sugar cookies and shortbread that can be easily adapted to whatever flavor you like.  She also provides you with quick swaps to make different flavors.  There is a section on candy that is full of great information.  I have looked through the book tons of times and I honestly believe she has covered every possible dessert category.  She has spoon desserts with different mousse recipes and custards, pie crust recipes, icing recipes, pastry recipes...the list goes on and on.  One of the best parts of the book is how she shows ways to approach decorating.  She discusses art principles and how to apply them to your baking.  There are so many gorgeous recipes.  There's not a single thing in this book that I don't want to make.  That's rare for me.  If I find a cookbook where I want to make sixty to seventy percent of the recipes, that's good enough for me to buy it.  To want to make everything in a cookbook--I'm not sure that's ever happened.  This book does exactly what it says it will--\\"Inspire Your Inner Artist.\\"
B007YDX4K4|5.0|Fans and long-time followers of the Supernatural franchise haven't been fond of the Leviathan storyline, but this episode makes it work. The Leviathan is genuinely creepy, the Bobby storyline continues to have both grace and grit and the story of the week works, especially with Felicia Day guest starring as a hacker.<br /><br />Charlie is a computer expert working for Roman Enterprises. She is everything a nerd dreams of and then the Eye of Sauron lights on her and she is handed Frank's harddrive to hack by none other than Dick Roman himself. Sam and Dean are alerted that someone is attempting to hack the hard drive and the trio joins forces. And by the end of the episode, Sam and Dean pick up a little something that may help them defeat the Leviathan. I just hope it is more convincing that a monster that falls to old-fashioned cleaning products. All in all a great episode. I didn't check the writing credits, but the last few episodes have had the feeling of early Supernatural. Great for the fans.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I picked up this book (recommended to me) one Saturday afternoon and I could not put it down. I finished the book in 4 hours while relaxing on the living room couch basking in sunlight rays shining through the front window.<br />This book brings to life every emotion the human body seems capable of going through. Written through the eyes of a young boy who is in love, distraught, broken, torn, happy, ecstatic, and more.
0425098478|5.0|Don't be fooled by the small number of pages in this book.  There are concepts and ideas that will change your life, if you practice the allegorical suggestions presented in this small book.  The revelations you'll discover, not only hold your attention, but will, if put into action, improve ALL your relationships:  Professional, Family, and your relationship with yourself.  The pages of this book, have provided me one of a very few other resources in my life, that I can point to as a pivotal and mentoring experience, and has influenced and improved my professional, family, and personal growth.<br />I highly recommend You own this wisdom.
0446585025|5.0|Ellen Degeneres is the only person in this entire world who can constantly self promote herself without looking or sounding self centre. Ms. Degeneres happy, carefree, determine and funny personality always shine through with whatever project she doing. Whether that is hosting her talk show, The Ellen Degeneres Show, or writing  her own humorous novel. Ellen's goal has always been to make other smile and that is no different with her novels (she already has three under her belt).<br /><br />In Seriously...I'm Kiding  she takes something serious as her own life and turns into a humorous adventure.Unlike other books she doesn't have a dramatic beginning and climax. No! She just writes about random things (or thoughts) in her life. It's one giant laugh fest. Or a better way of putting it: It's her talk show in book format. As I read this book I could not help but feel Ellen Degeneres was sitting in my living room beside me. She was right there. Beside me. Talking as if I were her best friend.<br /><br />She may be a celebrity but Ellen's genuine self always shine through. Ellen Degeneres is loveable and whether your reading her book or watching her show you cannot help but feel as if she is your next door neighbour. She motivates her readers and audience to another level. I, as a reader, could not help but feel refresh after reading this book.<br /><br />This was an awesome read. I did not once get dulled by it and finished it within a few hours. Lately, since returning from Taiwan, I have been in a reading funk. However after reading this novel I am motivated to read again.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Superb performance, nicely packaged (although I had no intention of using the bundled heat sink and fan, they were of adequate quality.)  I am running Windows 7 x64 Enterprise edition, and the Windows Experience rating for this CPU is 7.8 at default speed.  I have not attemped to overclock it yet.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Simply put, this version of the Phantom of the Opera was incredible on every level imaginable.  From top to bottom, actors to stagehands, the effort and precision of this performance was truly comparable to the original London cast.  The level of vocal AND acting ability comprised here is absolutely phenomenal.  Ramin Karimloo's Phantom is powerfully haunting, Sierra Boggess's portrayal of Christine Daae is certainly the best I've had the opportunity of seeing (although I never saw the London cast, I've heard the album)  Hadley Fraser's Raoul is without doubt to me the best Raoul I've seen.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is obviously a genius, and when you have an ensemble cast capable of performing his masterpiece at such a high level, well...you get MAGIC.  Amazing.

0741470314|5.0|I feel that Defending a King - His Life and Legacy is a wonderful and important book for everyone to read. It is, for sure, an \\"eye opener\\" to those who do not understand Michael Jackson. The author, Dr. Karen Moriarty, a psychologist, did an outstanding job. Her commitment & extensive research on this man is amazing. It has to be on the #1 Best Seller List. I read it on my Kindle & I now understand why Michael Jackson is so loved & respected among his fans, his true friends and family. He was a gentle soul and worldly humanitarian...something I did not even hear about in the media. I realized that he kept his philanthropy quiet in respect for others. I learned something very deep and sincere about this man. He never boasted how much he helped others and where. I learned that his heart was true; he was loving, caring, concerned & always there in time of need; paying for surgeries & funerals for those who could not, visited orphanages & hospitals, giving strength, love, encouragement, happiness and hope to so many & to those who were sick or terminally ill. I learned that he was humble, thankful and grateful to God for the gift God gave him; how he wanted to use his music and fame to make the world a better place. I now know \\"the truth\\" about Michael Jackson; why his family, friends and especially his fans understand him; why they love him, respect him & consistently fight for his legacy. I know Michael's fans will love this book. They will stand up and say, \\"YEAH, it is about time someone told the world about this kind and generous soul!\\"
B007BVOF8E|1.0|Totally boring!  The biggest waste of time I have experienced in a long time!  It was kind of like watching wet paint dry.
1590171993|5.0|This brilliant novel tells the story of William Stoner, a farm boy from a poor family, who goes on to become an English literature professor. Along the years, Stoner suffers from an unhappy marriage, a depressed daughter who buries her unhappiness in alcohol, a dispute with the head of his department who tries to make his life as difficult as possible, and finally a love romance with a young lady, which was doomed to fail from the start.  However, even though the world around him sees him as a failure, he remains true to himself and to his principles.<br /><br />Although the story line might seem rather simple, Williams has created a deep plot. The characters are very realistic, and I think almost anyone can find something to relate to. This is perhaps the magic of this great novel.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I don't know what took me so long to read this book. I loved it. While most of my friends would not see how funny this book really is or understand the romance of it, I found it one of the best books I have ever read. Obviously.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's ok...has a lot of small/simple games fir one free app. a lot of people are writing reviews probably for the points
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|Director Steven Soderbergh made an action film around a legit action star. The result was:<br />-undeniable displays of physicality far besting any lead actress & most actors<br />-acting much better than expected from a neophyte lead, some great screen-presence<br />-a realistic, art-house, throwback framework<br /><br />There's a reason why this film was received similarly to 'Drive'(2011) with a D+ CinemaScore grade (audience poll) but an 80% RottenTomatoes score (critics poll) The mis-advertising of the film (see the box cover itself) aside, it seems today's audiences are not open to anything but continuous beats in action/thriller cinema. I won't begrudge anyone for their opposing view of mine or the consensus of critics, but I will if the action goes unheralded. There is a reason why physicality is commonly depicted the way it is - to obscure the marked inability of actors and their reliance of stunt-doubles. If but one thing, let Haywire reveal the unfortunate, prevalent necessity of: quick-cutting, shaky-cam, and non-mid-range angle cinematography.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|After falling in love with Delirium, I was excited to read the sequel. Although the beginning was slow going, the second half had me at the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the next book!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Considering my wife and I watched all 10 episodes in two days, yeah, it's a pretty good show. The only downside to the entire show is that there are so few episodes.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The whole series was excellent.  Enjoyed the mystery and suspense that took us through all three movies.  The book helped us follow the movie and we found it very close to the reading.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun with few problems. It is a good game for kids. A few bugs but not too annoying.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I was so excited when I found out that I could finally download this app on my kindle but once I downloaded it after a day it just didn't work; not sure if it was just technical difficulties or if it was the app. Too bad I was really looking forward to playing this game with my friends it looked really fun  ):
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great, really! I find it pretty addicting. its better than facebook at least. I definitely would recommend this game to Anyone.
0439023491|5.0|Katniss and Peeta are living the lives of champions. They have their own houses, can help their families, and can also help others in their town. But, what about the love story from the Hunger Games? Katniss thinks she can live her own life now, but a stolen kiss, and a visit from the president change all that for her. Then, everyone finds out that the special 75th iteration of the games will be comprised of past champions. As the arena awaits her once again, Katniss must face her choices. She has angered the president and he seems set on revenge. Can she thwart his plot? Will she be able to kill any of the other champions in the arena? And, what about a rebellion? Is there really one in the air? \\"Catching Fire\\" is a fitting sequel to \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />This is another \\"can't put it down\\" kind of book. Following the themes of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" readers are first given a glimpse of life as a champion only to have it ripped away from those champions so they can once again visit the arena. The characters I didn't like in the first book, reappeared more despicable than ever. Then there were the characters I love, and I won't give any of that away. I highly recommend this book and am now moving on to \\"Mockingjay!\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian was a deeply troubled character with a laundry list of issues, but as a reader, I could understand why he was so flawed. He had a terrible childhood that would leave anyone emotionally damaged. Once Ana came into his life, he was finally ready to take a chance on life. Some of the things he said and did were a little creepy, his jealousy, possessiveness, stalker-like tendencies, were more than a little unnerving, but it made his character so compelling that I couldn't put this book down. Off to start Fifty Shades Darker now...
B007HO392S|5.0|CU is amazingly talented and easily one of the best, if not THE best singer in all of music right now.  The new album has an awesome variety of tones/tempos/styles.  It will definitely broaden her already growing fan base.
0385344228|1.0|I can't believe this book got 5 stars from most of the people that read it!!!!! I honestly found myself skipping so much of this book just to get it over with. The characters were totally unbelievable. The parents had their heads in the sand. The ending was ridiculous. I wish I would never have bought this book on my kindle! What a waste of my precious time and money.
1587613379|5.0|This arrived as expected, and on time. The book itself was well worth the purchase - I had the option of borrowing it from a friend, but having my own copy turned out better. I'll probably read this at least once a year - it had great advice on solving conflict in relationships. A good read for anyone, no matter what their relationship choices.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have worked out at my home all my life.  This is a great workout and definitely gives you results with the proper diet.
0142420891|5.0|I adored this book and found it to be better than If I Stay (although I love them both). Where She Went takes place 3 years after Mia's accident-Mia and Adam are no longer together and this book is from Adam's point of view. In the same style as the first book-flashbacks and all-we find out what exactly happened to Adam and Mia. One fateful night, Adam decides to see Mia's show and after they embark on a journey that is much more than just where they visit but who they become.<br />I really did enjoy this book, especially reading about the accident from Adam's point of view. He was a sweet and confusing guy to read about plus someone you can actually imagine. I also love the picture he paints of Mia-who she was and who she became. I also loved the ending. The writing was poetic, beautiful and sad. I give it 5 stars!
B0000793Z9|4.0|New Gold Dream isn't a perfect album, at least not in terms of it being made up 100% of 9 perfect songs - some tend to drag and show less sparkle or imagination - but as whole this is a magnificent album, one of the defining albums of the whole 1980's music scene, wonderfully coherent, influential and, most importantly, standing the test of time better than any other album from this period. This is one of the best albums ever recorded and, although for the most part the 5.1 mix is woefully inadequate, New Gold Dream still sounds as brilliant and timelessly fashionable as it did back in 1982.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this app so much i will deffinatelly never ever ever ever delet it even after i get board with solitaire
B00000IQV7|3.0|So I have seen this movie before but on VHS.  I wanted to add this movie to my collection of movies.<br /><br />I liked the price and that's what made me decide to get it.  HOWEVER, the seller forget to mention there was lagging in this particular dvd.  Most of the movie was fine except some parts where the movie would lag and freeze and skip part of the movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games get more challenging as you go. Some get pretty hard. But they keep me busy for long periods of time and there are all different kinds.
B000MQ54OO|1.0|I watched the first Happy Feet and found it cute until the end when it just turned into ridiculous environmentalist preaching.  This one didn't even have the plus of starting out well.  I would give it a 0 if that option was available.  Bad, jumbled storyline, horrible music even if you like that kind of music, characters with limp personalities.  Not even Robin Williams' talent could pull this one out of the junk pile.
B00792EGES|5.0|If you like big Rock N Roll concerts you must see this!  Alter Bridge Live At Wembley is a memory of one of Alter Bridge's best concerts ever! The video and audio quality are superb.
1451627289|5.0|I have not read many Stephen King novels, because I steer away from thrillers and chillers.  I am not sure I have ever written a book review on Amazon.  I love to read and read a variety of fiction and non-fiction.  I loved this book.  It is very well written.  He is a terrific story teller.  The story is engaging and you will fall in love with some of the characters.  I did not want it to end.  Five stars!
0345803485|4.0|Let me start out by writing a small disclaimer about myself: I do NOT read these kinds of books. To be quite honest, I rarely read because I have a hard time finding books/series that draw me in enough to invest the time in reading. I am NOT at all, ever, anywhere close to a Twilight fan. Never read the books, never saw the movies, I think it's all complete garbage. Vampires are supposed to be scary, not pretty and sparkly. With that being said, I had no clue that these books started out as Twilight fanfic before I started reading them, if I had I more than likely would never have given them a try. My hairdresser asked if I had heard of this book and told me the subject matter of the book and I laughed hysterically (I'm perpetually a 12 year old schoolgirl) and said \\"no way, that is not for me!!!\\". Couple weeks later, a few of my girlfriends mentioned the same book and I told them the same thing, \\"LOL no, not for me\\". I'm most certainly not the intended audience for this genre; I like action, explosions, blood and guts.<br /><br />I got home that night and caved and looked it up online to see what all the hype was about. I started reading the first two chapters through a free preview and I was instantly hooked. Christian Grey? Yes -holycrap- please. Rich, wealthy, drop dead gorgeous - and a bad boy in more than your typical sense. Not the \\"flowers and hearts\\" kind of guy, but that side of him peeks through every now and then and those moments made my heart almost burst with excitement for his character and the development he has made throughout the book. I loved the story line - albeit polar opposite from my real life. But isn't that what reading is about, escaping to a world outside of your own?<br /><br />Sure, I will agree with many reviews saying the writing was awful at some points, the same references over and over and over again became a little annoying, but I loved the book as a whole. The Inner Goddess reference annoyed me at first - but I think it added agreat insight into Ana's psyche in terms of how her body felt about Christian and his lifestyle, as opposed to her subconscious that told a completely different story. It truly portrayed the inner struggle Ana was having with trying to figure out whether to follow her head or her heart. I'd love to get a glance into Christian's subconscious (because we ALL know what his sexy Inner God is thinking) and see what it has to say.<br /><br />Read this book for what it is - not what you want it to be and you will enjoy is SO much more. Christian and Ana's relationship is so tumultuous - but yet so loving in a very unusual way. Look past the BDSM façade of Christian and there is no doubt in my mind that he loves Ana unconditionally. I knew it from after the first spanking scene, Ana is bawling in her room and sends Christian that scathing email and the next moment he is blowing past her roommate and bursting into Ana's room so comfort her. He CARED that she was upset and felt the way that she did. I don't know much about the whole BDSM lifestyle - and I understand from the book that when conducted properly is it meant for pleasure and is meant to be safe - but I don't think there are many Doms out there that would react the way Christian did with such sincerity for her mental and physical health.  Sure, Christian's a little (okay, a lot) creepy in the stalker department and has some way too intense \\"Mine\\" feelings about Ana - but he knows how special she is to him and doesn't want to lose her, even though he has a hard time expressing that to her. The only way he can show that is through possive behaviors because everything he wants is \\"HIS\\". Eveything he wants he labels \\"MINE\\".<br /><br />Here's my biggest issue with this book - $10? Really? For an ebook? For something that I don't necessarily tangibly have in my hands (let's not talk about the cost of my tablet that I have Kindle Fire software on. Because that is a very real, very tangible expense). I paid only $7/book for The Hunger Games and it was a much better story, writing experience and series (although Mockingjay was the worst of the series) and cost far less. As I read in another reader's review, there are a few British slangs/references that I would have preferred to have been \\"American-ized\\" just for my reading preference. I didn't think the sex scenes were as graphic as reviews I have read say they are - they sure aren't vanilla sex, but it's not horribly graphic like I had imagined. The tampon scene though - really? That was what killed me in terms of heebie jeebies, that was just weird.<br /><br />The reason I won't give this book 5 stars is because of the carelessness of the writing style in some parts of the book and the price of the book. I think it is a little unreasonable compared to other series of the same magnitude of popularity.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|It took me a couple of spins of Visions' first single, Oblivion, to get used to Claire Boucher's baby ghost vocal stylings, but by about the fourth or fifth listen, I was hooked. I immediately downloaded the rest of the album and I've been listening to it on repeat ever since. A one-woman electronic band, Grimes can lay down some funky beats, and she uses her voice like another instrument, weaving rich, almost ethereal, yet often danceable tunes, thick with rythm and melody. The album presents a good mix of uptempo songs and almost sensual slow burners, and it all flows together seamlessly. Her talents in composition and orchestration are truly impressive.<br /><br />Be forewarned, though: Grimes' voice is probably not going to appeal to a broad audience. She often sings in a pretty high register, or in a breathy whimper, and it takes a little while for the ear to appreciate her vocal talents. Her voice is actually remarkably versatile- sometimes she sounds like the Sundays' Harriet Wheeler, other times she sounds like Enya, and sometimes even, Stacy Q. The voice is the key component of her musical arsenal, though. She does all kinds of things with her voice, sampling it, looping it, putting it through a delay, using it as a percussive instrument. Coupled with her impressive studio talents, and her ear for melody, it is a potent weapon.<br /><br />Overall, Visions is a truly powerful and memorable listening experience. Like a dark, rich beer, it does take a little getting used to. But if you are a patient listener in search of slightly different fare, you will likely find it a rewarding investment.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|Although I gave this movie a relatively high rating, I totally acknowledge that it could have been improved upon---i.e., less cliches, script revisions, and tighter direction.  Still, this movie has such an interesting premise, that I wanted to spend some \\"time\\" sharing my thoughts about it.  I'm a huge Matt Bomer fan (\\"White Collar\\"), and to a lesser extent, Cillian Murphy fan.  Cillian Murphy, the Timekeeper, plays a dynamic role.  You get that he can't resolve the inconsistencies of the system that he has spent the last 50 years of his life maintaining, yet like Mr. Stevens, the butler in Remains of the Days, you can tell that he has moments of real doubt whether he has wasted his life in his particular form of servitude. Yet he cannot fully admit to himself that he misspent his life, nitpicking the seconds and minutes of the poor and disenfranchised, while the wealthy can afford to loiter indefinitely. The Timekeeper has the integrity to not be paid off by billionyear, Mr. Weis, yet the Timekeeper still cannot fathom another way around the current status quo.  He is nonplussed when Will gives him enough time to spare his life.<br /><br />It was refreshing that the ghetto wasn't racially or ethnically segregated, just financially segregated.  A blonde-haired man with a posh British accent was the most menacing gangster in this \\"wrong-side-of-the-toll\\" Time Zone.<br /><br />I suppose in heaven we'll never age beyond late young adulthood, but in the here and now, it would be very strange to see different generations looking exactly the same age; therefore, no visibly aging actor was featured in this movie.  I haven't seen \\"Logan's Run,\\" but that movie apparently has a similar theme.<br /><br />This movie doesn't really offer solutions, but rather points out how problematic it is for the few privileged to live at the expense of the many underprivileged. This excessive wealth and out-of-proportion longevity doesn't even really make these privileged few happy, as Matt Bomer's character, Henry Hamilton, attests before he times out. If we could all live agelessly, there would be issues of scant resources and overpopulation, yet as I chronically pester my Facebook friends, if we all went whole foods-based vegan, that could help prevent and reverse human starvation, as imported grain (now being forced fed to animals) could be redistributed to humans (i.e., a higher quality version, along with dried beans), and animals can graze on indigestible-to-humans grass, including grass clippings during the winter. (I only recently learned that the meat industry is a huge contributor to human starvation; I went veg b/c I love animals and could no longer pretend it was okay to love my companion pets while hypocritically eating meat from animals who likewise have feelings and are sentient.) This movie subtly (or perhaps not-so-subtly) preaches a dictum I first came across on a bumper sticker: \\"Live simply so others can simply live.\\"Bomer's character, Henry Hamilton, attests before he times out.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. Many levels that are difficult but not impossible. Great graphics. Just an overall solid game. Got this when it was free app of the day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thanks<br />Great app. It really works well and is easy to use. Helps me out daily and is totally free to boot.
0756405890|5.0|Yep he's that good. This book starts off strong and keeps getting better. I did not expect this to be nearly as good as it was. Intriguing, engaging, funny, sad, and very moving. I have now read it a couple of times as well as the next one, The wise mans fear. Bought copies for my friends and they pretty much feel the way that I do. Great Book. Truely a must have for your sci fi/fantasy collection.
4770030096|5.0|This book is ideal for working adults and students. It uses commonly used everyday vocabulary. Progression is slow and gives you time to understand grammar points one at a time. Explanations are clear and simple, sometimes a bit too simple, but it is to research on internet if you want to understand more.<br /><br />This is the kana version, which is good for practice, but you need to learn the alphabet before starting with this version. If you wish to learn kana at a lower pace, buy the romanized version.<br />you dont really need to purchase workbook.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|War Horse was advertised as \\"Uplifting\\", but I found nothing uplifting about this film at all; though I did find it realistic. There were many people and horses left dead in this film and it was a miracle (if a true story) the horse and it's owner survived, but after all the death and carnage that was left behind I really found nothing happy or uplifting about the ending. Very dissapointed with this movie and I would not suggest showing this film to a horse lover or children under 12 years of age. My wife and I are both horse lovers and from our standpoint this movie was absolutely horrible.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|The films in this blu-ray set look and sound wonderful. The problem for some fans like myself is that they are not the films we remember and would like to watch on blu-ray. The original theatrical release versions of the films need to released in high quality.
0439023513|5.0|War in the death throes of a dictatorship has Katniss being used and manipulated by a new leader in this third installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. In the end, it was fantastic to see her take action in a way that proved she wasn't willing to play anyone's games or allow another generation of the people of Panem grow up under the iron rule of a despot. Tight prose, read pain, and enduring characters made this not only a great book, but one of the best trilogies I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

1416972250|5.0|I know you are probably sick by now of reading my Mortal Instruments reviews, but I can't stop rereading these lovely books! I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible... here goes...<br /><br />In this third installment of The Mortal Instruments series, us readers find ourselves amid some very high tensions between our characters. Clary and Jace, Jace and Simon, Simon and Clary, Valentine and the world... really things are not going well for this race of Shadowhunters. As the gang from the New York Institute prepare to head to Idris for negotiations and to give explainations of what's been happening with Valentine, they are attacked by Forsaken as they enter the portal. This attack leads to a turn of events that leads all of our favorite characters on a journey in which they will fight for their lives!<br /><br />This book will make you laugh like always, but it will also make you cry. Cassandra Clare spares no one in the war against Valentine and as her story meanders through Idris, the fabeled home country of the Shadowhunters, we find ourselves mourning the loss of loved ones right along with her characters. Clare is such an emotional writer and I've come to love her subtle style of wrenching her readers hearts out.<br /><br />The Mortal Instruments series was originally meant to be a trilogy, but that plan back fired as Clare's 5th installment is set to release this month... and I'm not complaining! Because this was supposed to be the finale to the series, there are a lot of loose ends that are tied up and the book ends on an almost happy note, which is somewhat uncharacteristic of this series. I was almost disappointed that Clare didn't treat us to a tragic, cliff hanger ending... but don't worry, I've read book 4 and we are in for the some big surprises!<br /><br />Overall, I really loved this book. I want to say better than the previous two, but this one is so different from the other two in the series. Finally, we have Clary coming into contact with the place her mother grew up, the origin of the Shadowhunters and she finally sees herself as one of them. It was so great getting a chance to see Idris and this change in setting really does make this story stand apart from City of Bones and City of Ashes.<br /><br />That's all I've got for this one guys! Make sure to check out the other reviews for City of Bones and City of Ashes! I promise to start mixing it up again soon!<br /><br />Happy Reading!<br /><br />Allison<br /><br />Review brought to you by Allison at i[...]the origin of the Shadowhunters and she finally sees herself as one of them.

1453757430|5.0|This book is a bit different from other Christie's that I have read in that the detective, Poirot, doesn't appear until several chapters in and almost seems to be a secondary character.  It's a point of view that I found intriguing, and hilarious!<br /><br />The narrator absolutely cracked me up!  He is so dismissive of that 'funny little' Poirot, sure that the man is either crazy or absurd and equally sure that he himself will solve the crime.<br /><br />The mystery takes place at a country manor home that is complete with servants and where no one seems to have to work for a living--so very British!  The murder suspect seems to be ironclad guilty but leave it to Poirot to find that sliver of doubt.  There were so many red herrings in the book that I totally gave up on trying to solve the mystery.  Poirot certainly does nothing to help, agreeing with every ridiculous notion that the narrator has and leaving the readers to wonder what solution is untangling in his genius brain or if he is indeed the nitwit the narrator makes him out to be.<br /><br />Still, I was shocked by the ending.  Truly never even saw it coming and that is what makes Christie, still, the Grandest Dame of them all!  Jolly good show.
0757302661|5.0|This book coupled with the HypnoBirthing class supported two natural births in a hospital setting. I was free to move around the room and was in NO PAIN. I was so relaxed that my doctor said, as I was 10 cm and 100 efaced, that I might be too relaxed. My first birth was 17 hours and my second was 15 minutes. I suggest buy the book and find a HypnoBirthing practitioner and birth your baby with control and ease!!  [...]    Mother of Two:)

098357670X|5.0|This is an amazing book, Tom is such a great artist. He also has a pretty good way of teaching. You wont be disappointed you got the book!<br /><br />Edit... The content of the book & Tom Richmond's information is still first class but the book itself is absolute crap. Cheaply made crap that the pages fall out of. I have now lost the first 9 pages. I still have them but not in the book where they belong...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun for the whole family!  So many options so there is almost every type of game there available.  Should occupy the kids on long trips.
B0051RP4DA|5.0|He's done it again. He wrote an amazing album. i would never had expected this type of an album to be this insperational. if you like eddie vedder or pearl jam, this is a must have, you won't be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game but I only have one problem I cant add any body or visit ether can u fix this n it keeps saying to do this update but then it wont work please fix.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love that I was able to buy all 3 books together the way I did with the Trilogy on my Kindle. I didn't have to wait to get the other book when I was done with the one before it; I was able to just keep on reading!! And as always it having been on the Kindle meant that it was a quick delivery and I could take it wherever I went.
0385344228|4.0|What a great story!  I loved the \\"wow\\" factor for the ending.  I did not see this coming.  The courtroom drama was a little slow for me but I never was quite sure where the story was going which is why this book kept me engrossed.  This is a first time author for me and I tip my hat to you Mr. Landay.
0345803485|2.0|I gasped and said \\"Oh my\\" as I finished reading the first few chapters which made me blush incessantly and then inexplicably bite my lower lip several times after which I gasped and then blushed again.<br /><br />I continued to read and said \\"Holy crap\\"  as my subconscious started a violent argument with my inner goddess as to whether or not I should laugh hysterically until I passed out because of  the ridiculous plot and dialogue, the rather awkward sex scenes, and repeated use of annoying, sophomoric phrases and descriptions.<br /><br />In all seriousness, do I think this is a horrible book? Not really.<br /><br />Do I think this book was overhyped due to its connection to the overhyped Twilight series? Absolutely, yes!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Basically, it's an Ice Age version of Simtown.  If you are patient and play the game it's free,but if you like leveling up fast Gameloft allows you to purchase credits to speed up game progression.  Though the core plays like Simtown, Gameloft has included various mini games in it as well as some pretty sweet extras like the movie theater.  If you're a fan of population building games, this one's right up your alley!

B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and somewhat challenging puzzle game. I like that it has plenty of levels and that it tells you in how many moves it is possible to complete each puzzle. It also tracks your personal best for each puzzle as well.
0030565812|5.0|I am planning on studying abroad in South Africa this summer and have spent the past few months doing research about the complicated ethnic history of the country. Long Walk to Freedom was the first book that I bought, and yet it was the last one that I actually started. I have read a number of biographies and autobiographies about famous political or social figures and often find them to be nothing more than a chore (Steve Jobs anyone?), and as much as I was curious about Nelson Mandela's life I was reluctant to open the book. The last thing that I would have expected is that I would be completely captivated by a story that reads more like a political thriller or the script for an Oscar-winning biopic (which should seriously be made by the way).<br /><br />  You hear a lot about the kind of sacrifice that is required by political leaders, but for some reason all to often I feel disconnected from what that really entails from a distinctly human perspective. What a lot of people don't realize is that the policy of Apartheid was not instituted until after World War II, following the election of the Nationalist Party in South Africa. It is not to say that there was any kind of equality between races before that time, but it is truly heartbreaking to read an African's perspective of the rise of a modern party rooted in a policy of separation, hate and inequality. The idea that Mandela witnessed all this and continued to escalate his devotion to the cause of freedom on deeper and deeper levels to counteract the aggressive behavior of the government. It costs him his family, his law practice and in many cases very nearly his life. He freely admits over and over again throughout the text that there were moments of terror, moments when he was sure the cause was lost, and yet his response to aggression never varied from passionate, aggressive response.<br /><br />  Before reading Long Walk to Freedom I would have told you that there are virtually no excuses for armed terrorism or civil war. In America we hear the stories of Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi and their firm commitment to nonviolent resistance. Mandela initially points to these tactics as the best way to achieve freedom, but over and over again the government of South Africa attempts to crush resistance with a heavier hand than the United States or India and Mandela carefully outlines how this requires a response of equal strength. Suddenly I realized the \\"line\\" that must be crossed to the point when military action is the only necessary action. I embraced a struggle completely beyond the scope of my own life thanks to this masterfully delivered text, and it left a firm impression on me. I came back to this page on Amazon to buy two more copies of this book to give to each of my divorced parents, one for Mother's Day and one for Father's Day. I don't really expect them to read it, but I believe that the message of strength that Mandela writes about can be universally beneficial. I absolutely recommend this text.

I sent in a report and got no response in return. I'm deleting the game.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|So far I am really enjoying the game. No issues, although I went ahead and lowered the graphics quality, just to be safe.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this game but today it started glitching and now I can't play hopefully it'll be fixed by tomorrow I remember playing this game as a kid but they really changed it a lot its more like farmville and stuff from fb wish it was more like the original but still a fun game and yes you wait way too long for energy
B003GDYN24|5.0|This album is hands down the best album EVER!!!! The lyrics are beautiful the beats are banging. Kelis poured her soul into it. 4th of July is the best song off the album and its my favorite song ever.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|OK, this is a very polarizing film.  This review is geared toward the theatrical (2D) edition, does not address the many issues with 3D, or the multiple releases/director's cuts; other reviews have spoken to those issues at length.  For what it's worth, I saw the film in theaters in 3D, but am not into home 3D.  My view is that some moments are richer in 3D, but overall it's more of a gimmick than a true enhancement of the viewing experience.  But if you like 3D, this is a good movie for it.  As to the film itself:<br /><br />What I liked:  the \\"avatar\\" concept of having your body in stasis while you roam around as an indigenous species had some interesting implications to it.  Some of the creatures, and also some of the technology (weapons, ships, etc.) were cool.  Several of the planetary scenes (flying, hunting) were beautifully done, visually-speaking.  And reactions to the blue \\"avatars\\" themselves have been mixed; but I was fine with them (better than JarJar and his Gungan friends in SWE1/PM, at least).  If that's all you wanted, good movie.  However . . .<br /><br />What I didn't like:  many of the same things that have been fully-documented in other reviews.  Completely unoriginal plot.  No characterization.  The \\"heartless mega-conglomerate exploits the indigenous tribe\\" has been done so many times, and it is done here with no interesting variation.  And, I'm sorry, I know the \\"tree of life\\" scene was intended to be a beautiful and ethereal expression of their deeply-held love for their planet.  But I found it to be creepy and weird, not to mention blatantly advocating the green movement's message that we should love our own planet every bit as much.  James Cameron for President . . . of Greenpeace.<br /><br />So if you're looking for deep understanding of anything, don't bother.  Deep, involving plot?  Characters you care about?  Ditto.  But if you just want a sci-film that is a bit formulaic, but a feast for the eyes, then this one will work.

1451648537|5.0|I have only written one other review on Amazon  but I rely on amazon reviews on almost all purchases. This book was absolutely amazing - it took a bit of time to read on my kindle but I have to say that some of the stuff I learned from reading about Steve Jobs helped/is helping me succeed in business. I have had a great past couple of months and and can thank this book for that. Great read if you are interested in how to be the perfect business-man/woman or just on the life of an individual who left an impact on our world because he was able to think outside the box
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Its a wonderful game kids will love it.I would recommend it to kids that love farm games.Like I said love it!!!!!!
B002ZG980U|5.0|I am a movie collector.  It's getting harder to find movies to add to my collection that are not boring, predictable, disgusting or offensive.  This great movie is none of these.  Complex, multi-layered plot (no spoilers here) intense action, beautiful cinematography.  Plot is at times a bit hard to follow, but this is a good thing.  But not a movie to have on when you're walking around the room, catching up on your e-mail, or talking on the phone.<br /><br />What I liked:  mind-bending plot is a refreshing change from same-old, same-old, dumbed-down movie fare these days.  Cinematography is fantastic (opening Chinese castle scene is my favorite).  Action is very intense, but nary a car being blown up (for once).  DiCaprio is very good, and good supporting cast.  Could name lots more.<br /><br />What I didn't like:  I can't think of much, my rating is that this film is definitely a cut above the usual fare.  But the multi-layered plot-within-a-plot-within-a-plot could be too involved for some viewers to follow, especially if they just want to relax with some predictable action fare, that doesn't make you pay too close attention to enjoy it.  And if dreams have bad associations for you, rather than good, you might find some of the themes in this movie disturbing.  None of these factors were a detraction for me, but just trying to be balanced.<br /><br />Smart, cool, intense, original, great to look at.  Give me more movies like this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are a little too hard and rediculous but other then that its fun. i could spend hours playing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. The graphics are great and gameplay is extremely good. I absolutely love the goals but find it strange that energy has to be used to build
B0058VW36U|4.0|Games such as this one and Where's My Water? are so deceptive. They APPEAR almost ridiculously simple and yet, as you move up in levels, they require real thought, planning and logic.<br /><br />What I love about Cut the Rope is that the game keeps changing from level to level, employing different logistics/resources/tools in the way you get the candy to the little green guy. Some are not at all obvious on first glance, others are. Some I can finish on the first try, others require maybe half a dozen attempts. It keeps things fresh and exciting, knowing that a different way of playing the game is coming up, and wondering what it will be.<br /><br />I just adore the little green guy. He makes the cutest sound when you are dangling the candy over his head and he is trying to gulp it down. My dog's ears go up and she looks at me when the little guy is making this sound. It cracks me up!
B0071LLHO4|5.0|Naturally, the news of yet another reissue of DARE probably got a lot of eye rolls. But what's not so clarified with this release is that, aside from getting many bonus tracks from the DARE album sessions, also here is the few tracks from the Fascination EP that had never yet appeared on CD--along with bonus tracks from those sessions. What's CRUCIAL here is that finally, intact on CD is the Improvisation of Fascination as it was on the vinyl with the abrupt cold ending. Recent compilations that have included the mix have faded it out, leaving many fans of the original ending disappointed. Also on CD at last is the EP version of I Love You Too Much. Now--here comes the odd part...They've completely excluded Hard Times as it appeared on the EP!!! Yet it's included in an instrumental version! I simply cannot explain it. I don't get it. Good thing it was included on the Original Remixes and Rarities CD...<br /><br />Meanwhile, also of note is the fact that the Fascination EP, which is disc 2 and comes in a replica cardboard sleeve of the original vinyl cover, is not at all in the same running order as it was on the EP. Since it's an expanded edition (minus the vocal version of Hard Times), they've sort of scrambled everything around and thrown the bonus tracks in randomly between the original EP tracks as well. It just seems SO weird to have Fascination brought to CD and mess with it like this. And with b-sides, instrumentals, dubs, and 12\\" mixes included, aside from not including Hard Times, it's kind of odd that they didn't just throw in the 7\\" version of Fascination as a bonus track as well. This would have been the ultimate expanded edition of the EP. Of course, I'm grateful to have those last 2 remaining tracks on CD since I already have the missing tracks on other CDs (which is why I didn't give the disc 4 stars instead of 5), but it still would have made sense to have it all together.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that when the Fascination EP is referenced in the liner notes of this release, they actually give a nod to the organ intro of Fascination as the opening of the EP--yet that's not the way it's presented here since it's the 4th track on the disc. Also, they give nods to every song on the EP--excluding Hard Times. They simply pretend it never existed....<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is the DARE reissue to consider. Despite no inclusion of the Love and Dancing album (which was included on a previous reissue of DARE), Several of those mixes are included as bonus tracks on this collection. You also get an `alternate' version of Don't You Want Me, which is a slightly different mix of the original that brings out the background orchestration (sort of like on the Love & Dancing mix, which is included here as well) and the background vocals. The result is noticeable--there's even a curious little synth intro that I've never heard before in any version of the song.<br /><br />The discs come in a cardboard box. Just like the Fascination EP, DARE is housed in a replica cardboard sleeve of the original vinyl LP. There's an 8 page booklet with the new liner notes and the lyrics to just the songs on DARE. Plus there are cards replicating the front and back cover artwork of the original 12\\" releases of 6 of the songs. Track times:<br /><br />CD1<br /><br />1-1 The Things That Dreams Are Made Of 4:15<br />1-2 Open Your Heart 3:56<br />1-3 The Sound Of The Crowd 4:06<br />1-4 Darkness 3:58<br />1-5 Do Or Die 5:25<br />1-6 Get Carter 1:02<br />1-7 I Am The Law 4:08<br />1-8 Seconds 4:58<br />1-9 Love Action (I Believe In Love) 5:01<br />1-10 Don't You Want Me 4:00<br />1-11 The Sound Of The Crowd (12\\" Version) 6:28<br />1-12 Don't You Want Me (Extended Dance Mix) 7:31<br />1-13 The Sound Of The Crowd (Instrumental) 4:12<br />1-14 Open Your Heart/Non-Stop (Instrumentals) 8:41<br />1-15 Don't You Want Me (Alternative Version) 3:57<br /><br />CD2<br /><br />2-1 Hard Times/Love Action (I Believe In Love) (Instrumentals) 11:07<br />2-2 Mirror Man 3:50<br />2-3 You Remind Me Of Gold 3:37<br />2-4 (Keep Feeling) Fascination (Extended Version) 4:58<br />2-5 I Love You Too Much 3:19<br />2-6 Mirror Man (Extended Version) 4:22<br />2-7 You Remind Me Of Gold (Instrumental) 3:54<br />2-8 (Keep Feeling) Fascination (Improvisation) 6:13<br />2-9 I Love You Too Much (Dub Version) 5:53<br />2-10 Total Panic 3:292-2 Mirror Man 3:50<br />2-3 You Remind Me Of Gold 3:37<br />2-4 (Keep Feeling) Fascination (Extended Version) 4:58<br />2-5 I Love You Too Much 3:19<br />2-6 Mirror Man (Extended Version) 4:22<br />2-7 You Remind Me Of Gold (Instrumental) 3:54<br />2-8 (Keep Feeling) Fascination (Improvisation) 6:13<br />2-9 I Love You Too Much (Dub Version) 5:53<br />2-10 Total Panic 3:29

B007MNV5WU|4.0|I don't get why people are so angry about the 2 1/2 levels. There are updates that are to be released in the future. I think that this is a quality game and a nice addition to the Angry Birds Series.

B005HSL626|4.0|I played it on my boyfriends phone, and I thought I'd enjoy the game too, but it got boring after a while. It's a good time killer, though.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|I am soooo glad I decided to purchase this. I really LOVE this show, and this gives me the cance to go back and watch any episode at any time. This is how I'm getting my fix until Season 3 starts.
B004GYY714|4.0|I have the same problem with it on my iPod, it won't give me the names of certain songs. If they fix that, I'd give 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is a morality story which is appropriate for teens and pre-teens.  There is quite a bit of violence, but there is no graphic sexual passage.
B006FE83U4|5.0|I'm not sure how they did it, but to restore and old movie and make it look as sharp and clean as this one is amazes me. The sound and picture are absolutely brilliant on this Blu-Ray disc. If you liked this movie, you will love it in Blu-Ray. Do yourself a favor and experience this movie as it has always been meant to be seen.
B007JF87VS|5.0|I am so glad I finally decided to purchase the second season. I am so addicted to this show, and now I can watch the show whenever I feel like watching it. Thank you Amazon. I couldn't wait for the DVD to be released, and this is just as good.
B001VNB54A|5.0|very interesting series. viewer can see the character development as they progress deeper into the war. Also, comparing to the band of brothers, it shows more color as well
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Words can hardly express how I felt about this book.  A few might be, shameful, exciting, consuming, interactive, just to mention a few.  I don't think I've ever read a book that has so many different emotions at the same time.  It's like being in the middle of several people and having them all pulling at you at the same time.  Right or wrong I loved it!
0345803485|5.0|First of all, I see that this book has many mixed reviews.  Honestly, I'm shocked!!! I'm an avid book reader and read all kinds of books.  Some I read all at once.  But this book and actually the entire series I read within one week.  I could not stop reading from morning until night.  My husband actually became jealous of the book.  This was the first time I read a book that discussed sex in so much detail.  I felt as though I was a part of the book.  The characters felt like they came alive with each and every page.  I truly feel inspired by these books and felt that it has redefined who I am as a person and in my relationship.  Yes, I have read all the Twilight books and do not feel that these books are of the same caliber.  These books truly go above and beyond to describe a love story like none other.  I loved the books so much that I probably will read it again.  If you have an open mind to all types of books, then they are for you.  I highly recommend these books for women of all ages and for a book club if you are a part of one.
B007M6P01O|5.0|WOW!! This episode totally kicks ass!! One of the best ones of the season. I CANNOT wait for season 3 to start.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I was hooked from Page 1 and didn't take a real breath until the end....always returning to read just a little more and not really able to put it down.  Felt the topic could have been \\"ripped from the headlines\\" - recommended reading for all parents!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this. lots of xhoices.  great for all ages my kids love this and we fight o we who turn it is all the tome
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, was an easy read and finished it rather quickly but it was because I didn't want to put down the book. Have started book 2 and enjoying that one as well. Looking forward to picking up book 3.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|Madonna has been a superstar in the music world, and she will definitely remain so in the history books. She has also been involved in movies, and her career in Hollywood has not been as successful as she probably wished. So it was a surprise that she got green-lighted to direct W.E.,\\" a period film, with a moderate budget - big risk, I would say. But the movie, I believe, works. It is an honest, passionate and elegant look at one of the most controversial romances of all time.<br /><br />The film's main story is about the love affair between King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough). However, instead of telling the story as is, Madonna chose to include a parallel, contemporary story involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) and William Winthrop (Richard Coyle). The film opens with Wallis Simpson waiting for her first husband, Winfield Spencer, to have dinner together. He shows up late and is unhappy that his dinner is not served. He beats Wallis, who is pregnant, causing a miscarriage. We then move to 1998, and meet Wally Winthrop, who is also waiting for her husband, to have dinner together, something that also doesn't happen. In this case, her husband was having fun with other ladies. In her lonesomeness, Wally (who was named after Wallis Simpson), visits an exhibition featuring King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson's memorabilia, which would later be sold in an auction. While viewing the objects, she daydreams about their famous romance, in which King Edward VIII surrendered his crown to marry Wallis, a twice-divorced American woman. It was a scandal at the time, which caused the couple to live in exile. The rest of the movie deals with Wally's problems with her husband, intertwined with aspects of the royal controversy.<br /><br />\\"W.E.\\" is quite stylish and with a great, eclectic soundtrack. I found the comparisons of both couple's problems very interesting. And this is understandable, as Madonna Louise Ciccone has been known to be vocal on women's rights. This film, in addition of being about the King Edward VIII-Simpson sacrilegious romance, is also about courageous women and true love. I would venture to say that this film should be viewed together with \\"The King's Speech,\\" also a Weinstein production/Anchor Bay release, because it deals with the Duke of York, the brother that succeeded and inherited King Edward VIII's throne. The Blu-ray + DVD +Digital Copy edition of the film includes a making-of documentary (UK, 2011, color, 119 mins plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on April 30, 2012 by Eric Gonzalez for The Weinstein Company / Anchor Bay Entertainment.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|fun<br />this game is simple but fun you will enjoy it while you're supposed to be working just don't get caught
B007549YM4|5.0|Saw the preview and decided to give this movie a try. I can understand the wide love it or hate it reviews after watching this movie. The reasons for loving it and hating it varied widely as well so I suppose I'll focus on why I loved it.<br /><br />The movie begins at the end. The nuclear bomb goes off and the lucky few who made it to the basement of an apartment building were saved. The movie is not about why the bomb went off or what happens next but more about the degradation of the human mind when a group is placed in a small space with no hope and limited supplies. They have just enough supplies to last weeks but they lose their minds faster than they run out of food.<br /><br />I was impressed by the acting and have to say, the movie was brutal, depressing and truly disturbing but that is what makes the movie so good. The actors made you believe they were truly out of their minds because the effect happened slowly throughout the movie. The movie was really long so you can really believe in the changes but it might turn some people off because their is only so much depravity and hopelessness one can take. Oh, And to the make up department? You guys deserve an Emmy for the transformations of these characters. This great aspect only matched by the convincing performances.<br /><br />I did not enjoy watching this movie. That is why it is a complete success. It showed how humans can reach desperate lows and I have to move in the love it camp.<br /><br />******SPOILER************<br /><br />Only one minor complaint. I actually enjoyed the ending as it showed the main character getting out of \\"cage\\" of hell to get out into the open of another hell full of ashes. The great part about this for me watching the movie was how relieved I felt for her getting out of that basement because even an ash filled destroyed earth was better than that hell; but was confused as to what was going through her mind and why did she leave her fiance?

0439023491|5.0|I picked up the first book on a recommendation and thought it was a fun book to read.  Love, action, rebellion, and very well written.  It was difficult to put it down.  Catching Fire was well-titled.  I could NOT put it down.  I have the bags under my eyes to prove it!  It clearly sets you up for the third book, which I am going to TRY to wait until the weekend to read.  Suzanne Collins is now one of my top 3 favorite authors.  Bravo!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games that are fun to play . I play them all the time but mainly when im super duper bored.
B004ZJZPWA|3.0|If it weren't for the endless, clumsy shots of people flying thru the air, this would be a likeable goof, tho the decision to turn Van Helsing into the Ringo Kid is hard to explain. The Frankenstein Monster redesign is actually kind of neat (and his size is true to the book), but he is stuck griping about his tragic fate. Another mistake is the way every background goes on to infinity - just in poor taste. Kids will watch a drama without the silly effects overkill, especially if it includes monsters. Still, there are nice sets and costumes. Not a total failure, but flawed by an insistence on underestimating the intelligence of its audience.
0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain knows what she's talking about. A shy college student that managed to survive the very extroverted campus of Harvard Business School, she spent her first career years as a young lawyer scared to death of the talking necessary to her trade. Especially the dog-eat-dog vitriol throwing that often took place in such delicate negotiations. She's an introvert after all. Through many years of counseling clients, coming to treasure her personality, and interviewing well-known researchers in the field of introvert/extrovert psychology, she learned to come to grips with this inner trait, and to value it as a special part of her personality.<br /><br />But she would be the first to admit, it's not easy living as an introvert in an extrovert world.<br /><br />From elementary school on up through the career system, our culture has shifted from valuing character to valuing how loudly we can prove our  qualifications. Managers and teachers encourage group collaboration and interaction, organizing desks into pods of seven or more where students are forced to work together, and designing open office spaces with very little privacy. It's supposed to follow the natural system of pollination, where a good idea improves the more people you have discussing it. But for the introvert, this concept is scary, and often forces one of two decisions: either act like an extrovert, or content yourself with being a socially awkward student and co-worker.<br /><br />Susan Cain set out to change this trend. She divides Quiet into four sections: firstly, the rise of the extroverted culture, how it has affected our daily lives, and its negative connotations for introverts; secondly, the introvert personality itself, its physical characteristics, and the different studies psychiatrists have done on the symptoms of introvert tendencies, with a short detour into famous introverts; thirdly, foreign cultures that value introversion, and how this affects their school grades and society; and fourthly, how to love and live with the introverts in your life (as an extrovert) or how to open up with and value those extroverts in your life (as an introvert).<br /><br />One of my favorite parts about Quiet was learning about my own personality--oftentimes it's hard for introverts to define or even explain why they act the way they do: the way they think or argue, or emotionally process. It's not always easy being clear to yourself in your own mind, or dealing with the inborn weakness to 'lock up' and hide it all. Time and again, I would read a sentence and excitedly think \\"YES! That's exactly what I do. That's exactly why I do it.\\" One of the topics I enjoyed reading about was how introverts and extroverts act differently in society. For example, Cain writes that oftentimes introverts recharge best in solitude, while extroverts recharge best with social networking. Introverts start a conversation with the deep personal issues and end with the small chit-chat, while extroverts do just the opposite. And she even covers the issue of introverts and the Internet--how they act differently online than they do in face-to-face contact, and why that is.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed was the scientific discoveries in Quiet. Introverts are literally thinner-skinned then extroverts. Their amygdala-the 'fight or flight' sense-processes differently than extroverts. And there are many other scientific gems which I will leave you to discover for yourself.<br /><br />I would critique her style on a few points, however. Scattered throughout her book are a few words with negative connotations in our society, often used as swear words, that should from a Biblical as well as professional standpoint have been omitted. Cain is not a Christian as far as I can tell; she is not opposed to 'evangelicals' but makes no claim to it herself. Therefore, some of her conclusions and solutions to the issues introverts face and why they face them are clearly man-centered. I would certainly recommend as a Bible-believing Christian taking the time to evaluate as you go along. Evolution pops up continuously in how she believes the amygdala and other brain processes developed in introverts. I would disagree with her statements, and I took the time to write the correct Creationist-centered points in the margins. I recommend Quiet for older teens and up, and for those who practice careful evaluation with every book they read. Quiet contains much valuable and helpful information, but mixed in with man-centered theology that is not in agreement with the Christian faith, and therefore, should be discarded.<br /><br />As I took the time to carefully evaluate and refute, I was encouraged by Cain's refreshing encouragement for introverts. Quiet helped me to value my God-given personality and recognize its strengths that are often looked down upon or completely overlooked in America's extrovert culture. It also helped me identify weak tendencies in my daily relationships, that require careful thought and willingness to step outside of my comfort zone to overcome.<br /><br />I was glad to spend time learning more about this subject, and I hope that other introverts find encouragement to practice the strengths of their personality (looking at it as a gift from God) by using some of the principles that Cain collected and set forth in her latest book.<br /><br />I received this book for free from the Waterbrook Multnomah Blogging for Books program.end as a Bible-believing Christian taking the time to evaluate as you go along.

B0007KTBIU|2.0|There are highs and lows to almost all Disney fare, especially more recent ones.  The early days of Disney animation as easier to forgive because of the general majesty that came from the grand depictions of these fairy tales.  More recent entries in the Disney archives to feel more stilted and generic than they used to.  They aren't as sinister as some of the early films (`Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is still rather chilling today) and yet they almost lack any real bite to the point where they can become somewhat predictably boring.  `Tangled' was a refreshing rebirth so-to-speak; but can they really follow that up?<br /><br />I'm still wondering.<br /><br />So that leaves us with `Pocahontas', the 1995 retelling of the European settlers' first meeting with the Indians.  First of all, historically this is rather ignorant and it should not be used to help young ones understand the truth about our founding fathers.  This is given the glossy treatment most Disney movies are given and treated more like a Shakespeare play than anything else.  John Smith is Romeo, obviously, and Pocahontas is Juliet.  Sadly, Disney doesn't understand how to change things up.  Pocahontas doesn't feel like her own character.  She isn't any different than Ariel or Mulan or whoever else you want to name out of the Disney Princess archive.  She is a free spirit who has a formulistic father and a dead mother.  She follows her heart to a man or a path or a whatever that is against all logic and proves to be wiser than everyone else and thus there is that `ah-ha' moment and everyone realizes they should have listened to her all along.<br /><br />Bah.<br /><br />The singing, outside of that `Colors in the Wind' song is rather atrocious.  The actors here just can't sing.  The color palate for the film is a tad drab and doesn't have the usual grandeur that we have grown accustom to with Disney films.  Sure, those two little creatures (I'm referring to the dog and the raccoon) are cute, but they aren't the stars of the this movie; and quite frankly, Pocahontas and John Smith make a boring couple.y aren't the stars of the this movie; and quite frankly, Pocahontas and John Smith make a boring couple.

There was always one episode that I wanted to see and on TV they would never play it so with this complete series I can see the ones I want to see any time. What a great buy at the price. the delivery time was great and they were in great shape on arrival. Highly recommend.

0345803485|1.0|I really do not get what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />If this book is so popular for the \\"erotica\\" then people really need to get out into the world. This book is poorly written with no real character development. The same stupid phrases are used over and over and it's really quite boring.<br /><br />I can't believe I bought into the hype (literally).<br /><br />Want to start a notch higher, go read the Black Dagger Brotherhood series at least it's taken some thought to create the characaters.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This series is definitely up there with some of my cherished favorites now. It took me a long time to pick the series up though, the premise just sounded apalling to me but my sister finally talked me into it. It is written in a way that isn't disgusting but it's also not dumbed down. You definitely know how awful the games are without having the bad bits thrown in your face.<br /><br />Even though I totally love the series I am giving it only 4 stars because in all honesty there were a lot of times that I just didn't like Katniss, not so much in the first book but definitely in the other two. She's too cold, too inside her own head most of the time. And I HATED the way she always seemed to see Peeta as inferior and Gale was some kind of winder boy.<br /><br />I was rooting for Peeta and Katniss from the beginning... until she started getting on my nerves and I decided she didn't deserve him. lol.<br /><br />Despite these little annoying bit I definitely reccomend this series. I think everyone should read it!!!

B007HO392S|4.0|There's something to be said about being BLOWN AWAY.  I've always thought the phrase implied more of a `game-changer' - that things were definitely going to be much different after THIS happened - and, maybe kinda sorta that's what I found missing from Carrie Underwood's latest release.  Nothing \\"blew me away,\\" per se ... but, in total honestly, she did everything I've come to expect from her, and that's a good thing ... maybe even a grand thing!  She continues to produce likeable country set to likeable musical performances along with her immediately recognizable big pipes.  In short, Ms. Underwood can sing, and there's nothing wrong with being BLOWN AWAY by a girl who clearly knows how to belt one out with the best of `em.  If anything, she can leave those BLOWN AWAY sentiments behind, continue to produce albums like this, and she'll have a long career.  Everything here is `bankable' with only a few surprises ... so maybe while I wasn't blown away, I was still impressed with what she does to a song.<br /><br />That said, there are a few variations on her theme here, and I'll give you a few heads-up with a rundown on the tracks:<br /><br />Good Girl (4 out of 5):  This is what Carrie's career has turned to as a reliable staple - a driving pop rock rhythm laced with winning vocals - but `Good Girl' falls a bit short of the big sound by the refrain that softens up more than needed in the vocal department.  It's still a quality listen once it meets the bridge thru its conclusion; maybe it's all just a bit too predictable alongside some of her earlier work, like `Cowboy Casanova.'<br /><br />Blown Away (3.5 out of 5):  What is this?  Enya's back-up band in the opening and scattered throughout the track?  \\"There's not enough wind and alcohol to wash the wins out of that house ...\\" It's a musical request to annihilate everything that's been bad in an unlucky girl's life.  The lyrics are respectfully reminiscent of Martina McBride's best, but it's given a country/pop makeover for the sake of Carrie's vocals.  A big sound a bit different than what's come before, and it earns points for being something unique.<br /><br />Two Black Cadillacs (5 out of 5): Unfortunately, it suffers a bit from placing on the disc - it's beat and undercurrent sounds eerily similar to \\"Blown Away\\" - but it's vastly more interesting musically lyrically so far as this listener's concerned.  Country loves to visit its tragedies in song-form, and that's what's at the center of the track.  It's a metaphor about two forces in nature coming together and being forever changed by the consequences of that meeting.  \\"The preacher said he was a good man, his brother said he was a good friend ...\\"<br /><br />See You Again (4 out of 5):  It's an obligatory track about finding what's been lost once again in one's life and one's heart.  \\"I'll see you again ... this is not where it ends ... I will carry you with me until I see you again ...\\" There's nothing wrong at all in exploring themes that have been explored before so long as something new comes to the examination, and Carrie does the best she can with the material.  It's far more interesting musically than it is lyrically (all a bit predictable), but she gives it life balancing the softer moments with the bigger ones.<br /><br />Do You Think About Me (5 out of 5):  Nice guitar work set against some quieter vocals than we've heard from Carrie in some time.  There's some wonderful harmonizing here.  \\"I'm not even trying, but I can't stop smiling, do you think about me like I think about me?\\"  Country takes a lot of wallops from critics, but it's these softer songs clearly crafted on the back of strong, solid lyrics and the sound of the instruments playing that distinguish the genre from others.  Just a hint of bluegrass in a laidback romantic track is exactly what the doctor ordered today.<br /><br />Forever Changed (5 out of 5):  Excellent piano work opens the track about true love becoming true in only the way it does in the life shared between a man and a woman, as well as between a woman and her child, and even between a woman being herself.  What's lyrically interesting about it is that it underscores how wonderfully and magically our lives are constantly put through moments that change how we see ourselves and those around us for the better, even despite the pain and natural heartache that comes with growing older.  It's probably one of the best tracks here.<br /><br />Nobody Ever Told You (4.5 out of 5):  \\"Shine like a diamond, glitter like gold ...\\" Life is a mystery, and you never know what's coming ahead; but there's no reason to get all `hung up on the negative.'  Embrace the bad with the good `cause it's gonna be there whether you like it or not.  It's a pleasant enough diversion backed with a solid vocal performance - and another hint of bluegrass - that we don't hear all that often these days from Carrie.  Also, there are some violins / fiddles that perform wonderfully.<br /><br />One Way Ticket (5 out of 5):  Reggae-sounding track about considering a different solution than you've considered before: have fun, `cause we all have a `one way ticket' when it's all said and done.  Go where the pink umbrellas come with the drinks.  \\"Raise your hands in the air tonight, put a little love back in your life, get your feet up, and just kick it ...\\"  This is probably the most easily sing-along track on the whole album.  Pure musical fun!<br /><br />Thank God for Hometowns (2.5 out of 5):  A smaller, meditative sound about respect from where you've come from and how things are done much differently in a small town versus the big city.  It's a topic country performers know all too well, and, if anything, that's the shortcoming here: it gets done to death - even Carrie's done it better elsewhere.<br /><br />Good in Goodbye (3 out of 5):  \\"Some days you'll see the reason why, sometimes there's good in goodbye.\\"  No one understands a heartache when you're in the heat of the moment, but, as time passes, you learn maybe it was all for the best after all.  That's the message at the center of the track.  Again, nothing all that special, nothing all that grand.  Another obligatory track with mostly obligatory lyrics and music.<br /><br />Leave Love Alone (5 out of 5): Hillbillyish sounding rocker with some stunningly winning, sexy, sultry vocals performed only the way a winning, sexy, and sultry country girl can, and Carrie delivers.  \\"I just can't leave love alone.\\"  Again, and again, and again.  \\"Burn me once but it don't sink in .... I just keep coming back again ...\\" THIS is what she does so well, and it should find great success if her past is prelude.<br /><br />Cupid's Got A Shotgun (4 out of 5):  \\"He gave up on arrows a long, long time ago ...\\" Clever, upbeat, fast-paced country rock'n'roll celebrating love that comes from cupid's arrow ... erm, shotgun, that is.  Excellent musical performance with almost Gospel vocals.<br /><br />Wine After Whiskey (3.5 out of 5):  It's another musical metaphor about finding the silver lining in every cloud.  It's steeped in a very traditional `big vocal' performance - twangy guitars and heartaches - and it works well enough for what it is: a pop standard crafted around very specific sentiments.  Not all that bad, not all that grand, just a bit too predictable for my tastes.<br /><br />Who Are You (2.5 out of 5): Rising vocals built around a message of love.  Again, it all sounds well and good; there's just nothing all that fresh and different about it.  It may find life as a wedding song as it's specifically crafted around a woman asking who this man is before her, and, on that point, there's nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />Plenty of hits, and not very many misses, is precisely what makes Carrie a musical force to be reckoned with on the country and pop-crossover scene, and BLOWN AWAY is - for good or bad - not a lot different than what's come before.  Again, this is not to say - or even imply - thatit isn't a worthy disc: rather, there are some excellent cuts here that'll clearly shake audiences on the radio and at concerts.  It's a reliable performance built on a recognizable brand.  If you're looking for the next Carrie Underwood album, it's here, fans.  Rejoice!, but, as time passes, you learn maybe it was all for the best after all.  That's the message at the center of the track.  Again, nothing all that special, nothing all that grand.  Another obligatory track with mostly obligatory lyrics and music.<br /><br />Leave Love Alone (5 out of 5): Hillbillyish sounding rocker with some stunningly winning, sexy, sultry vocals performed only the way a winning, sexy, and sultry country girl can, and Carrie delivers.  \\"I just can't leave love alone.\\"  Again, and again, and again.  \\"Burn me once but it don't sink in .... I just keep coming back again ...\\" THIS is what she does so well, and it should find great success if her past is prelude.<br /><br />Cupid's Got A Shotgun (4 out of 5):  \\"He gave up on arrows a long, long time ago ...\\" Clever, upbeat, fast-paced country rock'n'roll celebrating love that comes from cupid's arrow ... erm, shotgun, that is.  Excellent musical performance with almost Gospel vocals.<br /><br />Wine After Whiskey (3.5 out of 5):  It's another musical metaphor about finding the silver lining in every cloud.  It's steeped in a very traditional `big vocal' performance - twangy guitars and heartaches - and it works well enough for what it is: a pop standard crafted around very specific sentiments.  Not all that bad, not all that grand, just a bit too predictable for my tastes.<br /><br />Who Are You (2.5 out of 5): Rising vocals built around a message of love.  Again, it all sounds well and good; there's just nothing all that fresh and different about it.  It may find life as a wedding song as it's specifically crafted around a woman asking who this man is before her, and, on that point, there's nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />Plenty of hits, and not very many misses, is precisely what makes Carrie a musical force to be reckoned with on the country and pop-crossover scene, and BLOWN AWAY is - for good or bad - not a lot different than what's come before.  Again, this is not to say - or even imply - thatit isn't a worthy disc: rather, there are some excellent cuts here that'll clearly shake audiences on the radio and at concerts.  It's a reliable performance built on a recognizable brand.  If you're looking for the next Carrie Underwood album, it's here, fans.  Rejoice!
0345803485|1.0|Poorly written and uninspired. Don't waste your time. James may draw the reader in by pushing the norms of sexual boundaries, but the plot is lacking and characters are not believable. Absolutely awful

B000003CMD|5.0|This is a fantastic album for a few reasons. They lost the driving force behind the band Duane Allman and their bassist Berry Oakley prior to release of the album. Also, the band was literally falling apart due to drugs, lack of leadership and personal problems during the recording of the album.<br /><br />They ended up replacing one guitar with the piano of Chuck Leavell, Berry was replaced with bass player Lamar Williams, and Dicky Betts stepped up to the plate with his songwriting and guitar playing.<br /><br />The result was an excellent album to follow up the successful Eat a Peach.<br /><br />The music side of the album is fabulous. Nothing could ever replace the slide guitar of Duane Allman, but Chuck Leavell's piano adds another dimension to the music.<br /><br />Although one of THE most overcommercialized songs of all time, Rambling Man, it is also one of the best songs on the album, musically and vocally perfect.<br /><br />This album is in the same stratosphere as Beginnings, Fillmore East, and Eat a Peach.<br /><br />In my opinion, this album marked the unfortunate demise to a great era of ABB music. The band would never again reach the same heights as far as creativity, sounding well together, and musical excellence after this album.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Ironic that the writing about something so hideous can still leave one seeing the beauty of the human spirit. Very scary but very believable. I can't wait for her next book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seeing the 2700 plus reviews on this novel I couldn't help but check it out.  After reading some of the reviews I read the sample that is offered - ~2 chapters.<br /><br />The very first thing that turned me off is it is written in first person, which as any novelist worth his salt knows is a cop out. Anyone can write in 1st.<br /><br />After that it all went down hill.  The writing is that of a teenager. Maybe this author is a young adult? Then it was all too unbelievable after that.  The way Christian spoke was like a hero out of a regency historical romance, not a 26 year old contemporary man.  An why would he, after all of 5 minutes, develop even an INTEREST in a mousy, non-confident, unattractive, clumsy girl?<br /><br />Glad I read the sample first.  I wouldn't even borrow this one from the library.  Good for her to have pulled off the scam of a lifetime!<br /><br />Does this ring a bell?  This review could just have easily been written about those vampire novels all the young teeny boppers are so crazy about..... Twilight or something?  I couldn't finish the one of those I tried to read either.
B001E45XT4|4.0|This headset is simply reliable,tough, and has good audio quality it can really take a beating, at first it may not be comfortable, but over time and a little stretching it will fit snugly. The wire for me has never came undone, or caused a loose connection, that things is freaking sturdy! Also to point out, a previous version of this came with a usb plugin, so I am using that and works well. The only down side to the headset, is that the wear and tear takes a toll and it may eventually snap in half, the plastic gets weak, and finally gives in, but that was after a year and a half!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|What you see is what you get.  It is a ka-bar (kill-a-bear) knife with a full tang (past the handle) and is every bit of 1/4\\" inches thick on its spine.  If you want a thin hard knife for fine cutting look somewhere else, I suggest Mora knives.  This hunk of steel is made for use and abuse.<br /><br />Here are some things you may want to consider before purchasing the knife.  It is big, definitely for outdoor use (thick thick spine).  It won't be great for detailed knife work.  Many people have complained that the included sheath can dull the edge.  It is near indestructible, like a cast iron skillet it can be passed down for generations.  I have sharpened it on a whet stone to where I could easily shave leg hair.  The handle could be better, which is why micarta scales are for sale, probably on this very screen.  The one star deduction is for the sheath which may dull the blade and is not very ergonomic due to the weight of the blade on the nylon straps.<br /><br />Also: There's a video on youtube where someone used citrustrip (paint stripper) to strip the black paint off the whole blade after removing the scales.  I've done this and it looks fantastic.  I am considering buying or making a kydex sheath.  Thanks for reading, have fun!

B0074QGGK6|5.0|I bought Austin Kleon's \\"Steal Like An Artist\\" on a whim after reading about it in Shelf Awareness, a daily email subscription I get about books and the industry. Being an author myself, a poet, and dabbling in painting and crafts, I like to think of myself as an artist. And like all artists, I'm frequently at a loss as to how to get the creative juices flowing and the muse talking.<br /><br />Kleon's book was the boost I needed on how to do just that. At just 140 pages, it's a quick read and is filled with insightful quotes, fun drawings, and inspirational photographs. I read it on my Kindle and found myself highlighting something on practically every page.  After finishing it, I immediately bought 4 hard copies - 1 for myself and 3 to share with my creative friends who I know will benefit from it as well.<br /><br />Kleon focuses on the fact that it's okay to \\"steal\\" from those artists, musicians, actors, painters, writers, singers, etc. who are our heroes.  We imitate them as children and want to be like them when we \\"grow up.\\"  So why now steal from them?  Kleon stresses that he's not talking about plagiarism; that's just copying.  He's talking about taking from the elements of those people that inspire us in the first place. It's the perfect way to learn and to eventually develop your own style.<br /><br />I'd like to think we can apply Kleon's advice to any part of our lives really, so those who aren't so creative might enjoy the book as well.  I especially liked his \\"log book\\" idea because while I enjoy blogging, it seems I can never squeeze in time to write out long and insightful blog posts.  His quick check list log book entries is a perfect way to take notes and remember the things that are important each day.<br /><br />A must-have for the artistic ones in your life, of if you yourself just need some inspiration.  I know I will be suggesting this one to my friends and colleagues for a long time!

B0071K5KWU|5.0|Tony Banks is known to many listeners as one of the founding members of the major '80s rock group Genesis. Like many talented rockers, Banks has turned his focus to different genres of music making in their post-touring world. Many performers have turned to forms of classical composition and film scoring  Some of the best known and most successful examples include Paul McCartney, Danny Elfman and fellow Genesis genius Peter Gabriel. I have not heard Banks' first Naxos orchestral release \\"Seven\\" but I have certainly read good things about it  The present release focuses on Banks' desire to write short, attractive concert pieces that may even include solo instruments. I think this collection succeeds on all accounts! The opening work, \\"Siren\\" is scored for solo saxophone and orchestra. Soloist Martin Robertson is a tremendous player and has an international reputation for orchestral saxophone playing. This is a bouyant and fun piece to listener to. \\"Still Waters\\" is a very cinematic sounding work with sweeping string writing and some nice solo lines for the horns. \\"Blade\\" is a very exciting, driving work with a wonderful solo violin part performed by the excellent Charlie Siem. This work has a bit of Celtic feel and I truly admire the chattering, propulsive backdrop to the soaring solo line. This was probably my favorite work of the \\"Six\\". Truthfully, every piece here is very entertaining. \\"Wild Pilgrimage\\" is a calmer work that does, indeed, have a \\"searching\\" quality to the melody and with beautiful string writing again.  \\"The Oracle\\" is a deeply fervent; almost religious sounding work with some very soulful wind lines. \\"City of Gold\\" is the longest work in this collection and it feels a bit like a small scale tone poem with some exotic elements. The score evokes grand vistas and a sense of discovery. In the booklet notes, Tony Banks indicates that these six pieces could be thought of as a set with a theme or \\"universal story\\" that covers the aspects of \\"seductress, journey, hero, quest, decision and goal\\"  As Banks also points out, it is up to the listener to attach those concepts to the pieces or not.  Almost equal compliment must be paid to Paul Englishby who actually orchestrated these works for Banks from the composer's piano originals. Englishby is a film composer of note and a brilliant orchestrator by these samples. I enjoyed these works a great deal for the genre that they exist in. I think Tony Banks would make a very fine film composer himself and these works are highly entertaining in their own right, especially \\"Blade\\" - but they're all quite good!journey, hero, quest, decision and goal\\"  As Banks also points out, it is up to the listener to attach those concepts to the pieces or not.

B0047Y17P2|2.0|I love Michael Connelly and his character Mickey Haller, but this was so not up to par.  I actually feel bad writing a not so great review of one of my favorite authors.  I haven't written the great reviews on his other books that they deserve.  But this one lacks all the excitement and passion of the others.  Please come back to us Michael.  You're too good to put out something like this.
B003EY7IUY|1.0|The first books were funny, you felt Rebecca's struggle and rooted for her to get her life straitened out. This book has her making massive mistakes, causing havoc in the lives of everyone she loves, and instead of trying to make things better she just feels sorry for herself. It's a horrible example of a relationship -- their marriage is nothing but hiding things from one another, lying, and Luke works late so often it had me angry at his fictional character. Her daughter, whom I thought the book would be about, made only a rare appearance here and there.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|it loaded but then it never worked on our Kindle Fire, so I can't say either way. We love Angry Birds Seasons!

0393088774|5.0|****1/2<br />\\"The Zax game of chicken resembles today's stalemate over how to speed recovery in the U.S. and Europe. On one side stand the Austerians, as Krugman calls them:... determined to slash deficits. On the other loom ... the Stimulators, who seek more government spending to create jobs... What sets this book apart is Krugman's readiness to address the anxieties of the Right-Going Zax.\\" -- James Pressley<br />*<br /><br />Krugman's own stand on recovery (Spend Now or Perish) is clearly stated from the beginning. He firmly advocates that, \\"Now is the time for the government to spend more, not less, until the private sector is ready to carry the economy forward again,\\" he writes, seeking to challenge P. Ryan and the Tea Party. The Princeton University professor, and Nobel laureate in economics, holds to the teachings of Maynard Keynes. The U.S. is suffering from what Keynes has once called 'magneto trouble', Krugman recalls. Our economic engine remains strong, it's just the alternator that's kaput. Stimulus* can provide the sparks to get the car cruising again.\\"<br /><br />the Nobel laureate advocates that government has to increase spending through borrowing now, when the economy is actually in recession, in order to stimulate economic activities, and help the businesses so that employment is enhanced. As incomes revive, resulting in tax revenue  increase and budget revenue growth. At time of economic slow down there is no other way to stimulate the economy but by borrowing spending (now at a low interest rate). This is the Keynesian argument, proven overtime, to help the sluggish economy to grow recovering out of the current freeze. Spending target to enhance production and boost services. Once that is started the government starts to cut spending, limiting it within revenues potential.<br /><br />Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in October 2008, at the peak of the American economy melt down, for his research, beginning 10 years earlier, that explained patterns of international trade. He is a prolific author, columnist, and blogger, and taught economics and international affairs, in Princeton, Stanford, and MIT. He may well be more popular for his NY Times Op Ed columns, that twenty of his books. He has been an enduring critic of President Bush's policies, winning him strong supporters and ardent critics. His current research deals with economic and currency crises. He wrote twenty books, and has written regularly for a broad public audience.<br /><br />In 2008, he wrote, \\"One of my favorite Keynes quotes comes from Essays in Persuasion, in which he tried to explain the nature of the Great Depression, which was still in its early stages, and declared that, \\"we have magneto (alternator) trouble.\\" The economic engine was as powerful as ever -- but one crucial part was malfunctioning, and needed to be fixed... The defective magneto is the financial system. We replaced the old, bank-centered system with a high-tech gizmo that was supposed to be more efficient -- but it relied on fancy computer chips to function, and it turns out that there were some fatal errors in the programming.\\"<br /><br />* Read my comment on Stimulusthat explained patterns of international trade.

B00723NWJE|5.0|\\"LITTLE BROKEN HEARTS\\" is a little different for Nora Jones, yet nothing drasticly so. She probably said it best herself when she mentioned that the 'Producer', DANGER MOUSE, took her out of her \\"known zone\\", but she didn't feel out of her \\"comfort zone\\". Different elements like 'tremolo' throughout much of the album, gives a little flavor of perhaps the 'spagetti western sound' of the 60's. A sound that a producer like 'T BONE BURNETT' might use, or a musical artist in the vein of 'CHRIS ISAAK', especially his earlier work. With that said, I would love to see 'JONES' & 'ISAAK' work together; that would be a great match. This album is not so much the rather quiet jazz album that her 1st mega hit, \\"COME AWAY WITH ME\\" was.<br /><br /> Shall we mention by the way what a 'huge' hit that became! After a rather slow start, 2002's \\"COME AWAY WITH ME\\" album grabbed '8' Grammys at the 2003 awards show. 'Five' went to \\"Nora Jones\\" alone. They were: *BEST NEW ARTIST; *ALBUM OF THE YEAR; *BEST POP VOCAL ALBUM; *BEST FEMALE POP VOCAL, for 'DON'T KNOW WHY' from the album; and *RECORD OF THE YEAR, for the Single, 'DON'T KNOW WHY'. The other ' 3 ' awards were: *BEST ENGINEERED ALBUM-Non Classical; *PRODUCER OF THE YEAR(Arif Mardin); and *SONG OF THE YEAR(Jessie Harris); for 'DON'T KNOW WHY'. -Also, it's become the biggest selling U.S. album of the last decade. U.S. sales total nearly \\" 11 Million\\" according to Billboard. WORLDWIDE sales stand at  \\"22.5 Million\\". Yet, Nora remains humble about it saying that she thought it might sale around \\" 10,000 \\"!<br /><br />  OK, so \\"LITTLE BROKEN HEARTS\\" probably won't be as big. What could be? That's a once in a lifetime thing! Still, you can't keep trying to repeat the same exact sound. And she has said as much, that she didn't want to repeat the same formula.She's made it fresh and interesting by changing things up a bit. And yet there's familiarity too. Listen to the beautiful, soothing sound of \\"MIRIAM\\". The prettiest song on the album,could have very easily fit on \\"COME AWAY WITH ME\\". However, the lyrics of betrayal belie the caressing, comforting feeling of the music. A little dark. Elsewhere you'll find some tunes that are more upbeat musically & lyrically. In other words, there's versatility to this project & experimenting with the textures, without going too far.<br /><br />  This is a very good, solid collection of songs, that you'll get more out of the more times you listen to it. Of course there's varying opinions as you can read here. Like they say: [\\"Opinions, - everybody's got one\\"!]  If you like NORA'S voice, there are no drastic enough changes that change that. The 'voice' is still there front a center. The music here never \\"overwelms\\" her voice. It only complements it in a little different setting.

1451627289|5.0|I am a prolific reader, yet had never read a Stephen King novel - I am not much on the horror genre.  And, while this novel has suspense, it has no horror.  And, really, it is much more about relationships, priorities, sense of purpose, etc.  And, of course, there is a healthy dose of historical fiction here.  Born in 1957 and having the JFK assassination a presence throughout my life, and intrigued by the ideas of paradox in time travel, I couldn't resist this one.  I can't begin to say how glad I am I didn't resist and how much I enjoyed this novel.  Now I am eagerly searching out another King novel that might approach the quality of thought and thoroughness of prose and description represented in this one.  I think I realized how powerful this book was when I was standing in front of a class, writing on the board, and realized I was feeling anxious about the developments of the novel - much like one feels when a relationship is in trouble, or when you know something is not right at work, etc.  I couldn't keep my mind on the class.  Very rarely is writing so compelling that the emotions begin to become internalized.  And while movies can make me cry - books very rarely do (okay, Charlotte's Web when I was 8.)  As I read the last page of 11-22-63, I was sobbing.  Thank you, Mr. King for a very rare gift.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|At first I was drawn to this but after a few chapters I was annoyed.  Mentally abusive relationships are not entertaining and frankly I find if you have to be defined by a man controlling you then you need to evaluate your life more closely.  oh and the lip biting thing is what i found most annoying.  The author mentioned it about a hundred times.  ugh. Not my cup of tea but if you are into erotic fiction then this is for you.
B00466HN72|2.0|After my 3 year old daughter seen this movie in the store we decided to get it for her for Easter. We got it from Amazon.com seeing as it is triple points. When we got the movie all was good at first. The main reason we got it was to put it on her iPod with all her other movies and tv shows. After going to Universal web page and doing the stuff there it took me to iTunes. When in iTunes the d/l started and it was d/ling something called Hop iTunes extras. Not real sure what that is as I have never seen it d/l any extras before. The movie would get to 10 mb d/led and would error out. I called iTunes and they had me turn off my virus scan and empty my cookies and delete the file from my iTunes folder. All of this took about 2 hours on the phone and when I tried to d/l it again it did the same thing so i had to call iTunes back. After another 2 hour phone call, iTunes told me to delete iTunes and my virus scan all together and try again. Sorry no. So I went and tried it on a different computer that is linked to my account and it still did the same thing. I called iTunes back and they told me to try to d/l it from a different network. So in other words they wanted me to load my pc up and take it another location. Sorry no. I did however try to d/l it to my iPod at another location but it also errored and stopped. Itunes has the cload now so I d/led another movie that I own on iTunes without any problems. I also d/led about 10 free tv show episodes with out problems. Next phone call I had with iTunes they told me to get another redeem code from Universal so I did and it had the same problem as the first one. I have not heard back from iTunes in over 2 weeks so think I just gave up. So the final conclusion is, if you are buying this movie for the iTunes didgital copy be warned, it might work, and in my case after 7 hours on the phone, 2 redeem codes, and over 15 hours fighting with it, it might not.
0446572993|4.0|Just finished this book after reading non-stop all day.  I do get other reviewers saying that the plot was preposterous but who cares?  It was exciting, fun, and original.  I for one am glad he stepped out of the Camel Club series because it was getting a bit stale.  This was definitely a page-turner and I enjoyed the twists and turns.

B00723NWJE|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars)<br /><br />I always enjoy Norah Jones' singing, and I like what producer Danger Mouse, a.k.a. Brian Burton, has done with her sound on Little Broken Hearts.  However, only three songs on the album really stand out for me: \\"Good Morning,\\" \\"Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Out on the Road.\\"  The rest of the material has a sort of ho-hum quality that always threatened to move it into the background of whatever I was doing as I listened.  Still, Burton deserves credit for an excellently produced album.  He added little subtle bells and whistles that spice up the sound, plus some equally artful adjustments to the vocals (a hint of reverb here, a smidge of double-tracking there).  The musicianship is also quite good throughout, including Ms Jones' own work on keys and guitar.  Ultimately, though, what undermined my pleasure with Little Broken Hearts was that so many of the songs, all co-written by Jones & Burton, are completely unmemorable.  Perhaps Norah is suffering a bit from \\"Ryan Adams Over-Productivity Syndrome.\\"  Maybe with all of her side projects (Little Willies, the Rome album, her acting), the focus on her own solo work was diluted.  Whatever the reason, this new album is very nice-sounding but otherwise undistinguished.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Instead of watching bits and pieces of the film I watched it in it's entirety today for the first time. Alien 3 is more of a dialogue film and Weaver's portrayal of Ripley was much more sullen. She remained interesting however. I was disappointed that Newt, a mega relevant charactor from Aliens, never had her name mentioned. With all the rightly emoted heartbreak by Ripley at the death of Newt, she never uttered an \\"Oh Newt\\" which is strangely amiss.<br /><br />The scene with Ripley and Bishop was engaging but I longed for an entirely reanimated \\"synthetic person\\" for charactor interaction. Alien 3 is unique in that there is very little gunfire, especially coming off the raging gunfire of Aliens. That missing element was never successfully counteracted. In turn, Ripleys every line became strong, and any return from her scene breaks worthwhile. It was almost as if she could bring out more in one word than ever before.<br /><br />The charactors were more often thin and I felt little concern for them. The setting though, and stylistic nature of the film, was more than ample. The early 90s CGI was a detractor but it may not have been for movie goers of that period. In a few scenes the alien looked puny. The penal colonists running around closing hatch doors was dizzying and weak. Child like \\"you hoo\\" words to lure the alien were unrealistic in such a fear oriented situation.<br /><br />The film was a hybrid of past greatness mixed with what was to come of the Alien franchise. And what was to come wasn't good. Sigourney Weaver held Alien 3 together just enough to make the film oddly interesting. The film makers knew it had run it's course, hence the climax. After this film, everything has became what I like to call \\"junkified\\". Alien 3 is a nice little last piece of one of filmdoms greatest heroines, and monsters!
0439023521|4.0|I hadn't paid any attention to `The Hunger Games' book(s) until I inadvertently saw the film a week or two ago. I watched the movie and rated it highly so I grabbed a copy of the book.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother writing a synopsis of the book, as a plethora of people have already done that. Furthermore, I'm not going to say that it ganked* concepts from this author or from that East Asian idea. What I will say though, is that Suzanne Collins has done a stellar job writing a kind of `Fisher Price - My First Dystopia' novel that is emotive, honest, and memorable. And considering the concept, it's not very graphic.<br /><br />The book is effortless to read. The chapters are fairly short, and the pages seem to turn by themselves. Towards the end of the book I was hoping for more pages to magically appear. Not since the classic Aussie war dystopia, `Tomorrow, When the War Began', has young adult fiction been so enjoyable to read and easy to crush through. I would even recommend this book as a good one for ESL kids who have an intermediate-plus grasp of English.<br /><br />`The Hunger Games' novel is better than the movie for a variety of reasons. First of all, there is a much deeper insight into the way Katniss thinks and feels - especially in regards to how she feels about the boys in her life. Secondly, the friendship and understanding between Katniss and Rue in the arena is stronger, more honest, and further developed. The movie does this part of the book no justice. Finally, the book has a lot more information about Peeta, as well as periphery characters that don't get screen time in the film.<br /><br />I watched the movie again a few days ago to compare it with the book. Needless to say it was wanting in many areas. If you rate the movie a paltry 6.5 out of 10 - you should still read this. However, if you enjoyed the motion picture, then this book is required reading.<br /><br />* Stole

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, the negatives.<br /><br />Okay, now to the positives. The plot, the characters, the ideas, the writing... All amazing. The author has created something truly great here. I had never read anything by Hugh Howey before, but based solely on this omnibus edition of \\"Wool\\", he has been added to my personal top 5 list of sci-fi authors.<br /><br />This is truly immersive story-telling, with well-developed, complex, believable characters, amazingly descriptive prose, jaw-dropping plot developments, deep concepts, and one kickass storyline. The last book that impressed me so thoroughly was \\"Hyperion\\" by Dan Simmons. \\"Hyperion\\" had a more mystical quality, wheras \\"Wool\\" is somehow more gritty and real. Both are examples of superior science fiction.<br /><br />I am so happy to have discovered \\"Wool\\"... It has revived in me a love of reading that I thought I'd lost. Thank you, Hugh Howey.

0741470314|5.0|I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed \\"Defending A King \\" by Dr Karen Moriarty<br />. .For people who are not really familiar with Michael Jackson , , other then the distorted media stories, that plagued this man, until his death and even after...it is a really eye opening book, because the man was completely different then he was portrayed in the media..<br /><br />I am so glad this author, Dr Moriarty, decided to retain control over what she wrote by self publishing this work, instead of letting publishers , who have a history of leaning toward the salacious when it comes to Mr Jackson, have the final say ,in the content of this book..<br />Michael Jackson was the victim of the tabloid press, cutting checks to anyone who had any thing negative or salacious to say for nearly his entire adult life<br />Truth was irrelevant ,<br />So for Dr Moriarty to take on the expense of self publishing and all the research is a gigantic endeavor and I commend her for that..<br />, .<br />, She also, has taken on the seemingly gargantuan task of giving the reader a very insightful study into the life of one of the worlds most famous people..<br />It details not only , the man behind the iconic pop image , ,the consummate performer, but that of the gentle humanitarian, as well as a musical genius,, who had an incredible gift for bringing people together..And yet was a shy and vulnerable person off stage..<br />. An artistic eccentric, trapped, living in a fishbow existence, trying to cope with an extraordinarily unusual life , constantly scrutinized by an invasive public..<br />A single parent trying his best to be a wonderful parent teaching his children about the world around them ...A world, it would seem , he was not able to be a part of due to his enormous fame,,All the while , trying to protect them from the prying eyes of the paparazzi..<br />A man , who it would seem, just wanted to be loved and understood, but , unfortunately, could generate millions or even billionsof revenue by being portrayed in the most negative and harshest manner .. vilified, exploited for profit in just about every conceivable fashion....<br />The business side of being Michael Jackson, the brand is also addressed.........The unscrupulous business associates , the constant legal troubles and lawsuits..The profiteers within his own camp that led to his financial troubles.<br />The criminal trial he was subjected to , due to his enormous wealth and celebrity , although completely exonerated....nevertheless , turned his life upside down and , forced Michael and his three small children into a nomadic existence that would unfortunately become his last years...<br />The misplaced trust Michael had put in others that led down a disastrous path, even his death..<br />.<br />Dr Moriarty covers it all....<br />Dr. Moriarty understanding of her subject ,and her ability to convey that to the reader,.... really made me understand how difficult it must have been for this man to just have the most simplest of pleasures that all of us take for granted on a daily basis.<br /><br />I really liked that it is almost written like a reference book, where you can go to particular parts of interest to you and get the info in a succinct manner....you dont have to start at the beginning and read through...<br />I think it is a great achievement to have all this information in one book ...in one place ...<br />I strongly recommend this book..<br />-----------------------------------------
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I bought this book back in September but was hesitant to read it after reading the horrible mess that is Water for Elephants.  I was afraid to return to the circus.<br /><br />However, I completely fell in love with this book.<br /><br />Two powerful men stage competitions of a magical kind between two people of their choosing.  The rules are rarely revealed and the two competitors may not know anything about each other.  Neither of them are treated well by either of their teachers, no matter what the relationship may be.<br /><br />A magical circus is created during the current competition.  The circus is only open at night and there are many tents, filled with sights and illusions that amaze and hypnotize.<br /><br />A beautiful and touching romance plays out during the book.  I don't want to say more and spoil it.<br /><br />The writing was so well done that I felt as though I could see everything perfectly.  I enjoyed learning about the characters and I really cared about them.  I wanted to know what happened to them.
0307948560|3.0|Unlike many of the other readers, I wasn't shocked by the ending. Kate's detiorating marriage and her struggle to have quality time with her children clearly hinted, I thought, that all was not 'well' and she was not really happy, despite her high-powered career. I found her character quite self-centered at times, but the author balanced this with enough sympathetic episodes that I still found her likeable.<br />I didn't think the author was trying to tell all working moms they had made a bad choice, but rather shone a light on a out-of-balance life where no one in the family was really happy with the current situation. I kept hoping Kate would wake up and realize that it wasn't just her husband and children who were unhappy, SHE was unhappy too.
6305428050|5.0|This movie is a classic, that I've been watching since I was little kid. I would recommend it for anyone.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The second season took me a bit longer to get through.  WWI is on and obviously, the series has to take on a decidedly somber tone.  The family dynamic changes as they open up their home to injured soldiers.  The young ladies of the manor are continuing to grow up and are dealing with heavier issues than simply what to wear to dinner.<br /><br />Overall, it's still a great season with wonderful performances.  However, there are a couple of out-of-character moments for the lord of the manor and a serious lack of screen time for Mr. Bates.<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to the third season.  I hope that it gets released on DVD here before we have to wait to see it on TV here.

B000001ELF|5.0|I asked a school mate and he lent me Ace's solo album in 1979 and I was blown away. Like many a review before mine, I consider Ace Frehley's solo album one of the best albums put out by KISS.<br /><br />Ace Solo Album defines the year 1978<br />Frehley's album  defines rock music in 1978. I have spoken to many a guitarist - most of whom loathe KISS with a passion - but admit that Ace Frehley is one of the world's best guitarists. Ace cannot only write killer riffs, but can play rhythm guitar and does the right solo for the correct song. The songs Rip It Out, Speedin Back To My Baby, Snow Blind, Wiped Out and the Fractured Mirror all testify to this. I could endlessly listen to Pip It Out and Speedin' Back to my Baby. Ace's album has stood the test of time, yet, remains fresh, There is a quality about it that is hard to define.<br /><br />New York Groove<br />The surprise hit \\"New York Groove\\" from Ace Frehley's album changed everything for Ace. He had confidence and measurable success - a Top 20 smash. The solo album release was a debacle and subsequently a HUGE failure. The TWO so called disco hits \\"New York Groove\\" and  the subsequent \\"I was Made for Loving You\\" cost KISS their US audience, BUT, opened up their fan base in Europe and Australia.<br /><br />Paul Stanley was extremely jealous with Ace's success. Stanley in the late eighties, circa 1988, attacks Frehley and refers to him as a guitarist who did not live up to his talent.  Yeah really ... what about the fact that ALL the good songs from the studio songs on Alive II - Rocket Ride the only \\"true\\" KISS song, the solo album success, Dynasty and Unmasked were ALL written by Frehley.<br /><br /> Ace was the first member to state that by early '79 that KISS had become a kiddies band and he hated the pop/disco numbers. This is why Ace's album is tight yet loose. Not bad for an alleged drugged out, drunken guitarist who could read the market and his own fans better than the the rest of KISS.<br /><br />The joketil this day regarding the solo album failure -  \\"they shipped Gold, and were shipped back Double Platinum.\\"<br /><br />5 out of 5 for this solid effort.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I love the show Smash and all of the actors are absolutely brilliant. I am disappointed by the exclusion of numerous original songs and covers, however I'm not going to lower my rating because it's still worth every single penny. Hopefully, NBC will release a second volume because there are so many great songs in the show.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I just watched this again recently and totally reminded me of how great a movie this is. Vince Vaughn and Will Farrel really changed the comedy scene with this movie. Its a classic like Dumb and Dumber. Great laugh!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|If I'd known in 1963 that the present was going to turn into such and interesting past, I would have paid more attention.<br /><br />This was a great book. Nice concept, even though I've been suspicious of time travel stories ever since John Connor went back in history to conceive himself. 11/22/63 was more like a mystery wrapped up in a love story, inside of a warp in the time-space continuum. Whatever that means.<br /><br />Another great hang-out book from the literal King of the hang-out book writers, Stephen King. Great characters. Interesting locations. If there's anybody out there in need of a best friend, Stephen King would probably create one for you for a few thousand dollars, but only as long as you can accept the fact they will die right when you start liking them most. He can make even the most boring places seem like sought-after vacation spots, or have them transform into the most pernicious hell on earth. Even though this book has an excellent ending, I hated when it was over. I always do. That's what makes it a hangout book.<br /><br />As it says on the jacket, this story is about Jake Epping traveling back in time to try and stop the Kennedy assassination. Stephen King apparently spent a lot of time in the Dallas/Fort Worth area doing research for this book, and it shows. Aside from having well-observed descriptions of the neighborhoods inhabited by Lee Harvey Oswald, he has one perfectly SPOT ON description of Dallas, Texas as a town possessed by an evil  unmatched since the days of IT in Derry, Maine. Having live my entire 59 years in the DFW area, I can tell you that his description of Dallas was not made up or mere artistic license. I never go into Dallas unless I'm armed.<br /><br />So sets the stage for one of the best Stephen King books of all time. Some features to look for: a swing-dancing cameo appearance by Beverly and Eddie from IT, dealing with thumb-breaking bookies to place bets on events with known outcomes, an obscene amount of school-teacher sex (Come on! I know you have always wondered if teachers did such things!), and plenty of people dying in hideous ways. It wouldn't be a Stephen King book without that.<br /><br />To consider a novel (or a movie) successful, I have to feel afterwards as if I have been someplace and done something. After reading 11/22/63 I have been on a great adventure, made new friends, and returned home breathless and bewildered. I say you've gotta read this one, otherwise you'll look back forty years from now and wish you'd paid more attention.
1589946901|5.0|Purchased after playing once with a friends game.  Very fast to play and easy to understand strategy.  It really does a great job carrying the fun and spirit of blood bowl without you needing any knowledge of the board game.<br />There is a limited number of teams and cards.  My group has played several times, each for less than 2 hrs and had tons of fun.  I dont think its a game you could play all day, but a great change of pace for gameing.  Too much strategy to be classed as \\"beer and pretzels\\" game, but close.<br />Overall GREAT!  I highly recommend to any gaming group.
145162445X|5.0|Do you like learning about reality and the universe?  Do you ever wonder about the cosmos we are and live in?  If you would like to learn some of the latest ideas about the awesome universe (or possibly multiverse) we live in, I would highly suggest reading or listening to this book.<br /><br />Don't think you have enough time to read a book?  Do what I do, and listen to the audio version while spending time getting ready in the morning. The book will go so quickly, and your morning will be more enjoyable!!
0439023513|5.0|My favorite book in the Hunger Games series by far. I love the ambivalence the book captures about war, making you doubt, throughout, whom you can really trust. War is brutal and dirty and the phrase that the victors write the history books so often rings true. The winners end up the good guys, yet it is hard to identify who the `good guys' really are given the inhumanity and brutality on all sides of the fighting. The Hunger Games relates that perfectly. Of course the Capitol is evil and President Snow a vile character you cannot wait to see captured and killed. Yet, you never know whether you can trust the rebels, in fact, you have lingering doubts about what would happen if they win. The government in 13 evokes images of North Korea with military training for everyone, government-issued uniforms, food rations and imprinted daily schedules. The rebel soldiers shoot indiscriminately - aiming for their targets but shooting innocent civilians in the crowd. A blood-stained yellow coat of a little girl, shot while screaming to rouse her fallen mother is one of the most powerful images Collins evokes.<br /><br />How much should notions of justice and human dignity give way to utilitarian concerns? Collins continuously keeps that thought on your mind. The ultimate test for the reader was when the parachute bombs, dropped by the rebels, detonated in the hands of children and their rescuers. It was a calculating move, designed to end the war as quickly as possible to minimize the number of casualties. As readers, we are repulsed and do not buy for a second that it vindicates Coin. We know there is no justification for such a move, and yet - wasn't this our explanation for dropping a nuclear weapon on thousands of Japanese civilians? Wasn't this our justification for dropping two, as the Japanese were on the verge of surrender? Collins lets you see the imperfections of human nature completely, she gives you no easy choices. Instead, as is often said in American politics, you choose the lesser of two evils, and settle for the rebels. President  Coin wants to defeat Snow, the tyrant behind the oppression of the districts and the Hunger Games that pit innocent children of terrorized district residents into a death match. Yet, it is not difficult to see that what drives President Coin is the desire for power not a sense of justice. She wants to replace Snow and anoint herself. Thus, while you want Katnis to succeed you are simultaneously hesitant for that to happen. Would Coin take over if she does? Would there be another rebellion once Coin becomes tyrannical? Of course Katniss sees the dilemma as clearly as you do and her radar on trustworthy characters is precise. She never trusts Coin and, in the end, launches her arrow resulting in the woman's demise. Collins never tells you what political arrangement the districts establish, but it seems to work, at least long enough for Katniss to lead a semi-happy life. But I also like how Collins ends the novel. She leaves Katniss a bit broken, with nightmares that never go away, because that's real. Life does not end with a kiss and people who have witnessed war and horror, people whose families were killed and people who have killed, are never undamaged in the end and Collins's 'happy' ending takes that into account.<br /><br />I also love Collins's commentary on the media and the importance of proper messaging in a war, rivaling the importance of manpower and weaponry. The cameras do not stop following Katniss around as she leaves the arena behind. In fact, they are essential to the rebels' battle. Collins fully understands the \\"hearts and minds\\" tactic of warfare. Instead of having her hero brazenly call the shots and charge ahead, she puts Katnsis at the direction of the video crew who follow her around. Katniss's power lies more in her celebrity than in her ability to fire an arrow. We can see that from the moment Katniss inadvertently sparks the rebellion to the final battle, where the rebel army, not Katniss, secure Snow's mansion. Katniss's undergound flight towards the capitol ends up being futile and possibly unnecessary sacrifice of lives (although it is hard to tell, since these people might have died anyway) and Katniss, though clever and rebellious is a tool for both regimes through out most of the series. Which is exactly as the books should have been written - as an examination of warfare and group strategy not the lone wolf hero's quest for justice. It is much more realistic that way and I love Collins for giving us that reality.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Now, I did not purchase this book. I was able to find it online and read it. For free. Even so I wish I could get my time back. I could not finish it. I read more than 50% of it.<br /><br />This is a man who gets off on abusing someone. Controlling her completely. And it is totally fine. Now, would all of you women out there be so quick to hop on the bandwagon if he wasn't as \\"sexy\\" as he is? Would you want your daughters going after a man who is obviously in no position to be in a relationship with someone? Yes yes, he is damaged goods and she can DEFINITELY change him (Please note my sarcasm).<br /><br />Apart from the fact that the writing in this book is simply terrible, it is a rip-off of Twilight. Really? Copper colored hair? You couldn't even make the effort to make him blond? Or something else that would make it seem less like a complete rip-off?<br /><br />How this has made it to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list I will never understand. How this can be considered literature, I do not understand. The writing is simply terrible, and the message it sends is even worse. NO I'm not a prude. Trust me. The sex doesn't bother me. It's the fact that this girl can see that what she is doing is wrong, she doesn't like what he's doing to her for the most part, but all of that is completely ignored because he is an attractive man.<br /><br />If I could give this book less than 1 star, I would.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire, the second book in [[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy]], is the fallout from the 74th Annual Hunger Games in the first novel.  The title can mean either \\"catching h e l l\\" or \\"catching the girl on fire.\\"  Either way, things aren't good for our favorite female Tribute from District 12.  At the end of [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]], the Capitol was *not* pleased with Katniss Everdeen's stunt to kill both she and Peeta if they couldn't both survive, thus resulting in no victor for the Games.  In letting them both live, the Capitol appeared weak, especially President Snow.  Now, he's out for revenge.<br /><br />Catching Fire is the [[ASIN:B000FQJAJG Empire Strikes Back]] of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  The rebel forces may have won initially, but now it's the empire's turn to take back what they feel is rightfully theirs.  Katniss is Princess Leia.  Gale is Han Solo.  Peeta is Luke Skywalker.  Cinna is Obi Wan Kenobi.  Haymitch is Yoda, albeit a drunken one.  Effie is the nagging C3PO.  President Snow is Darth Vader.  The Peacekeepers are the Stormtroopers.  Even when Gale tells Katniss, \\"I love you,\\" she replies, \\"I know.\\"  That's classic Han and Leia from the Empire Strikes Back, down to their exact quotes.<br /><br />I won't go into details about the novel, which would result in spoilers, but I will mention that whereas The Hunger Games was a complete story from beginning to end, Catching Fire is merely a segway between the first and third novels.  It's obviously part of a larger story, as one can tell by its Empire Strikes Back ending.  It leaves you hanging, knowing that there's a third book -- pardon the pun -- waiting in the wings.<br /><br />I was already invested in the characters from the first novel (and adapted movie), so the second book held my interest equally well.  There's no way, though, that you could pick up the second book and enjoy it much without having read or seen the first Hunger Games.  It's not written to be a stand-alone tale, but this continuing story was well-written by Suzanne Collins, as she immerses you deeper into the world of the Capitol and its Districts.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that Catching Fire gives us a much weaker Katniss than the initial Hunger Games novel.  In this one, she's ruled by her emotions for boys (e.g., Gale and Peeta) like a typical teen girl.  I found it a bit off-putting, considering the strong Katniss that we already met in the Hunger Games.  Jealousy over Gale and other girls just didn't fit with her character.<br /><br />Catching Fire wasn't as entertaining as the original Hunger Games, but it was still worth the read.

B004TACMZ8|1.0|Wow! I pity the poor fool trying to make a living using this thing. I own 3 other stud finders and decided to go for, what I perceived to be, the best. I have purchased plenty of fine Bosch tools so I arrived at the conclusion that all of the individuals rating this stud finder so low just didn't know how to use it. Later I would reveal to myself that this was indeed a pompous conclusion.<br /><br />Then I bought one. My background is in Electrical Engineering so I do know a thing or two about how these devices work. I decided to put the Bosch Scanner to the test. First, I scanned a section of wall with three studs on 16 inch centers sheeted with standard 1/2 inch dry wall.<br /><br />This was a relatively simple task as the bays were clear of any pipes, wire or insulation. I used a $15 Zircon, a $25 Zircon and a $20 Stanley to map the area. As expected, all three found the studs accurately. I had been using these 3 units for years and trusted all for this type of scan. I marked the studs on a strip of painters tape about 6 feet long to document the results.<br /><br />Then I attempted to settle the Bosch unit down and let it self calibrate over a known empty bay. The Green Ring lit up and I thought this is sweet! That was it for the excitement. As I moved the unit across the tape the blasted thing beeped and showed center about every 3-4 inches. I tried everything above and below the tape marked with the other stud finder's results.<br /><br />Other Notes:<br />The readability of the LCD display is ridiculous! This one had to be held about 20 degrees above eye level to see anything. Ah, but I thought, If I turn it upside down I will not have to squat to get readings below neck high. I could see it alright, but it was still incorrect and really cumbersome to use upside down.<br /><br />I cannot imagine how Bosch let this thing get on the market. Maybe this was a LEMON but if it was: There are most assuredly too many lemons produced with this model.<br /><br />By theway, the electrical wire sensor never did work even with a loaded circuit of 100 Watts. The metal finder did find the drywall nails, but so can my $1.25 swivel magnet nail finder. I have no embedded ferrous or nonferrous metal pipes in my walls, so to be fair; I could not test this function.

1451627289|5.0|When I was a law student, I met a woman who was a secretary in a law office where I worked during the summer of 1974.  She was funny, energetic and cute.  I admired her greatly, because she had been raped and worked tenaciously to see that her rapist was prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned.  She openly talked about it and had obviously converted this horrific experience into personal empowerment and growth.  Anyway, she was obviously very interested in me and eventually gave me her phone number.  I never called her, because I was  a typically snobbish 23 year-old -- even though we both came from working class families, I was going to be a lawyer and she was \\"just\\" a secretary.<br /><br />I don't think Karen (real name) and I would have been lovers; there were just too many differences between us.  But I do think we could have become good friends.  At 61, I feel the absence of good friends more than I do all the lovers I never had.  For anyone who has ever wished they could go back and change something in their past, Stephen King's 11/22/63 is a must-read book.<br /><br />At 842  pages, it is much too brief.  I flew through it in 9 days.  I think King is truly the greatest living American storyteller; a synonym for \\"page turner\\" must be \\"Stephen King.\\"  The framework of the story is the attempt of the narrator (Jake Epping in the present; George Amberson in 1958 - 1963) to travel back in time to save President Kennedy's life.  But the real themes of the story are the universal ones; love, loss, paths not taken, second chances -- this is after all, a time travel story -- and redemption for one's mistakes.  The love story between Jake/George and Sadie can break your heart; I teared up more than once.<br /><br />For the Baby Boom Generation (I am a card-carrying member), King really makes the early '60's resonate.  Things I haven't thought of in a long time (party lines, dial phones, puritanical sexual attitudes -- Jake and Sadie are school teachers who have to be verydiscreet about their affair or risk their jobs in a small town near Dallas) come vividly back to life.  And King's deep knowledge of contemporary music is evident in every chapter.<br /><br />The book is not perfect.  King's depiction of the effects of changing history are so over the top that it just wasn't possible to suspend disbelief; tragedy can become pathos if done to excess.  But, mercifully, that chapter was short.  The ending of the book, somewhat reminiscent of the ending of the Time Traveler's Wife -- with one major difference -- was so true and so bittersweet that it will resonate with anyone, like me,  who has ever wished \\"if only I could go back and do that right this time\\".  Which is to say, everyone.

145162445X|5.0|Anyone interested in current state of fundamental physics should read and understand this book.<br />Because it is written in plain words allowing non physicists to understand what science has achieved so far in understanding the basic functioning of the universe we live in.<br />I have read many bad reviews and all of them complaining that Mr. Krauss is wrong because his opinion is in collision with their religious beliefs. Well , here's the news for them. Universe does not care for your expectations. Universe was here, functioning very well long before your caveman ancestors produced the holy book based on their imagination and lack of knowledge.<br /><br />Example:<br />maverick909 writes: \\"not all religious people who see God as the answer to the basic philosophical cosmological question -- rather than the scientific question -- are idiots\\".<br />Mr Krauss does not claim that they are idiots. He claims that they are WRONG!<br /><br />Back in ancient days of scarce knowledge when your holy book was written cosmology was a part of philosophy and the Earth was considered to be flat. We (not you) made a lot of progress since then. We now have methods more exact then pure imagination to get the explanation of things around us.<br />It was science that created your car and your TV, not god. Try expanding that line of thinking to all of creation ... where whales are mammals, unlike what your god told Jonas.

B004OYCUWE|5.0|Finally got around to opening and listening to this, start to finish, up loud. It sounds flippin' amazing. If you're a fan of Prince's early work (or all) and are considering picking up a copy of this record, do it, especially if you are fond of vinyl and how it can pull you INTO the music. It's an awesome record by itself, but this issue of it will make your jaw drop in awe at it's sound.<br /><br />I noticed a significant amount of dust particles on the record when I took it out of the sleeve. I put it on the turntable and gave it a quick wiping with an anti-static brush and a very small amount of record cleaner, let it dry before playing and didn't notice one click or pop... I only heard one of the best albums ever created.

B0026IUXME|4.0|If you like war movies, you will like this one.  This is NOT for kids, there are some very disturbing scenes. It was an accurate depicting of what the Nazi's did to the Jews.  TERRIBLE!  This is not a movie I would watch a second time.
B007MDB71O|4.0|There's a line about a character from the movie Sin City that goes: \\"He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century.\\"<br /><br />That sentiment somewhat applies to John Carter, in that while its effects are as modern as they come, the script feels like it grew from the 1980s, and I mean that as a compliment.  It was a fantastic time for action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy films. John Carter is impressive in its creation of a world, but it's also impressive in how deftly it avoids many annoying trappings of modern films of its like.  Sidekicks aren't annoying, there aren't any pop culture references, no wink at the camera nonsense.  It manages to not take itself too seriously, while also sticking wholly to its own world.<br /><br />Story in quick form:  a former Confederate soldier on a gold hunt ends up being transported to Mars, which contrary to popular belief is teeming with life--life that wants to kill other life.  Much as he wants to avoid war, Carter is swept up in one far, far from his home.<br /><br />That description does little justice to the movie.  War?  Not a fun subject, and often its the climactic \\"charge!\\" scene to many of today's sci-fi and fantasy movies.  John Carter keeps the pace strong throughout with good humor, amazing effects, and action scenes you can follow easily, from tower-hopping to airship-traversing sword fights to a little dog-monster that manages to be adorable while biting people's heads off.<br /><br />I fell in love with the movie because of the jumping most of all.  Because of the lower gravity on Mars and Carter's muscle density (or something), he's a lot stronger and more spry on Mars than he was on Earth.  He can leap all over the place and it's when he's doing this that the movie's magic comes to life.  Jumping between airships, jumping between towers, jumping from battle to battle--you want to be doing the same.<br /><br />The effects are amazing, the score is a classic--if I had to complain, I'd say there are a couple clunky lines and the beginning is a little messy, though it quickly straightens out.  What's stronger than all that is the heart of this movie, and I don't mean in the sappy family film sense.  I mean there's a heart of courage, strength, a sense of old school right and wrong that I normally don't get invested in, but here it was all so fun that I couldn't help enjoying it.  The movie really came together when you realize just how insidious the situation of the war is, and how important it is that John Carter is an outsider coming into this situation.  He's someone who can change it.<br /><br />Overall, don't come into this as cynically as I did.  The movie had to win me over, and it did, but it shouldn't have had to.  John Carter is about having a good time. If you're looking for that, you'll find it here. My DVD's already pre-ordered.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I couldn't finish it. And I always finish a book. It was that bad. Where in the world did all the five star reviews come from? None of the characters were likeable, and the love story was a mix of silly and outright disturbing. I just gave up when the mob entered the scene.

0385342063|3.0|I would give this book 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and really liked all of them.  Generally, they are laugh out loud funny, with endearing characters and a good story line.<br /><br />This latest book has a tiny bit of each of these, but is, as others have pointed out, a little predictable, not nearly as funny as the rest of Ms. Kinsella's books with ok characters and a thin story line. It's almost as though she was in a hurry to go ahead and publish a new book and basically recycled some old materials, taking characteristics from her most successful heros and heroines and dumped them into this book.<br /><br />I still got through the whole book and actually laughed out loud once (Poppy, the main female character does a song and dance routine to Beyonce's music that's very funny).  But I have come to expect so much more from this writer that I was a bit disappointed with this latest effort.

B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|Very Bad Things is a horrible film. It is one of those movies that put you through the wringer. It doesn't tickle the real action  bone -- it pulverizes it. You don't know whether to see the real fight , sex, or if you simply want to walk out of this horrible movie.
B005S9EJZA|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW #29: \\" The Lucky One \\"<br /><br />Director Scott Hicks (The Boys Are Back, Shine) has done an amazing job on this film. He has taken a simple story with complicated characters and made them emotionally accessible to your heart in a believable environment.<br /><br />This is the story of one man's emotional journey starting after his third tour in the Middle East who ends up going back home to Colorado only to end up walking, yes walking, all the way to the south in Louisiana all because of a photograph he found in wartime. What's important about this photo? This photo actually saves his life. You'll have to see the movie to see how.<br /><br />Zac Efron (17 Again, High School Musical 3) pulls his most amazing performance yet. He has grown of the teen cult phenomenon he was to an actual actor with depth and range. His performance is subtle, quiet and extremely real. His honesty and passion shine through his low keyed physical actions. I was really impressed with his performance.<br /><br />Logan (Efron) pursues the image in a picture that literally saves his life only to find this woman in the picture, played brilliantly by Taylor Schilling (Mercy), has a son with a similar loss/past. Her mother, play by Blyth Danner (Futureworld, Meet The Parents), was an amazing support for both these young people to understand what they both need most. The young son played by Riley Thomas Stewart (How I et Your Mother, House M.D.) was amazing and added to this small cast ensemble as a real believable motivator for both his mother and this new `kennel hand' name Logan.<br /><br />The next standout performance was played by Jay R. Ferguson (Mad Men, No Ordinary Family) Beth's (Shilling) ex-husband. He was evil personified. He gave reasons for why the passion in everyone in this film was focused on the family unit and why taking care of yourself does includes your family.<br /><br />The somewhat slower than normal screenplay was written by Will Fetters (Georgetown) based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks who gave those other heart-tugging novels like `The Notebook', `Dear John', `Nights at Rodanthe' and `Message In a Bottle'. This author knows how to pull your heart-strings - hard. And the screenplay was well translated.<br /><br />The movie has lots of laughs, lots of tension, lots of heart and you'll need a Kleenex or two for everything else - I would call this a great date movie and a great way to get in touch with what's really important for relationships - passion.  I would definitely see this one again.

B0034G4P1W|3.0|MOVIE REVIEW #28: \\" Pirates: Band of Misfits \\"<br /><br />Well....I love Aardman films....(creators of Wallace & Grommit)...and directors Peter Lord (who also directed Chicken Run) and Jeff Newitt (key animator on Flushed Away) made a visually stunning clay-mation feature that is filled with panoramic views of old London, the Caribbean and the open sea!<br /><br />The movie's got a talented voice cast and some great gags that are short snippets of slapstick - even some one-liners that are quite funny. However, the movie lacks two very important things; an interesting and not too predictable story and characters we should care more about.<br /><br />Gideon Defoe who wrote the screenplay based on his own book....didn't seem to capture the magic that is a feature film style animation. The movie seemed to play on the `emotions' of the lead character called The Pirate Captain as voiced by Hugh Grant (Noting Hill, Music & Lyrics), but it seems a little shallow in the `believability' part of this character. Hugh did a great job personifying an uptight, unaware and obviously persecuted pirate captain, but without the script it falls a little short.<br /><br />Some other amazing vocal performances came from David Tennant (Fright Night, Doctor Who) who performed the not yet famous Charles Darwin and a generously evil performance by the Queen of England as voiced by Imelda Staunton (Harry Potter: OOTP, Shakespeare In Love). Other funny performances came from Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fright Night) as an Albino Pirate and Jeremy Piven (Entourage, The Family Man) as Black Bellamy an ego driven pirate who always wins the Pirate of The Year Award!<br /><br />The sole quest of The Pirate Captain is to prove himself - after 75 attempts - that he can actually win The Pirate of the Year Award.....except he is not very bright, his crew is a literal band of misfits and he happens on a scientist (Darwin) that discovers his very own parrot is actually not a parrot but a Dodo Bird. Something thought to be extinct. Then the story shifts to being about making it on time to a Science fair. Yawn.<br /><br />There are some great bits - but not enough to justify the 90 minutes or film or even the 3-D. The movie would have been just as fine outside the 3-D marketing. The kids in the audience I was in were not as into the film as I thought they might be....so overall a nice family film but probably worth waiting for on cable or the DVD.<br /><br />I was disappointed but somewhat entertained.ng thought to be extinct.

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|first off I must address one thing people seem to forget when talking about this story.<br /><br />I have noticed that a lot of people complain that the phantom is not the same as he was in the first musical and that this is a form of character assassination.<br /><br />well it's not! for one simple reason. it takes place 10 YEARS LATER! think about it, are you the exact same person in the exact same state of mind as you were 10 years ago? of course not! in those 10 years circumstances have occurred that caused you to grow, change, mature evolve! (whatever word you want to use!)<br /><br />Anyway that aside. This is an absolutely gorgeous production! the score is both uplifting in some areas and haunting in others! my personal favorites are Christine's gorgeous aria, Love never dies (performed by the extraordinary Anna O'Byrne)and the beautiful yet longing Till I hear you sing by Ben Lewis who gives such an impressive performance as the Phantom. my final favorite is the rockish number the Beauty Underneath. yes it seems a tad out of place until you consider that it does work if you consider it a parallel to the duet Phantom of the Opera from the predecessor. (both songs are duets where the Phantom attempts to see if the other in question is receptive.)<br /><br />the costumes are fascinating as well. but the standout is Christine's opera gown. I really enjoyed the detail in Christine's sapphire necklace and her peacock motif!<br /><br />All in all this is a very enjoyable recording which captures much that is easy to miss in a live performance!
0439023513|1.0|Like many I enjoyed the first two books.  Good characters, good plot, good action mixed with the proper amount of reflection.  A character's death had some meaning and evoked actual emotion, i.e.  Cinna's death.<br /><br />(Some spoilers)<br />Mockingjay, one would think, was written by a different author.  Katniss becomes a powerless, senseless, morose, drama-queen.  She is either injured, unconscious or mentally unstable throughout most of the book.  Other than a few flashes of her old self during the bombing in 8 or the attack in 2, I don't even recognize her.  Don't even get me started on her \\"mission\\" to assassinate Snow.  For a girl who knew so well how to calculate odds and make smart decisions in the arena, her decision to go after Snow makes no sense at all.  Then, all she does is screw around in the city and accomplishes nothing but getting others killed.  Collins does nothing to make those deaths memorable or even evocative.<br /><br />One of my major complaints about this book is the scene with the kids getting killed.  Not because it entails senseless violence on children, but because of the logical inconsistency of it.  If the rebels planned that, how did they 1) set up the concrete pen the kids where in 2) get the kids in there 3) keep their parents away from the kids and 4) position all of those medics so close by when they hadn't even taken that part of the city yet?  It doesn't make sense.  Don't you think the Peacekeapers would be asking questions as someone starts to drop concrete barricades around the street and then starts to fill them with unaccompanied children?  It's ludicrous.<br /><br />And then the death of Coin; I understand the twist that the District 13 was as bad as the Capitol, but why not have that come out after Coin's death?  A great trial where the truth comes out and THEN the election of a true leader, maybe even Gale.<br /><br />I've never been as let down by the conclusion to a series as I have been by this and I've been reading similar genres for 34 years.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could help but think of the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy while reading this and it's similarity in subject matter.<br /><br />In reality, I shouldn't have read it after finding out what subject it was centered around.  Why?  Because I have actually beem active in that \\"lifestyle\\" and this just comes off as cheesy to me.<br /><br />As for my Ann Rice reference?  Isn't it interesting that the last book in her trilogy is named \\"Beauty's Release\\" and the last book in this one is name \\"Freed\\"?  How very unoriginal!
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|Let me be clear, I own two Shinedown albums--this one and \\"Sound of Madness\\". So if you're wondering how this stacks up against the first two, this may not help.<br /><br />I've now listened to this album many times, and I would say it doesn't quite match the rock quality of \\"Sound of Madness\\". It's not a bad album by any means, but after a few listens there were definitely a few songs that I was tired of. Track by track analysis:<br /><br />Adrenaline (6/10)--Good intro song, but after a few listens it becomes pretty generic.<br />Bully (8/10)--Still one of my favorite songs on the album. Great rock, great ending with the lyrical power. Excellent song.<br />Amaryllis (7/10)--Great song. I only give this a 7/10 because although it is a great song, it does tend to wear on you after awhile. However, if you haven't listened to it in awhile, it sounds great again. Good lyrics and music.<br />Unity (8/10)--Excellent song. Beautiful lyrics and very pretty instrumentals. One of the best slower songs on the album.<br />Enemies (7/10)--Great intro, let me state that. Similar to Adrenaline in the sense that after 3-4 listens, it gets a little old. It needs more somehow, the song feels like it ends too soon and not enough variety is in the song itself.<br />I'm Not Alright (8/10)--Catchy as all get out, but if you're a lyrical-meaning kind of person, it's a bit difficult to understand what exactly he's saying. That's okay by me. The song itself is really weird in the sense that it's the most different song I'd say they've written.<br />Nowhere Kids (6/10)--Also catchy, good variety, but also a bit too short. Good song, not great. It ends very abruptly.<br />Miracle (8.5/10)--Love, love this song. Great music and lyrics both, just beautiful. Simple, effective, great.<br />I'll Follow You (9/10)--I cannot stress enough how great this song is for today's rock music. Rarely do you have a \\"Simple Man\\"-esque type song in modern rock, and this one nails it. Absolutely beautiful song--I don't get tired of this song.<br />For My Sake (10/10)--Best rock song on the album. Not as hard as Adrenaline, but more varied and excellent lyrics.<br />My Name (Wearing Me Out) (9/10)--Another great rock song. Heavier than For My Sake, and almost just as good. These two are my favorite songs on the album for sure.<br />Through the Ghost (8/10)--Great way to end the album. Very haunting and melodic. If you typically enjoy the slower-last songs of albums, and you liked I'll Follow You, you'll enjoy this song.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate this CD a 7/10. I can listen through it a few times before putting it away for awhile. A few of the songs I practice on my drums over and over, like Bully, but few of them have that re-playability factor. It's definitely worth buying, especially if you're a Shinedown fan, but I prefered Seether's new album to this one.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I heard about the book, I thought I would never read it. Youngsters fighting to the death didn't appeal to me. I finally gave in, when my grown children and neighbors were raving about it. It's a real page turner...very suspenseful. There is violence in the book, but it's not graphic. It's an easy read, and you really come out cheering for the kids over the evil government and it's capital.

B007DIQB50|3.0|Nicki has been my guilty pleasure for the past year or so.  I was a big fan of her first album.  I tended to gravitate more toward the rap songs, which is surprising because I am not that big of a rap fan.  This album is just disappointing because although the last album definitely had a pop sensibility, it didn't feel forced; this does.  It feels like, especially the latter half of the album, that she and her team are just fishing for a hit.  I actually think people are making a bigger deal than they should about this album being too \\"poppy,\\" because, the last one was more \\"poppy\\" than people seem to admit.  However, what IS disappointing is that she seems to just be trying on many different hats JUST to get radio play.  That all being said, I have still been listening to a handful of songs nonstop.  But as a whole, the album just doesn't hold my attention.  I tend to listen to five or so songs over and over, but skip the rest.  Sadly, purchasing individual songs through a digital downloading service might be recommended.  Stand out songs for me are: \\"Beez in the Trap,\\" \\"Roman Reloaded,\\" \\"Champion,\\" \\"Starships,\\" \\"Pound the Alarm,\\" \\"Marilyn Monroe,\\" and \\"Va Va Voom.\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and have never reviewed an app because never found one up to my high standards.  it is a great way to read the Bible.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I absolutely loved A Game of Thrones.  I actually purchased the 4 book bundle Kindle edition, and, now, I am very glad that I did.  While I am a newcomer to this genre, I really like it.  I have always loved historical fiction and have recently been interested in early British history.  That said, this is far from my typical read (historical fiction, mysteries, thrillers, YA, and, yes, some chick-lit).  I was very surprised that I loved this book as much as I did.<br /><br />My biggest hesitation was the fact that the story is told from many different perspectives.  I thought I would have a hard time keeping the characters and plot lines straight, but Martin does not make it hard to follow.  While some of the details were hard for me to read (such as Dany and the horse's heart), I still enjoyed the book thoroughly.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this book, read it.  You will not be sorry.  It has elements that will appeal to a very wide audience.  My only words of advice are to wait to buy the books until you have plenty of time to read them.  You will not want to put them down.  Overall, this book surprised me.  I cannot wait to start reading the second book.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Both my wife and I use these earphones and love them. They don't hang on the ear where they are subject to to falling out. The position they fit in the ear projects the sound toward the ear channel for best sound transference of any of them. For someone with hearing aids that don't block the ear totally, they are ideal. The only bad feature is their availability. In my area, only Target sold them. Now not even Target carries them so on line ordering is necessary, which incurs shipping charges. However, even with the shipping charges, they are still a good deal. My major fear is that they will become unavailable shortly, at which time we will be out of luck. I highly recommend these to those who have trouble using other available earbuds/earphones.

0718157834|5.0|I am in the middle of this book but I can tell it's a keeper. Jojo Moyes has this way of writing that keeps me connected as the story unfolds. Don't want it to end!
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|I am half way through this book and am struggling to finish it.  I don't understand why it received so many glowing reviews.  To say the book is obsessed with 80's references is an understatement.  I had to skip past a serious number of pages (on multiple occasions) just to get back to the story line.  I wanted to scream \\" I get it.  Move on with the story!\\"  If the characters were likable or interesting, I might give the book more of a pass, but I found them all one dimensional and predictable.  The main character's ability to remember every line from every 80's movie and TV show is simply not believable.  The writing style has no depth and the quests/challenges that the characters must fulfill on their way to winning the prize are uninteresting and obtuse.  I grew up in the 80's, I liked the 80's but I don't want to sleep with the 80's.  I sense the author does.  The only credit I will give the author is that the virtual world for schools and education that he portrays early on in the book demonstrates a deeper level of thought.  It's too bad that the author didn't  put the same amount into the story line and characters in the book.

B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is awesome! I loved the Secret and The Power.  But The Magic is the best! I love that she concentrates on not just telling about gratitude but the projects that she asks us to do for 28 days as we learn to become more grateful is phenomenal! My favorite one that I do almost every day, is counting your blessings.  TO set aside time every day to write down what I am thankful for and really feel those feelings has changed my life! I love this book! I will continue to use several of these practices in my daily life.  Now that I am counting my blessings, I am changing! YES!
B007HO392S|4.0|Ok. So here's how I think the album is. There are some INCREDIBLE songs in the album. There are some which are not as good. If you are a country fan, you will love it. If you are not a country fan, you will still love it.<br />So here's my song by song review. The marks in brackets below are out of 10.<br /><br />1. 'Good Girl' - A good song but resembles of Cowboy Casanova a little bit. Even though I like the song, it is just a little bit unoriginal.<br />(7)<br /><br />2. 'Blown Away' - An excellent song with excellent lyrics. This is one of the best songs EVER by Carrie and it is very catchy. It is in my top 3 for this album. This song is filled with metaphors and a lot of smart lyrics.<br />(9.5)<br /><br />3. 'Two Black Cadillacs' - An even better song than Blown Away. Musically, Carrie shows that she can do her job without screaming all through the song and still deliver. The song has a VERY effective storyline and this song could be a huge hit for her. The lyrics are very smart again and this is definitely my favorite Carrie song from all albums.<br />(10)<br /><br />4. 'See You Again' - Not a bad song, not a brilliant one. I like listening to this one. This one is the first song after Good Girl to have a country feeling to it, but not a lot of it.<br />(8.5)<br /><br />5. 'Do You Think About Me' - This is a nice country song but the chorus is too repetitive and after all the great lyrics beforehand, this stays a little weak (this is the case for many songs on the album)<br />(6)<br /><br />6. 'Forever Changed' - This is an emotional song which Carrie herself loves. For the fans, it might be a little boring but this one also has some strong lyrics.<br />(7.5)<br /><br />7. 'Nobody Ever Told You' - A very cheesy song but very likable. It has the same subject as Fireworks by Katy Perry but better. This is like the country version of it. I really don't like the weird speaking voices in the middle of the song. I suppose it is a reference to Snow White but it's very pointless<br />(7)<br /><br />8. 'One Way Ticket' - A fun song. As other people told, has a Reggae feeling to it. It's like 'Screw everything, live your life!'. I like it.<br />(8)<br /><br />9. 'Thank God for Hometowns' - An emotional song which I kinda like. Carrie's voice shines in this song. Another song that shows people that she shouldn't shout to sound beautiful (which is what she did on her previous albums).<br />(7.5)<br /><br />10. 'Good in Goodbye' - An excellent melody, actually. And an excellent instrumental. Good message. She's great to deliver it. Lyrics could've been smarter but yet a great song on album. One of my faves.<br />(8.5)<br /><br />11. 'Leave Love Alone' - This is another case which lyrics fall very shortly. VERY repetitive for the whole song. The chorus is weird. It's likable but nowhere as good as most of the songs. The country feeling in it is nice but the song generally is not VERY strong.<br />(5.5)<br /><br />12. 'Cupid's Got a Shotgun' - Another very powerful song from the album. AMAZING rhythm. I love the lyrics. Very, VERY catchy. Amazing song. Definitely the best uptempo song on the album. It's a great country song, but non-country lovers can like this as well. 'I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark...Cupid's got a shotgun and he's aiming it at me!'<br />(9.5)<br /><br />13. 'Wine After Whiskey' - Another emotional songs. Good lyrics. Good song. Nothing special but not boring. It doesn't make me jump up and down as well.<br />(7)<br /><br />14. 'Who Are You' - A great way to finish the album. Mid-tempo, not boring at all, great lyrics. Noting much to be said about it.<br />(8)<br /><br />So when finding the average for the marks I gave it makes 7.8 which is a solid 4-star. BUY IT, NOT GONNA DISAPPOINT.
0312576463|5.0|I was initially ashamed that I found Patty and Richard's relationship to be the single most enthralling plot point in Jonathan Franzen's brilliant, best-selling novel \\"Freedom\\".  Yet I realized that the relationships in this novel are akin to those in reality in that, like dominos, they can all fall as events play out.  Every thread in this expertly woven tapestry is just as important as the one sewn before it.  By the end of the novel, I felt as if my undeniable female urge for passionate romance was justified.  Every experience here holds equal weight in being depressing and thrilling, or hopeful and devastating.<br /><br />\\"Freedom\\" is an updated \\"World According to Garp\\", Richard in this novel being what Garp was to the other.  The characters are miserable but they mean well.  They try to turn their lives around, and things exponentially worsen.  We find reasons to both love and hate each person, perhaps because in them we can see so much of ourselves.<br /><br />Bonus points go out to Franzen for his inclusion of a Bright Eyes concert that spanned five or so pages of the novel.  I have been a fan of Bright Eyes for over six years now and, for the record, they put on one hell of a concert.  (You can see my review of one of their shows on Saddle Creek records' website at [...])  They, particularly frontman Conor Oberst, even received the deserved Franzen treatment in that they too were provided a back-story for those less familiar.  What perfect musical accompaniment to this story that is already dripping with emotional turmoil.  If this book is adapted into film, as it has been rumored to be, Oberst should undoubtedly be consulted for the soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"Freedom\\" has its finger on the pulse of human discontent, particularly the kind Americans experience daily.  It is written so intelligently and with so much attention to detail and back-story that the 500+ pages that may put you off at first are essential to painting a fuller picture.  With a similar narrative style to that of John Irving, Franzen does not skip details or rush to the results in order to deliver a juicier but shallower tale.  He burrows deeply down into the center of the modern family, carving off details from the sides as he goes, and then splits it straight down the middle for us all to see its vulnerable and rotted core.<br /><br />Franzen builds his characters up over time so that you can understand better why your middle-aged neighbor remains miserably married and has not yet left his wife.  Or why that ambitious young woman that you knew in college married the \\"nice guy\\" and yet remains despondent and unfulfilled in her later years when she seems to \\"have it all\\".  Or, better still, why the children of this union seem to be carbon copies of their parents, only with less morals and more sense.  Franzen has a keen understanding of suburbia and through his eyes we can come to better understand our own.<br /><br />\\"Freedom\\" shows us the perils of entrapment, how two people can't imagine life without each other when they deliberately make each other miserable.  It is impossible to vote for the \\"good guy\\" here when everyone is so thoroughly damaged.  Yet they keep on, they fight for what they need and they don't give up when it appears that they have nothing left.<br /><br />I was expecting one character in particular to commit suicide and was thoroughly pleased when this did not happen.  That's the message of \\"Freedom\\".  You may not get a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end of the novel, depending on your perspective, but that's okay because there are no warm and fuzzy endings in life.  There's just the determination and courage to persevere, and the maturity that allows us to separate what we want from what we need.  It's never too late to change.  After a lifetime of misery, there is still a shot at liberty.  We have the power to choose our own paths.  We often create our own prisons, inadvertently or otherwise, but we can always make the consciousdecision to escape.<br /><br />After all, would we truly appreciate the freedom we've earned if we were not first oppressed?y appreciate the freedom we've earned if we were not first oppressed?

0374275637|5.0|It was one of those nights when I was doing a web research on how humans make choices, that I stumbled upon a TED Talk by a psychologist who was explaining the riddle of experience versus memory. The Talk led me to Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, one of those books that shake the foundations of a discipline, and prepare the grounds for a paradigm shift and a new direction for the research of generations of academicians to come.<br /><br />What I am about to summarize might not make sense to many of you. Kahneman's work was not short of raising controversy in the social science that's psychology. What I admire on the other hand, is Kahneman's dissection of the odd behavior of our brain under certain conditions, which make us make choices, which seen under another angle, simply do not make sense. Our brain is not the rational agent many imagine.<br /><br />Now why a book review? Because books' principle quickly falter into oblivion in one's memory if no written synthesis is made. Also, explaining the concepts in simple terms will help me make sure I understand them myself. And who knows, a few of you might be intrigued as well. Kahneman's is not a \\"how to become happy in 10 lessons\\" book. By enriching our awareness on the shortcuts our brain takes to make decisions, Kahneman tries to raise our awareness in the unlikely hope of making us make more informed choices. This is my first book review, most probably not the last one, and I leave you to enjoy a summary of a selection of a few concepts laid out.<br /><br />Two Selves<br /><br />Kahneman argues that our brain is broken down into 2 \\"systems\\", System 1 and System 2. System 1 makes most of our daily choices for us, while System 2 is lazy, has to be stimulated, and is rarely used outside classrooms. If I had to isolate my best understanding of System 1, I would name it Intuition. On the other hand, I would name System 2 Rationality. Intuition, when nurtured, such as the famous case Malcom Gladwell makes inhis book Blink about the fireman who pulled his brigade out of a building for no reason he could explain, simply to witness the building collapse in front of him a few minutes later, can be trusted as expert intuition. On the other hand, most of us non experts, intuitively take shortcuts to make choices that lead us astray.<br /><br />System 1 is a system prone to cognitive illusion. Much like visual illusion, cognitive illusions is a fancy term for a reasoning you make that you think makes sense, but when looking at it under another angle, does not anymore.<br />Try to answer the following question:<br /><br />A bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball costs?<br /><br />A number quickly came to your mind (generated in your system 1). If you think the ball costs 10 cents, think twice. The correct answer, computed by your system 2, is 5 cents.<br /><br />Heuristics and Biases<br /><br />Kahneman argues that our brain is not trained for thinking in terms of probabilities and statistics. We tend to induce (Nassim Taleb describes the problem of induction in Fooled by Randomness very well) conclusions from samples which are too small to be significant. Once a basketball player scores from 5 throws in a row, his teammates suddenly start passing him the ball thinking he's on a \\"hot hand\\", while statistics clearly prove that this lucky streak is perfectly explained by a simple random distribution<br /><br />And if our brain does not find causes to explain the phenomena it goes through, it often tries to look for causality where there is none. A famous experiment done on pigeons can explain the concept: a few pigeons are starved in a cage and start to be fed a very slow rates, much slower than the rate at which they need the food given how hungry they are. The pigeons do not see what other pigeons are doing, and each of them starts to make gestures which they think will make the food come: one of them starts jumping, another starts to make movement with its wings. Is that a clue to explain superstition in humans, or data snooping among research analysts or financial traders who use technical analysis?<br /><br />An experiment was done where people span a wheel of fortune marked from 0 to 100. The wheel was tricked to give only 2 outcomes, either 10 or 65. All the people were shortly thereafter asked a simple question:<br /><br />What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?<br /><br />The people who got 10 in the wheel of fortune on average said 25%, whereas the people who got 65 on the wheel on average said 45%. The number they got the the wheel, although clearly not relevant to the question, did affect their judgement. This is a simple example of the anchoring heuristic, which explains how under uncertainty, our brain has a tendency to take whatever piece of information and extrapolate, without questioning the validity of the piece of information. This is the reason why sales people throw a price at you before you ask for it, and this is why when opposing parties meet to discuss a certain outcome, the party that speaks first has a certain advantage: the other party will take the benchmark thrown at him and extrapolate.<br /><br />Another concept our brain has trouble dealing with is regression to the mean. Ask yourself the following question:<br />Why do highly intelligent women tend to marry men than are less intelligent than them?<br />You have certainly started coming up with all sorts of explanations such as women are more intelligent than men and this sort of nonsense, but you haven't probably thought that the say 5% highly intelligent women among the entire women population are much more likely to choose among the 100% population of men than the 5% highly intelligent men.<br /><br />To be Continued
B003Y5H53S|4.0|RANGO is a cool movie...the story is interesting and the visual of the film is great!I really like it...it´s not a masterpiece, but i think everyone can enjoy this animation!!!!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I like many was concerned when I heard Chris Evans was playing Captain America.  Images of him from 'Not Another Teen Movie' kept flooding back.  BTW, funny movie.  I was just concerned about having a funny man play the ultimate American.  Also he had already played Johnny Storm.  It was kind of weird for him to play another Marvel character.  I was further concerned when I saw he would not be blond in the movie.  FYI, Capt. America is blond in the comics.  So, going into this Marvel flick I had some worries.  I will say my worries were calmed a bit by the epic previews they kept showing before the release of the movie.  I was eventually, cautiously optomistic to say the least.<br /><br />Well, this Fanboy was not disappointed.  The movie turned out GREAT, and was a solid prequel for the upcoming 'Avengers' movie.<br /><br />--Story--<br /><br />The story was exactly what is should be, Steve Rogers in World War II fighting Nazis.  No other story would have been right.  To only have a brief moment of him in the 1940s and then flash forward to 2011, that would have a travesty.<br /><br />**Some Spoilers**<br /><br />The story begins with a Nazi villian, later revealed to be the Red Skull, finding an ancient cube in an old church.  For those not familier, the cube is called the \\"Cosmic Cube\\" and is VERY powerful.  The Red Skull is portrayed by Hugo Weaving.  Excellant casting decision by the way.  Just the right amount of sinister and intelligence.  The cube once harnessed by the Red Skull's scientist is able to power all his advanced weaponry.  These weapons are powerful enough to definitely gurantine victory for the Axis powers.<br /><br />Enter Stever Rogers, a small, sickly man who is 100 percent adamant about serving his country in the armed forces.  Kudos to the CG department for making Chris Evans look so small.  Well Steve hops from city to city hoping at least one doctor will clear him medically to serve.  So far he's been turned down every time.<br /><br />Finally he comes across an army medical doctor/scientist, played perfectly by Stanley Tucci, who offers Steve the chance he's be looking for.  It turns out this doctor has perfected a \\"Super Soldier Serum\\" and is looking for the right candidate to try it on.  It is revealed in a flash back scene that the Red Skull looks the way he does because he tryed an early batch on himself.  Stanley Tucci's character is concerned who to try it on, as the formula only amplifies what's already in a person.  I.E. a good man becomes GREAT, and a bad man becomes a HORRIBLE monster.<br /><br />Thus, after going through some basic training overseen by none other than the great Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers is selected and prepped for the procedure.  BTW, another great decision casting Tommy Lee Jones...<br /><br />We at this point get another great character entry, Howard Stark.  Howard is none other than the father of Tony Stark, aka Iron-Man.  Howard is in my opinion just like Howard Hughes.  That's what the writers of the comics and this movie are going for and it shows, in a good way.  Howard is already a millionare and works on top-secret projects for the U.S. Government.  He builds the chamber Steve Rogers becomes Captain America in.  This will no doubt be a plot point in the 'Avengers' movie.  Expect Captain America to say something on the lines of \\"I knew your father Tony, and your not him...\\", or something like that.<br /><br />Anyway, shortly after the successful procedure, a buff Chris Evans exits the chamber.  The lab is blown up and the doctor is shot by a Nazi spy.  Thus the exact formula is lost with the good doctor.  It also means that Steve Rogers, at least for the forseeable future is the only \\"Super Soldier\\".<br /><br />It's at this point that the movie loses pace a little.  We see Captain America dancing and singing his way around America selling war bonds.  I would have much rather seen him go right into action.<br /><br />Luckily this doesn't last too long.  Steve feelshorrible for not fighting, and once his old pal Bucky Barnes is kidnapped he sets off on his own for a one man rescue.<br /><br />The film then regains it's pace.  We get a lot of action and some pretty cool shield throwing scenes.  Howard Stark outfits Steve with a pretty cool uniform, (which looks WAY better than what he's wearing in the 'Avengers), and gives him his vibranium shield.  Captain America puts together his own rag-tag bunch of soldiers, his A-Team so to speak...and they go on some pretty high octane missions together.<br /><br />Well...to move things along.  Steve loses Bucky, or so it seems...and after stopping the Red Skull's forces and the Red Skull himself, crashes the Red Skull's plane into an ice-filled ocean.  The ship would have killed a lot of people if it made it to America.  The Cosmic Cube is recovered by Howard Stark, and later seen at the end of 'Thor'.  Unfortunately Cap is not found until 2011.  This is a sad scene, as you know he will never see the woman he loved again.  He is a man out of time, with friends and loved ones long gone.<br /><br />--Pros--<br /><br />Great casting.  Great costume, followed the Ultimate Captain America design.  Great writing.  The scenery is truly realistic in it's appearance.  If it wouldn't be for the futuristic tanks and energy weapons that the Red Skull's forces used, you'd swear you were back in WWII.<br /><br />Having us the viewer see Steve Rogers before and after his transformation is what REALLY made this film.  Again, kudos to the CG department.<br /><br />This film, although it can stand on it's own, IS really a prequel to the 'Avengers' and helps to tie 'Thor' and 'Iron-Man' together, pretty well actually.<br /><br />--Cons--<br /><br />My only gripe was seeing Captain America singing and dancing.  Although this was not long, I did not enjoy it and think it took the character down a notch.  Why would a man so adamant about being a soldier stoop to doing this.<br /><br />Only gripe though,  movie gets back on track soon afterward.  So I only docked one star.  Also I would have prefered to see Steve Rogers blond.  I can see why they choose to go with brown though.  After all the Nazi's were blond haired, blue eyed.  Still, he is blond in the comics and in the 'Ultimate Avengers' movies.  This is just a minor Fanboy gripe though...<br /><br />--In Conclusion--<br /><br />Stellar movie, a MUST own for any Marvel fan.  I plan on buying the BLU-RAY edition, once I finally buy a BLU-RAY player.  From what I've been reading, you get the most deleted scenes and bonus features with the BLU-RAY.<br /><br />Really liked this movie and can't wait to see the 'Avengers'.  I'll see you there, I'll be the one yelling at everyone to shut their cellphones off because the movie is starting...horrible for not fighting, and once his old pal Bucky Barnes is kidnapped he sets off on his own for a one man rescue.<br /><br />The film then regains it's pace.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|THE JUNGLE BOOK is one of my ALL TIME favorite classic animations!!!! MOGLI and BALU are some of the most remarkable characters from DISNEY, the story of jungle book is one of the most interesting and, as usual, the graphics and the musics are great!!!
B004EPYZTE|3.0|I just watched this on the Epix Movie Channel in HD.  I was really looking forward to seeing this as I missed it at the theaters and on DVD release.  As I sat down with my dinner and flipped the channel on I had high hopes that once again I would be transported to Hyboria.<br /><br />Well...I wasn't.  I'm not sure where I was transported to, but it wasn't Hyboria.  Let me say first off that the Arnold incarnation of Conan was not perfect either, but it was still loved and rewatched numerous times by us action lovers.  It, dispite it flaws, was a GOOD movie and had the perfect lead.  This new 2011 'Conan' is not a rewatch.<br /><br />--Story--**(Some Spoilers)**<br /><br />The movie begins by showing an ancient group of Necromancers doing some sort of occult ritual.  The flaw in the scene is that you see nothing happening.  There is a mask, (which is the MAIN plot point in the film), that these Necromancers made that was supposed to grant GREAT power to the wearer.  Well...the Necromancers are defeated by the barbarian tribes and the mask broken up into little pieces and spread amoung the tribal heads for safe-keeping.<br /><br />This is flaw one.  If this mask is so evil, they should have just beat the @#$& out of it and turned it into dust.  Why allow the possibility of it being used again in the future???<br /><br />The movie flashes ahead to little Conan, still an infant inside his mother.  We see a sword get thrush into his mother and just miss the baby.  Conan's father (Ron Pearlman) cuts Conan out and let's the mother see the infant before dying.  This scene is extremely unrealistic.  But this violant birth on a battle field gives Conan the title/statis of \\"Battle Born.\\"  This is alluded to as one reason he is so well equipped at fighting.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier the main focus of this film is the Necronmancer Mask.  I guess the mask allows the user to bring back the dead.  That's all the villan Khalar Zym, (Stephen Lang, the bad guy from 'Avatar'), talks about the whole film.  It is his desire to resurrect his witch-wife and have her use her increased powers to inslave the world for him.  His wife was burned at the stake, shown in a flash back scene.<br /><br />Khalar Zym destroys Conan's village, kills Conan's father (or at least sets him up to die...) and leaves Conan furious, and this sets him on his bloody path.<br /><br />This is flaw two.  Arnold's Conan was shown at various stages in his life.  Once he was grown, we witness him as a slave on the Mill of Agony, as a gladiator, once he is set free he discovers the cave of Grom and gets that cool sword.  Then he's a thief for a while before being hired by a king to rescue the kingdom's princess from James Earl Jones.  My point is we see Conan doing a lot of things, just like in the books.<br /><br />Unfortunately we just go from child Conan to Jason Momoa.  No scenes of his struggles or escapades.  We are just thrust to the future and see him freeing slaves.  No backstory what-so-ever.  Thus the viewer doesn't really grow attached to the character, nor do we really care about him in the film...ever.<br /><br />Conan later on rescues a red-haired woman, (Scarlet from 'G. I. Joe'), and spends the rest of the movie saving/protecting her.  For some reason her blood is important.  As this is all Rose McGowan talks about endlessly...<br /><br />I won't give anymore plot points away.  This is the jist of the movie.  Nothing too deep or interesting.<br /><br />--Character Choices--<br /><br />Jason Momoa as Conan was wrong for one reason.  He's not big enough.  You can't go from an Austrian body-builder to a surfer.  Granted he did bulk up for this film, he still lacked the physique of a Cimmerian warrior, in my opinion.  In Momoa's defense, it is evident that he gave this movie 100 percent.  It still though wasn't enough.  The film not being stellar is also not ALL his fault.  Bad writing, bad casting decisions, THEN Momoa are what took this film down.  Momoa was GREAT in 'Stargate: Atlantis', but not great as Conan.  I personally think he had TOO much dialogue.  Arnold's character did not speak much in the first film, and I think it was a PLUS for the character.  Conan does not strike me as chatty.  Momoa's Conan was too chatty.  This was probably again though due to BAD WRITING.<br /><br />Stephen Lang while a great villian in 'Avatar', does not deliver in this.  He looked too old, and had a WAY too close relationship with his daughter.  Any minute I thought they were going to get it on, and I would puke.  He is ruthless in the film, having a TONS of people slaughtered whenever he feels the urge.  He has no reason for killing in my opinion, it's always for this stupid mask or something related to it.  FYI, when he finally does get the mask ensembled and puts the \\"pure blood\\" in it, all that happens is that is wriggles around like a starfish.  He puts it on his face and it wraps itself around making a helmet.  That's it.<br /><br />Rose McGowan, while good as Cherry from 'Planet Terror', was not good as Khalar Zym's witch daughter.  She played a witch on 'Charmed', and must have been good, as the show was on FOREVER.  However in 'Conan' she never displays any powers.  She does once make some dust people that Conan fights for 5 minutes.  Other than that, besides sniffing all the time for the \\"pure blood\\" like Wolverine, she demonstrates no witch powers.  She looks out of place in the film, and does not pull off the look of a Hyborian Witch.  Plus her scenes where she is coming on to her father are pretty gross.<br /><br />I couldn't tell you much about the rest of the characters, as I said you never get attached to anyone in the film.  Ron Pearlman is in the movie, and does an OKAY job as Conan's father.  The red haired woman who played Scarlet in 'G. I. Joe' is the woman Conan is always protecting.  She does not add anything to movie acting wise.  The french guy from 'G. I. Joe' is here also, he's the guy with an eye patch, the thief who helps Conan.  He's actually pretty good.<br /><br />--Wrapping up--<br /><br />Bad casting choices and terrible writing killed this film.  If you were one of the few who LOVED this movie, don't expect a sequel.  This movie is evidence that sometimes a franchise is better left alone.  Revisiting a movie franchise with new actors and writers usually doesn't equal success.  Will the new 'Total Recall' be a disaster???  Time will tell, one things for certain, the original wasn't broken in any way.  Why do we need a remake???<br /><br />Well, that's my 2 cents worth and opinions on this new 'Conan'.  Is is worth buying, NO.  Watch it on tv, it will be on FX really soon I'm sure...REAT in 'Stargate: Atlantis', but not great as Conan.  I personally think he had TOO much dialogue.  Arnold's character did not speak much in the first film, and I think it was a PLUS for the character.  Conan does not strike me as chatty.  Momoa's Conan was too chatty.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a total classic from DISNEY!!! The tale of Alice is a classic, and the DISNEY version is the definitive animation of it!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like this game. well games. it has a variety of games and even serpent which i habent played in like yeats. but overall bery nice game to play.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|There´s many many movies that use the image of PETER PAN, but the DISNEY animation is BY FAR the best ONE!!!! WOW! This movie is great...like most of the DISNEY animations, i recommend this classic to everyone!!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had fallen in love with the show on HBO and being an avid reader had to try the books and I absolutely love it.  I am only half way through the first book but I am enjoying it!  It is even better of course then the show as there are more details.  I would recomend this to adults! (probably a little to much details for children) who enjoy reading books of castles and knights.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Is it true? SLEEPING BEAUTY is from 1959??? It´s just incredible!!! The graphics, the colors, the animation...in a time without computers and high techniques...THIS IS A PIECE OF ART!!!! The story is a remarkable fairy tale that most people can recognize, but DISNEY turns this thing in to a eternal masterpiece!!!
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|As an avid Sex and the City fan I feel obligated to inform the masses that this is by far and away one of the worst movies of all time.  The series was clever and funny, and the first movie carried this trend to our general amusement.  The second movie was an unnecessary travesty.  If you want to watch the complete degradation of all characters we've come to know and love, all the while disgracing themselves and a foreign culture along the way by all means please watch this tragedy of a film.  All involved should be disgraced by their association with this film, and the director, producer and writers should be banished from making additional cinematic failures so as to spare us all from spiritual decline.
B003F48E4W|5.0|This is a classic from the late 80's...i remenber seeying many times this movie on tv reruns, and was always fun to see this cool vampire film! I agree with other reviewers...this is what vampires should be, not those sissy romantic vampires of today!!!!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|If your looking for a cheap intro to the 2011 socket systems, this is it! This baby is fast and does everything I need it for without a hitch.<br /><br />I have even overclocked it to 4.5GHz and it still runs perfectly!<br /><br />Great CPU for the price!
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Ah...The ARISTOCATS...this great beautiful animation travels me to the past, when i saw it for the first time....I´ve seem this classic many times, and reminds me one of my favorites...SWEET MEMORIES from a time when DISNEY created pure magic!
B002ZG9774|1.0|Burlesque was about as authentic as the WWE, but with less talent. First, the story has been told a thousand times: Aguilera is sick of her backwater home town. So she puts on her best Dorothy Gale gingham bustier, packs up her little basket of vocal chords and goes over the rainbow to join the cast of Glee as they re-imagine 'Showgirls' (and oh, how I was longing for someone to get pushed down the stairs).<br /><br />As for Cher, she was a campy-trampy imitation Mae West at best. This 'hooker with a heart of gold' cliche made me sad to remember Cher the Real Actress.  You know, back when she was kicking Hollywood's pretentious *ss around the block?  Come Back to the Five & Dime, Jimmy Dean. Silkwood. Mask. Moonstruck. Of course, that was also when she could still move some of her facial muscles. She may be delivering Oscar-worthy performances, we just can't see it happening.<br /><br />And poor Stanley Tucci! You could tell he was embarrassed. Every time he hit the screen he was made of pain. Pain like peanut butter stuck in your throat. Pain like full body paper cuts in a vat of stewed tomatoes. So sad.<br /><br />Truly, this is no Moulin Rouge.  It's not even Coyote Ugly (but it did make me want to chew my leg off to get away). No way around it: This is a stinker.
B001AQT11M|5.0|There´s some fairy tales that most EVERYONE in the world knows...SNOW WHITE and the 7 DwaRFS is one of them...and the DISNEY version to this tale is the DEFINITIVE...A CLASSIC from 1937!!!! AMAZING!!! The animation, the musics, the colors...BRAVO! BRAVO!!!
B000WCN8SC|5.0|The Doors are probably my all-time favorite band. This set has everything I could want in regards to their studio albums with Jim Morrison. A larger set including Full Circle, Other Voices, An American Prayer, and live material would have been even better, but this is still a fantastic collection. The packaging is nice, with the original artwork for the albums. The booklets are nice, giving information about the remastering process as well as lyrics and such. The bonus tracks included on the albums are hit or miss, but a nice addition. The real kicker for me with this set was the inclusion of each album on DVD Audio.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|PINOCCHIO is one of the most famous and remarkable animations by DISNEY...and it´s from 1940!!!!UNBELIAVABLE!!! Of course, you can´t compare with the computadorized high costed productions of today....but by the time it was made, PINOCCHIO got just AMAZING graphics, musics and everything!!! This will stand the test of time, and became a legend in the future.....
B005OCFHHK|5.0|These movies, while not as good as the books, are still great. The big bonus to this set is the size. All eight movies are packages in a case just slightly wider than two regular Blu-Ray cases. Fantastic for someone that doesn't have a huge amount of space to store movies, games, and cd's. There aren't as many special features as you often find in sets like this, but there are enough. There are very few movies and shows that I really have any interest in watching hours and hours of bonus material about, anyway. Anyone looking for a nice collector's set might want to look at other options.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it. constantly have it in my hands. nice having the option to link to fb. (or not-like me-i hate having my friends see what I'm doing.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|Never really been a big Train fan, of course I liked a couple of their big hits but didnt have any of their albums. I understand compared to previous efforts that this album is a little to cute and popish for some people, it may well be for some but darn it man, the stuff is really catchy.<br /><br />Almost every single song can be sung or hummed, they drop modern day references all over the place, display a bunch of different styles and keep things to the point at 43 1/2 minutes.<br /><br />It loses a little steam towards the end but a very nice pop gem indeed.
B0053VKP8S|2.0|I bought this to convert the optical output from my Apple TV to stereo analog to feed a whole-house audio system.<br /><br />Two major problems:<br />1. Static noise when waking up the Apple TV from sleep.  The static persists unless you start playing audio, or, cycle power to the FiiO converter.  At first I thought it was the Apple TV (and even had that replaced under warranty)... but turns out it was the FiiO.  It doesn't gracefully handle the situation where it's getting an optical input that's not yet phase-locked - which results in static noise.  Poor design.<br /><br />2. Failed after 6 months.  One day it just decided to stop working... no more blue power light when plugged in.<br /><br />To address #1, a workaround I found was to not let my Apple TV go to sleep, so that it's always on.  For #2, Amazon was good enough to let me return the item.  Outside of these two problems, the product worked ok, and the sound quality was good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is AWESOME!!!! I love it! I would suggest this book to anyone who liked any of the hunger games books or likes sci-fi books. As I said before, its AWESOME!!!! Great for the money!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game was awsome. I was truely impressed. its like a better farrmville with ice age characters. Who doesn't love that.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I watched the first two movies, loved them, read this last book before I watch the movie. Could not put it down. Am going back to read the first two books. Characters are great, multi faceted, the movie only skim over the details. Love it!!!
B0046IQZLU|3.0|Not my favorite book, started to read it and was hoping that I'd get into the whole series, but the book just did nothing for me and didn't keep my attention.
0345803493|3.0|Reading the second installment in this trilogy, my biggest issue again was Ana and Christian's relationship! Most of the things I had issues with in Fifty Shades of Grey were very toned down in this one, as their relationship became more \\"normal\\", which was nice. The lack of Ana asserting any control over her life was probably the biggest fault of this one. I understand the way she was supposed to be characterized, but I felt like she felt very fake and not real in the way she is completely passive. There was a lot more substance to the story of this one. While there were things besides the relationship with Ana and Christian in book 1, there was a lot more of it in this one,  severalof them being \\"aw\\" moments which is always nice. The characters remain one of my favorite things about this series - Christian's family is too awesome. After finishing, I was super excited to see how the trilogy would end.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Like the previous three, I enjoyed the fourth of the mission impossible movies.  The only thing that I would have changed is to make it a two-part movie.  The action and story could have easily supported a sequel.  This would have allowed the story to be expanded.  The action and gee-whiz cool stuff was great.  For entertainment purposes, it was a winner.  Watching it a second time didn't make the high elevation scenes any less nail-biting.  Maybe some day, they'll take the ideas from this movie and ease parking in metropolitan areas.  The lit fuse at the beginning of the movie was a nice touch, which was reminiscent of the original television series.  Maybe someday, Ethan Hunt and the Impossible Mission gang will get to team up with James Bond for a fantastic explosion and cool-gadget laden and suspense filled man show.
0345803507|4.0|What a long way this trilogy has come for me! Fifty Shades Freed was my favorite book of the trilogy. The story grew so much from where it started, and in this one there was so much else going on, that I felt like some of the focus on Ana and Christian's relationship was scaled back. The one issue I had with this one was the random time jumps. You could be on one day, then the next sentence you were in a flashback or the next day, and it become really confusing. It would take me a minute to adjust to the fact that the time jumps were happening. I thought the villain was a bit lame in his motives, but his actions still made the book exciting. As ever, I really love the characters - they seriously are the best part of this series.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|Interesting story that could have many possibilities for how it can be shown on the big screen.  I found it interesting that the movie protrayed time as being more valuable than life itself.  If it were to really happen, then there probably wouldn't be over-population - just slavery.  I liked the movie, because it was entertaining and it raised a whole bunch of new questions about how low humanity could go.  It's not a chick flick so go ahead and watch it, and be glad it doesn't take too much of your time (life) to watch it.
0345803485|2.0|There has been so much hype and craze around these books in the past weeks, so I just had to know for myself what the craze was about. And I will admit, it did have an addicting quality, because I just needed to know what would happen next. As I talked about above, I had a lot of moral issues with this one. I didn't need Ana to be the strongest female lead ever, but it was the lack of any sort of anything that bothered me. She just let him decide everything for her, and even in the instances where she did put up a \\"fight\\", it was easily ended with a look or statement from Christian.<br /><br />There were a few scenes that kind of grossed me out throughout this one, like the scene where Ana uses Christian's toothbrush (hello, GERMS?)  There was also the issue that there was hardly any build up to Christian and Ana's relationship. She interviews him and already things are starting to hit it off. Then she drunk calls him, and that's pretty much it.<br /><br />There were some great moments throughout the book - most of them were the ones with the other characters of the book. Jose, Kate, Elliot, Christian's family, they were all great, and were actually my favorite part of the book. They really were just awesome characters, and they sold the book for me.
B007SSDS24|3.0|Okay, this movie was fun and entertaining, just keep the lights on and the brain turned off.  Now all the aliens had to do was to shut down the almighty cloud and pizza delivery, and the modern world would come to an end.  I just don't think aliens that are that technologically advanced would have to use that much effort to snub out modern man - They'd probably do it remotely.
0439023521|5.0|Although not usually a fan of teen literature (I read enough while a teen), I am a fan of dystopian books and had heard enough about THE HUNGER GAMES to take the bait.  I am glad I did.  Yes, the book is very exciting and both grabs and keeps the reader's attention.  But what I found equally, perhaps even more, interesting was the dystopian landscape portrayed in its pages as well as author's fantastic ability to portray that landscape through only a relatively few chilling lines.<br /><br />The dismissiveness of main character Katniss Everdeen to the games themselves, and the reasons why, portray in only a few sentences the utter horror of the games and what they represent.  The complete helplessness of those citizens in the various districts, used and toyed with for the comfort and entertainment of the citizens in the Capital, are described in such cold but emotional terms that one really gets it.  The Hunger Games are a way for the Capital to show that they own you, can do anything to you and there is nothing you can do about it.  The district residents are just close enough to always be on the verge of death, whether through starvation, disease or whatever, that they cannot gain enough balance to fight back, but just enough of them are able to remain healthy enough to do the arduously hard labor to keep the Capital's citizens in comfort.  Author Suzanne Collins is a wizard of parsimony in this respect, giving us enough information to realize the deprivation but little enough information to allow us to step into the shoes of the characters, who themselves have very limited information about life outside of their districts.<br /><br />One particularly compelling aspect of the book is that it provides no explanation for the disgusting moral condition of the Capital itself.  Just how does a society degenerate so much that it considers kids killing kids to be the height of entertainment?  Perhaps this is a commentary on the numbing effects of violence in our own entertainment, maybe combined with the ridiculous popularity of reality television, in which \\"normal\\" people will seemingly do anything for their 15 minutes of fame.  Perhaps, based on the colorful description of the Capital's citizens (brought to vivid life in the movie), it is a politico-social commentary, as the freak show of the Capital seems largely like an extrapolation of what one can see any day in ultra-liberal cities like San Francisco, whose citizens consider themselves more enlightened than the hicks out in the sticks, but whose comfort depends on those hicks doing the labors of society.<br /><br />For a book aimed at such a young audience, THE HUNGER GAMES has an awful lot going on underneath the surface.  It heartens me, at least, that the younger generation found itself engrossed in this book.  Maybe if enough of them keep reading, we will not have to worry about a future like this.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|If you grew up reading comics in your youth, you'll love Captain America.  I read a few comic books in my day, and I can say that Captain America is worthy.  It's good action, with a good story.  It's definately worth renting or adding to your collection.
1572814136|1.0|Ok, so after reading the reviews I thought that I'd love this deck. There were some reviews that talked about missing pages from the booklet but I didn't think that would be a big concern. The deck arrived in great condition, wrapped and apparently new. I went through every card and when I reached the suit of cups I realized that it was missing about 5 cards. I thought they'd be mixed in with the rest of the cards. I didn't have many left and this concerned me. I went through the rest of the cards and what do you know, the last suit was missing 75% of the cards. NO JOKE.<br />I contacted Amazon and filed a return.<br />The colors are bright and pretty, but the deck is not as pretty as the Universal Rider Waite. Plus, it was missing a large amount of cards :/<br />I'd say, If you like it, order it but be aware that it might be missing cards.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Regular search and find.  Good directions.  Sometimes the objects are unclear as in look for paper and my last item turned out to be a pen.  Really at least let a person know its a relative search.
B006MGC3VK|5.0|When you have a line-up that consists of guitarist Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, keyboard player and singer Kevin Moore of Chroma Key and ex Dream Theater, and drummer Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree you can be sure the results must be something special. Despite their day jobs in some of the best modern prog rock bands on the planet this is not a rock buddies vanity project. What started out as a one-off album project has continued to grow and blossom, and this is now their fourth full length album. On their previous records they roped in some other big names in prog such as Mikael Åkerfeldt (Opeth), Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree), Joey Vera (Fates Warning) and Mike Portnoy (ex-Dream Theater) to help out, but this time everything's been played and sung by the core trio. It's a mix of ambient keyboard textures and hypnotic vocals, counterpoised by strident metal guitar. Arguably, it's their best and most cohesive record to date. They're truly progressive and original in a genre that's littered with imitators.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|The product was just as described and delivered in a timely manner. It is a great movie and finished my collection. thank you
1451627289|2.0|I'm afraid I'm less enamored of 11/22/63 than many of King's earlier works.  It continued on by about twice the length needed to tell the story, but more importantly, it failed to explain the pivotal element of the story: how and why the portal worked.  Without a plausible explanation of that vital point the book becomes a fantasy that stretches credulity rather than even a remotely viable method.<br />Washington Irving and numerous other authors have implemented sleep as a time travel technique, after failing to come up with a semi-realistic alternative technique. Earlier Time Travel techniques forced the reader to provide a plausible mechanical or advanced scientific method to move the protagonists forward and backward through the book without any scientific explanation whatsoever.<br />On arrival of H.G. Wells Time Machine, Bartlby.com notes that H. G. Wells is<br />A dreamer obsessed with traveling through time who builds himself a time machine and, much to his surprise, travels over 800,000 years into the future. The world has been transformed with a society living in apparent harmony and bliss, but as the Traveler stays in this world of the future he discovers a hidden barbaric and depraved subterranean class. Wells's translucent commentary on the capitalist society was an instant bestseller and launched the time-travel genre. Since then, numerous devices have been used.  These include machines that teleport people through space and time by disassembling their molecules and restoring them at a different point of space and time such as in the StarTrek series.  Worm holes have been used in several series of screenplays to connote a method of travel back and forth.  In my series [[ASIN:B0067MZ24Y The Rebellion (Escape Into History)]], two special operatives working private industry have their time travel facilitated by keying a series of codes into a handheld computer that has, through an electrical storm at the manufacturing plant altered the computers so they function as controllers to open a miniature vortex that swirls those in the immediate area to a time preselected on the computer.  Such advances have served to transport the technical level of teleportation beyond the simplistic device of just stepping through a rift in time that magically appears at the most convenient moments. King's use of stepping through a doorway without any tie in to any potentially plausible method of time travel, such as worm holes, Einstein's first theory of relativity or some the theoretical work by Kip Thorne results in a throwback to the credulity stretching elements Stephen King uses in 11/22/63. Overall, as Time Travel in demonstrates a mid-fifties television level of sophistication rather than the more technological techniques that currently seem more believable.
B004EPZ034|1.0|My grandchildren were very sad because the DVD was poor quality and stopped playing in the middle.  I had failed to keep the packaging info so we just didn't get to see it in it's entirity.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|Tremors is my favorite movie. I have three or four copies of it and Tremors 2: Aftershocks laying around my house...<br /><br />Unless they sent me a blank disc labeled \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", I knew I was going to like it. And wasn't disappointed with this disk.<br /><br />The quality of the transfer to BluRay was superb. It looked fantastic on the 32 in. HDTV I played it on at 1080p.<br /><br />I do have a bone to pick with how Universal has designed their new 'menu' interface. It sucks, big time. And, on this DVD, they called \\"deleted scenes' 'Outtakes'. And the cover of the DVD says there is a 'Making of Tremors' documentary short on the DVD. I've seen the documentary, before, but I didn't see it on this film. Oh, and the interface is poorly designed, loud and somewhat counterintuitive.<br /><br />Other than the interface, which, after all is said and done with, I can live with, this is a fantastic DVD, at a fantastic  price. I'd buy a copy for a friend/family member in a heartbeat... lol
B007J4T2G8|4.0|this book is well written.  it catches you from the very first chapter.  Its written in a classy way. I loved it. i am on the second book and about to get the 3rd.  I love the way the writer keeps you wondering on what's going to happen next.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Utter crap. There isn 't a straightforward way to exit the program.  Yes we figured it out but it is a pain and completely counterintuitive. Instant uninstall,  instant ban on anything else by the developers.<br />If there was a way to rate it zeros instead of stars i would have.
0345803485|2.0|Holy crap! Can kinky sex get boring? Fifty Shades of Grey does not deserve all its hype. It's simply a new twist on the vampire fiction craze with a Dominant billionaire with a dark past(I have to laugh even as I write that phrase) as the forbidden love. The book's claim to fame is all the S&M sex scenes, but even in the first novel they get repetitive. And to get to them you have to suffer through the \\"romance\\" which includes high school worthy email strings and other foolishness. The sex scenes are hot -- even if they stretch credulity -- but after so many you cool to them. I cannot imagine reading an entire trilogy of this stuff.<br /><br />No doubt BDSM parlors will be flooded with people wanting to try out scenes from the book and husbands will be grateful to EL James for their newly horny and kinky wives, but if you already have an interesting sex life, or if you really can't bear sophomoric writing, steer clear. America seems to be addicted to junk fiction of all kinds, and this is just a kinky new wrinkle.
B004J4WLPU|2.0|My cousin told me she couldn't put this book down. She recommended  it for my book club. I took my Kindle on vacation and as I flew in the plane, I attempted to read the book. I kept waiting with the next click that I too would become enthralled with it. Nevertheless, that never occurred. I was so confused! I usually can follow a book that goes back and forth without a problem. I usually enjoy such books written in that style. However, Sister I was having most difficulties following. It did not hold my interest and I actually found myself dozing off a few times, as I attempted to trudge through it! Sorry to say, I can not recommend this book. We have our book club meeting tonite and I am hoping someone saw what my cousin did in the book, because although I tried it was hopeless.
B007SGM084|1.0|I really want to read these books, but like many other people have said... $30 is WAY to much for ebooks. It is crazy! We are paying more to only download than to buy an actual in my hands book. It is such a ripoff. BAD IDEA AMAZON! Bring down the price, please!

0143121006|4.0|Historian Paul French puts a bit of a unique twist on True Crime. He focuses on a unsolved murder that took place in China just at the onset of war with Japan. The mixing of different cultures and peoples at this time in Peking's history is pivotal factor in why this crime was unable to be solved .<br /><br />The balance between the cultural history and development of Peking and the procedures taken to solve this crime were equal factors. As the murder victim was originally from Britain both police forces had to work together. They were also given a time limit on how long they had to unravel the details and arrest a suspect. When the time limit is up, Pamela's father takes on the case himself and with all of these documents 75 years later, the author believes he has solved the mystery and presents it to us in a very convincing format.<br /><br />After telling her father that she was going roller skating, Pamela fails to come home. He goes looking for her and comes across a murder scene in which the dead is literally gutted and unrecognizable that he has to identify her body by a piece of jewelery and her hair color. All of her body organs are removed and her face is butchered. Leading the investigation into several different directions, most likely being that this was not an crime of passion, and whereas there is no blood at the site of the body the murder had to have been carried out elsewhere. And this is what leads them into a large amount of questioning of people, business owners and possible witnesses that were out that night in various parts of the city that Pamela was known to frequent.<br /><br />The author gives us insight into the city of Peking. How the people that were coming and going from this city at this particular part of history were just as much a part of the way that the investigation was handled as the murder itself. People and businesses coming and going in the recent years with the impending war with Japan looming upon them. The combination of rules and regulations that both sides of the police forces had to abide by and a time limit that could only frustrate matters. Even her own father who was very familiar with Peking himself, unable to to find the answers before he died as well. A sad story that the author was able to bring to light many years later.rules and regulations that both sides of the police forces had to abide by and a time limit that could only frustrate matters.

0345803507|5.0|This book is so amazing.  I did not want it to come to an end.  The story is captivating from Book 1.  Thank you E.L. James for such an amazing trilogy.  Too bad there isn't a Book 4.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill earn their Oscar nominations with this laid-back thinking-person's movie about minimizing the influence of what you see in the face of numerical evidence to the contrary.  The movie explains how ball players are overlooked by Major League Baseball for a variety of of biased reasons and perceived flaws, how other ball players (including Billy Beane) were made first round draft picks based on the same biased perceptions and unthinking prejudices rooted in baseball's traditions, and how Beane, as GM of the Oakland A's, was determined to not use the same old methodology to draft his players.<br /><br />This is also a movie about how a guy (Beane) in a management position of a small-market business reframed a problem and then went about solving it.  Beane recognized that the amount of money you have is less important than how you spend it, and he figured out how to spend his money to maximize the efficiency of his dollars.<br /><br />Moneyball is my favorite story.  I take the book on every airplane ride, I listen to the audiobook on my commute, and my boyfriend bought me the movie when it came out on DVD (we also saw it in the theater).  I never tire of this story.<br /><br />The viewer might want to keep in mind that this movie is a fictionalized version of the book, and the book is also probably under the genre of literary nonfiction.  But I don't mind the movie's deviations from the book too much (e.g. Jonah Hill's chubby character Peter Brand in place of diet-conscious Paul De Podesta, Brad Pitt's maybe-overly-sympathetic portrayal of Beane as a genius in the clubhouse and a stand-up guy everywhere else, Philip Seymour Hoffman's unflattering portrayal of Art Howe, etc).  These deviations don't remove too much from the story, or, in the case of Hill's character, the deviation adds to the message of the story, and the story is really why I like this movie/book/audiobook.  I can see how the still-alive people involved in this story might be annoyed at the director, though.<br /><br />The movie had a few moments of humor that my boyfriend and I laughed at in the theater (e.g. \\"This is how we do business in Cleveland.\\"; Billy: \\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\", Peter: \\"Are those my only options?\\"; One scout: \\"Who is Fabio?\\"  Other scout: \\"He's a shortstop.  He's the shortstop from Seattle.\\").  Throughout the movie, the interactions and dialogue ring true (Billy: \\"If he's such a good hitter, why don't he hit good?\\").<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004EPZ084|4.0|If you enjoy silly, raunchy humor, this movie is about as good as the genre can get. I'll be honest: I was not expecting to like this movie. I thought it would be like a bad Saturday Night Live parody of The Office or Dilbert, featuring a pathetic, lowbrow script and juvenile potty mouth humor. For some reason I don't like Jennifer Aniston - I've never liked any of her movies and I don't find her attractive. I never wondered why Brad left her. But wow, she is over-the-top funny and sexy in this movie. Eat your heart out, Brad.<br /><br />This movie never lets up. Virtually every scene is funny and surprising. You never know what's going to happen next. It seems to me that most of the raunchy movies are about teens or college kids. This is a raunchy movie made with and for grownups, and I'm loving it! I've seen some other raunchy adult comedies, like Zack and Miri Make A Porno, and they're okay, but this one sparkles. There's no point in my saying anything about the plot. It's about horrible bosses - obviously - but you only need to know that it is raunchy, absurd, and funny as all get out. Even if you've never had a horrible boss, you'll still enjoy it. If you're in the mood for some wicked laughs, just watch it. You can thank me later in the comments section. :-)
0439023521|2.0|How interesting that an astute writer can superimpose multiple social events, recreate the passion of the gladiator entertainment and appeal to a younger generation.  Bravo
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Description says \\"**PLEASE NOTE: This app lets you purchase digital content using actual money. You can configure parental controls for in-app purchases, which will require your Amazon account password or a 4-digit PIN, by tapping the Menu icon and then Settings.**\\" THIS IS NOT TRUE. THERE IS NO SUCH SETTING.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews saying people's kids bought stuff w/in the app and got it anyway, thinking there was a setting where I could require a password for purchases. No such setting. Well, I've taught my 5-year-old not to click anything unless it says \\"Free\\" so I thought maybe we'd be okay. He played it for 20 minutes or so last night. It took forever to figure out how to turn the darned thing off. Got up this morning and had an email that he'd bought something for $4.99 that was charged to my credit card. NOT. HAPPY.<br /><br />And whoever is commenting \\"you need to watch your kid better\\" on all the reviews where people are pissed that it's so easy to let their kid buy something (probably the developer), shut up. Go find a 5-year-old, give him your Kindle, and sit there for an hour and watch him play a game while you try to clean your house, cook dinner, and take care of another kid or two. See how easy that is.<br /><br />If your content is good, people will buy it. You don't have to try and trick people into it. Really hoping I get my money back from Amazon. App is permanently uninstalled, which is a shame because my kid really seemed to enjoy it. I would have paid money to buy it because it actually looks pretty well made and fun.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|If the brutality with which North Korea's regime treats its people is unique in the world, it must be because it has lasted so long.  The people are too beaten down, too much under control, for there to be much chance of a revolution from within.  I don't count a possible military coup which would only change the power structure at the top.  Its neighbors, China and South Korea, are unlikely to do anything more than accept refugees.  Shin Dong-Hyuk, the subject of this book, managed to escape to China, and through good luck and fortuitous timing, found his way to a South Korean consulate.<br /><br />Perhaps the saddest thing about this book is realizing what life in the camps can do to the personalities of its victims.  Shin, born in a camp, did not merely grow up ignorant of the world outside, he grew up ignorant of the possibilities of human decency.  Love, honor, loyalty, and trust were not even concepts to him, growing up in a savage environment where the only virtues were to obey authority while looking out for oneself.  When he did escape, he did not merely need to learn how to organize his life in a \\"normal\\" society, he needed to learn how to be human.<br /><br />The author acknowledges that we can't know how much of Shin's story can be trusted; by its nature it is almost impossible to corroborate the details.  It does, however, match what is known of North Korea from other sources, and Shin bears the physical scars of the tortures and privations he described.<br /><br />A word about star ratings.  This is a fine book, well worth reading for anyone who has never thought much about North Korea, and what it does to its people.  Four stars adequately expresses my admiration for what has been done here.  If we strew five star ratings around every time we like something, however, there is nothing left for when we encounter something truly exceptional.  Just a thought.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|I really love The Walking Dead series and if you're like me then you really should have this in your collection.  The picture quality is a little rough but I figure it was the film used for the tv series.  I'm still glad though I purchased it on Blu-Ray.

0743289684|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to see what the woman go through. In other countrys and religion. We are so lucky to live in the United States where we can have our freedom and to be able to make our own choices in our lives.
0740748475|5.0|For Calvin and Hobbes fans this is the ultimate collection... with a nicely written history by the artist... buy the collection... much cheaper than the various books found at the local bookstore...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read the book in advance of the movie to see if I would like to see it or to see if it was suitable for my 11 year old granddaughter.  The book was a little violant in places but not enough that I would not want my granddaughter to read it.  I enjoyed it and think she will too.  I have read all three books and will let her read them too.
0345803493|5.0|This book is amazing as per my title a great author. I hope that she continues to keep wowing us with more books to come. I could not put these down!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love the graphics and the challenge. However it needs more levels already. Not sure why it was released when it was incomplete. It needs updated already please.
0345803485|5.0|I bought the first book for my Kindle Fire and was done reading in no time...I was immediately hooked Christian had me intrigued and Anastasia I had to keep reading to figure them out and after I bought the next two books I could stop reading them. I have now read them over again, yes, for the second time and am still just as hooked as the first. God Bless Stephanie Meyer for making E.L. James feel the need to open up and write, these books are so great!
B005IQZB14|2.0|I feel sorry for her mother, may she rest in peace. Seems this book was written on the back of her mom, all that horrible hate, drama along the trail, what did her mom do to ever do to deserve this trashing? 20 years later author still harbors this ill will and hate enough to write this trash and cash in on it? That's sad. And why was it she just walked out on her husband again? What did he ever do? Is all this behavior the new normal? What is to praise here?<br />.
B007IE4DSG|1.0|Volume one and only 10 songs?  Unbelievable!  At this length you could fit three volumes on one CD.  Just another rip off
B000024C7W|5.0|Mostly instrumentals, lots of nice work. Doesn't have any pop hooks like some of his albums, but still worth getting if you're a Wonder fan. I am!
0316056863|4.0|All the fans of Tina Fey will enjoy this book.  Her wit and charm come through in page after page of funny stories.  She gives us a look at her rise in the entertainment industry and at those who made it possible.  However, she does gloss over the personal life here a bit and uses comedy to deflect what could have been a more personal retelling.<br /><br />One of the problems Tina faces in this book is that she pretty much lived the middle class American life growing up.  There are no terrible childhood issue for her to overcome.  So how does she turn the ordinary into entertaining?  Well, of course, she uses comedy.  Her use of self-deprecating humor is legendary and comes across well in this autobiography.<br /><br />I was most intrigued by the people who gave her chances in her career, most notably Lorne Greene.  I had no idea of the sexism involved in the comedy industry.  Tina rose above and provides these stories for us here.  By the end of the book, I was most impressed with her ability to rise above the crowd and define her own success.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o good use of humor to tell stories<br />o interesting behind the scenes look at the comedy industry<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit disjointed in sections<br />o slightly impersonal - more focused on the accomplishments than the inner person<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this book as it is an entertaining look at the life of a comedian.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very good easy to use. Addicting! can't get enough of this vibrant game. Oh yeah the kids live it too!
030788743X|4.0|A buddy of mine at work recommended this book to me.  He told me that all the focus on the 1980s would make for a good trip down memory lane.  He was right in one regard, the trivia in this book is on par with any pop culture trivia game you can come across.  It is heavily bent towards the dungeons and dragons crowd along with movies, music, and of course, video games.<br /><br />The story itself reminded me a bit of Ender's Game and Willie Wonka mixed together.  The story moves at a fast pace and is written in an easy to read manner.  Even when it delves deep into games and game theory, Mr. Cline does not lose the reader with unneeded details.  The hero is just a bit smarter than the rest and this immediately throws him into a whole new world of corporate espionage, run for your life threats, and lots of video game playing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o fast pace<br />o easy read<br />o fun trivia on the 1980s<br />o enjoyable for the video game crowd<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit shallow on character development<br /><br />Overall - a good book and one worth reading for its entertainment value.
0553801473|5.0|As expected George RR Martin delivered another great book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  I was one of the many millions of people getting extremely impatient with the constant setbacks and missed publication dates.  At one point I declared loudly to all that could hear \\"I shall NEVER read another George RR Martin book as long as I shall live!\\".<br /><br />I promptly reread the entire series and then started waiting again.<br /><br />When the book was finally delivered I tore through it in a matter of hours.  It is amazing, just as expected.  The storylines have remained clear, characters have retained their personas and the flow of the series continued, even if this book technically is occuring over the same time period as the last one.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent read and one more home run for Mr Martin.
0756407125|2.0|I decided to tough it out and read this 1000 page snooze fest. Kvothe goes on some pretty pointless adventures and has the same repetitive interplay with his friends, Ambrose, and Denna.<br /><br />The main plot doesn't advance at all. This book is so slow. I kept hoping the book would unveil a chain of events that led to some plot advancement but it just didn't happen. The Chandrian are still hidden, doing whatever they've been doing in the prior 1700 pages of this disappointing series.<br /><br />I thought this book would be full of the excitement that the first one seemed to be slowly building up to. It wasn't.<br /><br />Avoid this series and save yourself a lot of time. It is a failed effort in the storytelling department although I do like the actual writing style (which is one thing that kept me reading).
B005QI4TP8|5.0|so, im fairly  new to florence and the  machine, and  wanted to test the  waters with them because i had heard alot  about  them, and  was very curious, so i bought both their albums, and  im sooo glad i did, because now im seriously  hooked!!... i absolutley am in love  with this  particular album, and  like  it  alot  better than lungs... florence welch is  a truly  beautiful woman with deep, powerful, thought prevoking etheral lyrics that one  can relate  to... i love  how dark this  album is  as well... my  two most favorite tracks  on this  album are \\"heartlines\\" and \\"all this  and  heaven too\\".... they are  both so powerful lyrically and  have  awesome  beats... i have  now  found  a  favorite band, and  hope  they contiune to release much more  awesome  music  in the  not  so distant future... i highly reomend  this  band to anyone...

B000EGCITG|5.0|i have  always been a  pink fan, and  have  almost all of  her albums, but  i must say, by far i think in my  own personal opinion that this  is  her best album to date... i have always  appreiated her sincere honesty through her lyrics, and  with this  particular album, i can most deffintiley relate to her in so many  ways... first off, the  song \\" stupid girls\\" is  brillant in describing how  rich celebrities only seem to care  about  outward apperances, etc... i have  the  video, and  think its hilarous... i love  the  title track \\"im not  dead\\"  \\"runaway\\" is  a  very powerful track for  me  as i have  been one  myself, and  deffinitley makes me  think about  my  life.... \\"conversations with my  13 year old  self\\" is  also a  very powerful, haunting, emotionally jarring  song  for  me because it  reminds me  of  how  i used to be  at thirteen... it  can be  hard  to listen to at times, but  i am forever greatful she  wrote that song... i also love  the  track \\" dear mr president\\".. a very honest and  heartfelt and  ballsy move  at that time  considering who was the  president  at that time... one can only  guess whether he  knew of  this  song, or  even listened to it... i also like  the  track \\"i got  money now\\"... all in all, this  is  a  superb album, and  i highly  reccomend  it  to anyone who likes  honest music, and  music  to relate  to.....
B005T87QCI|4.0|I love it so awesome so awesome just. add little more robots and I will like it even more then. I did
B001PB3RU8|4.0|so, as i have previously stated in my  other review of ceremonials i am a rather new fan of  florence and  the  machine, and  i am simply hooked on them now... i listened to ceremonial first and  like  that album much better than this  one, but  all in all, this  is  a  pretty good  album too... my  two favorite tracks on this  album are \\" rabbitheart raise it up\\" and \\" blinding\\"... i love  the trippy, dreamlike trancey quality of  blinding  and  the  very upbeat positive  lyrical content  of  rabbitheart... another great album from a  very awesome  and  talented band indeed... i look forward to other releases from them in the  not  so distant future....

B007HO392S|5.0|One of her best album's yet!!! She has songs that are more classic country and others more of pop country, but there is something in this album for everyone no matter what you like. These songs are so relatable, that's what makes them good. Country singers write about what they know and their experiences that's why people like it.

0385421982|4.0|In the recently released, \\"Redemption Day\\" by Steve O'Brien, a supreme court justice is kidnapped at the start of the story. In \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" two supreme court justices are murdered as the story begins. I found it interesting to compare the stories which were both well written and suspenseful and suggest that the reader read both novels.<br /><br />In \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" after the justices are murdered, the President feels that it is an opportunity for him to reshape the court. Eight of the justices will be republicans and their rulings could change the direction of the country for years to come.<br /><br />Government and media are attempting to analyze the murders to see why the killer picked these two justices. Darby Shaw is a bright law student at Tulane. She believes that she knows why the justices were murdered. She researches her opinions and publishs her findings in a document called \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"<br /><br />Darby is a student and lover of law school professor Thomas Callahan. She shows Callahan the document and he gives it to a friend in the FBI for his opinion. Not long after, Calahan is murdered and Darcy becomes hunted.<br /><br />Grisham is an excellent story teller and master of creating suspense. The reader can sympathise with Darcy who doesn't know where to turn and stays alive by her intelligence and quick wit. Even though she's unsure of who to trust, she continues her attempt to expose the guilty person, even at the risk of her life.

It's one of those stories that when you start it you don't want to put it down. Harper Lee sets the tone of the times perfectly!!!

Keep in mind that you must work at this everyday over time and that reading the book over again will help you regain perspective on points that perhaps didn't register at first.<br /><br />My suggestion, people never fully relax enough before sleeping or preparing for LD techniques. Always relax to your fullest ability to do so before engaging in any technique in order to be able to move on with your progress.<br /><br />The book is a great value at the price you find it for here, if you're here reading this review, you shouldn't even think twice about getting it, just get it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The series follows a wonderful and chilling story-line. The concepts in this book rival 1984 in greatness. A great read, I'd recommend it for anyone.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I was scared that this would be a bomb like the last couple of albums. I wouldn't call myself a huge VH fan, but these songs keep growing on me. I find DLR pretty funny and love it when he gives a little commentary during the songs and the harmonies are good. Missed that from the old stuff. Fun vs. serious.  Fav tracks in order are.... Stay Frosty(fantastic), She's The Woman, Big River, The Trouble With Never, You and Your Blues, China Town, Blood and Fire(really growing on me. Reminds me of VHII. DLR=\\"Told ya I was coming back\\" :-) ), Beats Workin.<br /><br />Didnt care for Honeybabiesweetiedoll. Even Tattoo has really grown on me.<br /><br />Overall, great job. Definitely a pleasant surprise. Thanks VH! Hope they can keep it together and put out more like this.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love this from start to finish! The songs have variety and show off the depth of talent (OMG remember talent?). Soulful, retro rock. Buy it for yourself. Gift it to loved ones. Gift it to the neighbors who always play crap music.
B007HO392S|4.0|Here is how my system works: I give each song either zero stars (if I would skip it on a playlist), half a star (if I would consistently listen to it), or a full star (if its good enough that I would download it as a single). Following are the track numbers and their ratings. Generally, I buy an album if I give it at least 4 stars.<br /><br />1. 1<br />2. 0<br />3. 1/2<br />4. 1/2<br />5. 0<br />6. 1/2<br />7. 1/2<br />8. 1/2<br />9. 1/2<br />10. 1/2<br />11. 1/2<br />12. 0<br />13. 1<br />14. 1/2<br /><br />Summary: 6 1/2 stars - Gettin' It! Country is not my preferred genre. As far as country albums by female artists, I have most of Shania's stuff (I know, I know... she's not really country), one of Faith Hill's albums, and now this will be the second Carrie Underwood album. I received her first album as a gift after I was rooting for her in the finale of American Idol. I'm not sure whether I would have bought it on my own, but there ARE some tracks on there that are keepers. I'm not familiar with her second and third albums yet, but after hearing this album I'm going to go back and get caught up. This album is definitely stronger than her first. She's unquestionably grown as an artist. This is one of the best country albums I've heard. \\"Good Girl\\" and \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" are my favorite tracks and she REALLY shows off her pipes in the beautiful \\"Forever Changed\\".
1401307450|5.0|If u have a child in high school you should definitely get this book for them to read<br /> I did not want to put this book down once I begin to get into it. The author made it feel like I was in the room with him. Very good book would love to read it again,
0439023521|5.0|Got this for my daughter, but I've read it myself since receiving it.  It was so hard to put down!  Came in great shape, although rather late, was afraid I wouldn't get it in time for the holiday.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Awesome graphics with lots of fun challenges.  I do wish there were more mini games and an easier way to get neighbors.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Maps stopped working for a few days, but seem to work fine now. The daily forecast is never even close to the actual temperature (although, even the local weather guys are wrong). No refresh button, so some days I'm stuck with yesterday's forecast. Really only useful for current temperature &amp; radar (when the app updates, that is).
B0055SWM08|4.0|Not the most stimulating game, but a nice series of increasingly difficult mazes to solve.  Definitely a game for introverts. Not sure what the years have to do with the game.
0385342063|1.0|I somewhat impetuously bought the hardcover of this book.  After reading it, I just felt really cheated.<br /><br />I strongly agree with some of the previous reviewers when they say 'Poppy' was only a slightly different version of Becky Bloomwood and 'Sam' of Luke Brandon.  It felt a lot like a book that had to be written to a contract deadline and not out of passion or interest.  To put it more succintly, this book was:<br />Truly awful.<br />Wading through it at times was simply a chore, but I'd already spent the money so....<br /><br />In conclusion, you'd be better off spending your money on....I don't know, say.....getting your tongue waxed.<br /><br />Don't buy this book!
B0031OCY2E|5.0|The Informant is amazing, it's definitely one of Damon's best work as well as Soderbergh's. This movie is greatly comical and wildly educational, especially to diehard fans of ADM and Lysine. As for Mark Whitacre, he's getting by on his looks. Not looking too dangerous, but tell that to the FBI!!! Just ask the FBI about the price fixing scandal of 1993 and see what they say. Then watch the movie.
0062183591|4.0|All of Dan Ariely's books are intelligent and entertaining.<br />Dan knows how to explain why scientific findings will help you understand humanity.<br /><br />Collaboration often leads to more cheating without any increase in productivity.<br />Being exposed to lies and deceit by people that we can identify with influences us to act the same.<br />The act of wearing or carrying counterfeit goods makes us more liable to cheat.<br />Creativity enables us to come up with strategies for breaking rules, and rationalizations that make us feel fine afterwards.<br /><br />The list goes on and Dan has plenty of science to back up each insight.<br /><br />My favorite sections of the book were those that focused on cultural differences (Chapter 10) (as far too many studies are done with young, white, privileged college students in the USA) and why doctors often become less trustworthy as we get to know them and build a relationship with them (Chapter 3). I also think his personal stories are highlights of the book. He is simply killer at moving from narrator straight into the science.<br /><br />A few downsides:<br />- if you've read one Ariely book, you will find a decent amount of overlap in this one<br />- you will get tired of the same experimental methodology used in a large number of studies throughout the book (his beloved matrix task)<br />- expect to be skeptical of whether some of these studies are relevant to decisions about honesty, deception, and cheating in real-world situations<br /><br />An easy, interesting read by a fantastic writer.

B000PMLFRA|4.0|Ok I broke down and bought the Blu-Ray version of the original trilogy and must admit it looked very good. I have unaltered versions in Laser Disc and VHS but we will never see it in Blu-Ray being that the huge demand would cannibalize the altered version plus the high quality video would ultimately lead to overseas bootlegging of the movies cutting more into Lucas' earnings. Not a good business move but I will most definitely pay top dollar for a limited edition run.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Great series. Acting is superb and the story line is superb. Product came on time and was undamaged. Highly recommended.
B007UXSPK2|1.0|This movie was LAME. Just another sad example of how Hollywood uses  it's power to do a quick money grab through hyping up a low quality movie with a washed up actor and a washed up old plot. Another PRIME EXAMPLE TO WHY I RARELY WATCH ANYTHING THESE DAYS! Someone needs to start a new company to compete with the garbage and propaganda Hollywood pumps out. You would think with all the new advances the world has achieved they would  stop with the dumb old espionage, terror, nuke em flicks. Get a life Hollywood you guys suck!
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  The characters are wonderful and I love the story line.  This is definite MUST READ for the romantic at heart.  It keeps you intrigued and entertained. You will laugh out loud an comment as you read along.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|dude get this app it is amazing you play these fun and cool games to win points and unlock more trust<br />me some games are hard but you'll get it sooner or later anyway two fingers/peace
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app can really eat up time. fun to play the little mini games and whatnot. download this!!! especially for you non 3g peeps
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a cute game, much like super Mario bros. I didn't like that there were only nine &quot;worlds&quot;, that you couldn't go back and replay levels, and that after losing your lives you had to go back to the beginning of the world - but all in all in was a fun game to pass the time.
0670023329|5.0|After reading this harrowing story of brutality at the hands of the North Korean government I am incensed that I have not, and we as a nation, have not done more to help these people.  I seriously wonder what future generations will think of us for our lack of action.  I have always truly believed that it is the duty of the strong to protect the weak and to not do so due to it being economically inconvenient, our own fear, or due to political interests will condemn us to the harsh, and warranted, judgments handed down by our children and our children's children.  When they ask, what were you doing what will you say?  \\"I wanted to help in some way but then became too preoccupied with the latest iPad?\\"  (I am not condemning you as much as myself for this.)<br /><br />I found it painful to read about the guilt felt by Shin due to his actions that he undertook for survival.  I understand why he feels it but honestly believe he had no choice.  An individuals instinct for survival is apparently the one thing that cannot be stripped from us no matter how harsh the circumstances.<br /><br />Ultimately I finished reading this feeling very lucky about where I was born and outraged that we, the UN/US and the world, let this occur.  It really makes you appreciate what you have and to know that no matter how hard life gets, it well never get as bad as it does for our fellow humans in North Korea.  I pray that God watches over them and grants us the strength to do something about their plight.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have full version on pc and addicted. Now I can play anywhere with my Vizio android system. Graphics are great and nothing is slow. Loads quickly. Would like it to have more like the pc version, maybe someday. But until then fantastic game play.
B00110K62U|1.0|I don't want to be overly harsh, but it's sadly true.  Every time Colm Wilkinson opens his mouth, there's a sense of disappointment.  It ruins the experience.  I loved the play on Broadway.  I love the CD.  In the past, I felt joy and chills at the sound of Colm Wilkinson's voice.  But time has taken its toll.  His voice has no strength, no range, no resonance on this DVD.  It's not my equipment, which is high quality.  LG 47LW6500 HDTV.  OPPO BDP-93 Blu-ray.  Marantz SR7005 A/V receiver.  Aperion 5T & 5C speakers & 10D subwoofer.  It's not my personal taste.  All the other performers are very enjoyable.<br /><br />I wish I could be more positive.  I have very fond memories of what had been.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! Definitely addicting for anybody who likes Facebook games &amp; Oregon Trail.  Absolutely not that beloved 1980's Oregon Trail I played on my Apple IIe though... lol. It's worth downloading on your Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really appreciate this Bible as I am homebound most of the time. Love and enjoy hearing the Word of God on audio! I am re-learning the Bible and getting closer to our Lord. Thanks for making my experience with the Bible on<br />Kindle Fire a very happy one!
B006MQRLSA|4.0|The online movie rental service has been great. There is a great selection from which to choose, and the rental price is as much as, or less than, what you would get at a movie rental store.
0439023483|5.0|It's better than the movie! So glad I read it. It's an easy read and you won't be able to put it down once you get it.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|i think it's one of the best weather applications. Reccomend it to you!<br />it is very useful and looks nice
B007P0Z9AY|1.0|This film is tedious and badly acted.  In particular, the acting by Ms. Knightley was bad enough to cause one to apply to a mental institution, just to get away from this movie. Further, the audience never really learns the significant differences between Jung and Freud.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter is addicted to the Hunger Games so yes, this book fed that addiction. :) And you cannot go wrong with a Kindle.
B006G39E2A|5.0|We had never seen Hercules in high def so this was a nice treat to rent on a lazy Sunday.  We enjoyed the movie thoroughly... the picture quality is not of the same high standard as retail Blu Ray releases, but it looked far and above better than a standard def DVD.  There were no interruptions or any hiccups in the service and we were very pleased with the rental overall.  Being able to rent a movie in minutes on your tv is a great service, especially with the wide range of titles they have.  This is something that's not available at retail in high def, so this is the only way to watch it in HD.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|If you like quirky and original British mysteries, you might enjoy this series set in Edinburgh with private detective Jackson Brodie. The scenery in Scotland is visually stunning. Inspired casting choices, original and intriguing plots, upbeat music, charming cinematography with great shots, and fun and fanciful dialogue make this a treat to watch. Based on books by Kate Atkinson who often has a streak of magical realism in her stories, this series has a bit of that, too. I found it added to the charm, and didn't detract, if you're not looking for a lot of realism in the the mystery.<br /><br />Plot lines intertwine and keep you interested, but beware, Brodie jumps around in his sleuthing. I enjoy the variety and eccentric characters and situations that keep coming at you.<br /><br />Because of the humor, it keeps the stories from being too grim. It's fairly light-hearted although deals with serious crimes. Somehow the interest is finding out how Brodie, the underdog, is going to help the down and out with his limited and overtaxed resources. That's the challenge.<br /><br />You may want to read the books by Atkinson after seeing this series. I found it captured the flavor of the book. Hope more shows are produced for it.
B004GYNPL2|4.0|This app is great. It keeps all my passwords safe and secure, yet easy to access. I just wish it was easier to back up a copy. It would be nice to if the desktop version was free. You have to pay if you want to manage your passwords from a desktop
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Works well on my Kindle Fire. Lots of fun and isn't money hungry like other &quot;free&quot; games.<br />Wonderful graphics and animation. Glad we got this one.
0061906220|5.0|This is a great story with just the right amount of repetition.  :o)  My daughter loves it!  I've read it so many times that I can recite it to her in the car.  Great illustrations, too.  You have to check out the youtube video of the author and illustrator reading the book aloud!  AWESOME!
B007MJSYF0|2.0|I rented Battle Royale due to the number of multiple-star reviews, but by the end I wondered what all the hype was about.  Yes, it's pretty clear that The Hunger Games owes some of its ideas to Battle Royale.  The basic concept and many of the ideas within the film (zones, \\"off-limits\\" areas, gangs working in tandem, deceit, etc.) were very much a part of Battle Royale long before the Hunger Games series was penned.<br /><br />But when I watched the film, what overwhelmed me was not the violence but the melodrama of the whole thing.  I lost count of the pained expressions, the looks of yearning, and declarations of unrequited love. The movie had just about every teen movie trope I'd seen in countless other films.  The geek.  The abused victim with a drunken parent.  The good boy.  The bad girl.  The girl gang.  The computer geek with a plan.  All of them were written with the expertise and subtlety of a screenwriter with no more than a couple high school Literature classes under their belt.  The characters were so broadly written, and cliche'd, that the sheer over-the-top emotion was hard to sympathize with.<br /><br />I also was surprised at the glaring warnings about how the film was rated R-15 (or whatever it's called in Japan), where anyone under the age of 15 is banned from watching the film.  Other than a few squibs, the violence primarily consisted of fake blood spray, stains on shirts, and an awful lot of cgi blood.  In fact, a film like this would barely rate a PG-13 in the U.S.  I could also remember virtually no profanity that would have justified anything more than a PG.  The violence is only shocking, perhaps, in the manner in which it was perpetrated against teenagers, but it was actually rather sanitized compared to films like Kick Ass and even Attack The Block (itself not terribly shocking.)<br /><br />So in the end, you get an over-the-top, melodramatic, and at times nonsensical film of attrition that follows a pretty routine formula to an end thatmost anyone could have predicted from the start.  There were few twists and turns, an awful lot of CGI blood, and one HECK of a laundry bill at the end. (Getting all that red blood out of those white shirts must have required a year's supply of bleach!)
B004LP3AYI|1.0|The story is good.  Just don't buy a Kindle version.  The second and third books in the series, I have not read beyond that, are difficult to read because of simple, gross editing mistakes.  Grammatical, spelling, punctuation and pagination errors throughout the book make it difficult to read and considerably less enjoyable despite a wonderful story. I love to read using a Kindle; I am just shocked at such a lack of quality control. I hope it is not a trend.  So buy or borrow the books and enjoy a good story. Just don't get them on the Kindle.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I freakin' loved this movie! Yeah, it isn't like these modern day action flicks with unrealistic over-the-top action, nudity and an overabundance of explosions and coarse language -- It's a throwback to 70's espionage thrillers. Even the music with its cool, driving bass riffs had me thinking Steve McQueen would've fit right into this cast of characters.<br /><br />And then there's Gina. Have I mentioned Gina Carano? That is one beautiful bad ass chick. It is refreshing to see a strong, athletic woman in a film role that actually requires a strong, athletic woman. No spaghetti armed little 110 pound actress. No shaky cam. No whip pans and camera tricks required to give her the appearance of looking like a fighter. Gina Carano IS a fighter and she is glorious to watch. The fact that this is her first film role and she still manages to hold her own without much experience is pretty impressive. She has a definite career ahead of her (I hear she has just been signed for Fast & Furious 6) and I am looking forward to more projects from my new favorite action star. Gina, you rock.<br /><br />Sadly there isn't much in the way of special features on the Blu Ray, only two little shorts -- One on Gina Carano and her rise from MMA, how Soderbergh 'discovered' her, to the training and some behind the scenes on the film.  There is another very brief short on the men of 'Haywire'. No commentary at all which is a missed opportunity in my opinion. It would've been interesting to hear Director Steve Soderbergh and Gina Carano discuss the film.<br /><br />I like what Soderbergh has done here with this nice little film. It's just cool. I'm sure there are some people who won't get it, I mean a lot of people aren't into older films. That's okay. Everybody has their likes and dislikes but this little gem deserves some attention. And hey, did I mention Gina Carano?
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|A very fine product, with high quality dvd releases, soundtrack, a funny gift, a book with photographies of the movie, all in a pretty box.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Gave as a gift my mother loved it. So do i<br />It came so quickly.  Would order again if only season 3 were ready.
0345803485|5.0|Perfect for the romance with a twist lover!! Reads very smooth with lots of detail. Good for college age and up!
B007HO392S|5.0|Great album. Just as good as the rest of her albums. Not disappointed at all. I preordered and got it today even though it just released today. Thanks Amazon and Carrie keep up the good work!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow, this book was a lot of fun to read, I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />It was a combination of a huge virtual reality game combined with a a bunch of old '80's games and details from the 80's.<br /><br />I thought this book was awesome, I'll be checking out to see what else the author has written.
B0008ENICU|3.0|I never ever warmed up to the untalented Norma Shearer.  Her directors throughout her career let her rely CONSTANTLY on her silent film faces.  Her facial expressions in \\"The Women\\" are no exception.  The quick hand to the mouth and the popping eyes (she's surprised, you know).<br /><br />She's untalented.  Always.  She just landed in big budget pictures with the sets and the wardrobes and really, you forget that there's a man, a leading man, in most of her films.  It's NORMA SHEARER after all.<br /><br />No men appear in this film.  Fine.  Good.  The movie starts out horrifically noisy in a beauty parlor. It seems as though there are two hundred women babbling all at once.  This opening scene is NOT entertaining.  So much noise, in fact, that you want to turn the movie off.  And it seems to last and last.<br /><br />And here's Rosalind Russell in stupid hats and odd sweaters.  (What's up with the sweater with the eyeballs on it?)  She does have some good lines and delivers them well, though.  I'll give her that.<br /><br />Joan Crawford comes in for her share of the pie as the \\"other woman\\".  She's the best in the cast and it clearly spotlights how MGM sort of tossed her off in a batch of witless films throughout the thirties.  Maybe they didn't know what they had in her.<br /><br />We get the weepy, boring Joan Fontaine and the supposedly wise Paultette Goddard and the damn-it-to-hell Mary Boland who never lets anything get her down.  We also get a screeching Marjorie Main, who would go on to better things than this carp-fest.<br /><br />The worst of the lot is Virginia Weidler playing Norma's daughter.  So saccharine is her performance it is apt to give you a toothache. (\\"Daddy....Daddy darling....\\"  Who the hell, ever, said \\"Daddy Darling??????\\"  Her performance is gross.<br /><br />And then there's NORMA SHEARER.  All gowned and coiffed and troubled and wronged.  Her silent movie face making the best of her waning stardom.  She can't act.  Never could.  And this movie is proof of that.  She's just there.  The central character, yes, but all the other woomen seem to have much more fun living.  Not our Norma.  She's the good and dutiful wife.  (Imagine someone requesting from the cook, \\"Tonight we'll have Pancakes Barbara\\"  Oh, wait, you don't have to imagine it: it's here!!!)  What the hell are \\"Pancakes Barbara\\" anyway????<br /><br />The dialouge is fast, funny and VERY entertaining.  Some of it is silly, but by and large is a very well written movie.  With the exception of the noisy noisy beginning and - hold on to your hats, folks - a Technicolor fashion show that plops down out of nowhere and is not only unnecessary, but brings the film to a screeching halt as you watch these models with their bizarre get ups, most of which would be better suited to the characters that populate Oz.  An odd moment, indeed.<br /><br />For most of the cast, their association with this film was a step in the right direction for their own careers.  For Norma Shearer, it's a vanity production all the way.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This guy is awesome. I've been listening to his songs ever since Geek in the Pink. Now, this CD is something completely different. Is LOVE. Simple and plain, but powerful and useful. I believe this is not good music to listen for, but study for. Music for the soul, he knows what he is doing... Waking up people, fixing and giving strength to all of those who listen.<br /><br />Take advantage of your musical choices and pick something that would program your brain to think positively... Pick Jason's LOVE. Good stuff!
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|to this hotel.  The hotel set is, actually, the films biggest star.  It is an art deco wonder (and I'm not even into art deco) and a marvel to behold.  It also looks like a fun place to stay, especially that little bar where everyone meets at 5:00 to do whatever it is people do at little bars at 5:00.<br /><br />I wish they had changed Garbo's character from a ballerina to ANYTHING ELSE.  She isn't graceful enough to be a world famous ballerina. This is the movie where she professes to wanting to be alone.  I'd leave her alone.  Her falling in love with John Barrymore is preposterous.  Of course, we all fall in love with the person that breaks into our hotel room, don't we?  Especially if you're a world famous ballerina.  Their love scenes are not convincing, but it's Garbo and Barrymore (!!!!) so of course we are supposed to be impressed and entranced.<br /><br />I'm not.<br /><br />Crawford's stenographer.  She plays it very well and is perhaps one of the easiest in the cast to take.  Sure, she'll run off with dying Lionel Barrymore for his money but so what?  She's a stenographer and a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.<br /><br />Wallace Beery is bluff.  All thunder and fire.  Fun to watch.  Can you imagine Gloria Swanson being married to this man?  She was.  Around 1917 or so.  He attempts an accent (the only one in the cast to do so) but don't ask me what kind of accent it is supposed to be.<br /><br />John Barrymore is John Barrymore.  Being photographed in profile as usual, but he has a nice voice.  He doesn't look like a jewel thief (but who does?).<br /><br />Lewis Stone's facial scar is never explained.  He quieetly keeps saying \\"people coming...people going...nothing ever happens...\\"  Well, it's an all-star vehicle from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1932 so of course a lot happens.  Everyone has a secret and no one is who they appear to be.  It's a great film and Cedric Gibbons deserves all the praise and awards he can for this one.  His hotel truly is a marvel.
B007WPM4V4|5.0|Stop saying negative things about this show, even though the show has some crappy episodes, they are building it up for the next episode.  Don't judge...no one is judging you. Come on people. Time to find something else to raid and rant about. Stop watching the show. Wait for the season to be over with and then judge on how the season is.
0307454568|5.0|All three of the trilogy books were spellbinding.  You don't want to lay them down. It has all the ingredients of great books.  I have recommended them to everyone I know.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love using this app daily. I use various reading plans and enjoy seeing my progress. Daily reminders are great too! I use this app on my iphone and kindle fire.
B000KIPT30|5.0|For those who choose not to invest into another AI (audio intereface) and need more than one headphone jack for monitoring and whatnot, this fits the bill. No loss in quality and you get four outs!! You can route all to heaphones or use the outs to route to other monitors in another room--the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />I give it a 5-star review for functionality and build quality.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Enjoyed the book overall...definitely geared toward teenagers, though. Enjoyed the educational aspects of the story (learning about Egyptian myths and such), which flowed well into the overall plot. Characters were well-done, though it seemed like the two main characters floated between teen and adult a little too often. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a read, and I'll likely check out future books in the series.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|kindle fire +this app= so much fun... until it would not open! iv waited so long and now it wont work! I'm so mad right now. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is an amazing book.  If you like adventure acrion and a hint of fantsy this is a good book and the movie is good too.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|this app is the BEST!!! I first bought cut the rope and loved it. I even beat the game with all three stars on each level. then when this sequal came I bought it (for only .99) and loved it even more! all the new features are super creative and fun! so get on your device and download this app NOW!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|We love this game. All of the family play to make our village great.  The only hard part is that it takes a long time to collect acorns if you are not willing to spend your real money buying them.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King hit a homerun with 11/22/63 as far as I'm concerned. It's the best of fantasy, thriller, love story, and historical fiction all rolled into one. The moment you enter the \\"rabbit hole\\" with Jake Epping you won't be able to stop reading. It's an 800+ page book that seems like 350! And the ending is about as satisfying as your favorite meal. So take a bite. You won't regret it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good interface and above average graphics.  I like that it gives you choice random deal, which may or maye not be beatable,or deal that is always beatable given you make best moves.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|totally was in love with game....now all I get are errors and not able to collect from buildings, houses, animals, etc. wish I would have read reviews before I wasted all my time on this game!
0763657875|5.0|This book is amazing! I love everything London related and pop up books are my favorite type of book! This book is a combination of two of my favorite things and is absolutely amazing. The pictures are fabulous, there are so many interesting facts and the book is just great! I strongly recommend it!

0765316994|5.0|It is difficult to write humorous books. It is even more difficult to not put in too much humor. It is still more difficult to write just the right amount of humor, be funny, and not insult the readers' intelligence. Scalzi pulls off all of the above. Then, he goes even further and does the humor while telling a very enjoyable story.<br /><br />Someone(s) are causing the deaths of other(s). Who? What? When? Where? Why? Whow? But, those aren't the questions that need answered; or they aren't the only ones. Add to them the question of \\"am I the only one who noticed ....?\\" or the question \\"you want me to wear what color?\\".<br /><br />We are subjected to the quandary of \\"recursive and meta\\" descriptions, events, and lives. The input of the result of an iteration is fed back for the next iteration and then coupled with the \\"meta\\"; as in a writer writing about a writer writing about the first writer. Add in self-referential events and you create the type of circular situation common to the paradox of traveling back in time and killing your grandfather.<br /><br />Thus everything is relative, little (if anything) is controllable, and reality (if there is such) is, perhaps, fictional. Maybe it's the fiction that is real. Either way, it is really fun to read such a deep story with such deliberately drawn shallow (if duplicitous) characters.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|It's amazing how watching this movie on bluray makes the movie more exciting each time we watch it Brandon lee does a great job on this movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|Katniss has survived the Games and returned to District 12 a hero, somehow winning alongside Peeta in defiance of the rules of the Games. That defiance has drawn the ire of President Snow who is afraid her actions might spark on uprising. Now she must convince all of Panem that she's just a young girl in love in order to keep her friends and family safe. As the noose tightens, revolution looms in the distance.<br /><br />It takes about half the novel for the story to really pick up speed, but once it gets going, it's the same flavor of un-put-downable suspense as its predecessor. The first half meanders around a bit, playing up the Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle and making District 12 even more of a Dystopian hell. MILD SPOILERS. But around the halfway mark we find out that Katniss is returning to the arena to take part in the Games once more. I was not expecting to see the Games again, but at least Collins keeps it fresh. It's a very different arena with a very different feel. And Collins is fairly inventive with her ways to torture/kill people. END SPOILERS.<br /><br />The plotting is good, the pacing is riveting, of course. The characters are interesting and mostly believable. On that note Haymitch, who had been stupifyingly one-dimensional in The Hunger Games is more fleshed out now, which was nice. Peeta has grown a bit, shifting away from his damsel-in-distress role (although we never wholly abandon that). In fact, this novel takes itself quite a bit more seriously than its predecessor, which I was pleasantly surprised by--especially in side characters like Haymitch who could easily be (and in his case have previously been) one-note jokes.<br /><br />My biggest qualm was with President Snow, who is transparently evil. We don't get the impression that he's on a misguided attempt to save the citizens of Panem from themselves. He's just a ruthless tyrant. Perhaps we'll get more from him in book three. But I find it funny that he could be so hypersensitive to the whims of the people and at the same time to eager to provoke them. My other qualm has to do with foreshadowing. Since Katniss is our perspective character, we get a lot of information that goes right over her head, which annoyed me. Early on one character shows her a watch that was a pretty clear signal of some plot point I'll not divulge. She misses it completely. Towards the end, she's so out of the loop that major plot elements are happening around her rather than to her. It was a good source of tension--seeing her willing to betray people she didn't realize were friends--but I stayed irked at her for not figuring out some predictable plot developments.<br /><br />All that aside, I stayed up until 2:30 finishing this book. I think I liked it better than the first one, and that's saying something. It's brain candy, sure, but it's really well-executed brain candy.e whims of the people and at the same time to eager to provoke them. My other qualm has to do with foreshadowing.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Almost to the end of this first book.  Can't stop reading; don't want it to end.  Thank goodness there are 2 more books. I seriously don't want it to end.  This is the ultimate damaged/dangerous man.  I have no idea how she will save him, but I sure hope she does.  These are good strong characters.  No synopsis here, you need to read it for yourself.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This set has all 8 Harry Potter movies in one box! It's a great thing to be able to get. People who complain that this set doesn't have all the extras as the regular single movie DVDs are correct. But if they are truly super mega Harry Potter fans like they say, they would had bought every movie as it was released for purchase and shouldn't be buying this set anyway! All movies for less than $50 is a great price. I watched every movie multiple times since receiving this set and pick up something new I didn't notice before every time. Recommend to buy!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a neat game. me and my brothers play it kn our electronics all the time. we love it. and it keeps us out of my parents hair. Haha :)
B003EYVXVE|5.0|I'm very picky about movies adapted from books.  On top of that, i am not one to recommend seeing movies in the theaters.  In fact, the last movies i recommended for theaters were LOTR, Star Trek, and Avatar.  I'm just not a big theater person.<br /><br />I knew i had to see this one in theaters.  I actually saw the movie before reading the trilogy.  While i do understand the complaints that stuff was taken out and the movie was \\"watered down,\\" isn't that what always happens when a book is adapted to a movie?  It was wonderfully made, and i actually enjoyed the cinematography, even though i've seen people who hated it.  It made me feel the movie more, especially during the heart wrenching walk to the reaping.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the movie AND the books!  Even though i was disappointed in Mockingjay and considered it a let down for how intense the rest of the series was, i still recommend it and will recommend it be a theater trip.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was well written. I found it to be most pleasing. The characters have amazing chemistry, interesting dialogue, and HOT sex!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Loved it but can not get into level 3.  Do not know why.  Have tried everything.  Stuck and would really like to be able to get into next level.  First time experiencing such a problem.  Any suggestions to help.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It worked like the first day. now it juss shows a black screen. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. I'm. sure the full version would be worth the money.  but as of now, I am not impressed with this app.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I got my Kindle Fire for X-mas and found it fit in the inside pocket of my jacket perfect. I wanted a case that would not add to the size demensions so I chose this one from Marware. That was in January it is still holding up like new other than a few ware scratches. The only thing I would do different if I had known is get a dark color. I chose the pink and haven't found a cleaner that works well in removing everyday grime. My Kindle gets a lot of use and is never out of reach so it collects dirt from handling. I read at least one novel a week sometimes two and three so it is in use a lot. The only downfall I have found is that there is not any way to store my stylus with it.<br />I recommend this case for protection to any android it is available for.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|right on this is like Mario bros it plays really well on my kindle must try if u like thhis type of game
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great series! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Love the way Collins mixes our society with Hollywood, politics, and the hunting aspect.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|Don't know about all the treble anyone else had with this game, but it works fine for me and now my son and I can play one of my fav games I grew up with together.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a good game for you and your kids to learn stratgy therefore I reccomend it for you.also it a good game to bring in the car for long trips in a car or plane!
B002WY65VU|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone. I found myself crying so hard I had tears. It's a hurt your side from laughter movie. The main character gives rules on how to survive the zombie attack. As he is walking on the abandoned freeway he meets Tallahassee who is in search of a Twinkie. While they are in a grocery store then meet the two girls on the cover of the movie who are on their way to an amusement park. As this movie continues the characters bond. They stay at Bill Murray's house.<br />If you want a movie that makes you laugh for 90% of the time I would recommend this movie. Best movie ever produced.
0345472322|5.0|This is a great read. 'Mindset' talks about two mindsets, a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. I am always looking for ways to improve myself in order to move forward both in my career and in my personal life and I found the information in 'Mindset' positive, useful and challenging. Grateful thanks to Amazon for providing me such an excellent quality, affordable book in such a timely manner :)
B006QKJRGG|1.0|If you are thinking about watching this because it is the third installment of Hostel. It was worse than the first one and sicker. What is worse that it is set in Las Vegas. As a movie by itself then it is okay. There are parts that are really good but as a whole I found it to be a waste of time.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|time keep resetting to over 1 week.  waited it out only for it to keep happening level 54 time to uninstall
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I thought by purchasing the \\"trilogy\\" it would be a good way to read the three books.  However, I didn't like the way they were delivered by Amazon as a continuing story.  I would have preferred three distinct books on my Kindle.  The books themselves were a great read, even for an over 65 year old man.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|loved it until all my timers screwdriver up. haven't been able to play for over a week and this is the second time its done this to me!!!! very high in levels so this stinks! about yo uninstall!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|A Song of Ice and Fire continues in this book and Martin delivers! The best thing to bear in mind with this series is that you can't take anything for granted. As we saw in the first novel with the death of Ned Stark, main/favorite characters are never safe and there's no telling who might be the next to fall.<br /><br />I really enjoy these books and am looking forward to reading future installments.
B000025JU0|5.0|This album blew me away so hard when it came out--more innovative and original than anything at the time. OMD did have their own quirky vocal flavor, which may explain their limited popularity. Personally, I loved this album then and I still do. These guys were simply genius. I'm listening to this album as I write this. It's the first time I've heard it in more than ten years. It still strikes as intelligent and honest, with a waterfall of soul and emotion coming through compelling electronic sounds.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The intrigue and backstabbing continue in Clash of Kings. If you enjoyed Game of Thrones, this is definitely a worthwhile read!
0345803485|5.0|Despite the terrible reviews this book is getting from some readers, I thought the entire trilogy was phenomenal. As part of a book club 50 Shades of Grey was selected and I scoffed at the notion of reading a \\"romance\\" or \\"erotica\\" novel. After picking it up and putting it down, about 50 pages in I was hooked. I read all three books in two weeks. The relationship between and Ana and Christian is powerful and the storytelling was provoking. I laughed out loud and I even gasped at times. WHAT A GREAT READ! I thoughtfully enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to James' next novel, I'll be first in line.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Before the movie was released, I seriously doubted that I would like it. My biggest concern was with Cap's uniform - it was Not the original. From what I had seen of the movie's version of it, the uniform looked drab and cheap. But, Joe Johnston pulled it all off, beautifully.  The story was crafted in such a way as to lock one's focus on Steve Rogers at the very outset - who HE is, and what it was about him that made him the One to be chosen for the Super Soldier project. He was the Right pick, at the Right time, for the Right reason. A world full of Captain Americas might Not be a better place, but a world full of Steve Rogers(s) would definately be an improvement.....<br /><br />From the gate, the look of Cap's uniform became less of a concen. In fact, in the context of the film - and the era in which it took place - the look actually worked, for me - somewhat. However, my only complaint about the movie was the way the facsimile of the original was used. I'm an 'old school' kind of guy, and I found that whole scenario to be rather insulting to the memory of the Captain America who I grew up on (I still think that they could effectively used the original uniform with the chain mail armor). Although this part make me squirm, it did not keep this movie from being an outstanding production.<br /><br />Chris Evans' performance was right on the money - he nailed the `Character' of Steve Rogers. I can't even think of him as the Human Torch, anymore. He handled his business, extremely well.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull....whoa! He was the perfect choice for the role, and I can't think of any words that would do him justice.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones - a WW2 colonel?....of course!<br /><br />Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes.....I liked it.  He did a great job. Although I am a fan of classic depictions of characters, I liked the portrayal of Bucky in the movie. A kid sidekick would not have fit the tone of the movie. Stan wore the only uniform that Bucky needed.<br /><br />Hayley Atwell was a great choice as Peggy Carter. She was tough, yet very much a lady - and you could see puny Steve Rogers melting her heart away. Seeing her dressed in 1940s styles reminds me why I would prefer to see ALL women dressed in those styles.<br /><br />I could go on and on...<br /><br />This movie is, in my opinion, the very BEST of all the Marvel movies. In fact, this is the most satisfying of ALL the super hero movies that I've seen. To me, it is waaayyy much better than The Dark Knight (not a particular favorite of mine - I liked Batman Begins much, much more). Joe Johnston is especially gifted in evoking the 1930s (see The Rocketeer - another great film)and 1940s eras. He knocked This one waaayy out of the park. Captain America The First Avenger is a grand and epic story that also pulls at one's heart - the ending left a lump in my throat.<br /><br />This movie is grand entertainment on all levels, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I've been fooled before, but I can't see The Avengers - or any other super hero movie - being a better movie than Captain America The First Avenger.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i spent more time reading the reviews of this book than the book itself.  i highly recommend the reviews of this book, as they are everything this book ought to have been: well thought-out, entertaining, passionate.
B000003CMC|5.0|Allman brothers is one of my favorite bands an this cd rules an is the best, but then again I like em all.<br /><br />This band and all of the other old bands like PINK FLOYD, NEIL YOUNG, FRANK ZAPPA, GRATFUL DEAD, etc. rules over all the main stream hip hop music.<br /><br />Also I am not into drugs of any kind, but I love this type of blues rock music. I arent a huge heavy metal fan because they all almost sound the same, like morbid angel, rotting christ...<br /> Also I don't just stick to (ONE) genre..also am into space rock(Hawkwind, Steve Hillage, and Ozric Tentacles). An some of others rock like Porcupine Tree.<br /><br />An also am into JAZZ music and TECHNO music as well.<br /><br />If you like blues rock then you may like the allman bros. an if your a Grateful Dead fan, etc. then check the allman brothers out.<br /><br />An last thing some people in my work told me that music like this is for older people but I think that its non-sense because there some people in their 20s an 30s that likes music like this, by the way I'm 32 an a half. And in the past I used only like Zappa like Frank zappa/mothers but it was till later in life like a few years ago when I got into Grateful Dead music an now I'm also just got into this allman brothers as well, though grateful dead fans(over internet).<br /><br />So when it comes too ROCK AN ROLL music I like blues rock and psychedelic rock too, like southern rock and space rock bands.
B0067LXQAW|5.0|When I purchased Roses, I was not sure The Cranberries could still deliver that classic Cranberries sound I like so much. So many bands reunite, but the magic is gone. I'm happy to report The Cranberries still have that magic! Roses explores all the sounds we've come to love on their older releases, but with fresh, new material. I'm notoriously picky when it comes to music, generally counting myself lucky if I like 2 or 3 tracks on any given album. I would rate at least half the tracks on Roses as downright excellent.<br /><br />If you're an old Cranberries fan, or even new to their music, you won't go wrong with Roses! Do yourself a favor and buy the entire album.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Si es lo máximo como todas las historias de Nicholas Sparks, románticas a morir, con una trama excepcional, hace florecer los sentimientos aun cuando solo estas leyendo, lo recomiendo
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a great read! It really starts getting good in the middle. It kept me turning the pages faster to get to the end. I love Nicholas Sparks books. They make me laugh, cry, get frustrated and suprise me.  I would recommend this book to any fan of Nichloas Sparks.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah Jones Does It again. Another award winning album from Norah Jones & her band. Side note, I would also love to see her in another movie at some point.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is my ALL time favorite app I have found to this day and I highly reccomend it to anybody with love of RPG's.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was grabbed from chapter 1.  The characters are believable and I related to (and laughed at) Ana.  This trilogy had me so entrenched that I forced myself to put the book down at 4:15 am since my alarm was set for 5:45 am!  I highly recommended this book to all my friends and suggested they keep a fan close by to cool off after reading the\\"playful\\" moments between the main characters.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!  I have watched it twice and shared it with friends.  It will be one of my keepers.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this is a fun little app. I like every thing about it except the noise, some would call it sounds or music I guess, but there's only so much of David spades voice I can take. but that's why there's a mute button :)
B00786XVOG|5.0|Yanni and his team of world class musicians and vocalists have created an excellent album and it gives the listener an overall great live concert listening experience.  It contains songs from his Truth of Touch album along with many sentimental favorites from albums past.<br /><br />I just saw the live concerts in Florida and Yanni's stage presence gives the audience a clear sense of just how passionate he is about his music.  If you have ever had an opportunity to attend a live Yanni concert firsthand, then you know just how special Yanni and his music can be no matter what the setting.<br /><br />Highly recommend the album!<br />.
B0054JELS4|5.0|Brand new - perfect condition<br />Delivered in a reasonable time frame, packaged well. I would definitely order from this vendor again! Have no regrets about my purchase, would do it again in a heart beat!<br /><br />My addiction to this program is growing as I watch past seasons! Without each actor playing their individual characters, the show just would not be the same. I have to say, Gibbs, Tony(both total eye candy) & Abby are my favorites!

B0052RDHTM|4.0|I've always been a World War II buff but really didn't remember much from school about World War I. Fall of Giants was greatly entertaining while also informative. \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" remains my favorite book, but I would easily put Fall of Giants up there with World Without End as a terrific read.
B000005HAU|5.0|This is one of guitarist Bireli Lagrene's better jazz albums of the 1990s. By this time he had pretty much discarded his original Django Reinhardt influence (even on \\"Nuages\\" he sounds nothing like Reinhardt) and he took time off from playing rock to perform a dozen familiar standards with bassist Niels Pedersen and drummer Andre Ceccarelli. Lagrene's technique had been admirable from the start and on this studio session his own musical personality was allowed to come to the surface. Highlights include \\"Softly as in a Morning Sunrise,\\" \\"Autumn Leaves,\\" \\"Donna Lee\\" and \\"Ornithology.\\"
B007RI56NY|5.0|Might be my overall favorite Train album. All songs are great and I haven't found any tracks that I've found a bit annoying like in previous albums.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This game is common. Getting a comfortable feel for some auto steps makes the diff between mind free fun and tedious work. This one is pretty good. However, the new ads of 15 sec commercials between play are way too much. More fun to NOT win to avoid them. Too bad.
0345803485|4.0|She's a newbie!  (author)<br />Yes I rolled my eyes a lot at the repetitiveness of some words, dialog, etc. but it's a fun sweet story!  Her constant defiance of him is what kept me intrigued and her innocence. The lol email bantering back and forth was quite pleasing. Come on!  Some of you didnt crack up over the massage that wouldnt have occurred if he hadnt upgraded her flight? And her room-mate asking \\"How was Jose at the bar last night?\\" right in front of him?  Its full of jealousy and insecurities that we all can relate to.  And I don't really care if he wasn't Dom enough for everyone. He fell in love with her and was lovingly gentle with her.<br />I read where a reviewer had written \\"He wouldn't even let her ride a jet ski!\\". Oh horrors!  Maybe because she had never ridden one before and was afraid shed get hurt?  Don't Dom him more than he is. She got on the ski knowing he'd be upset and playfully waved to him when he dashed out to see her.<br />It's her constant defiance of him that intrigues him and me. She stands her ground and there's a few twists and turns that I didn't expect that helped me cont. on with the book and I'm very glad I did. I love it and for the first time (another first!) I may just reread a book again. (this one)
B005721W9O|5.0|One of my favorite funny movies of all time - watch it at least once a year!! So many parodies are so stupid they aren't funny. Not the case here. It is well written, wonderfully acted, and downright hilarious! Maybe because I'm such a huge Star Trek fan - TV, movies, love 'em all - I adore Galaxy Quest for making science fiction funny.
B00701QVVY|5.0|I intended to write a review but hell... if you are an Overkill fan you already know this one of the years best metal albums. If you are not a fan by now you have already wasted your music listening life and it is too late to convert you. :)<br />A perfect \\"Overkill\\" album once again.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|This CPU is a work horse, and at the small price of $115 it's one of the best CPUs on the market. With 4 threads (to physical cores w/ hyper-threading) and a clock speed of 3.3Ghz this CPU will give you solid performance for most everyday tasks. The Intel HD 2000 graphics are the only weak spot, but will be fine for everyday computing and/or light graphics rendering like watching streaming videos in 720p via Netflix/Amazon Prime/YouTube/etc... I am running a small machine with this CPU, 8Ghz of cheap RAM, and a bargain Mobo. The machine performs exceptionally well and is very quiet. The included CPU fan can get loud at full speed, but I've found temperatures to be in the low 30's Celsius with the fan running at 65%, which makes it almost silent. I am using a 450W power supply because I had one sitting around, but you could easily get by with a smaller (200W should power this CPU just fine) one if you're so inclined.<br /><br />Very happy with this chip and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to put together a low cost machine. Was thinking about taking away 1 star for the weak imbedded graphics, decided against it because you get 4 threads at 3.3Ghz which is very impressive.
0895260131|1.0|The \\"facts\\" in this are hit-and-miss, for good reason -- they're meant to paint the most negative portrayal of Muslims as possible while exalting good, wholesome Christians who have never done anything wrong throughout all of history. Most laughably is the ridiculously distorted presentation of the Crusades. The author highlights all of the atrocities committed by Muslim militants during the Middle Ages while carefully disregarding any such atrocities committed by the Christian side. He also portrays all of the Western world as being unified in Cristendom, which, any good history buff will know, it was definitely not -- we Christians have been fighting ourselves ever since Constantine stuck his thumb into the pie, and for longer than we've ever been in opposition to Muslims. The author spends a couple chapters explaining that all of the scientific and medical and historical and literary contributions made by Islamic cultures were in fact made by Christians with Muslim names who were enslaved by Muslims, that Islam forbids all art and music of any kind, and oh yeah, they stole all their architecture from Christians too. Lastly, I found it really amusing how he spends so much time condemning the more violent aspects of the Quran and emphasizing how much better Christianity is because Allah commanded war and slaughter and Jesus didn't, etc, etc, but at the same time when Pope Urban II commanded, in the name of God and Jesus, that all Christian soldiers should wipe out the \\"Muslim race\\" from the face of the earth, he was totally justified because he didn't actually MEAN to ask for genocide. Riiiiiiiiight. Picking apart religions takes a scalpel, not a chainsaw, Mr. Spencer. Just more trash aimed at stirring up hate and ignorance. It's not even worth picking up for laughs -- the contents are facepalm and headache-inducing rather than laugh out loud funny. Don't waste your time.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|I really like the interface.  It's very simple and intuitive.  I only have one issue.  I cannot seem to get the reminders to work.  I've set the reminder up in the settings and I've set up multiple test reminders intended to simply cause the reminder to activate.  I have not gotten any of the reminders.  I do not know if the reminder is supposed to show up like one of the google calendar reminders or if it just puts a remninder in the \\"Notifications\\" section (where email reminders and almost every other reminder shows up)
B005G4TJUC|2.0|I have to say that I expected this one to be kind of good. But whatever. The visuals were absolutely awesome, that is a given. But overall, I just felt disappointed. The thing is, for a franchise that is ostensibly based on toy robots that turn into and from vehicles, Transformer has a great deal of serious dramatic potential. There are great characters to work with, and interesting philosophical questions to ponder. It was not that I thought that the plot of Dark of the Moon was not any good; it was just rushed, blitzed and obscured by the writing (oh, dialog), editing, and directing style. The one scene that I LOVED was when the Autobots were standing on the launching pad at Cape Canaveral in the sunlight, dwarfed by the starship towering above them. It was a quiet, slow, and sadly, emotionally poignant moment. They do not need rapid-fire, sensory overload battle sequences to be compelling characters. I wish that there had been more moments like that. So anyway, I guess that I was hoping for something different. Was this better than Revenge of the Fallen? I am not sure...I did find myself missing Megan Fox. But Josh Duhamel is always great in his role.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is slightly haunting and a puzzle with pieces waiting to fall into place. Some of the characters draw you in and others repel you yet you want to see what happens to all of them in the end.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|How lucky we were to have George Harrison make such beautiful music in our lifetime. A great soul and fantastic musician. Although some of these outtakes have been bootlegged before on the Beware of ABCKO Cd. The new remastering and clarity of these tracks, with him mostly singing with his guitar or with simple arrangements, is so heartfelt and joyous, you can't help but from being transported. If you are a fan, be ready to feel the love of why we still honour him All these years Later (Ago). I love every track but because I never heard his version of Let it Be Me before the DVD came out, this is a standout for me. Also hearing George play and sing Behind that Closed Door was breathtaking. It is one of my favorite songs of all time. Enjoy his unique gift of spirituality and breathtaking songs, a perfect companion to help lift your soul. Nameste .

B006R1T40I|5.0|Right now I'm anxiously awaiting from Amazon the delivery of \\"Slipstream\\". When I shop for CDs, I listen to the samples. With this album, I just KNEW, y'know? I'm reading rave reviews, watching it sail up the AMA charts, and I'm really excited for this lady and her new rich album. I can't wait to hear the rest of those two Dylan cuts.  Man!...  more later  maybe

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think deep down inside Christian Grey is every woman's fantasy. I sure hope they make the trilogy into a movie. Very well written, highly addictive. I read the trilogy within 2 days. Definietly want some more!!!
0345803485|4.0|Christian Grey is an enigma. He's handsome, driven, magnetic, possessed by an insatiable sexual desire, and yet disturbingly distant and perhaps dangerous. He's not the ideal first love for Ana, a naive virgin.<br /><br />If you purchase this novel as I did, read it with an open mind. I found the character of Christian fascinating. It's not because of what Christian does, it's trying to understand why he needs to do it.<br /><br />In her mind, Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" awakens and provides a humorous commentary that every women will identify with.<br /><br />I just finished the second installment of the trilogy. If you are intrigued by Fifty Shades of Grey, then Fifty Shades of Darker is a must read! It provides more insight into Christian Grey and his compulsion to control.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not for the weak of heart. This book (and book series) is a combination of Twilight's love story meets WW3! It is a great book too for those with a creative imagination!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was wary trying this books, after reading all the reviews. However, I am so glad i did. As a fan of erotic romance, the book was a little mild. I'm not huge into the BDSM theme books, but have read several. However, this is a small part of the books.it is a wonderful love story about a young ,an overcoming his issues. It is a lot like twilight with sex. Minus vampires. I am just disappointed that I have finished the series. Hopefully there will be more!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It aloes me to download videos to watch while I'm away from wifi. For the kindle fire, it works fine.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  Makes you feel like you were, there, but glad you were not.  Thinking of what these brave soldiers did in WWII, I cannot even imagine the hardship and dedication they have had.  God Bless all our soldiers, past and present.  Thankyou for what you do.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Excellent, in every aspect. The first single is the weak one of the album, the rest it´s incredible deep, fun, and daring. The best from her since Confessions

B006Z7Z3R2|2.0|After all the hype I ordered Innkeepers expecting to experience some chills. I honestly don't know where people think that there was ever any real terror or scary moments in this film. Is it really too much to ask for a horror movie to be scary?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the game just wish it wouldnt run out of energy so fast because I would like to play longer.  but other then that the game is really cool.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|I wanted to start reading a science fiction series today and had good memories of reading Dune a decade back but I never read more than the first two. I thought I'm reading a lot, now is the perfect time to go through the whole series and if I like them there are numerous recent prequels and sequels to dip into after I'm done with the original Frank Herbert stories. Then I saw the $15 for Kindle price tag and read about the errors in the volume and decided to buy Asimov's Foundation series instead.<br /><br />You've priced your gateway drug to a multi-book series out of competitive range, I'm sure I'm not the only one passing on a whole range of Penguin books as a result.<br /><br />PS: the rating is for the story (which I remember liking a lot) not the format, which I don't like in any way.

B002361MLA|3.0|I understand that Eckhart Tolle is the 'guru' but quite frankly I found this book lacking in practical application of the Power of Now and Mindfulness. I've read several other Mindfulness books by Jon Kabat-Zinn and Mark Williams. I found these to be far better at giving pratical advice on the practice of Mindfulness and applying this to the Now. I give this an 'Okay' rating, but you need to read 'The Mindful Way Through Depression' and 'Mindfulness A practical guide to Finding Peace in  Frantic World' to get lessons on how to apply Mindfulness techneques to achieve the Power of Now.
0807014273|5.0|Viktor E. Frankl is a famous Austrian psychiatrist well known for the invention of a new way of treating psychiatric ailments called logotherapy. Logotherapy strives to make the patient understand the purpose and meaning of his/her life. The meaning may differ from one person to another. It differs from the previous popular psychiatric theories based on the pleasure of sex by Freud and the urge for power by Adler. \\"Man's search for meaning\\" is a book which explains how Fankl survived concentration camps which lead to the eventual development of logotherapy.<br /><br />I read this book a few weeks back. This book is effectively divided into three parts. First part explains the tough conditions faced by Frankl in the Nazi concentration camps in Auschwitz and Dachau. Second part provides the realizations of Frankl through his experiences in extreme conditions of concentration camps. It provides in a nutshell the treatment of basic psychic ailments through logotherapy. Frankl and his students have treated millions of people using logotherapy and some of the instants are narrated in this part. Third part of the book includes a lecture given by Frankl which got appended to the book later as an overview of logotherapy.<br /><br />This book though a bit too hectic read to start with, poses some of the vital questions. How to find meaning of one's life even in highly improbable extreme situations? How to keep faith on oneself that the suffering would soon end, even if the conditions do not seem so? Why did not all the members of the concentration camp commit suicide? What impulse drove them to survive unrecoverable tortures imposed on them by the Nazis? How could the inmates of concentration camp cope up with the fear of being put in a gas chamber any moment? All these questions are elegantly answered in this wonderful book through search for meaning.<br /><br />Frankl gives instances how he helped the inmates of the camp even when he was suffering himself. Frankl also provides glimpses of the later treatments he provided to some of his patients which directed them to realize the real meaning of their life. Frankl makes it very clear that there is no such thing called universal meaning for every one's life. The meaning of life differs from one individual to another. The meaning can be anything like one's love for parents, affinity towards some God, completion of professional duty, etc. While in the camp, Frankl was driven by his love for wife and the psychotherapy book which was incomplete. Logotherapy can just direct one towards identifying that meaning of his/her life. It is for the individual to take the lead and live to fulfill that meaning.<br /><br />Though I have heard about the theories of Freud and Adler, I have not read their works. But after reading this book, I felt Frankl's logotherapy to be much more effective in facing life's challenges. The very fact that Frankl lived for more than 90 years even after going through the tortures of Nazi concentration camp, supports his theory quite well. The book is lucidly written though not much coherent. However, this book is highly recommended as it provides a detailed account of one of the foremost technique in psychotherapy and makes it accessible to any common man. I am sure every reader will get some different insight on life after completing this book.des glimpses of the later treatments he provided to some of his patients which directed them to realize the real meaning of their life.

B0051GY0LS|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version for reading on my holiday/vacation. No complaints, John Grisham is a great storyteller, and this is a great book and I recommend for all age groups. The Kindle version is as easy to read as a hard or paperback book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy these games. You only start with ten or so but it is easy to unlock more as you go.
0765316994|5.0|This book does more than just successfully navigate a tightrope between entertaining and angering Star Trek fans.  It provides more than just a very funny satire.  It brilliantly touches serious philosophical/religious issues around destiny, free will and fate.  While it does gently poke fun at the classic Star Trek episodes, it is not insulting to the legion fans of the series.  Rather, it provides a fresh look at a few of the themes that the franchise touched.  The core story, taking up around 90% of the book, is a solid, complete science fiction work but the codas put this book into an elite class.  Scalzi skewers writers through the book and cooks himself brilliantly in one of the codas.  Another spins part of the story in a way that would make Richard Matheson proud.  I think he has done some great work in the past (the Old Man's War world and some of his musings on Whatever are world class) but this is absolutely brilliant.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book. My curiosity regarding Christian Grey's past led me straight to the second book after finishing the first in less than a week. It's steamy, and definitely not for teen eyes, but it is a good read for adults. This book is extremely hard to put down. I have recommended it to many friends and all have loved it as well.
0451532082|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.irls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great read. My daughter and I both enjoyed this book. I can't wait to read the other two.
0307719774|3.0|I ordered this thinking it was a interesting idea to look back after five years seeing how you changed but there is a lot of problems with the journal. First it back fit in one hand so you can not right a lot in it. The spine is easily bent.Most of the questions are questions I wouldn't care about knowing later on in life like what I was eating or what animal explains that day yes..two actual questions from the journal. So it is all optional but you may want to keep from spending 11 dollars on something that will dissapoint you
B007V5CF5K|5.0|love hidden object games...this one has everything you would expect...only problem I had was it would lag on my kf every now and then and would reboot. to me though, that in itself wasn't enough for me to give less than 5 stars!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Let me start off by saying this is Eminems best album ever it is considered to be his best work which indeed it is thanks to powerful singles like \\"Stan\\" in which he plays the role of an obsessed fan who isn't recognized by Eminem then Slim shady himself finally writes the stalker fan back and realizes he kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend. \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" basically Eminem is letting people know who the real slim shady is and that he's not Pop like NSYNC, Brittany Spears, Christina Aguilara Etc... Now to the best Single and song on the Classic LP \\"The Way I Am\\" Eminem taking jabs at the media for criticizing his image and his controversial Lyrics just by stating hey this is the way I am U don't like it step off pretty much self explainatory but besides the singles there are other standouts like \\"Kim\\" most hilarious Eminem song ever. \\"Kill You\\" perfect intro to the album. \\"Criminal\\" what a way to end the album another funny track also if you don't own this album then U have a problem or just an Eminem hater go get it NOW!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great story.  I had trouble putting the book down.  Read this and you will want to buy the other two books as well.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I can tell by watching this that if you do it it will work. I can't say that I have tried it because I bought from Amazon Prime instant video and downloaded it to my desktop. I do not have room in front of my computer to do it. I wanted to make a copy from my download that I purchased but it has some kind of block on it so that my computer tells me it can't copy it. So if you are thinking like me and want to make a copy for your portable DVD player, forget it. Buy the DVD. Now I have to pay for it twice, hopefully my mistake will save someone else some money. Information on the workout: It has 3 levels. I assume you do a level for 10 days and then progress to the next. Jillian doesn't do the whole video which some other reviews have pointed out. She does it long enough to demonstrate and then walks back to the 2 girls working out and talks about the modified version and makes sure they are doing the moves right. In other words she isn't working out herself she is training and teaching proper form. She used squats, lunges, crunches and other traditional exercises mixed in with a bit of aerobics like running in place and jumping jacks.
0345803485|4.0|I have never read any book of this \\"type\\" I found it a bit disturbing, as I am  bit of a prude LOL I am on the 3rd book and am totally addicted and loving it. Please take a chance and read it. Be sure to have all 3 books, you won't want to have to wait.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I thought this game was enjoyable and I didn't have to pay real money to like it. Just like so many other reviews though, the time glitches is frustrating and not worth it. I even uninstalled then reinstalled this game and started completely over.... The timers reset to unrealistic times leaving nothing to do and no money being made.<br />If this problem were to be fixed I would definately install it and play again.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|Had not read the book, and I have to admit I didn't even know about the original Swedish film.  I watched this movie on a flight from London to the US, as I had always been curious about this series and was looking for a long movie to kill time on the flight.  Well, I absolutely loved this film.  It drew me in right away, and I was instantaneously in my own little world in rapt attention throughout this long movie.  Rooney Mara who starred was an incredible actress, and Daniel Craig was great- so much better, IMHO than he was as Bond.  I will definitely see the next movie in this series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of the most thrilling and compelling books i have read this year. i am an avid scifiand fantasy fiction reader and this book is definetly now in my top Five books list of all time. Thanks to Mr. Howey for writing such a imaginative and engaging story. i loved it!
0439023521|5.0|I don't read many novels in English, but I made an exception after reading the reviews for this book. This book is very good. My advise is to read this book before watching the movie. I really liked the narrating style and the simplicity of the language used by the author. The way she describes the struggle of the protagonists in the games is simply superb. I recommend this book.

1401923127|4.0|The research and description of the cell, especially the cell membrane, and how outside influences play the major role in gene activation helped me see the topic more clearly since I had come across the idea before.  The chapter on the effects of stress on the mind, body and cell activity was also exceptional and I learned new information that helps to reiterate that stress reduction is very important.  I had come across the importance of stress reduction via the research and explanation of the meditation and breathing program &Eacute;iri&uacute; Eolas which I have been practicing for some time.<br /><br />The author in another chapter describes how as children we are programmed with habits, beliefs and that as adults we are reactions machines just playing back these programs.  I found the description spells out the state of the individual pretty well.  I'm not sure if the author is aware of the teachings and work of G. I. Gurdjieff.  Gurdjieff laid out this fact in a full explanation of the subject over 70 years ago.  The book `In Search of the Miraculous' I think gives the best and fullest version of Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings and is an in depth description of man as a reaction machine, so if you find the chapter interesting you will want to continue on to Gurdjieff.  It's interesting to find that science with its discovery of the adaptive unconscious, see the book `Strangers to Ourselves' for a full treatment of the subject, that is mentioned by the author is just now catching up to Gurdjieff and what I see as the best explanation for the actions and state of man as a whole.<br /><br />I have to respectfully disagree with the author's epilogue that pretty much states that individuals just need to find love and also that the evolution of man will lift us out of our current sad and degrading state.  The universe and existence may be based and lead to a \\"higher state of awareness\\" for man, but not without conscious work and a basic understanding of what makesup humanity and it seems only a very few individuals are willing to make the effort and acknowledge the darker aspect of our reality - psychopaths and the role they play in society and personal relations.  The author and readers would do well to research and learn about the role psychopathy has to play in why we live in a violent and dog eat dog reality based on Darwin's survival of the fittest.  This fits all too well the aspects of psychopath that lets them thrive.  If you give psychopaths nice thoughts or love they will basically maul your being without a second thought, so knowledge of their existence and the part they play in the chaotic and evil nature of the current state of affairs on earth is in my mind essential.  (Books - `Without Conscience', `The Sociopath Next door', `Puzzling People', `Political Ponerology' to name a few that are vital to understand this topic)<br /><br />Overall give this book a chance.  I think it will surprise you and lead you to other understandings if you let it.

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Eva and Gideon are two characters I enjoyed reading about. They are flawed, and even though at first it feels as if their relationship is based on sexual attraction, it gradually changes as they get to know each other. Each has issues, and both are possessive of the other. Eva has gone through so much in her life, and she is still struggling with the sheer weight of what happened to her years ago.<br /><br />Cary, Eva's best friend also has some issues as well. So both sitck up for each other and encourage.<br /><br />I am really curious to find out more about Gideon, his past. I'm definetely looking forward to the second book in the Crossfire series.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|Definitely a strange and thought provoking film. The book is much more terrifying---especially for young teens. I had excellent quality on my television when I streamed it. The animation was excellent!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is a very fun game. Good strategy and fun the first and second runs through adventure mode. My only complaint is that there really isn't a whole lot to do after you get all of the achievements. Unless you really really like the quickplay things.
076115678X|3.0|I delved into this book and the methods outlined with such enthusiasm.  I'm a little disappointed for myself.<br /><br />Positives:  My daughters have 3c and 4a (if you are into the hair typing system) already definable curls.  Their hair responds well to the sulfate-free shampoo, feels softer after ditching the silicone-laden conditioners and looks fuller and less frizzy after donating my Denman brush - again per Massey's advice.  Lorraine Massey in her book and during interviews does not advocate the use of combs and brushes - not even brushes supposedly designed for curly hair.  In one interview, she said that Denman brushes cause frizz, breakage, and disperses your curls causing your curls to have to find their way again.<br /><br />From my experience, I have found this to be true about Denman brushes. I would add that using those brushes also causes your curls that do clump to shrink further onto themselves - making your curls appear shorter. But that's a different subject.<br /><br />IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF US WITH SMALLER OR TIGHTER CURLS:  If you are using the Curly Girl method and have 3c or 4a curls, finger-combing your hair en masse or in two sections per the photographs in Massey's book may make your hair look frizzy and your curls probably won't clump properly.  That was my experience on myself and my daughters.  My daughters' natural curls looked better defined once I divided their thick hair and mine into more sections and finger-detangled each section separately.<br /><br />For my tween daughters after a month of trying the Curly Girl method, I have no negatives to report.  They have beautifully defined shiny curls, I didn't have to buy an avalanche of trendy, pricey curl-defining products to get this look.  Hair care is fairly simple, cheap (you don't have to use the $30 a bottle DevaCurl Products Massey touts - any sulfate-free shampoo or silicone-free product that you like should be fine), and my daughters get tons of compliments.  Their hair responds well to leaving conditioner in the hair as Massey suggests.<br /><br />For me - different story.  My hair looks okay while it's wet or damp.  The curls clump.  My hair feels soft, softer than it did when I used silicones but it's not gleaming.  It looks powder-dull and a little brittle.  I'm not sure why.  I am under 40, I don't have any chemicals in my hair.  I don't use heat.  I don't have heat damage anymore since my haircut.<br /><br />My hair just doesn't look as good as it did when I was simply wearing twist-outs, bantu knot-outs, braid-outs or up-do's.  The curls on me (not on everyone) look sort of dated, and little severe.  I just feel I look unflattering wearing a cap of curls (my hair is about four inches long all over stretched).  Massey said that your natural curls can make you look younger.  Well, not me.  Perhaps my hair will look better once it's longer?  I don't know.  I feel now they make me look mousy or like a throwback from an 80's poster.  This is not the image I want to project.<br /><br />Am I crazy?  Does anyone else have this experience?<br /><br />Also, should people born with curly hair only wear it curly whether it suits them or not? I don't think so.<br /><br />For now, because I do like how my curls clump, I like finger-detangling (I lose less hair) and I like how soft my hair feels I will continue using the Curly Girl method but I will only be wearing my hair in twist-outs, braid-outs, etc. until it grows out a little more.  Perhaps my curls will look better when my hair is longer.<br /><br />That said, I'm glad that she has inspired and helped others, including my daughters.

0439023491|3.0|It was not as good as the first book. I did make it through the end but was very disappointed with the character building. I think the author did a better job of connecting the reader and the characters in the first book. I am on book 3 just to see how this turns out but definately enjoyed the first the most out of all of them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I kind of became addicted to it because the more games you play; the more points you earn and the more points you earn the more games you can play.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the books. Was a big surprise. I had heard many reviews and was hesitant to read. From start to finish i was hooked. The story line was great !
0061537969|5.0|This book is a breath of fresh air, I absolutely loved it!<br />I got extremely emotional at times and couldn't stop laughing at others.<br />We can all find an Enzo in our four legged friends... please do yourself a tabor and read this book!
B005MZIF4Q|5.0|My son and I have really enjoyed reading this! As everyday goes by he ask to read about something new. The statistics are amazing! And it is extremely easy to read from my smartphone!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The game is great but the game eventually creates a fake &quot;full memory&quot; claim when in-fact I had deleted half my apps due to an almost full storage while PLAYING the game. If it didn't have a problem when my memory was full why does it have one now??
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I purchased this and then could not even download it. I was highly upset! I strongly do not recommend this for anyone and would not bought it for myself had I read the reviews!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an awesome book and I am so glad that I was able to purchase the whole trilogy through my kindle.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Defenders of the Faith defines the genre of metal. This album is pure, and epic. The tracklist is: Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, Rock Hard Ride Free, The Sentinel, Love Bites, Eat Me Alive, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, Night Comes Down, Heavy Duty, and Defenders of the Faith, which has a connection with Heavy Duty. It includes two bonus tracks: Turn On Your Lights, which was recorded during the \\"Turbo Sesson\\" , which it is a nice slow song, and Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith Live, which sounds very epic and modern. This is a fan favorite album. Even a song \\"Freewheel Burning\\" made an appearance on the video game \\"Grand Turismo 4\\" for it's fast pace racing concept. Jawbreaker is an epic, fast paced song, simular to \\"The Sentinel\\". \\"Rock Hard Ride Free\\" is a fast, epic song, that even sounds like it could be in a cool 80's flick, it jus has that cool classic sound to it. \\"The Sentinel\\", oooooooohhhhhhhh The Sentinel, no words can describe how epic this song is! \\"Love Bites\\" has a dark and epic sound to it. No emotion, but yet lots of it. This is pure Priest! \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is a smooth, but yet, very rough song lyric wise, this song seems more like a song for \\"Screaming For Vengance\\". It's a good song, but some parts don't go with the rest of the album. \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\\" has a classic 80's feel to it, lots of action, but calm. You just can't stop listening! \\"Night Comes Down\\" is a very nnice slow song for the album. It's very diffrent from the rest of the album, but yet it just goes with it. Just think of \\"Stained Class\\" and it's simular setup with \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\". Slow but EPIC! \\"Heavy Duty\\" and \\" Defenders Of THe Faith\\" are put together. Kind of like \\"The Hellion\\" and \\"Electric Eye\\" on the \\"Screaming For Vengance\\" album. Very epic, and heavy duty has the \\"Bad Ass'feel of the song \\"Iron Man\\". By all means, this album should be at the top of your list! This is \\"The Metal Album\\", this defines the genre in an epic way, so if you're a rock fan orany sub genre of rock fan, you will like this album. It is pure and EPIC![[ASIN:B00005K9LM Defenders of the Faith (Exp)]]
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|seriously the best game ever! no flaws/problems yet &amp; tons of fun! better than any other &quot;friend&quot; game... super competitive &amp; great!
0517543052|5.0|I purchased this book as I had heard a lot about it in a positive sense, and I wanted to get something that I thought would help a friend who was having a challenging time.  Her feedback has been great and she's expressed lots of gratitude for the shift in her awareness that is causing a different mental outlook.  Hey, it's all about helping each other out, right?!<br />So, this book gets a thumbs up from us!<br />Peace from a Planetary Citizen

0345803485|1.0|If Anastasia was my daughter I would kick Mr. Gray's ass. As a society we set a minimum age for sex, especially for young women and older men because young people can be easily abused and taken advantage of by cynical and heartless horny old men. Of course this Statutory Age is arbitrary. A few street wise and experiences eighteen year-olds might be able to handle Mr. Gray.  But, many twenty-one year old protected, naïve, shy virgins like Anastasia can not. Gray is an abusive, domineering, neurotic creep. If adults want to play out some bondage fantasies, fine. But this guy is WAY over the top. This borders on cult, brain washing, slavery type behavior. Stay out of my neighborhood Gray, I keep a shot gun by the door.<br /><br />And by the way, than non-disclosure agreement isn't worth the paper it is printed on.

B007Z9RAX4|5.0|Kick-Ass movie, Hope to see more. From start to finished action, with hand to hand moves and weapons. Great directing and stars.
030788743X|1.0|Wow.  I can't believe 638 people have given this book a 4 or 5 star review.  Is the thrill of recognizing a reference so overwhelming that they've ignored how atrociously poor the writing is?  The references to 80's pop culture aren't even artfully done - but I'll get to that in a moment.<br /><br />This book was so painful to read, I only finished it so that I could write this review and add another sane voice to the few who have rightly given this book 1 star.  This was the worst book I've read as an adult... and I've read Twilight.<br /><br />It's like the high school creative writing project of someone obsessed with 80's movies and World of Warcraft, a person who's never heard the advice \\"show, don't tell.\\"  This book is ALL tell - the author manages to resolve entire plot points in a paragraph that boils down to, \\"I studied it beforehand so I was awesome at it and I won.\\"  Meanwhile, there's page after page describing the protagonist's routine in I-wake-up-and-then-I... format.<br /><br />There's very little character development in the book.  Not much in the way of descriptive language, either.  The plot is pretty thin, too.  All of things have been replaced by trivia.  Instead of building interesting characters, a realistic and beautiful universe, and a solid plot, there's just endless 80's (and 70's and 90's) references.  They are used in place of dialog (of which there is extremely little - conversations are related instead of transcribed), they stand in for character attributes, and they make up almost all of the 'virtual world' in the book.  As a reader, I got the feeling that Cline does not know how to be truly creative - he just used 80's stuff as a shorthand, a way to hook readers that love nerd nostalgia.<br /><br />Okay, so the writing isn't great - it's the guy's first book and I would totally cut him some slack if the story was good... but it isn't.  It's pretty lame.  It's set in a real world that's been abandoned for a virtual one, which is a great set up to explore a number of interesting premises, to ask questions about our own digital lives.  Unfortunately, Cline doesn't explore or contemplate anything of depth.  It's Whiz Kid vs. Bad Guy trope all the way.<br /><br />The conflict in the book comes from an evil corporation that's trying to win a game, which means a lot of it takes place in the virtual world where there are no stakes and endless power.  It's hard to build tension when the only thing that could go wrong is a restart.  Or when there are a million opportunities for a random anything to save the day.  In fact, that might be the ONLY literary element present in this novel - lots and lots and lots of deus ex machina action.<br /><br />The protagonist, through whom we learn everything about the real and virtual worlds, is nearly intolerable.  He brags about himself constantly - the whole book, really.  It's one long brag about how awesome this guy is at video games and 80's trivia.  There isn't a challenge he can't overcome because he's THAT good at Joust or THAT into Monty Python.  All the other players just aren't quite as good as him and he treats them like it - even his friends.  It's like the inner dialog of the Comic Book Guy.  Grating and with absolutely no self-awareness or growth.<br /><br />TL;DR?  This is the ultimate in badly written fan fiction.  It's just awful.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|In an age where nothing is innocent anymore, but everything is way out of control and corrupt, I found this sappy, sentimental movie to be very refreshing and entertaining. No cursing, and no bloody violence(for a change) made for a very relaxed viewing experience. And, I love happy endings - especially because happy endings are also hard to come by in this crazy world. Let me enjoy a little fantasy. Indulge me. There is entirely too much \\"reality\\" these days. Plus the movie really ends up implying - surprisingly - that war is indeed a racket. Yay! I could go on, but I've had a long day. Suffice it to say, I first saw this on VUDU, but liked it so much that I ordered the blu ray. Can't wait for the sequel. :) By the way, the picture and sound quality of the movie are hard to beat.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I'm really liking G5 games. now on my kindle fire I've downloaded apps that I love on my phone ....
B0037QM8YA|5.0|This movie really moved me, it was so heartbreaking to have such a selfish Mother.<br />Sure do hope there is a sequel. God Bless Precious for having so much inner courage and strength.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it! I wish I could play it all day long. I enjoy playing the game and I learner from it. I have told all my friends about it also!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a awesome game you can also play with your friends just type in their character name or email so its awesome
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|THIS GAME IS FRICKIN DRAWSOME!!!!!U SHOULD TOTALLY GET IT! WYA BETTER THEN WORDS WITH FRIENDS!!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY..... i should proabably calm down. i just had an energy drink lol!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very well written tale. Could not stop reading them.  Collins takes us on an exciting adventure that brings out numerous emotions.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so much fun to play. wish you didn't have to have actual people neighbors though. run out of energy too fast but its my go to game to burn time.
B007WOQLHS|1.0|I was given this particular Kindle version of the book as a gift, and simply have to report that this electronic version of the book cuts off abruptly and does not contain the entire story.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|I think Horrible Bosses is a really funny movie; I rate it 5 star and hold it equal to some of the best comedies of the last 5 years (The Hangover, 40 year-old Virgin, Little Miss Sunshine). Considering the crude sexual jokes that seem to be prevalent in many recent comedies, I thought Horrible Bosses was very decent, except for a scene or two.<br /><br />I think Jennifer Aniston was awesome, she was hot, she was funny, and her acting was great. Actually, all of the actors did a terrific job. Colin Farrell, like Jennifer Aniston, was  in a very unusual role where he showcased his comedic skills which I didn't know he had. Kevin Spacey is great as usual; his portrayal of evil boss with gigantic ego was amazing (although his character gets too crazy in the end).<br /><br />Totally Inappropriate Blu-ray edition has some extra scenes that are not in the theatrical release but they are not that many. I've seen this at the theaters recently and if my memory serves me rights, the following scenes are extra:<br /><br />- When MotherFxxxx talks about the incident how he acquired the name MotherFxxxx, there is a flashback depicting the story<br />- There is an extra scene which shows Bobby having sex with some prostitutes<br /><br />I really don't care for the Ultraviolet format as I watch my movies on big screen TV. I know many reviewers rated this 1 star due to their dislike for Ultraviolet format. I don't think it's fair to rate a Blu-ray product just 1 star due to dislike for only one of the formats offered with the product (but everybody is entitled to their opinion).<br /><br />If you like this movie, I recommend this version (I bought it for $15 from Amazon, which I think is a great price; Target and FYE have the same version for $20).
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Keeps your mind alert. Great for the baby boomers set. We need all the help we can get. Would recommend it if you like match games.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I am not going to get into the story as I think it is a very well-known film. I personally think it is a great achievement in film making (especially if you consider the budgetary and other constraints) and after 28 years, it still holds his power as one of the most beloved science fiction movies.<br /><br />I had reservations about buying the Blu-ray as I have read many negative reviews here on Amazon. I ended up buying it from Target only for $8 (which is unusual as I buy almost all of my movies from Amazon). I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see that Blu-ray transfer was actually quite good, if not without flaws.<br /><br />It is not very grainy but there are scenes in the movie that suffer from artifacts (I most noticed it in the scene where The Terminator is talking to the punks and later during the flashback where a terminator infiltrates the compound and starts firing his weapon). I think it would be wrong to expect it to look crystal clear like the movies that were made in the last 5 years. HD audio is excellent.<br /><br />Although artifacts didn't bother me that much, if they were removed, the picture quality would be better. There are talks about a new and better Blu-ray edition being in the works to release early next year. If you can wait (and don't want to spend $8 - $10), then the upcoming edition might be a better choice. But if you are not too nit-picky, this Blu-ray edition is pretty decent (in my opinion).

B005IQZB14|1.0|I recently read AWOL on the Appalachian Trail and really enjoyed the outdoor experience.  I bought this book with the same desire to experience the PCT in the same manner.  It didn't happen!  Too much discussion of personal issues with drugs, sex, and relationship problems which took away from what could have been a great read about an outdoor adventure.  In my humble opinion the book was terrible and I wish I had not wasted the time or the money!
0393088774|5.0|Extremely relevant to our current economic condition. You wont get this type of analysis from the Fox news.  I wish people would read this instead of the so called \\"deficit hawks\\" who \\"seem\\" interested in cutting the deficit as long as it doesnt include defense cuts or taxing the rich.
B006G4WN18|5.0|Meat Loaf grabs you by the jugular and doesn't let go in this epic journey into the heart of darkness and back into the light. Elements of hard rock, heavy metal, and two songs with rap integrated in a dramatic way (\\"The Good God is a Woman and She Don't Like Ugly\\" [Chuck D] and \\"Stand in the Storm\\" [Lil Jon]). Meat Loaf sings with great intensity (listen to \\"40 Days\\" and \\"Mad Mad World\\" for example). This is Meat with no loafing around!

0099579936|4.0|Very engaging! I loved Ana.  She made me think of myself. Eager to learn and wanting to be loved by someone special.  The book kept you wandering where the next chapter would take you. I hope all my questions will be answered in the next book. Can't wait to purchase it to see if Ana and Christain are able to establish a meaningful relationship.
030758836X|3.0|I'm just going to come out and say it: Gone Girl pissed me off to no friggin' end.  That's the one feeling that remained consistent to me throughout the whole novel.  Sure the things that pissed me off were different each time I read a new chapter, but that feeling just did not go away while I was reading.  In fact, it's still lingering despite the fact that I have already finished reading the novel.  So just know that you might experience feelings that may vary from mild annoyance, to pissed off, to maybe, if you're particularly sensitive, out and out rage.  There's my disclaimer.<br /><br />First things first.  I was highly annoyed at Gone Girl for the first 200 pages.  It was just so ever-loving slow!  And since I've read both of Gillian Flynn's novels, I was already spoiled to the fast pace that those novels employ (or rather, not the agonizingly slow pace that Gone Girl was lingering in).  I was also spoiled to the fact that Gillian Flynn's previous novels all started off immediately creepy.  I found the beginning of Gone Girl...mundane (although that probably reflects more on my reading experience of reading tons of creepy/horror books as opposed to the novel).  So mundane that had this not been a Vine book, I would've stopped reading it.  But since I have read it, I think not finishing it would have been a mistake because it ended up being really insane.<br /><br />Gone Girl shocked me like you wouldn't believe.  I had expected the book to go one way (the mundane way) and it ended up going a completely creepy and off-kilter way (which I liked).  Yet, still I was annoyed, but this time because I was supposed to be.  There's just so much flip-flopping in this book (half of it is narrated by Nick; the other half by Amy) that you don't immediately know who, if anyone, to root for.  In fact, I spent most of the time while reading Gone Girl wanting to jump into the pages of the book and repeatedly shake every single character to saneness.  Again, this is deliberate and I wasn't so much annoyed at the book by then, but at the characters, but like I said, I think you're supposed to be.  There are no clear heroes in this book and that did make this book seem more human to me as opposed to the self-righteousness that can plague some books with a clear hero.<br /><br />Again, Gone Girl is INSANE.  One minute you start off thinking \\"God, I hate this person!\\" and then you think \\"No, scratch that I hate THIS person\\", until finally you realize you hate everyone in the friggin' book, but that's okay because they are all relatively hateable (I know not really a word, but there you have it).  And the situations the characters find themselves in are hateable (and there it is again)...and shocking...and brings new meaning to the word \\"twist\\".  Everything that happened (after those initial 200 pages) was so unexpected and not in that annoying \\"well we didn't see it coming because it made no type of sense\\" kind of way.  The things that happened here made sense, which brings up all sorts of questions like \\"If you find that THIS situation made sense, what does that say about YOUR state of mind?\\", which is all sorts of fun.<br /><br />So why the 3 stars?  Well, I just couldn't get over how long Gone Girl took to get going (for me as this is all a matter of opinion).  Sure, once it did get going, it never stopped, but I just wouldn't have given a book 200 pages to get going if it wasn't for review.  Also, I was left feeling very unsatisfied by the ending.  I expected an exploding, tremendous ending and what I got was an ending that was, now that I'm thinking about it, very reminiscent to the beginning 200 pages of Gone Girl: anti-climactic to the extreme.  I still recommend Gone Girl as I do feel the middle of the book (right up until the end) was worth it just for the \\"this is craaazy!\\" comment you will most likely say.  However, if you even semi-like this one, I'd recommend Gillian Flynn's two other books as I think they were better than thisone.one.

B001JNNE64|5.0|It is excellent in the historical context of the character. All people need to watch this movie! Note 10 in all conditions possible! It's great to give up art classes!<br /><br />One of the best classics of cinema and one of the best films that portrays the life of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the cast is to be congratulated. It's a shame to miss Mozart 35 years who knows the 100 years he would leave, but beautiful works of all times like these that we have access to CDs and concert halls.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a real page turner. It's a great read. I am glad I purchased each and urge you to do the same.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Another Heavy Metal masterpiece!! Blood of the Nations was as well. Mark Tornillo is a perfect fit. Udo who? Need I say more? Wolf Hoffman is one of the most underrated guitar players of all time. The riffs are killer! The rest of the band is totally dialed in. Stalingrad and Blood of the Nations should be rated as the best Metal releases of the 21st century in my opinion.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you are thinking about buying this bundle because you love the HBO series a few words of warning:<br />1. Though the HBO series is a very faithful copy of the books, the books are so much better. So any plans to not read beyond the latest TV release will soon be shot.<br />2. If you're a big fan of Tyrion (the dwarf), you'll love the books even more. That's not taking anything away from the actor in the HBO series, he's a giant in a small body. It's just that it is so much better to know what he thinks as well as what he says.<br />3. The books are far less sexy than the HBO series, though that's good if your children want to read them. And they are a great read for teenagers, with lots for them to learn about human nature.<br />If you haven't seen the HBO series, you probably think a bundle is a bit of a gamble. However, if you have a Kindle or i-pad, just read a sample, if you're not hooked, I'd be surprised.
0470932139|4.0|This is a well written practical book for anyone who knows basics of photography and wants to go to food photography direction. I have tried another book (digital food photography Lou Manna ISBN 9781592008209) that is much more basic than this one, may be suitable for people who are not familiar with photography terms and techniques much, but personally I prefer Helene Dujadin's book Plate to Pixel because it is very well written and has got great visual instructions. She teaches the food styling as well, so you can get creative in your own kitchen. Recommended.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very captivating story! I absolutely loved it and am about to start a second read through! E L James tells an intriguing story about this out of the norm (or is it??) relationship. The story is about so much more than a BDSM relationship. You will fall in love with the characters and their love story as you read through the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is the 2nd book in the series, all i can say is WOW !!! i could not put the book down and the ending is a cliff hanger and at 3 am i finished this book and just had to start the 3rd one to see what happened !!
0439023521|5.0|When the motion picture of The Hunger Games was released, I had no idea what this series was about. I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon, until I heard it was about New World Order and apocalyptic themes. Being as a fan of possible futures, I dug my heels in and bought the book. The narrative was easily accessible with great visuals of a place like we know, but lost in a terrible fate. Katniss Everdeen's narrative was strong, as a girl that was trapped in world where food was scarce and she had family to take care after her father's death. This touching story had me spellbound with baited breath never wanting to see even a paragraph ahead, it was that good. The romance was well suited and not at all heavy handed like the \\"Twilight\\" series. Frankly, love is just another part of Katniss's life that she can lose in the Games. The most surprising element was how moving the protagonist's sensitivity for her fellow competitor was illuminated. On the other hand, this story didn't throw down a story that was too much of a political agenda, and where it was bordering on it, it never strayed very far into a contemporary political message. The story was fresh and new merging the elements of the Greek or Roman Colosseum and the sensationalized reality TV. Leaving the reader with a couple moral questions: if the Hunger Games was a real event on TV now, would you watch it? If you would, what does that say about society and ourselves? I would highly recommend it to anyone about that likes apocalyptic themes, accessible narratives, and a strong sensitivity to the plight of humanity that are conscripted against their will to die for the amusement of strangers.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|The Film:<br /><br />A perfect continuation of Henson's characters, and a sort-of spiritual-sequel to the original film and the classic TV-show, \\"The Muppets\\" follows Walter, a muppet born into a human family, who learns that an evil oil-tycoon plans on destroying the Muppet Studio.  He must re-unite Kermit, Gonzo, Miss Piggy and the other Muppets so they can put on one final show to raise the money and save their theater.  Filled with delightful inside-jokes, great meta-humor and a tone that is appropriate for all ages (I've known people aged 7 who enjoyed the film, and people in their 60's who have loved it as well), this is a perfect family movie.  A 5 out of 5 any day!<br /><br />Three-Disc Blu-Ray Set:<br /><br />Great picture and sound quality, and some nice special features, though this set doesn't feel as complete as I'd have thought.  I wish there could have been more for the features, especially given this is a 3-Disc Set.  In fact, most of the discs are devoted to the DVD and Digital Copies (and the soundtrack download), and not to bonus content.  It feels like a bit of a missed opprotunity.  (Especially given some of the features, like the fake trailers, are available online for free.)<br /><br />That being said, the perfection of the film makes this a definite buy for fans of the series!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|To me, a long time fan of a little known book, Wyrm by Mark Fabi, I couldn't help but compare Ready Player One to my avowed favorite book; so of course it comes up a bit short. The exploration of early computer/gaming culture and 80's pop culture was enjoyable, if a little beyond my realm of expertise. However, Cline does a good job of making the subjects of discussion understandable to the point where, despite not being familiar with the object of a discussion, I could still enjoy the discussion itself, and in some cases, be tempted to do a bit of research on my own into the game/movie/album/etc.<br /><br />A fun adventure that, while sometimes tripped up by (necessary) exposition and awkward pacing, was, for me, intensely satisfying and enjoyable. This was a book that I didn't want to put down. I'm interested to see if the movie comes through and how the story will be handled, since the novel relies on a strong first person narrative voice.

I'll definitely re-read this one!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not a novice when it comes to reading erotic fiction. I think the lure of these books is that it has the same obsessive intensity of the Twilight books.

0345803485|5.0|Well, let's see...I finished the first book in nine hours. It took me 3 days to finish book 2 and 3- which consisted of sneaking into the bathroom at work to read it, ignoring my family for 3 days, sleeping a few hours a night because I couldn't put it down! Loved the characters- you get so invested in them. Yes, it's kinky--and it's also a beautiful love story--a good recipe for a beautiful, fun marriage. I was in a deep depression when I finished the trilogy, so within two days I started to reread book 1 again. We all need a little spice in our lives~~~READ IT!!

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was suggested it from another author who writes paranormal romance.<br /><br />Sophia is your average white Wiccan trying to live in a small town. Her mother is bipolar and highly disturbed. Her mother joined a cult like church ran by Mrs. Franklin, who will do anything to get Sophia out.<br /><br />Sophia thought she was just a little left of center until her friend Ivory took her out to a club..from that night on she learned of the supernatural world..Once you learn things like this sometimes you wish you hadn't.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat learning all kinds of history, and rooting for Sophia. There are all kinds of twists and turns, but they were enjoyable and fun. I'm glad I took a chance on this book and hope there are more to come!<br />When is the next book coming out??? I want more!

0823095223|4.0|A very useful book for getting started with sculpting as well as setting everything up. My one complaint is there's really very little in the way of actually sculpting HOW-TOs in the book, which is fine, but if you're learning how to sculpt accurately, get a book on anatomy. This book shows you how three particular industry talents, and really, only one or two of them, go about sculpting pieces, the materials they use, etc. etc. If you aren't familiar with sculpting/carving in wax, this book will try and familiarize you with it, but it basically only shows you how to get a rough sculpt done in clay/whatever, then casting it and finishing it in wax, and doing another cast in resin. Sound complicated?<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with that whole process, the book will get you started with it. If you ARE familiar with it, then there's the main problem: you're already familiar with it, and all you'll divine from the book is a handful of helpful hints. The book does a lot to really impress on you that you can't get good sculpts if you aren't finishing in wax. But, if you just want to sculpt some figures in clay or Super Sculpey, like me, without dealing with all sorts of other things like casting in wax and wax pens and whatever else, again like me, then this may not be a wise investment.<br /><br />Otherwise, there's lots of pretty pictures and a bunch of great, helpful hints if you want to seriously devote yourself to sculpting in the figure kit/statue/action figure industry.

055380684X|1.0|What a load of garbage.  So this guy claims to have the \\"secret\\" to becoming great, huh?  And that secret it...wait for it...practice, motivation, and a coach.  And if you happen to come from a place where people have been successful in the past and there is a tradition of winning, even better.  Really?  That's all you got? It took research and an entire book to figure this out?  For the way this was marketed, I expected at least to hear something new.  Sure, he mentions the myelin thing (which, by the way, is open for debate in the scientific community), but that's just a theory of what happens when you apply the aforementioned \\"secrets\\" and get better at something.<br /><br />All that aside, what irritates me the most about this book and claim that anyone can acheive greatness, is that anyone cannot.  Without being naturally talented and thus superior to everyone else, all the hard work in the world won't get you to greatness.  For every person who's achieved greatness through practice, motivation, and coaching, there are thousands more who have practiced harder, were more motivated, and had better coaching, yet never came close to achieving the same level of greatness.  Quite frankly, this idea is a slap in the face to all of those tens of thousands of people who have done everything in their power to be great, but have fallen short.<br /><br />What separated those that achieved from those that didn't?  Natural talent folks, plain and simple.
0345803485|1.0|this book is truly deeply amazingly awful - at least the first 40 pages are.  It's some of the worst writing I've ever encountered in my 66 years, I'm sorry to say.  But if Danielle Steel can make money from her books, I sincerely hope this author follows in her footsteps.  I would be more detailed and specific if I'd been able to get farther into the book, but apart from some loopy sex scenes, there doesn't seem to be any reason to try when there are so many good books out there.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Overall I like the service. I just upgraded to premium for the ability to use it for my employees to check off of to do list I created.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I'd put it on par with [[ASIN:B000QUEQBS Shooter [Blu-ray]]]. A Bourne Identity type movie where the main character/agent is double crossed by their handler. Considering its budget, 1/3 of the 10 year old Bourne Indentity, its not bad at all. The plot moves along and makes sense. The fight scenes are good and don't detract from the movie. Gina is not a bad actor at all. I am not sure where all the 1 star reviews are coming from. Its clearly not bad at all. Perhaps its not outlandish enough for some of today's audience. Its definitely not gadget laden like [[ASIN:B004EPYZV2 Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo +Digital Copy)]] and maybe that's what some where expecting. If you liked Bourne Identity or Shooter, you should enjoy Haywire.
B004E3XD1W|5.0|When my mother bought this book for me, saying that someone who went to her college (Williams) had written it, I couldn't even have expected how good it would be. I had had high hopes for it, judging only by the description and the cover, and it exceeded all of those. It is a fantastic women-empowering book. For a debut, it is amazingly well written, and has all of the plot-line, originality, detail and intensity of an author's tenth book. I have actually just re-read it for the fourth time, which is what inspired me to finally start writing reviews on amazon. So, to sum it up, I love it!

006197806X|5.0|Oh how I'd been pining to read this novel. I had to get through quite a few review books in order to read it, but finally, I could wait no longer! I was beyond nervous before I started reading it. Would it match up to the heart-pounding excitement I felt during Delirium? Would it be the same without Alex? There were so many questions, so many unknowns but ten pages in, I knew I was safe. I knew this book would be just as good as te first. I'm going to skip the summary as this book doesn't really make sense unless you've read the first and if you've read the first then you really don't need to know the premise for this book. Anywho.<br /><br />The Good: What's not to love about Oliver's breathtaking writing? Picking up Pandemonium was like going away to college and coming back home to sleep in your old comfortable bed with all your favorite trinkets and toys piled around you. Oliver's writing is like coming home. There are some stories you just connect with. You fall in love with them whether or not you realize it and every time you touch on that love, it's an easy, comfortable relationship. So I guess that was the first thing I really loved about this novel. To be more technical though, there were so MANY things I really loved about the sequel to Delirium. The novel is broken up into \\"Then\\" and \\"Now.\\" I thought this was a really brilliant way to break up the chapters and Lena's story. It also made me royally agitated because just as I was really getting into one section, the next chapter would start and I'd be left wondering what came next. (Which is exactly why Oliver did it, but damn woman, I hate the suspense sometimes!) I know a lot of people said that this novel wasn't as good as Delirium, but I happen to think it was as good if not better. I LOVED Lena's character development throughout this story. She grew by leaps and bounds in this novel and I was seriously impressed with how attached I grew to her. I liked her in Delirium, but to be honest, I wasn't head over heels for her. She kind of drove me nuts with how passive and naive she was. But that girl is LONG gone in this novel. I enjoy novels with kick-ass girls, but I especially enjoy kick-ass girls who have a reason to kick-ass. It's this determination, this primal survivalism within her that makes her character grow so well in this novel. She preserves, she persists in her endeavors even when she thinks it's the end. She goes against the grain to stand for what she believes in. THAT is why she is such a kick-ass character. I actually really liked Julian too. I wasn't sure how I'd take the little romance thing between Lena and Julian, but he's different then Alex and I liked him with Lena a lot. I kind of associate the two relationships like this: Lena and Alex are symbolic of innocence, experimentation, first loves, intensity and passion. The \\"before.\\" Lena and Julian represent the \\"after.\\" Lena has been hardened, she's rough around the edges. She's both calm yet fiery. Things are more calcuated this time around but yet her draw to him is reminisicent that you can't control everything. That sometimes catching amor deliria is the best thing to happen. I loved the action in the novel and even though I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about Raven, I feel that she will become more important in the next novel. Now for the total SCREAM OUT LOUD ending... WOW. Lauren Oliver sure knows to end her books on cliff-hangers. Damn you Lauren Oliver. I don't want to wait another freaking year for the next book!<br /><br />The Bad: Nada! Not one thing I disliked about this novel!<br /><br />Of course this book earned its A+ rating!

B00723NWJE|2.0|I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but...I don't think I like Norah Jones' music anymore.  Maybe I'm just a middle-aged weenie, but I liked the kinder, gentler Norah from her first two albums.  The last three have introduced me to a musician who's simply not to my taste.  The material is harder, darker, funkier...and if you like that kind of thing (and people do, as the 5-star reviews indicate), I imagine there's no-one better than Jones to deliver it.  But there's little melody here, no hooks I want to hear again; it's mostly jarring, turgid and dull.  And Jones' idiosyncratic voice is overly processed and distorted to a detrimental degree.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not someone who sits around listening to Enya and Jim Brickman.  I'm into Maroon 5, Guster, Smash Mouth, Parachute, Counting Crowes, Sugarland, Sara Bareilles, Rob Thomas, Josh Kelley, John Mayer..all sorts of different styles.  So I'm open, believe me, to new sounds.  I'm just not digging the ones Ms. Jones is making these days.  And that makes the little broken heart...mine.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|It's hard to put into words how I feel about \\"The Iron Lady,\\" Phyllida Lloyd's non-tradional biopic of English prime minister Margaret Thatcher.  On the one hand, I think it's non-linear approach is one of its assets.  We certainly get a sense of Thatcher's career, her rise and fall, her defining moments, if you will; but they're presented almost as flashbacks, in pr&eacute;cis form.  The dementia-addled Thatcher is looking back on her life and it's all a jumble, almost a blur.  This is how memory actually is, and I enjoyed how Lloyd and screen writer Abi Morgan played with the audience's expectations.  Much of the film makes little sense, with characters slipping into and out of Thatcher's consciousness, particularly her dead husband Denis.  The surreal elements work quite well, in my opinion.  What doesn't is everything else, including Meryl Streep's Academy Award-winning performance.<br /><br />Yes, I know this is sacrilege.  We must love everything that Streep does because she is Streep.  But to me she takes a two-note approach: she's either befuddled (old Maggie) or bitchy (middle-aged Maggie), there's no in between.  (Alexandra Roach, playing the young Thatcher, is one of the few actors here who finds any kind of nuance in what's they're doing.)  Streep provides a pitch perfect impersonation of Thatcher, and it's fun to watch.  But as for presenting a fully rounded human being with flaws and insecurities?  Not here, I'm afraid.  And maybe Thatcher had none...but I doubt it.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, Streep can only do what the filmmaker and writer ask of her, and she's sorely let down.  The best that can be said about Lloyd's direction is that she shows greater skills than she did on \\"Mamma Mia.\\"  The film has no point of view and seems particularly unclear about how we, as an audience, are supposed to feel about Thatcher.  Watching anyone go through Alzheimer's is sad and difficult, of course, but it's not enough.  What made Thatcher tick, why was she who she was?  The film never even asks those questions, let alone tries to answer them.  It's an exercise in biography that's more about show than substance.was?

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This story has been done so many times, and even though I normally love the innocent sweet girl makes the good looking bad boy fall in love plot line, I had trouble getting through this at some points.  I actually found Christian plain out creepy the way he bossed Ana around and sent her e-mail after e-mail.  The sex is just as kinky and steamy as everyone said, probably more so.  I'm no prude, but I had to put the book down and take a break every now and then.  It was just TOO much.  I honestly have no idea how there are 2 more books after this one.  It seems like it easily could have been wrapped up at the end of this one.  Having said that...I did read the book in just a few days.  It held my attention well enough.  At some point I'll probably check out the two other, but I can definitely wait.  I may have to wash my eyes out first!
055358202X|4.0|Right up my alley. Got the boxed four book set when the show hit HBO. Liked the characters and thought, 'this'll be cool'. And it was until book \\"A Feast for Crows\\". When Sandor speaks to Arya while breaking their fast one chilly morning after the 'Red Wedding', he says 'About your mother...' I blew beer out of my nose. And then it gets phoned in. But you know what? I'm invested, for the long slog. I want to see what happens with Daenerys and Euron Crow's Eye. It's one hell of a game. I just hope book five isn't Tweeted.

B0007LXPBI|4.0|The Parent Trap... a remake that is almost as good as the original! I really love this movie and would give it 5 stars except for the fact that I've seen and adore the original. This movie didn't try hard enough to be its own story. There is too much identical dialogue. That in itself would not be a problem. The problem comes from borrowing things from the original that would not make sense if you had not seen the original. Meredith bangs sticks together to keep mountain lions away during the camping trip. No explanation. The girls get goose bumps. So what?<br /><br />Some of the stuff was overdone. No one - especially little girls - are putting beds on a roof! Two little girls on opposite sides of the world would not be experts in sword-fighting. I took a class in fencing in college, and while that scene may have looked simple, it was probably 20 pages of choreography, seriously. And did that lizard really need to go into Meredith's mouth? That was just gross.<br /><br />I have to wonder why they didn't just use real twins for this version. In 1961, for the Hayley Mills version, it seems like they were showing off what they could do, with split-screen technology just coming into play, and that era's version of green screen. Now (or in 1998) they could do pretty much everything anyway, so why bother making it more difficult? But in any case, Lindsay Lohan did an amazing job, just as good as Hayley Mills. Although... it was sort of sad to watch her during the special features... she came off as such an eager, intelligent child, and these days she really needs to get her act together. I still think she's pretty talented, so I hope she comes around.<br /><br />I still think this movie is hilarious, though. Here is what I loved. Chessie was a much better housekeeper than the maid in the first version. What was up with the maid saying to Mitch in the original, \\"You don't know what a good thing you had when you had it?\\" That was just so rude! Chessie was so much better, wanting to hug Annie when she found out Hallie was Annie. And she was just funnier and sweeter in general. Getting the original Vicky (Joanna Barnes) to play future mother-in-law Vicky was a stroke of genius. (Too bad they couldn't get another original actor or two.)<br /><br />One last thing... Natasha Richardson may have been nice, but the way they called her beautiful... I'm sorry but she is just a typical, late 20th century blonde. Doesn't compare to the glamour of Maureen O'Hara. She was a real beauty. Just gorgeous.anting to hug Annie when she found out Hallie was Annie. And she was just funnier and sweeter in general.

B005WNF4NI|5.0|These pieces weren't written in the sense that a pop song is written. This album wasn't composed. It was designed. There are no extra sounds or complex layering here. There is nothing superfluous. Each track has been carefully refined and sculpted until only the truly essential components remain. Like some kind of acoustic electronic music, we marvel at the emergence of the artist through his work. The work is surprisingly personal and intimate despite the modulation and electronic manipulations that separate us from the artist.<br /><br />These are well-crafted sonic poems. They are suggestive and evocative. The sonic economy creates spaces and voids that evoke a sense of grandeur. The vistas make us feel small but not insignificant. Any sense of isolation or desolation that could be aroused by a vast and lonely space flounders against Jaar's order and harmony. Chaos and entropy have no chance in this well-crafted void.

This book is a must read, I was lucky to get this two days after I read Susskind's \\"Black Hole Wars\\", so I really had a good grasp going into it. Finally, the perfect response to the sophist's \\"nothing\\" non sequitur.

B00699SDR8|5.0|Sophie's World: a novel of the history of philosophy is a fabulous book supposedly written by a father for his 15 year old daughter's birthday.  Altho I find it difficult to believe a 15 year old could understand this book fully (because I don't), I think both 15 year olds in this book are exceptional.  I learned so much I didn't know and expecially used the Kindle dictionary to learn many word descriptions.  I loved all the characters in the book except the father, however, in the end I loved him, too.  If you want to learn about philosophers from the beginning of time to now, this is the book for you.  I wish I had read this years ago.

It is a compilation of her first two books - contains excellent instructions and pictures on many different types of figures that can be included in this form of needlework. If you enjoy stump work this book is a must have. Well packed, arrived in great condition very quickly. It has made an excellent addition to my library of needlework resource material.

B007P6VM04|3.0|In a perfect world, this show would have two soundtrack albums.  One that was just the pop covers included in each episode, and one that was the original music written for the series.  Unfortunately, we don't get that - we have a soundtrack that tries to include both but doesn't do either justice.<br /><br />The track selection is just WEIRD.  With the lone exception of \\"Stand\\", the standard version of the soundtrack completely ignores the last seven episodes of the series.  Nick Jonas makes the soundtrack after appearing in one episode, with a Michael Buble cover that's okay but not all that interesting.  And while the pop songs that are included are usually well done, what's the point in having Katharine McPhee or Megan Hilty perform covers that never stray too far from the original recordings?<br /><br />The real issue, in my eyes, is that the soundtrack doesn't include enough of the original songs.  The songs written for the show are smart, feature great performances, and are usually the highlight of each episode.  This soundtrack only includes five of them.  I am aware that *SOME* (but not all) of those are available on iTunes and Amazon, but I would have loved versions in higher quality than 256kbps MP3s.<br /><br />The sad part is, there isn't really an excuse for the soundtrack to be this way.  It's 42 minutes long - just over half of the disc's capacity.  There really isn't an excuse for leaving off so much of the show's strongest material.<br /><br />What IS included here is good, but this soundtrack could have been so much better.  Instead of going with the Broadway songs written specifically for a show about a Broadway musical, the soundtrack is full of covers that aren't too far removed from Glee or American Idol.  And by neglecting the original material, this soundtrack does the show a disservice.<br /><br />One more thing worth noting: the Target version of the album has an extra five tracks, including the show's covers of \\"Run\\" and \\"Breakaway\\", and none of those five tracks are available anywhere else.  If you can buy the Target edition, there's no reason not to.

B000W1TJWC|1.0|This isn't a rating on the music itself, but the mp3 version of this classic. I'm not sure why I'd buy this as it only seems to contain four songs--for $9.49? Um, I'll buy them track by track for $4, Amazon. What are you thinking? And leaving out key tracks is irritating!
B007X15GRQ|2.0|Right out of the gate you will notice the goofy camera work. You are not supposed to notice the camera work in a movie, its just supposed to flow. This had to be this camera crews first movie. Weird angles, obnoxious close ups, fuzzy lens filters (by the way, don't pay for the HD version, its blurry anyways due to camera effects) jerky camera movements and zooms.<br /><br />Second, I noticed the language. I know its rated R and expected it to be an R rated movie, but they forced the \\"f\\" word into sentences it wouldn't naturally be in or even make sense in and got old very fast. I think producers do this as a way to make sure the movie is rated R and not pg-13 b/c R sells better. Fine, but they did a horrible job of it and was just embarrassing to listen to.<br /><br />Third, the plot is basically a rehash of every other heist movie. I don't expect every movie to be original when Hollywood cranks out so many movies a year, most movies are plain remakes anyways, but this is a total ripoff. If you think you want to watch this movie, simply watch \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" (even has one of the same actors) and \\"Italian Job\\" back to back, add some goofy plot twist and then you have \\"Contraband\\" This movie does not have the quality of either of those but rather just the ripped off plot. It also takes two thirds of the movie for any of the action to start even start.<br /><br />The only reason i gave it two stars instead of one was because of a twist a short time before the end which saved the movie. It made my feel better about wasting the money, however, still a waste. I'll be honest though, I almost didn't make it that far. The beginning of the movie sucked so bad that I almost shut it off regardless of the money I spent just to play Call of Duty, which by the way HAS A BETTER PLOT THAN THIS MOVIE.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|A strange film indeed echoing The Tree of Life. Has the West in its vast financial, debt and economic crisis become absolutely morbid when having to face the loss of its hegemony in the world? I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.<br /><br />Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.<br /><br />Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.<br /><br />And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.<br /><br />Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.<br /><br />It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUu should see that film and enjoy it.

B0002V7OI8|5.0|I think that Tea Leoni and Morgan Freeman were excellent. The best scene is when they confront each other in the basement of the White House. The plot is a realistic search for what is ELE, can humans prevent a coming apocalypse, and the irrationality of humans. I definitely prefer Deep Impact over Armageddon.<br /><br />The movie focuses on human emotions- love, fear, rejection, and disappointment. It also takes on the issue of high tech and material possessions versus classical values such as family and literature.

B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Overall, I was very impressed with Underworld Awakening.  I was a little skeptical at first being that this is the 4th in the Underworld film series and, well, as we all know, sequels can be terrible the majority of the time. I am a big fan of the Underworld series and this does not disappoint any fan of the series.  I was fortunate enough to see the film in the theater and I was also fortunate to see it in it's intended format of 3D using the ultra modern 3D filming techniques, which add's incredible depth and perspective to the movie.  In it's intended format, it really envelopes you in the movie experience.  You almost feel as if you are there, and that's no exaggeration, it was simply incredible the way this movie was filmed.  I wish all the Underworld movies had been filmed this way, unfortunately, the technology was not available when the first films in the series were made.  Kate Beckinsale is, as always, fantastic in her portrayal as Selene.  I have always been a fan of Stephen Rea, who is one of the best actors on this planet, period!  He gives a good performance in this movie as a mad doctor obsessed with getting rid of the Vamps and increasing the Lycan's abilities in the new modern era.  India Eisley also gives a good performance as \\"Eve\\", the love child of Michael and Selene.  This movie has a LOT of action in it, more than the previous films in my opinion.  I like the first film in the Underworld films the best, no question, but this film is good and most people should enjoy it, especially any fan of the series.  I truly hope they continue making the Underworld movies.  I think, overall, the producers, film makers, directors, actors, and everyone involved with making the Underworld series has done a great job keeping them blended together, even with different variations of the four films that have been made.  There is so many different ways that this series could go and different directions and stories that it could take.  PLEASE make more of these films.  The four films already made did very well in the box office and even better with their DVD sales around the world.  It is a good series and it's something that the fans definitely want continued for at LEAST a few more films.  I'm not sure I would do a television series and that seems to be the demise of any film series.  Just continue making really great films and this series could continue on for many years.ms.

This app allows you to have immediate access INSTANTLY to several versions and this is a great feature to have access to for those impromptou discussions on the Bible that crop up.
