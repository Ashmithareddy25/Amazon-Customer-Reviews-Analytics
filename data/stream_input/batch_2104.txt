B007J4T2G8|4.0|The male character is portrayed as a worped sex fiend who preys on women who cannot resist his macho elements, and who is incredibly wealthy.  The story eventually knits together with a bizzare twist, but is mostly about sexcapades.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so important to me and it was the only thing that I am also addicted to it its the best game in the world and its so cool and its the only thing that I am loving the best
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book is a continuation of the story from book 1.  Like book 1, it is mostly about seemingly impossible sex excapades.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I liked it when it use to be so simple to send gifts to friends.  Now they make it such a long process...It isn't Amazons fault it is Buffalo Studios...I may just consider finding another Bingo site that isn't so slow.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The entire series is mostly frequent and practically impossible sex.  It is written by a woman who has either a very good imagination, has interviewed lots of hookers, or has had a very interesting sex life herself.  It's an ok story about life at a certain level, but very unlikely to exist in a real world scenario.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this a fun, entertaining app but most of the things you can get require you to spend actual money.  So much for being free.

B008JFLWLE|3.0|Being able to calculate with polynomials and pi using a tablet-like interface is cool.  However, it won't accept enough characters to make it really worthwhile if you're doing something that actually requires those things.  If you want a pocket-calculator with the four basic operators, then get one of those.  This is too slow and ponderous to make it truly worthwhile for the advanced functions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calulator is bery covenient and easy to use. I like that it had huge numbers. anyone can use it and they do not need any readers. Haha!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Before I could post my review here there are already 155 reviews of the feature film - and the Amazon Instant Video release - so I will not take up a lot of space here repeating the accolades given to the WONDERFUL documentary about an amazingly talented singer-songwriter who was virtually unknown in the US but was a huge success in South Africa. For a first film, Director Malik Bendjelloul , did an amazing job on virtually no budget. He used his life savings and even found himself creating the animation needed to recreate Rodriguez's early days in Detroit. Thanks to this life-affirming film the singer is now touring the world and his two albums and concert revenues are going to him. (The film never quite \\"follows the money\\" for the earlier royalties but I think that was done at Rodriquez' request.<br />If you saw the film in a movie theater or as an Instant Video, I will highly recommend that you at least watch the DVD. The bonus features really ad to the enjoyment of the film. In addition to a feature length commentary by Rodrigues and the Director, there is a 25 minute \\"Making of\\" featurette that is not just full of scenes from the film. Ano0ther bonus is a 10 minute Q&A filmed at the April 2012 Tribeca Film Fest which consists of Rodriguez performing one song live and then, with Bendjelloul, answering questions from the audience.<br /><br />No matter what your musical tastes this film will draw you in and keep you entertained for its 87-minute running time. Note that I watched the DVD but the DVD and Bluray versions contain the same bonuses. I'm not sure if the images are much sharper on the Bluray.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

6305558167|5.0|This is the best movie ever, Having the unedited movie that is not seen on tv is one of the guilty pleasures. True classic movie
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Loving most of DeMille's works, this one left me iced cold and I had to force myself to finish it.<br />In almost each paragraph there is a funny quip by John Corey that keeps you from enjoying the story.....if there were a story. This is like a travelog of Yehman and as Corey states \\"it's the most God-forsaken place on earth\\"...and so is this book.<br />I can only hope he gets back to the tense excitement of past works and even though he IS funny, perhaps he should do standup comedy for a while and get it out of his system.<br />This is one DeMille book that I will not recommend to my friends.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|One series I will watch over and over again. Would have liked it not to skip for the commercials but still loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are only a few things over which I have no control:  1)  Paying taxes; 2) My inevitable demise; and 3) Watching Downton Abbey.  The series has something for everyone -- a storyline with just the right doses of drama, romance and skullduggery.  The setting is glorious; the clothing divine.  The ladies are beautiful and a great many of the menfolk are quite frankly beautiful, too.  Just like that well-known potato chip, I dare you to watch just one episode.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Foul language, alot and the new humor of the times. Sexual inuendos, not for prudish people or really teens. Hard rate.
0880796863|4.0|The images are clear and well-printed, and the back of the cards has a pleasing blue and white design.  The construction of the deck is quality.  The large size of the deck does make it more difficult to shuffle and deal for someone with small hands, but I prefer the larger illustrations.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|My son had to read the book for school, and saw in theaters, He recommended I watch it, I loved the movie and went to library and got the books. I really thought I want the set of books now for my library at home.<br />But this movie was excellent.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I totally LOVE this app!  It's better than watching Accu-Weather on TV!  If I need to know what's happening with the weather, I just grab my Kindle and it's right in front of me in seconds.  All the info I need for my city for the day and many days afterward, plus the option of going to videos of weathermen giving the weather.  It has weather warnings and the amount of rain or snow that's expected.  I never dreamed I'd be so excited about a &#34;weather&#34; app.  I guess I need a life!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but it takes away the people you buy and that will just make yo mad. Kids love it.

B0012TUPRQ|5.0|Great for mounting anything! I use it for cameras and other elements! The only downside is the restriction of the angle that is restricted by the gap between the two elements!

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this was the first full hidden object/puzzle game i bought.  took me about 12 hours over the couse of a week to complete.  liked the story.  music and sound effects were creepy. puzzles were easy enough so u didnt get discouraged.  and i liked that u never had to back trace ur steps to far to find missing objects and put them together,
B001NHNG64|5.0|once you have read the first book with Jack Reacher as the main character you will want to read this book. Just as gripping as the first with an excellent story line

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Great spoof, and excellent job by Willis and Malkovich.<br /><br />Also, Bruce Willis recently voiced his support of the second amendment.  A nice difference from the usual Hollywood crowd of idiots.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Great classic Sci-Fi move from my youth, Robbie the Robot is still the coolest Robot in any film ever. The Blu-ray version just makes the picture even better, the Blu-ray DVD really brings out things in the movie you did not notice before. It was really ahead of it's time when it was first released and makes you appreciate how they did special effects back then with out the use of computers in today's movie's.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|The Matrix(1999) was a big critical and commercial hit at the time. It was \\"revolutionary\\"! Keanu Reeves played Mr. Anderson/Neo. He's a white collar office worker who finds out that reality is a computer program created by robots who have taken over the world. A group of rebels help him fight back. The Matrix is a \\"cyberpunk\\" classic. It mixes Total Recall, Hong Kong movies, anime, Alice in Wonderland, Darkman and philosophy in a blender. The Matrix was one of the first films to use \\"bullet time\\" photography. The film mixes hard rock with Don Davis' music score. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving took martial arts lessons before filming began. Yuen Woo Ping(Drunken Master) staged the kung fu fights for the film. There's also loud, energetic action scenes and gunplay. The Matrix has been spoofed in over 20 movies.<br />Times have changed. The directors went on to make The Matrix sequels, Speed Racer(2008), and Cloud Atlas(2013). The Matrix deserves a place in your home video collection.

B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This ia a movie I can watch over and over.  Anytime I see it listed on a cable channel I watch or if I need something light and fun, I pop my DVD into the player.  I recently purchased a copy as a gift for my sister since she also enjoys it, but doesn't have it on the shelf.  I have to say this is one of my favorite movies and I will continue to enjoy Drew Barrymore's Cinderella.  Better than Disney if you are older than 12.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is a brilliant guy if we can judge by the quality of this excellent book. He is, at the same time, refreshingly modest about his abilities, and that modesty reflects his central thesis here: that we live in a probabilistic world where successful prediction is possible but only after acknowledging that our initial ideas about almost everything are wrong. Furthermore, he believes that even our well-developed ideas can never be better than approximations of the truth. His philosophy is the antipode to intellectual arrogance.<br /><br /> Only 35 years old, Mr. Silver has already made quite a name for himself as a statistical analyst and a forecaster. While he never mentions this, Time Magazine named him one of the world's \\"100 Most Influential People\\" in 2009. His early success was in the field of armchair baseball scouting, where he developed unorthodox  statistical algorithms that successfully forecast the career trajectories of fledgling players. This was the kind of analysis Michael Lewis would later make famous in Moneyball. Mr. Silver also made a good deal of money for a while playing online poker, a game in which the  keys to success are knowledge of probabilities and an ability to interpret the betting patterns of opposing players. More recently, he achieved renown with his uncannily accurate predictions about our American elections. In this new book he demonstrates that his methods are applicable to many different areas of modern life, albeit with highly uneven degrees of success, as he is first to acknowledge. The subjects he delves into here, in addition to sports, poker and politics, include the weather, earthquakes, economics, the stock market, bond rating analysis, epidemics, computerized chess, global warming, and terrorism.<br /><br /> Silver gently but convincingly lampoons the pretentions of professionals in several of these areas, who generally exhibit what for him is the cardinal sin of overconfidence. In the field of earthquake forecasting, for example, scientists have for years fielded complex statistical programs that claim an ability to pinpoint the locations and timing of major earthquakes.  While getting the high-risk locations right is easy enough, dramatic predictions about timing have fared little better than amateur guesswork, and big quakes always catch the majority of seismologists by surprise.<br /><br /> My own area of professional focus for many years has been financial markets and economics, and it is not surprising for me to see Mr. Silver sweeping through these fields with easy dispatch. Economic forecasting is a long-standing joke, even among the professionals who make their livings producing the forecasts, and professional stock fund managers in the aggregate are perennial underperformers relative to simple market averages. Even individual fund managers who outperform for a while rarely sustain their records across market cycles. All this failure has occurred, and goes on occurring, despite the lavish compensation, costly computer support, and high-profile media braggadocio that goes along with advising the public about their money.<br /><br /> Mr. Silver devotes a lot of focus to the so-called \\"Efficient Market Hypothesis\\", which essentially says it's hard to beat financial markets, because everything we might hope to learn about them is already reflected in the prices we pay for our investments. It is in his discussion of this notion that we begin get a glimpse of what Nate Silver is really driving at. We have to remember that he is after all a statistician himself with a rather successful record to his credit. He should therefore by no means be viewed as a debunker of statistical methods in general. Nor is he a pessimist who believes that our environment is totally unpredictable.  His belief system would seem to be more in line with the ideas of \\"chaos\\" or \\"complexity\\" theorists,  who focus on the dynamics of massive systems that are inherently unstable and thus subject to continuous change. Analysts are therefore unable to devise static models for them, and what is left to them is to nibble around the edges in the hope of gaining at least a marginal handle on how such systems move.  With respect to any system, like the stock market,  in which human intelligence is part of the dynamic, there is worse problem: i.e., the closer people come to understanding the system, the faster it changes and invalidates the new understanding. The \\"Efficient Market Hypothesis\\" is a reflection of one such Sisyphean pattern.<br /><br /> The conclusion that Mr. Silver wants us to draw from his work, however, is not that prediction is hopeless. Rather, he suggests that we should undertake it with modest expectations and be prepared to make continuous small adjustments to the theories upon which we base it. Following this heuristic method, we should be able to stay close enough to the truth that we can still recognize it once it has morphed into another form. As a poker player, Mr. Silver found that he could do well enough by winning a few pots bigger than the ones he lost. It is by routinely exploiting such marginal advantages in any field that we can hope to stay ahead of whatever competition we may have and to achieve higher levels of understanding.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this book.tinuous change.

1451695195|5.0|This book is a very powerful read.  Dr. Alexander is a fantastic writer, not at all what you'd expect from a doctor, he offers just enough technical and medical terminology to explain what's going on.  What a fabulous story he has to share!!  If you're feeling a little lost and need a pick me up, this is the perfect book for you.  It is a quick story and you'll be amazed at what he experienced.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|i loved this book. My business has grown at a year over year average of 30% which has spoiled me. Now with the uncertainties of our socialist presidential and the democratic bureaucracy with their beliefs of over taxing the rich and placing the burden of big government on the back of small business i have been concerned how we can continue our current model which has trended down since re-election and all the talk of gun control. After reading this i see things we are doing right and understand concepts which have worked for other companies when threatened with change that propelled them from good to great.
0143114085|3.0|I looked forward to Sophie Hannah's Little Face with some excitement. A poet writing a mystery novel? Must be brimming with rich detail and vivid phrases, i thought, not to mention a carefully crafted plot with intriguing characters. Was I asking for too much? Possibly.  In one respect, Little Face did not disappoint. Hannah's imagery and turn of phrase is often on display here. But after powering  my Kindle off, what ultimately remained was a feeling of huh? What do you mean, she was faking it ?<br /><br />The story begins with a compelling premise: Alice, a new mother,  insists the infant in the nursery is not her daughter, Florence. While she was out for two hours, someone switched the babies as her husband David was napping, she claims. David swears it's his daughter but Alice sticks to her theory and calls the cops. Okay so far, it's gripping. Simon, the junior detective is inclined to believe  her but his superior Charlie does not. At this point the narrative splits into two, with a first person voice for Alice and third person for the police, mainly Simon. This device could have worked if Hannah stuck mainly to sleuthing details but Simon's version often derails into heavy chunks of personal information. Why should i care if i don't really know him? P. D. James does this so masterfully with Dalgleish. She gives us just enough to spark our interest. The book  starts getting muddled, with Alice sometimes going back in time and sometimes describing her present where David is turning nasty. Oh, then there is Vivienne, David's mother and general Poohbah of the household, whose friendly demeanor conceals, not very convincingly, a rotten core. Simon unearths the fact that David's first wife was murdered by a thief who is now in jail having confessed.  The story suddenly turns into solving a murder that seemingly has been solved. In the end, Hannah clumsily ties up the loose ends but I was left unsatisfied.

076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a very powerful novel for people of all ages.  It forces an individual to reflect upon his or her own life and what is truly important.  High school teachers and librarians should include this as part of their curriculum because it addresses so many issues that many of the students can relate to.  The main issue that is addressed is dying and reflecting on one's life. If someone has experienced loss in their own life, it is very meaningful.  I lost my mother this past May, so I can connect to Morrie's loss of his mother when he describes it on p.72.  If an individual never experienced loss before, the text forces the reader to look at their relationships with others and the meaning behind it.  It seems that many adolescent novels that deal with death are connected to suicide, but this is a novel that brings up the notion of death in a different perspective.<br /><br />Furthermore, many of the other topics in the novel teenagers can relate to within their own life and may lead to wonderful discussions within a classroom.  For example, in the \\"Taking Attendance\\" chapter, Morrie discusses how people glue themselves to the OJ Simpson trial for weeks on end when they don't even know who OJ Simpson is. This is similar to how people watch reality television in today's society.  We live through other people on a television screen instead of living for ourselves in the present.  Students can also relate it to how they use other forms of media, such as Facebook and Twitter, where people are watching other people's lives instead of living their own.  Another example is the chapter in which Mitch and Morrie discuss the power of money and the difference between need and want.  When individuals graduate from high school, they feel that they need to make the most money or have the best car, but really they find what they really \\"need\\" aren't any of those things.  Nonmaterial items such as friendship, love and kindness mean so much more.<br /><br />Lastly, there are some benefits and drawbacks for incorporating Tuesdays with Morrie in the classroom.  Some of the benefits of incorporating this text in the classroom is that it addresses so many different issues related to life, such as family, emotions, the world, and feeling sorry for oneself.  On the other hand, a drawback of using this text is that some of the main messages in the novel, such as marriage, regret and aging, may not connect to teenagers as much as they would with adults.  For example, as a 30 year old adult, I can reflect upon those topics in my life because I have lived so much longer and experienced a lot more than a teenage student.  Those chapters would mean a lot more to me now at age 30 than they may for a 16 year old student.  Overall, I strongly recommend Tuesdays with Morrie.

It was kind of a cop out in the diner scene, however, when the characters start discussing some of these paradoxes and Bruce just says 'I'm not going to get in to it'. It's an incredibly violent film, some of which, of course, is gratuitous and unnecessary for sure. So that part kind of bothered me. When it comes to murdering children, well, you know the story line and film needs to be very careful. So that is the down side. Otherwise, very unique and engaging story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is really cool I like it because you can relate with it and it's inspiring and you can think more
B009HEJXFS|5.0|My husband and I very much enjoyed MIB3. Brolin does a terrific job as K (TLJ) and it's well written and funny as always. Some sequels get diluted over time but cheers to MIB who keep it going just as strong as ever here. Can't wait for #4!
B008LZHA3G|3.0|great quality. the sound was very good and clear as a bell. i really liked the cover art on the cd...
B00B7VZN76|5.0|OK Season 3 is comming....? Season 3 is Amazing but my BIGGEST Fear & worried is that the Terrible remaster from Season 2 Blu-Ray will be the same with Season 3 too...?  I hope this are diffrent Peoples this time doing the Remaster properly than the ones who did the Terrible Remaster on Season 2....? Lets pray....? Season 2 was soo Bad they did not even review & bother checking out if they done a good job in Remastering every Episode....? Right from the Start of Season 2 first Episode you see a very Bad / Terrible Picture they call it Remastering....? Please dont mislead us again with saying things like Stunning Remaster if in truth the Picture is like a DVD Version as in Season 2 befor.....? Lets wait and see.....?

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I was playing this in the doctors office the other day XD. So many weird looks. But its a good game, no lie  well worth the money.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I know he writes with ego but I think the substance of his ideas and the cleverness of his examples makes it worthwhile. I originally gave it four stars but I find the things he said informing my worldview in unexpected and I think positive ways.

B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really like the secure strap. I also like the backside of the cover for the protection of the screen
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard so much about this television show and was curious about all the raves it was receiving. I watched the first season on another site, but was unable to continue to season two.  I really enjoyed following the characters and following how their lives interacted. I had become a fan of this show and wanted to follow-up with season two, so I purchased it, in its entirety, and every free moment I had was spent watching it.  I love 'period' pieces and this is an excellent one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love love love it!!! just can't get enough Downton Abbey! It's a great show for my husband and I to watch together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|In my opinions, this game is really fun. There are a lot of different games and stuff you can play. It's pretty easy to get diamonds too. The only thing I don't like about it is that the tournament training costs a lot of energy, but other then that it's a really fin game to play.
B004SIP7AS|3.0|It looked as though you had copied from tv with ads in it.  Not what I expected.  That is the first DVD from you that has not been up to your standard of quality.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|great basic little game for horse lovers. easy enough to be entertaining but enough stuff to keep you busy. great graphics as well. I'd recommend it, definitely! :)
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is an absolute classic due to the cast, actors like Chris Rock and George Carlin and the deep and straight up debates about religion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app. Full of hours of lessons and great game play. Well worth the download. The horses are well done and the environments are fabulous.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great read. Very imaginative! Really enjoyed the detailed events and lots as the story unfolded. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|gregarious<br /><br /> this is a. really good game. to play it make me feel happy because I don't have a horse and this is fun for me
0765325950|4.0|It was, yet wasn't everything that I expected it to be! I enjoyed this book and was so sad to finish it. It was a good ending to a long story and one that leaves ur imagination open at the end.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Awesome book. A painter of imagination, you wonder how the  author accomplished this. Brings you right into the dream and makes you never want to leave.<br />I love this book!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This is a great movie and can't wait for more to come out on Blu Ray.<br />I've read the graphic novels from Fank Miller and can't wait for them to make the next<br />movie.
B007P06DOK|5.0|This replaces an original CD that got away from me. I knew I needed another copy as soon as I saw his PBS special.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I started to read this after seeing the excellent Tom Cruise movie. This was pretty dang good, can't wait to read the next one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome! I love this game! The horses in this game are so realistic and taking care of them is so FUN!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun for all ages. Definitely recommend to anyone who loves horses or animals. Graphics are realistic too.
B002QO8E9M|5.0|We had &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34; on VHS for many years and watched it often.  Unfortunately, we loaned it to a now former friend and never got it back.  After seeing &#34;Celebration Day&#34;, I was on the hunt for anything and everything Led Zeppelin on CD and DVD.  Yes, I am now a full-fledged, hardcore Zeppelin fanatic and will be until the day I die.  Seeing this concert again after such a long time was a thrill in and of itself.  The crispness and clarity of DVD as compared to VHS made it that much better.  Led Zeppelin was, is, and always will be the greatest band, the greatest experience, in the world, without exception.  I look forward to finding anything else that may be out there that we don't already have.<br /><br />Excellent product, delivered before the estimated date, new in the wrapper as promised.  Very positive experience overall.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Victoria grows in mind and spirit through  the meaning behind each flower she uses in her carefully created arrangements. She learns to accept herself and to allow love into her life. I loved the story and watching Victoria unfold with her flowers.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not as good as her other books. The story like is fine, but her writing has changed. She is so intent on getting through to the reader what Kay is thinking and feeling in such dragged out choppy detail that you start to forget what the whole point is. It's choppy. It feels almost as though parts are written by someone else. I have bought and read everyone one of the Scarpetta books from the time the first one came out. I love the series and the character. This one is just not the caliber of earlier books. Sorry!
B00336C3EY|5.0|Excellent movie by the Coen brothers. Pair it with Barton Fink and think about the two men, where they are like and where not
B00006G9WI|5.0|great movie love jim carey highly recomend ,gives you a sense of the true meaning of love and fogiveness loved it
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my technically challenged sister who wouldn't know how to download Amazon Instant Videos if she tried. So thank goodness there are still DVDs out there to give.
B0082Z447U|4.0|Complex and gothic read of the period.  I can highly recommend its twisting plot and dark atmosphere. What devious creatures.
B000002U9L|1.0|this was not for me but a gift , never heard from the granddaughter so I don't know how she liked , but guess she did since she had asked specifically for it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. Read it in a day. Couldn't put it down. Hope the movie is just as good.
B00275EGWY|4.0|Well done movie. Jeremy is a top-notch actor, I think, and I wish to see him in more roles. He fits the military type very well.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|How can you go wrong with Disney Animation (yes there have been a few exceptions)? This is another example of GREAT animation and storyline for both kids and adults alike.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This movie came packaged well, still in the plastic.  The box was in great condition as well.  It arrived on time and as promised.  It was a great gift idea for my grandmother who loves the Lion King.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This is not an intelligent witty movie but an enjoyable sequel to what was a Super action movie with more than your usual monies worth of Top Action stars. Some have been etched in our memories for ever and have continued to do what they do BEST. The only weak spot in this movie for me was the Bad Guy; Jean-Claude Van Damme. He has not aged well probably due to his drug problem, his already problematic accent seems to have gotten worst and he barely mumbles his lines. He just doesn’t pack the punch he once did.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|The troll looks awesome, like a real bad-ass. I only kept watching  with the hope of seeing him in action. What a f*****g tease!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it's so fun next on tour take subway surfers to France !!! :-) that would mean so much too me thanks to the creaters of subway surfers awesome game(:!!!
B001ECQ6E2|1.0|The very old VHS copy I still have somewhere has better graphics than the BD version I purchased. The picture of the VHS is very  clear throughout while that of the BD is mostly dark & thick-- no matter how I much adjust the settings. A very good movie overall but either I got a bootleg or it was an all-around poorly remastered edition.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a good book for just about everyone from 9 and older I would say it's a great book and probably the best book I have ever read
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Apart from the graphics, not much I can say about this waste of time, sorry excuse for a movie. Even the characters appear disinterested & very distant. Though, being kidnapped & used in sex trafficking can make one so, however, I get the feeling that some of the actresses are thinking to themselves: &#34;why did I agree to to do this film?&#34; There's very little to no commitment. Maybe, you 'll see it differently when you watch it. Mine, a BD, went to the trash the same day I saw it. Didn't even bother watching the extended edition.
0765325950|5.0|20 years later I can finish the series begun with the Eye of the world.  Unfortunately it finishes with a whimper but the story Robert Jordan began outlived the master story teller.  In the end nothing is revealed but those faithful fans will be glad that they can finally move on despite the new authors attempt to leave the story open.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|\\"Flight\\" is about Denzel Washington, the actor who has taken chances, proved himself worthy, and now accepts all kinds of roles. Playing an alcoholic and becoming that person convincingly highlights once again Denzel's exceptional talent. I've always been a fan.<br /><br />That said, I must include in my positive things these negatives:<br />1. I don't like it one bit that he is showing signs of aging. He can't help it, none of us can, but I want to remember him as that beautiful man he was when he was young. I am being totally unreasonable, but there it is.<br />2. My biggest objection is also questionable. In my memory Denzel has never had a relationship onscreen with a white woman. He does this time. She is also half his age, but then again, her race and age are irrelevant to the arrogant, obnoxious dude he plays. Being a player is part of who he is only as it reflects his addictions to both drugs and alcohol. In a movie from his younger years he plays a sheriff in Haiti who has a brief affair with a white woman. The test audience, or the black women in that audience, were incensed and the film maker changed that part of the film to a black woman. I think, here in this film, he had to break with his tradition because that is what his character would have done. So, I guess I say kudos now.<br />3. I did not realize the film was about addiction. Not my favorite subject. A personal dislike. Also unfair to the film.<br /><br />What I did like about the film:<br />1. Denzel's acting. He is completely convincing as an addict. Completely.<br />2. The addiction is dealt with in a fair way.<br />3. Two lines are memorable and will be repeated as such: He tells his paramour: \\"I chose to drink. I chose to drink\\" even in face of losing each person in turn in his life. Bravado, false. Braggadocio, false. But still a line memorably shouted. The second line almost makes hair stand up on one's arms: \\"Who are you?\\" To give it in context would be a spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />This is a review about Denzel, my man. Others have written excellent reviews about theme and events. I'll stick with Denzel because he does redemption like no other.<br /><br />Oh yes, the title. It's obvious: a flight goes down. However, the pilot, loaded on drugs and alcohol, miraculously lands it. He's a hero, but not a hero. What takes flight is the symbolism behind the title. Flight. Flying. Freedom. Yeah.t.<br /><br />This is a review about Denzel, my man. Others have written excellent reviews about theme and events.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooooo much fun and really addictive. I recomened this game for people with a motif reflex and focus.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|\\"Killer Joe.\\" What is this film: Violence porn? Image porn? Pointless? Visual prurience? Dark unto indecency? Oh yeah, all this and more! Except pointless. \\"Killer Joe\\" has very serious messages, but not for any of its characters. All of these characters, except perhaps the girl, are lost (the viewer learns at the end just how lost), but the girl is redeemable, perhaps.<br /><br />But as usual, I get ahead of myself. Matthew McConaughey is Killer Joe, a cop by day, a killer, an assassin by night, that is, for a high cost. In this case paying his price is dependent upon killing a woman for her life insurance earmarked for her 12-year-old daughter (yes, she looks much older and surely has the luscious body of a mature woman, but she plays 12). Joe demands a retainer and demands the girl. McConaughey's sexual encounter with this child-woman is a piece of prurient perversion gone amuck. Shocking? That's too weak. Unconscionable for sure. Sick, indeed, but the scene is very necessary in delineating Joe's character. He is not just a cold-hearted, brutal killer--he is a whacked-out sick-o, deserving of absolutely no sympathy. The viewer will never look at McConaughey the same way again. He's not just a pretty face--he's a talent now with nothing left to prove. He can do comedy. He can do romance. He can do serious. Now he can do evil.  Denzel Washington did it, too.<br /><br />Thomas Hayden Church is the biological father of two children with his ex-wife, now married to another man. There's a generous life insurance policy assigned to her daughter. It's a complicated, twisted plot about the whys and wherefores of the intended plan to kill the woman. Joe carries it off with inhuman indifference.<br /><br />Then the twist is revealed and an already ugly situation turns gruesome and shockingly violent. One scene involves a chicken leg and the plumped lips of a very attractive Gina Gerson. From this point on, many reviewers were reviled by the apparently meaningless violence and resulting bloodbath. But I disagree. I think Director William Friedkin had a very serious message. Whether my take on the movie corresponds with his is irrelevant. It's how I see what the director has given me. I put my own stamp on this creative process with my interpretation.<br /><br />Here it is: As an English teacher I taught \\"Lord of the Flies\\" every year to high school seniors. I've always thought this novel essential to any curriculum and a good education. It teaches moral lessons, social bonding both good and bad, the infiltration of evil and its overpowering attraction and its subtle and blatant take over and extinguishing of all moral ambiguity. By novel's end morality is being burned and evil is rampant and all-consuming. I used to ask those seniors: Tell me. What happens when these boys go home? What will they become? What will they do? Or, now, I might ask: Who are you-- to each boy survivor (a new lesson gained from \\"Flight\\" with Denzel in a new acting situation. After you've played a rabidly corrupt cop, you might get any kind of role as Denzel does here). Who are you, indeed.<br /><br />The key scene in \\"Lord of the Flies\\" occurs at the edge of the beach when one of the little ones is sitting and playing with a crab. It's called play, but it's a control issue on the verge of death of the crab. One of the older boys is casually throwing stones around the boy, never hitting him, but wanting to. Mores dictate that we don't throw stones and especially not to hit. But the thought is there. He intentionally does not--yet. On the other hand the boy will possibly kill the crab by happenstance, or not.<br /><br />The characters, all of them, except perhaps the girl, have taken that step beyond missing long, long ago. The first time opens the door. Isn't there nearly always a second? Well, I've done it once, blah, blah. Until there's a blood bath. Clearly, the director is making his message visibly potent: evil is a dark path leading to despair, pain, andpossibly annihilation. Is this where you are heading? Who are you?possibly annihilation. Is this where you are heading? Who are you?
B000SEIK2S|5.0|There are a lot of interesting scifi elements in this book. The character development was excellent and interesting. The next books in the series are a must read for me. The concept of using the elderly to fight a war (vs. 18 year olds) was one of the most intriguing parts and set it apart from a lot of other books in the genre.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I bought this as an audio book to listen to on a long drive from AZ to TX in December.  I anticipated a great way to pass the time.  In a nutshell, I was disappointed.  It seemed like it went over the same stuff over and over and you knew what was going to happen before you got to the end of it.  Disappointing - I liked his early work but he seems to have lost his touch.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun but the writing doesnt enlarge enough, so you have to figure it out as you go along.  would better with enlargeable type.
1449433251|5.0|I bought this comic book collection as soon as I found out it produced. I remember back in the 1980's buying the Detroit Free Press, I sat back remebering reading Calvin and Hobbes first, his interaction with his parents,His fascination of being Spaceman Biff, as well as his close and personal relation with his best friend Hobbies. I am only im the beginning section of book one and I'm laughing myself to tears. I am dissapointed with the quality of the books and their binders. The pages can be easily damaged, and the binder is quite fragile for books of this size and weight. I recieved two other books \\"The Essential of Calvin and Hobbies\\" and \\"Something Is Drooling Under My Bed\\". My wife thought these books would passify my Love and Addiction for Calvin & Hobbies, theyvserved their purpose, Until I saw this collection. I would tell anyone who would make this purchase the quality of the material use, but if you are a true fan of the comic strip, it wouldn't make any difference.<br /><br />  I salute Bill Watterson, for releasing this comic strip collections for future, and present fans to read. I make one request: Please! Please! Please!find a more durable paper and binder for this collection. The collections should be shared with others, without falling apart.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|If you are a Fun. fan you will probably like this album. Although I prefer the later one better, this made a great addition to my collection. It is offered at a great price, too.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Takes a while to get anything. But if u play at least once a day you get there. Stick with it and it adds up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first book that I've felt was so gripping that I had to write a review. From the first few pages I was transfixed by the mystery of the story, always wanting to read longer just to get one more tiny scrap of an answer. There were times that I was completely flabbergasted by plot points and brought to tears by others. You will fall in love with the characters and how well they're written. Each one feels like a true flesh and blood person. If you enjoy post apocalyptic fiction even slightly you will not be disappointed in this.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I dont watch TV but I will make an acception for this series..... It is only getting better &#34;Kevin Bacon is the Man&#34;
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|Boring, but then I probably just don't know enough to appreciate it. There is nothing more that I can say about it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written science fiction.  A few unanticipated twists, and moderate suspense.  The main character is truly likable, and other characters are often believable and multifaceted.
B00452VF4O|5.0|Great. Fantastic well written typical Sharon Kay Penman novel, based on factual histrory. Read it three times, and it can still make me cry, only author who can do that to me. One feels as though one really knows the charaters. Highly recommend this book for anyone interested in history. In fact I would recommend any of Sharon's books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had heard many comments about this book but  could not have predicted anything near this!  Total page-turner and could not put it down!  Bring on the next one!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|A little... off. And too short. Enjoyed it but, I don't know. Not my favorite. But I will remember it!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Nice action flick, Good twist and i like the idea that they took it to a different level vs the original
1451627297|4.0|King is one of the best writers of his time.  I've always enjoyed his less macabre novels and this was one of his better ones.  I had trouble putting it down.  Very few authors can draw a picture in your mind that is so real you feel like you are really there and experiencing it firsthand.  I loved the whole idea of the story, to go back in time to save Kennedy, it was fascinating!  The book brought me back to my childhood and wonderful memories of the early 60's and pangs of nostalgia, it was so accurate. Life was simpler, nicer.  Jake was believable, as were all the characters, the story well written.  I would have given this a five star, but my one criticism is that it is about 200 pages too long.  (I felt the same about his book, Insomnia.)  About 400 pages into it I started asking when will this end and by 500, I became tired of it and impatient.  He could have shortened it by cutting down the romance and sex with Sadie.  Jake could have entered the past at a later year than 1958.  It would not have been necessary to fill in five years of trivial living and detail before leading up to 11/22/63.  But, all in all, if you have a lot of time and don't mind a long book, its worth reading.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Earlier versions frequently crashed on my Android but they seem to have fixed it. What I really love is that there is a crescendo option on the alarm so it starts really soft (if you select this option). Good LARGE snooze.<br /><br />You can set many alarms and can set them for certain days of the week. That's great.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like is that if you edit an alarm you have already set up, you need to remember to Save it. Sometimes I forget, which means the time of the alarm doesn't get changed. I'm sure someday they'll fix that....
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is the greatest music. It's eclectic. I never get tired of listening to it. Going to hear them live in July. Can't wait.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It's basically Super Mario Bros clone for those who missed good old NES days =) However, I gave it only a 4 star because it's harder to control the player using touch screen than actual controller.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I watched the movie for approc 3/4 of it and turned it off...to the news about our trillion dollar defcit and the blizzard in my part of the country and also some lunatic loose in California. Sad as all of those events are they were more interesting than this movie. Maybe if I were younger it might have seemed funny. However at age 56 I am known for my sense of humor. If there were a \\"no star rating\\" this movied would get it. I have Amazon Prime so I was able to watch it for free. If I had to pay for it I would recommend forgetting it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I was struck by the clear research and scope of the work done on this book. Finally, someone has come to the truth of the luck of birth at a certain time, and luck of opportunity combined with concentration by the innovator, in seizing thr oppotunity or window of time.
B00867GHS8|4.0|I'm not going to get into Disney's obsession with parenticide or the gay vegetarian shark.  It came in a quality 5 disc case.  the &#34;digital copy&#34; is a useless low piece of crap only good for playing on phone if you accept installing the software on your system.  The tablet version is junk.  it should have been at 1280 x 720/800.  The extras are mostly boring.  I've seen a lot of DVD extras (thanks N3tfli1x) and these will put you to sleep with boredom.  The basically leave the DVD, I guess you can give that away as a loaner, and the 3D and 2D discs which contain the movie only.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|And free as well! My 6 year old son is a particular fan and he could not put down the computer after we got this game

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game... when it actually lets me play it. it loads the home screen then it exits out. hopefully. they'll fix it. :/
B00B2G2RG6|1.0|The Following is much too dark and disturbing for my tastes.  It makes Criminal Minds seem mild.  Not for me

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. The music mash ups are great and it is so funny . Love Fat Amy she is so funny.
0525478817|4.0|Get your tissues ready for this one. Brilliantly written. I found this book to be honest and realistic portrayal of the tragedy that comes out of cancer
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game.  It is fun to play!  It's a great time killer too!  The best part to me is when you finish all of the levels, you can reset all levels and start over!  They have people you are supposed to save and if you accidentally &#34;kill&#34; them, you get points deducted..... BUT, if you &#34;kill&#34; them FIRST, then, no points are deducted because you don't have any points to deduct!  Perfect!!!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|The story was very interesting and the action scenes were great.  Kept our interest thru the entire movie.  Liked the cast.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Seems like just about everything on television is violent, loaded with sexual references and basically poorly done.  None of that with Downton Abby.  Well written and well acted.  Worth every penny.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love it. I just started and I only had dirt I got this game and now I have a 24 floor house with dimond every thing
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. It would be better if you earned more coins while offline. I play several of these type games and it is one of the better ones!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun. if you love animals this is the perfect game. even if you don't love animals its still a good game.
B0085YNML2|3.0|Played it a few times.  Not really my kind of game, but my 7 year old niece likes it.  I will keep it on my Kindle Fire just for her.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really couldn't figure it out why this tablet didn't come with something like this great and quickie blessedly simple calculator!!
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is the second Rollins book I've read, the first being The Last Oracle, and I thoroughly enjoyed both! Both are well researched and weave a rollicking adventure in with great and little known historical mysteries. I will be reading others if they are this good! Well worth the read.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I gave this a high rating  because of the depth of ideas in this book.  I couldn't  put it down and yet I was learning about IT.  It is accessible and advanced, a rare combination in the business book genre.<br /><br />This is a great book for those who lead in IT but also for any leader who wants to better understand IT and IT leadership.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run two there is more challenges and better graphics than the first temple run and instead of three monkeys there is one big one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a lot of fun. Very challenging. Makes you think out how to cover all the spaces. Great brsin game
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is such a fun way to pass the time! I don't really know what else to say.....I just decided to rate it to keep it from popping up again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this show! I don't want to give away spoilers, but , NO THEY DIDN'T!!!!!! How much more pain can this family endure!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Mindless not much strategy needed and run out of  coins to fast  need to make regeneration of coins faster or start you off with more
B007ZD17XO|5.0|To my opinion, one of the best &#34;connect three&#34; games on a market.  You need to collect as many points as possible in 1 minutes to transfer to the next level.  Each time more and more.  Once you finish certain level you are rewarded a star which allows you to purchases &#34;totems&#34; - extra powers helping you to the next level.  You also have an opportunity to earn a bounce games - to eliminate all tokens from the board, which I personally love playing.  Well worth buying it.  Nice graphics too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is 1 of the best games ever but cost money. if you want it for free go to 4shared.com on your kindle or android and set up an account. don't worry its free. then type in on the search bar, minecraft 0 6 0 apk to get it for free :-)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game. then it erased all of my data. i am reinstalling, because i love the game though. it is really fun and a challenge. i would just like that bug to be fixed
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very good game you go through it and earn points to buy new ones this should be 5 stars
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Nothing like falling asleep to a thunderstorm.  Love the timer feature.  Who needs a sound machine anymore?  I also like having the option to mix sounds.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Have to pay attention to every second but when you are into it will be real thought provoking and keep you watching
B0043RGY60|5.0|Jared, Shannon and Tomo are just to much for words.<br />they roll anything you may have thought about and wondered about and made it into a great cd
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|this is I say a leggit slender. I hope this game gets updates so it can keep progressing if there was more maps I would go 5 *
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was good if you like Grisham, and I do. Would make another great movie. Plot was well thought out.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple run 2 is impressive in its design and entertaining. there is so much variation throughout the game that it doesn't get tiresome or boring. it is very entertaining but you cannot upgrade as easily and finding gems can be tricky. overall a very good game though.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I learned about Susan Cain in a NY TImes article that caught my interest; subsequently I bought her amazong book. I related to every sentence, especially recalling the &#34;but she's so quiet&#34; comments that plagued me my entire life. There's nothing wrong with being quiet and Cain's book is tremendously affirning. I hope to catch one of her speaking tours sometime. In the meanwhile, I've signed up for her newsletters and facebook page.
0765325950|5.0|Finally the last book of this series.  I was waiting for this book to come out since book 13 was released.  It completes the whole story nicely with all characters taken into account in a most epic battle which keeps you glued to the pages.  Highly recommend this series to any fantasy fan.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I love each and every LP cd out there, Linkin Park is the most put together band , they know how to captivate by their lyrics and music, Chester's voice is mesmerizing .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so much that i will recommend this game for people to play.o hope people see how fun it was,just like it was for me .
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Breaks frequently and has a lot of problems that never get fixed.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a great knife,great price and i love it cant wait to use it in the feild this year.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Like most people, I've seen the movie countless times but have never read the book. It was a quick read and it was fun to learn how the book differs from the movie in many cases.
1609611543|4.0|I learned all sorts of things I didn't know about wheat--like why the wheat we eat now *isn't* the same wheat our grandparents ate a couple of generations ago. This is filled with good, medically sound information, and William Davis writes in an accessible and informative style that's fairly entertaining considering we're talking about wheat.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I am so in love with this show.<br />got into it mid 2012 and didnt take me long to get caught up and wanting more.. gotta love SPN !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game it is really worth buying i reccomend that you get this game it is very fun also because it is free if it is free it is for me
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good basic entertainment...not a &#34;Barn Burner,&#34; but good entertainment.  The ending was interesting and provided a good conclusion to the &#34;Time Travel&#34; concept.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|The movie was in my opinion, amazing. I am glad that I watched as many times as I did. The music behind it was equally amazing, once I heard the songs, and the instruments I just had to have the album that went with it. Really, this soundtrack helps me through my panic attacks, it helps me when I need to sleep and above all it makes me feel so freaking epic~ It is a must buy for any Hobbit/LotR fans out there.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Once again I enjoyed a Nicholas Sparks novel.  Thanks now I can see the movie. I hope it is as good as the book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I can see what everyone loves about this game. Totally reminiscent of Super Mario Bros., I think of it as a tribute game and not a ripoff. Very smooth and easy play and thrilled that its free. The controls on the touch screen screen work beautifully.
B00608HMFW|5.0|this is a great cast and write put together, loved each season.<br />Warning to all that its so good that I watched the whole 1-6 seasons and season 7 in less than 2 months..thats how well they drag ya into the SPN world!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Twice now when I get to a high multiplier and get boost almost completely upgraded I get bumped back to the beginning multiplier and have to re upgrade
B004EIZCPM|5.0|this movie always makes me laugh and smile. it's clever and witty and just what you need on any night of the week.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|lots of fun and very entertaining .If you like action games; you will enjoy Leps world.Have fun.I give it a big thumbs up.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great great great book. College is a terrific author. Everyone of her books I have loved. Be prepared to cry and remember to start reading this book early in the day instead of at night like I did. I was up till 4am because I couldn't put it down.
B007SGM084|5.0|The writing is terrible, but the story was good. I found myself skipping through a lot of it to get to something with more substance. The author really needs to buy a thesaurus, she kept describing Christian as &#34;mercurial.&#34; There are other words to describe a person's temperament, come on.<br /><br />Really it's just a love story with some kinky stuff thrown in.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 second to mars really make you think and they pour so much into their songs.lyrics and music.<br />so underrated, needs to be heard and appreciated by more people !
0307960471|3.0|For the past few years I've been hearing a lot about Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. I've frequently seen his books on the staff recommendation shelves when I go into various bookstores, and for awhile now I've considered trying one of them. I see now why he's been labeled by some as the next Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />Once again I broke my own rule of starting at the beginning of a series and jumped in with book #9. Harry Hole, the protagonist in the series is a cop, or an ex-cop by the time this one starts. It doesn't take long to figure out that he's not your typical series hero. He's a complex character who is constantly struggling against his personal demons, and more often than not, losing that battle.<br /><br />As Phantom begins, a new drug has begun to appear on the streets of Oslo. It's called violin, and it's far more addictive and powerful than heroin, but it doesn't allow the user to overdose. Harry gets dragged back to Oslo from his new home in Hong Kong to investigate the murder of a dealer of violin. Harry has a personal connection to the young man who is accused of killing the dealer.<br /><br />Phantom, and I would imagine the rest of the series, are not for those with delicate sensibilities. It's gritty and dark. But at the same time, it's very well written and full of unexpected plot twists and very interesting characters. I had a tough time putting it down and am definitely looking forward to reading more by Nesbø and finding out more about his highly original main character.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|different than the film is a way that seems more authentic. I need to write nine more words in the review.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It doesn't flinch which most games do. It is pretty addicting. The graphics are good. All in all an amazing game. Worth the 1 I payed!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book. I loved it so much. Very sad tho. College is a great Twitter. All her books I have loved. Thank you so much for this book Colleen
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This last book in the series is alright, I didn't like it as much as the other two books in the series though. You knew where it was going and I kept wishing she would take certain turns with the story and it just seemed like the story got pushed and pushed. The end was a shocker though.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Fifth season is not as entertaining as 1-3 but still a hoot.  Good price and contains the blu-ray for at home and the dvd for my laptop.  Bazzingga!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|i downloaded this game for my kindle fire and it wont even download.  it's stuck at 2%.  now i cant get anything else on my tablet DONT BUY!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The preview does not give the book justice. There was no way I could have pegged the story to develop into such a dramatic ending. In the beginning I thought, oh here is a mother teen love story but that was not it at all. I love reads that have psychological issues that explain why people do what they do and this book was exactly just that. Loved it!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Clint Eastwood is one of the all time<br />great movie actors. This is just a fun film.<br />In the end good wins!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Luv it so much more than algebra and selena gomez a b c d yt? G tv u x st
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Easy to use app, exactly what you think it is. Just like the app on your phone or on your computer.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I like Nelson DeMille but I thought this book started too slowly.  It seemed like a travelogue for Yemen which was not exactly what I was looking for.  He did finish strong.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ok, so I saw this game and thought it might be kind of fun... but know I love it, it one of the best horse games ever so if you like horses you should get this app!!!!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This app brings you not only classic music, but the chance to play, and learn it, in a way that is easy to grasp at any age.
1616550414|5.0|This book is great . it tells you the whole story and it wont waste your time.<br />It also has very good quality and its made of great material.<br />I would recommend this to both a newcommer to the franchise and a long-time fan....
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It's fun to play and it can waste some time so if you want to waste some time and have fun this is the game
B007WFTFG6|2.0|It's an alright app, but not real exciting and sometimes the colors don't really work. My preschoolers find it boring.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|as always mr guy is at the top of his game with this small but POWERFUL collection he has gifted us with/ enjoyed every lick and every comment he made during this set, a must have for any serious or novice BLUES PERSON
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Just a fun little app.  I enjoyed playing it.  Not too hard, and entertaining.  Lots of nice songs to choose from.
B008WOULPK|5.0|I have never had any interest or knowledge about the world of 'fashion'.  However, this book was very interesting on so many fronts.  I especially liked the respect demonstrated for the photographers she worked with; her candidness; her respect for everyone she worked with and especially for herself.  I would like to find a copy of her &#34;Cat&#34; book.
0425166805|5.0|I bought your book, &#34;Chariots of the Gods&#34; for my son. He loves it and commented that it was an excellent book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars. I'm going to see the movie when it comes out next week. I was disappointed in  the movie \\"The Lucky One\\" and am hopeful the movie makers Don't mess this one up. This is the best book I've read in a long while! Absolutely loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such an excellent series, it's obvious from the get-go where this is going but where it ends up is a whole other story. Love this series!
B00B3ES20M|5.0|Miles Davis, like John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Artur Schnabel, and Glenn Gould, is one of those artists whose sound is so original and unique that he becomes an artistic category in-and-of himself.  With Miles, the category-trascending element is the even more pronounced because he left traditional jazz behind in 1968-70, to help pioneer jazz-rock fusion.<br /><br />This was more than just a move from electric to acoustic instruments.  It was a move away from jazz rhythms to rock rhythms, from traditional jazz forms to open amorphous song forms, and from the chord-based and modal jazz harmonies into a harmonic world that was often nearly atonal and for which the only \\"jazzy\\" thing is the prevalence of improvisation.<br /><br />But for those of us who carefully follow Miles' trajectory from \\"Miles in the Sky\\" to \\"Bitches Brew,\\" the move from jazz to fusion in 1968-70 seems so abrupt.  It seems like one minute he's firmly ensconced in jazz (albeit moving towards the free jazz of Ornette Coleman), and the next minute he's jamming with a loud electric funk band.<br /><br />Which is where this wonderful bootleg set of performances fills in the gap.  It is truly the missing piece.  Selections from Bitches Brew and In A Silent Way are played side-by-side with his acoustic standards, like Nefertiti, Paraphernalia, 'Round Midnight, and No Blues.  The style is a true mix of jazz and jazz-fusion, an experimental music that seems to be on the move.  Oh, and it is also beautiful, intense, and powerful.  Miles is red hot, his chops at their top form.  His sound is searing in a way that reminds one of John Coltrane.  Wayne Shorter is manic, full of original ideas, and seems freer than in the studio.  Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette, and Chick Corea are likewise in top form.  Only thing I miss is Keith Jarrett, who is wonderful in the Cellar Door recordings, but was not yet with the band at this time.<br /><br />Only negative is the sound quality, especially on thefirst disk.  But what do you expect?  They're bootlegs.  If you're the kind of person who avoids Charlie Parker's and Dizzy Gillespie's 1940s recordings (or Schnabel's 1930s recordings) because you don't like the recording quality, then you might want to skip these.  But then you'll be missing out on something of high historical and artistic value.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book.  It follows the 50 shades series but stands alone.  The characters are messed up bet it is good to see how they try to work things out.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Certainly not something I would read again or recommend but did help pass time.  Learned nothing from the time it took to read.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have worked with many other thermal pastes before and can't say enough good things about arctic silver. This is especially great for people putting on paste for the first time -- the extra 10-20% cooling you get from this will overcome your poor application technique.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This is just so calming and romantic and beautiful. I might float off like a piece of chiffon in the wind if not for Dianas' sultry voice. Diana has such a sultry smooth cool, with a large body force behind it and real fine grit to bring this listener back to earth. All of her albums are sexy renditions of jazz love songs.
B005HSL626|4.0|Strangely addicting, all you do is cut fruit and avoid bombs.... it's a good time waster. l l l l
B0041KKYBK|5.0|No finance course can prepare you for the magnitude and sheer scale of what this disc shows.<br />If you have not seen this movie yet, suggest you do so at the earliest. Even though i had already seen &#34;too big to fail&#34; i was shaken and vowed to be better informed in the future.
B00846REIS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started to read this book.  I was not disappointed to say the least.  It goes down the lines of 50 Shades but with a twist.  If you loved 50 Shades then you will certainly like this series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an excellent read. Even under life's worst circumstances true love still can prevail. This is both happy and sad but true to life. Very quick read.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I was never a cat lover until we got our Annie and well Annie hold a special part in my heart!<br /><br />This book is perfect, give me a crappy Monday full of surprises and fires to put out and all I need is a little time with this book for produce a chuckle or two!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|product was in excellent condition, product was beyond what I expected, it played very well and looked brand new, my husband loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm on this constantly on my computer, now I can go on where ever I am! Good app, works quickly and does what it's supposed to.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really addicting and enjoyable for people of all ages and what I really like about this game is that you can get all the features without spending a single penny of real money. The graphics are amazing and can keep you entertained for a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Useful tips and shows how much goes into taking care of horses. Also very educational on what horses like and the names of different breed's.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We have enjoyed this series very much, looking forward to season four. C u later me. Me me me me
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Sure, my Macbook Pro 15 inch Retina 2.7 GHz i7 16GB, 768GB SSD is awesome but when you have gigabit internet access and the Apple Extreme Router is right there beside you why not plug in and really push that download to the extreme!<br /><br />Worth even penny - yes they are a little expensive but come on when you spend the kind of change I spent on my new Macbook Pro, the money spent on the adapter was pennies really!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The product arrived on time, the disks were in excellent condition. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family.
B008BU70HW|5.0|The most outstanding movie series in decades!  I enjoyed every episode thus far. Excellent for those who enjoy getting hooked on a series.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|He scared the s*** out of me it's the best slinderman game ever I'm going to play it more buy it
B008M0NDOK|5.0|My only complaint is the over all lack of support so far and the fact that the controller is shaped very uncomfortable. Reminds me of the first Nintendo controller. It hurts after long hours of play. But its worth the pain. Nova 3 probably controls the best. That and real racing 7. I say but it because they may come out with more supported titles.
B008VBYN80|4.0|tutorial is well developed and helps you get started without any confusion. game seems to be well crafted. I look forward to becoming addicted to this.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Gw8 movie. Bought new one because my son wore out the other one. Best football movie ever. We love it.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I was fortunate enough to get this free. But as useful as it is to me, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this! It's worth it!
B007THA4FI|5.0|First off, I didn't have any 'want' at all to read this book ... one of the many book clubs I was in was reading it and I had every intention of abstaining and then someone made a comparison with Maeve Binchy, whom I love.  The characters are all pretty flawed (but isn't everyone?) and I had a difficult time finding anyone that I truly liked.  The entire story somehow reminded me of watching one of those late 70's early 80's British shows on PBS - think Ballykissangel.  Everyone seems headed toward some kind of personal disaster and it's a bit like you're reading juicy gossip and just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I liked it - it's certainly not like any of the previous books and I didn't expect it to be - but, it's was a great read about normal people and how everyone has their own agenda be it good or not so good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|No explanation needed, this show is still the best.....right after Homeland.  It defiantly keeps me at the edge of my seat.
1451695195|5.0|If you're tired of people questioning your sanity because you believe in an afterlife, the experience of this once-skeptical neurosurgeon and his conclusions will substantiate your belief and give skeptics pause.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can build citys and have anaimals out of blocks and you can move things around everything is square what can i say it was free and my daughter loves it
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very handy app I use it almost daily to look at something on my desktop pc from my kindle fire hd. Thumbs up for a neat app!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Freaking best game in the whole world. It is my favorite. A few words to describe it are, awesome, cool, and best game EVER!
1451695187|5.0|Great service, arriving fast.  Is a really great book.  Would recommend to any and all. Will definitely consider using again.
B0096Y6EUG|2.0|I really like Paul Simon, but I cannot seem to get through the album.  It just seems boring to listen too, and not boring enough to sleep through.  I would rather but in something a little more upty dupty.  This one is depressing.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book may not answer all your questions, but if you follow it faithfully, you will have no problem creating your Kindle book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. Even better than the last one. This is a great pastime and if you're thinking about getting it. Don't!  Just do it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game for horse lovers. Personally I think that the game is fun and it has great graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it Is so fun I'm 12 and I love this game so much I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!
B00499DRJO|1.0|Extraordinary? Seriously.  Stibal's 'stories' about the cancer and her healings have that 'Phony'  smell all over it! Do your research b/f you buy any of her books/classes.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I don't normally buy pop albums, but I made an exception for this one because it contains at least 4 or 5 singles that I really enjoy. As a whole, the album doesn't stand out in terms of flow/transition or topic, which is why it gets 4 stars. Rest assured, at $2.99 for a digital copy, it is well worth your money.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|did not know how how errotic this book was.i'm only into 20% of book i wouldn't have bought it if i had known what it was like.  If book 2& 3 are like the first i won't read them. I would like to send them back if i could.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|They added new upgrades and other obstacles like with a mine cart and the rope slide. I think a lot of people should get this game
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Awful, unrealistic, way too much unneeded gore, who needs tosee chunks of body and blood flying in every scene with every kill. With such great actors, this should have been so much better and I was expecting much more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A quick read because I was drawn to the characters.  An unexpected twist was a nice change from formula books.
B000VIPJKM|5.0|Good movie about a young women finding her potential beyond what she was lead to believe.  Even with the superficial materialism, its about not making quick judgments about people and looks can be deceiving.  Good coming of age movie for young women.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I just finished this very sad and touching book.  I recommend this to anyone and everyone it changed perspective on the holocaust completely.  I could write pages about this book. But for now, all I will say I'd that EVERYONE must read this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the most BEST and entertaining game I ever played because it teaches you focus and concentration if you have both of those you will have the highest score on the game.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I love it, it reminds me the best time ever, the 80's. The music is great, the actors as well. The shipping was on time as expected. The DVD was in perfect conditions.
1451627297|1.0|The bone-structure of this book could have made for a wonderful story.  But where was the editor in this train-wreck?<br /><br />The first part was good, creepy, interesting.  And then there's a point where you can see the author fall under his own spell -- he's so busy being \\"in the moment\\" himself he forgets to take his audience along with him.  Forgets even the Prime Directive of genre fiction, which is to always keep posing questions and delaying answers so that readers must keep turning pages.  Those people who feel the middle part of the book drags are not just idiosyncratically failing to enjoy the content -- they have a real and legitimate gripe with the FORM, the competence of the writing.  For literally hundreds of pages in the middle King seems to suffer amnesia, and forgets the most basic fundamentals of his craft:  Suspense and conflict.<br /><br />King takes liberties no lesser-known writer would be allowed to take.  Any book this self-indulgently navel-gazing, if submitted for publication by any lesser name would never see the light of day.<br /><br />Worst of all, when King finally does wake up and remember he's supposed to have, you know, like a PLOT or something, he botches that too.<br /><br />It was a very bad decision to have Oswald be a lone gunman.  Never mind that even RFK Jr. is now saying publicly that his father, Robert Kennedy, did not believe Oswald acted alone. (King's protagonist is far too eager to dismiss the idea of a conspiracy, giving the impression King himself thinks only a whacko would believe a thing like that.) Never mind that.  What's worse is that in terms of FICTION, the elements required to tell a good and interesting story, a conspiracy would have given a lot of added interest, plot complications, and potentially better pay-off at the end.<br /><br />If that really wasn't the story King wanted to tell -- OK, he wanted to go for this other thing, about what can and can't be changed -- fine.  Then the book should have beena quarter of the length.  Hell, a short story could have been cool.  In a much, much abbreviated form this story could have been great, spooky, evocative, and beautifully bitter-sweet at the end.  But the bloated center blocks all possibility of that.<br /><br />Worst of all, right at the end, when King seems to wake up and realize he really must get back to the story, all his not inconsiderable writerly talents seem to abandon him, and he just has a (newly introduced) character EXPLAIN it all to us.  Bo-ring.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|I have to admit, when I started reading this--on the recommendation of a vendor--I wasn't sure what I was going to be in for. Normally, I don't read science fiction (more of a fantasy reader), but I truly enjoyed riding along with Mark Watney's Martian experiences and couldn't wait to see what Mars was going to throw at him next. It was hard to decide if it was the planet out to get him or if he was brilliantly inept. The Martian had elements that were so far over my head that I almost skipped over them (not a big chemistry/aerodynamics engineer). This story had enough humor to keep me interested and I'm glad I did. In my imagination, I kept thinking of all of the different ways that the story could have ended, and I'm glad that Weir chose the ending he did instead of one of the many different scenarios that I had imagined.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Every problem is a challenge.  Although stranded and alone on a hostile planet, he keeps a joyful attitude and is never defeated.
B00932HEX2|4.0|Your sentences are twice as long as they need to be.  Besides which it does not take any creativity or thought to add vulgarity to a script. And it is distracting.<br /><br />That said, I turned on my internal \\"F\\" bomb filter, and watched the whole season.  Some of the plot twists seemed implausible, but the story was good enough to keep me engaged. Claire Danes is amazing.  I'm ready for the second season as soon as Amazon Prime will let me download it.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The Wool 1-5 Omnibus series is set in the distant future where Earth is basically a wasteland due to war, nuclear detonations and virtually the entire planets population having to live in giant 130+ story silos. Going outside is forbidden and the only way anyone goes out is so they can die via a quasi-religious ritual known as The Cleaning. Most of the people in Silo 18 (where the majority of the story takes place) have never known any better and just assume not going outside is for their own good, while never questioning the WHY behind the reasons of those in authority. Talk of the outside is generally regarded as forbidden except for those that \\"poison\\" the others in the silo with talk of the outside and eventually going out there one day to do more than just clean. These people are the real danger to the silo as far as the IT and law department of each is concerned. What wages over books 1-5 is the battle between the residents of Silo 18 and the authorities in it for a better of quality of life, to not live in fear of going outside and to find out just why the outside is so forbidden.<br /><br />That being said, Wool was surprisingly good. AT first, I was very skeptical because naturally after being on Amazon for umpteen years. Alarms immediately go off when you see a lot of reviews that are barely 2-3 sentences (even though the word count doesn't have to be beyond 20 for a review), but overwhelmingly positive. Now, I'm still not sure if half those 1-time reviews are legit or not. What I do know? This Wool series is really good. Not the greatest of all time like some have said, but it's pretty solid dystopian sci-fi. Especially if you're a fan of games like Fallout and dystopian societies, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy of the Wool Omnibus. I wouldn't bother with getting the books individually as they're like 40-50 pages up until Wool #5. Better to just grab them all for $5 and enjoy not having to stop after the 40th page of each story.<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone on the fence about this series!<br />Traviss helps anyone on the fence about this series!<br />Travis
0439023513|4.0|One thing I have to say in favor of this trilogy that does not apply to the Harry Potter series or to several others where the same basic structure is followed from book to book without extreme variation is that each of these books departs from the arc traversed by its immediate predecessor. `Catching Fire' seemed set to be a repeat of the `hunger games' format of the first but it departed from that scenario very quickly and veered into a nightmarish and surreal landscape, ending in a cataclysm. `Mockingjay' is not a novel of games of any kind, unless one considers rebellion and war to be a game. It is only similar in the sense that the participants try to outwit their opponents and constantly produce strategies that will take the opponent off guard.<br /><br />`Mockingjay' involves casualties of war and how people continue existing despite the destruction of almost everything they cared about. Katniss is the ambivalent `mockingjay,' the symbol of the rebellion led by District 13, the region previously thought to be destroyed. She quickly realizes that she's as much a pawn in their game as she was in the games of the Capital. She knows that the leader of District 13, President Coin, would easily see Katniss sacrificed for the benefit of the rebellion if it served her purpose. Katniss feels she has to work toward the rescue of Peeta, taken by the Capital as Katniss was rescued by the District 13 rebels. It is almost worse for her when Peeta is rescued because she finds that he has been brainwashed into believing that Katniss is responsible for all the suffering he has experienced and is now the object of his hatred. Deprogramming him is hardly certain and only partially successful. She spends much of the novel on her guard against him while hoping he will regain all of his former self.<br /><br />Partly because the story dictates it, this is not a fast paced page-turning adventure novel in the vein of the first two books. It is a novel with a slower, more measured pace in which the horrors of war and the uncertainty of survival infiltrates every fiber of Katniss's being. To a certain extent, Katniss' own obstinate nature is responsible for her doing impulsive and sometimes self-destructive things that have unintended and unknown consequences.<br /><br />Neither Katniss, nor Peeta nor Gale has the luxury of deliberating about the outcome of any possible romantic dilemma that may exist between them. They are all too busy either struggling to hold onto their sanity or fighting for physical survival while taking even higher risks venturing into the enemy's lair in order to assassinate the evil, tyrannical President Snow. Even after the climax and the subsequent restoration of some kind of order these characters are too damaged for there to be much `happily ever after and all's right with the world again' idyllic existence. These are traumatized, damaged people who lost whatever remnant was left of their childhoods long ago. Living through tragic loss on such a massive scale, they carry on and go through the motions as they construct a new existence. There are no children in this book. There are mainly severely traumatized people who have seen multitudes of horrors before they've even finished their second decade.<br /><br />The environment in this book and the surface events of the story are no more plausible than the wildly surreal altered reality of `Catching Fire.' However, the emotional flavor of this novel is far more in the tradition of hundreds of novels about real, historical wars. While this novel lacks the readability of the first two novels, it does possess more of an exhausting, drained, ravaged quality in keeping with what the occupants of any war zone experience.<br /><br />`Catching Fire' was a little more plodding than `The Hunger Games' and `Mockingjay' is a bit more turgid than either of them. That quality does not detract, for me, from the overall quality of the novel as a completely fitting climax to this trilogy. I have to admire Collins for taking the story in unexpected directions along with the heroine. Almost nothing goes according to plan and that's as it should be for any novel that seeks to possess any verisimilitude to the emotional realities of any survivors of oppression and war.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|After reading this book the first time, all I could think was \\"Wow!\\" I found it hard to wrap my mind around all the things that happened to one person and the way he overcame them. It seems impossible. My next thought was to share this with the rest of my family, especially my son. I thought it would especially be relevant to him since he is also a young adult that's still finding his way in the world.<br /><br />When Kelley first meets Adam, her friend whispers to her to stay away from that one...he's crazy. Of course, Kelley was intrigued because he was the one she was attracted to. After they had known each other only a little while Adam showed up late for a date. It was then that she found out about his former drug problem, his lack of direction in college, his partying and addiction to crack, and the sordid events that eventually led to his arrest and conviction of felonies against his friends. He told her about the year he spent in drug rehabilitation, how he found Jesus Christ as his Savior. She could relate to his story, as it seemed similar to her own history but without the drugs. Their time together as Adam fought the pull of the drugs is only the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Adam kept running away from his concerned friends. At one point, he confessed to his friend, Jeff, \\"I'm a loser.\\" In spite of his relationship with Jesus, he couldn't overcome the pull of the drugs. Kelley had spent nine months pulling him out of crack houses, praying for him and he'd finally run from her. He was afraid he'd been putting her in danger, and she was close to giving up on him. He and Jeff had a long talk while they discussed solutions. One of them was joining the Navy. Adam remembered a movie about the SEALS and he decided he needed direction and something challenging to work for. To become a SEAL, he would need to be completely drug free for two years. The alternative was unthinkable.<br /><br />Adam's journey through boot camp, A-School, then BUD/S training to become a SEAL was grueling, but Kelley, now married to Adam, stood by him and he learned to lean on the Lord. The training brought out the \\"psycho\\" character trait from his school days and he would not give up. His scores were not the highest in his classes, but the instructors liked him because he gave his all and then some, was a team player, and showed leadership qualities throughout.<br /><br />Graduation from BUD/S and the birth of his son came at the same time. One day during airborne training, Adam called Kelley, \\"It's calling my name.\\" That was his way of telling her he was facing temptation again from the crack. Kelley immediately dropped everything and moved to an apartment closer to his training base, and put the baby in his arms as often as she could to remind him that he was a daddy now. He had to be strong.<br /><br />From energetic, spastic goofy kid taking reckless chances to consummate professional warrior, Adam found his place. When 9/11 rolled around he was even more fervent in his love for his family, God, and his country. He kept training, kept overcoming, became loving husband and daddy, responsible son, leader, and even a Sunday school teacher. But you absolutely have to read this book to find out the rest of the story. Some pretty amazing problems kept hitting Adam and Kelley, but they overcame them, one by one.<br /><br />By the time you get to the end event, you really know Adam Brown, and it hits a person hard to know his life was given to serve our country. But aside from his sacrifice, his life is a celebration of dedication and committment to the Lord and those he loved. Yes, he was human and failed at first. That's what makes this read so compelling. This is a book I plan to read many times.<br /><br />A complimentary review copy was provided to me by Blogging for Books (A WaterbrookMultnomah.com division).

B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|Foxygen is the latest entry into the 60's rock/psych pop, what was old is new again, dig up our roots and make them sound fresh revival.  Arriving with a back story not too far removed from MGMT- the band Foxygen will most likely draw comparisons to- these two friends have absorbed their catalog of music and re-packaged it into an album that manages to sound fresh and new while also sounding like it could have been released 40 years ago.<br />  A list of names that may pop into your head while enjoying this album: Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones (circa \\"Aftermath\\"), Elvis Presley (late '60s), T-Rex, Lou Reed, The Beatles (circa \\"Abbey Road\\"), Donovan, any random band from the Nuggets compilation, The Who (pre-\\"Tommy\\"), and probably a half dozen more.  Musically, it feels vintage without sounding dated.  Lyrically, Foxygen rises well above the majority of the current batch of psych revivalist bands with memorable lines that you will quote for days.  When the band does it's best Dylan impersonation on \\"No Destruction\\", they drop lines that would be at home on \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" or \\"Blonde on Blonde\\"- existentially absurd without sounding forced.  The simplicity of the lyrics in \\"Oh Yeah\\" fit the T-Rex shuffle perfectly.<br />  The true strength of the album lies in that fact that repeated listens pay off big time.  Yes, \\"Shuggie\\" is so catchy it almost makes you sick, but after listening to it a dozen times, the track just sounds darker and more depressing than its smooth surface suggests.  This is the true measure of this album's success- you want to listen to it often and every time you do, you catch some new lyrical gem or musical treat.<br />  Here's hoping Foxygen sticks around for awhile.

0345525558|4.0|The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Deffenbaugh is a story about an eighteen year old woman, Victoria Jones, who aged out of the Foster Care System, and who had been so disappointed by the adults in her life that she lost all perspective and confidence in herself and her own abilities. Miraculously, she connected with flowers and their Victorian meaning, and through this passion she learned to trust herself and others again. This may sound like a very depressing book, and although parts were incredibly sad, it was also a hopeful story. There were characters in this novel that loved Victoria Jones deeply; they too were flawed, but their love was undeniable. Victoria did not trust her own capabilities to love another person because she did not have the guidance, stability or unwavering, unconditional love growing up. She feared getting too close to anyone because she was destined to hurt the other person and ruin the relationship.<br /><br />Victoria had a remarkable gift. Through the meaning of flowers she was able to help others improve themselves and achieve their dreams. When Victoria worked with flowers, her very best self was present.<br /><br />The friends that Victoria made along the way were not perfect people, but they reached out to Victoria and loved her in a way that she had never experienced before, transforming her gradually. I loved Renata, Grant, Elizabeth, Mother Ruby and Marlene.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Language of Flowers. I would have rated it with 4 1/2 stars if the option was available.

0525953728|3.0|As promised, Owen delivers a detailed account of Bin Laden's capture. This is the insider's view of the last thirty minutes of Zero Dark Thirty, but certainly not the book about the movie. Like most Navy Seal memoirs, Owen describes his path to becoming a Navy Seal, the training, the ethos, etc. We learn much about the attitudes and feelings of the DEVGRU team before, during, and after the mission. The equipment and methods used are fascinating, but not so secret that it hasn't been said before. This is an easy read, but one that might flow better with a little less detail. We don't need to know what kind of sauce Owen puts on his taco. We don't need to know that he pulled the adhesive strip off the explosive before attaching it to the door. Aside from that, you will not likely read a better account of that raid.

0374275637|5.0|This book has changed the way that I see the world.  I now have a new perspective on how we perceive the world and our consequent actions.  Kahneman does a great job of clearly explaining his work and the work of others in the field of behavioral economics.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|I had great difficulty with going from directory to directory. I also had problems with maximising the aspect ratio on my screen. I could get these done but it made for repetitive inputs. I was using 2.2 froyo. I uninstalled it and I am looking for a better player.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So far I really like this game<br />But I just started it today,so we shall see once I get . More into the game. Enjoy
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|This is an amazing album!! No, BVB isn't the best rock band out there, but they are a really fun band to listen to!! I would recommend this album to any rockers who are looking for something new.
B006RA0E5I|5.0|I bought this because I need a 3 button mouse in order to use CAD software. It works great and I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app will work on your kindle fire hd. It is a joy to play I cant actually imagine someone who doesn't like it. My sixth grade class all loves this appbI would highly recommend it.
B003YL4L52|5.0|If there ever could be a &#34;gripping&#34; book on learning how to make presentations. This is it. Its an eye opener. I have never looked at presentations this way. Lets just say it had changed the way we look at presentations in my company.<br />Simple principles on presenting more effectively.
B001KQBFAM|5.0|Great true life story about an Honest Cop who had to take on the whole NYPD police department and their corrupt Supervisors. Definitely worth seeing and a great read in book form too. I have actually talked with Serpico and I regard him as a True Hero. I am also former law enforcement and had to become a whistleblower due to corruption issues within the U.S. Customs Service. See Also: [...]<br />Another good book or DVD to get and see is The SuperCops(1974), about two honest cops named Hans and Greenberg who fought the corrupt system in place in the New York City Police Department.<br />Remember corruption only exists if the managers and political allow it to exist, including the NYPD Chief, Commissioner, City Mayor etc...Feel free to contact me at: john.a.carman@gmail.com
B008CRC506|5.0|Being a musical lover, this is the best TV programming ever! Star-studded cast, great songs and dance numbers around a terrific story line!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|We enjoyed this movie so couldn't wait to purchase for our collection. We received the product on time. Quality purchase!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Firstly, you HAVE to see the unrated version. Without the bit of vulgarity, it loses it's realism. This is one of the best, and funniest, movies I've seen in years. Seth MacFarlane is brilliant, and brings humanity to a teddy bear as he does with every other animated character he's created. I can't wait for Ted 2!!! Yes, they're already working on it!! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great!! Never was sure what would happen next. It's a definite must read!! I honsey could not put it down.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is very fun and I definitely would recommend it to any and all angry birds lover to try out.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This series is absolutely astonishing.  You will be mesmerized by every moment of it.  Unlike Attenborough's earlier &#34;Life of Birds&#34; and &#34;Life on Earth&#34; he does not venture with us on camera, but narrates the series which is mostly void of humans onscreen.<br /><br />The first disc has an audio problem.  Attenborough's voice gets louder and quieter at irregular points making it necessary to turn the volume up louder than you may wish just to be able to hear him clearly during the points where is voice drops off.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I only wish I had known of this movie while it was in theaters!  What a great action movie and a plot line that is not only plausible, but sadly, conceivable in real life.  Danny Glover;s performance leaves something to desire, but Mark Wahlberg and Kate Mara do an excellent job in this film.
030746363X|4.0|this book arrived as described.  In good condition and in a timely manner.  I would buy from this seller again.<br /><br />I already owned this book and purchased it as a gift for a friend that stays at the gym.  They really enjoyed the info in this book.
B0049KWAVY|5.0|Excellent product and service. The sound is amazing! An excellent purchase for anyone especially for audiophiles. Buy it now. This is an outstanding buy!!!  Perfection from an Outstanding pair of Brother, Sister, and the without a doubt the best musicians available. Richard Carpenter's arrangements are just amazing !!! I only wish they had many more great songs from so many of their albums that had this K2 HD Quality. They gave us so much great music. Gave this CD 5 Plus Stars.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Funny, sweet (but not too sweet), and sharp--a great start to a (mostly) great show!  I could watch this pilot over & over.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Well-drawn characters; beautifully written.  Captures essences of coming of age.  Relationships and settings keep reader engaged throughout the story, genuinely interesting characters.
0761171703|5.0|A collection of lighthearted photographs showing dancers practicing their art in incongruously every day settings.  My personal favorite is a setting that appears to be mountains of coal at an industrial setting.  On top of a pile of coal, we see only the lower legs of a person wearing jeans - and ballet slippers, standing on point atop the refuse.  Many pictures will bring a smile to your face.  A few, maybe even a tear.
1596354208|5.0|In going over this book I am salivating to get started. I read through the book instructions and it looks very easy to tat. This is going to be so much fun. I am getting everything together to start. Get this book you all will make fantastic jewelry and use your imagination in making these in multi colored threads.
0345803485|5.0|This book is sooo not for single people!  When you are done with this book you will be ready to make a whole lotta whoopi lol
B0063IH60K|4.0|love how  easy is it to change games  like all the different games  my game to i  go to when bored
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Great story, great action...look forward to sequel.  This is completely different to the original and far better. Don't miss this movie or you will regret it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so addicting. its just cool. its a little challengeing, but that's what makes it fun. try it you will love it!
0767847431|4.0|This came out at the theater when I was just the age to be amazed by it.  Watching it again for the first time in 35 years, I was surprised that the stop-motion animation of all the creatures still came across pretty well, even after seeing years of CGI wonders.  The acting and the story were pretty corny, but in a way that made it fun to watch again.  And my own young children loved it.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|This app is both easy and convenient.  I use it as my secondary source for free e-books, the first being my local library.
0451205766|3.0|I dont know what to really say because its a book and there is nothing more to it then a book.
0007466064|5.0|I just love the series and can't wait for the season to begin again.The books are so descriptive  with detail, I can just imagine it in my mind.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you like Nicholas Sparks' books, you'll like this one.  I found the book to be an easy read.  It was very enjoyable.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Our family was looking for a good comedy for an evening together.  At 7, 9, and 12, the kids enjoy some different movies, but everyone enjoyed this comedy with Adam Sandler in the lead.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Simple game play.  Connect the matching dots on the  grid so that all squares have a line in them, but no lines cross.  As you play the first boards, the play is super easy.  I was frequently able to complete boards in 5 seconds.  My only complaint is that there are too many easy boards before getting to the more challenging ones that require some careful thinking.  But those are mighty fun.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is addictive I just wish that my stats in my iPhone was same on my kindle fire.it made me start from the beginning mind you I logged into Facebook for extra coins.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I luv it!! It has great graphics, smooth operation, and is way better than the original!!! Although it could have more characters to choose from!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Great book for a mental escape. Type of book that is a great summer beach book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although sad, this tale of kids with cancer was well written and thought provoking.  The prose was filled with humor as well as intellectual insight on life and death and how terminal illness can affect young people.  I recommend it to anyone and I expect that I will read it again.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Tommy Lee is a stereotypical fuddy fuddy but I give him kudos for recognizing the value of his marriage and working to improve it. Pleasant entertainment
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Highly recommend reading very heart filling and great content!!!  One of my favorite books cannot wait to see the movie on Thursday!!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I am sure my 2 year old granddaughter has no idea what she is doing but she wants to play this more than the age appropriate games I have purchased for her. maybe she has the makings of a physicist.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|I'm in my 20's and never would have guessed that I would become interested in One Direction. I was over at a friend's house and she was playing this CD. After hearing it, I knew I had to give it a try. I like it a lot. I had it on repeat for days. This music put me in a better mood.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|This is a great card, performance is optimal, the noise level is low, it is very quiet. Note that if you want to buy PCIe 3.0 graphics cards and use their full potential you need a board that supports PCIe 3.0 plus a 22nm processor in Intel's Ivy Bridge technology. Do not take surprises. It supports PCIe 2.0 ports but not all the bandwith advantage offered by PCIe 3.0.<br />Missing more specifications in the publication
0452289963|5.0|Tolle, once again, proves he's a master at his craft by urging readers to let go of their way of thinking and become \\"still\\" in a society that's become far too obsessed with this, that and the opposite. His words are clear, convincing and difficult to refute, as any negative review can easily be summed up as \\"ego.\\" How else could a guide to focusing your attention on what's directly in front of you be misconstrued as anything but a positive step in the right direction? Alas, acceptance is crucial, and not everyone will be ready for such a drastic change in what they perceive as \\"normal\\" behavior. I will, however, say this: As someone who's suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, panic attacks and anxiety for many, many years, it's a wonder how cognitive response therapy and medication couldn't achieve what this book was able to. I was always told it was my conditioned thought process that was the problem. OK, \\"think differently\\" always seemed to be the solution. But this book went one step further - stop thinking all together. Problem solved.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Odd concept but held my attention. Not sure if I would recommend this. Little too out there for my taste
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft in a nutshell is a game where you can let you're imagination roam free. you can adventure mine and fight. what's not to love about it you can build you're kingdom and do what you want. so if you don't have it get it NOW
B007KT5X9M|5.0|Thought I had most everything of his. Overlooked this one until saw a CBS Morning report. Glad I found it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|so good if u r in2 templ run also it's really fun and easy even my 3 yr old sister plays this game and she's so excited when I let her play it so u should get it it's awsum
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Gives insights into the world of autism, and how one can overcome challenges.  I own horses & have been around cattle, and am so happy to follow the journey that lead to 'humane practices'.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Loved it. If your a fan of Tolkien and LOTR then you'll dig this.The blueray  is coming 3/19 according to theonering.net
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Purchase!  All episodes are available with TV Pass and I love that I know what happens before everyone else!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a great read.  If I had a daughter I'd need to make sure we had a &#34;drinking&#34; talk.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Saw it before and enjoyed it again. I great remake of the former movie of old. Will probably watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great book. I'm so glad I read this book. It's so good, that even though I'm only ten, it only took me five hours. It was so amazing. I felt like I was really Katniss, the girl on fire. The author did a good job on not to heavily descriving the bloodiness. Also, she did a good job of putting clever little twists in here and there. The plot was amazing from the first page. If you have not read the Hunger Games, you have not lived life. The Hunger Games is a great book (t is took me one hour thirty minutes to write).
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that Amazon saves the books directly to your device and you just go download them when you're ready.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the movie on TV and enjoyed it very much, so I read the books and thought they were great!  They make you think about the way our country could be heading.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|great i like that it stands up, shuts off when I close the cover, it is a great product to have..
1451696191|5.0|Once i finally got the book I instantly fell in love. I finished the book today and it took 3 days to finish it. You can't put the book down And you won't want to put it down. Its an amazing book filled with love, happiness, drama, friendship. It's worth the money. One of My favorite books now. GET IT!
B003RV43X4|5.0|I like watching these kind of movies. This one was a good one to watch. Hope to see more on Amazon Prime
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun game. Great for everyone. Imagi has done it again.<br />Well worth  the download.<br />Fun, fun, fun.<br />Get it now!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a lovely story of teenage friendship and the adults in their lives. That the kids have cancer is operant, but not the whole story
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson LOVES this game!  He will sit and create with this game for hours sometimes.  I feel good about it because he's not killing anything. or just mindlessly spellbound in front of the tv.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Although the ending could have been better, I'd recommend this book to those who ever wished to live in a videogame.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Christian's point of view. I wish there was more to read from his view point. The ending was great. I love happy endings.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first found out about this game from my friend and it is EPIC.<br />I like how you can get the letters and all of the coins are great to collect.<br />And I like it when it unlocks a new character in each place I the tour.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome app my grandmother bought it first then my mom<br /> did and now I mygirlbb has it
B008MEM24S|5.0|if you like where's my water this is a great app. same concept with clever new obstacles. there are also challenges to complete certain levels with specific goals ( beyond just getting the knomes). the one downside is that you have to buy two separate unlocks--would prefer just one.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I have just finished doing this study, and it has helped us tremendously.  Finally, we have been able to make some sense of the source of so much friction and misunderstanding between us.  Only wish we had discovered it sooner.  This is a great book, and we would recommend it to anyone who is married, or considering marriage.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Ice Age are a good family trilogy. Clean humor on all, but this last installment was not as entertaining as the first two. Worth watching for the sense that you can depend on it as a family night, but if you have not watched the first two...from a level of entertainment, I would pass this one and view any of the other two first.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The  game was a good idea of the run and BOOM!It is a good game.I LOVE I IT.It's the game I see
B005USZYDU|5.0|I really liked the book and I can't wait to buy the second one it's one of my favorites and would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so great. Love what your doing with the world tour. Graphics are amazing compared to other games like temple run
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved the beautiful language. The tale of human reactions and band waggonning by people when the pilgrimage becomes known was very well dealt with .it was beautiful, his faith in believing that his friend would wait for him. The rejuvenation of Harold 's marriage was heart warming.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This was a gift for an old guy with a new grandson and he loved it.  It will give him access to characters that his grandson will be talking about.
B005HSL626|4.0|my grandsons play this and they like it takes coordination and eye practice to play and they always try to play against each other
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome and very great[[ASIN:B00BA4XDWM Subway Surfers Platinum Guide - Cheats, Hacks, Strategy, Tips, Hints, Game Guide, & Walkthrough]]
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It's good for reading, but I have had a lot of trouble with moving from the cloud to my device. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. And I have lost books on my device while doing that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games, in my opinion.Subway<br />Surfers,<br />Is a very skilled game created by very intelligent (smart)<br />Video game designers. If u disagree fine by me, if u agree<br />U picked the right choice. This is my review hoped u liked it!!<br />:-)

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig rises like a phoenix from Quantum of Solace train wreck. Skyfall is a sublime masterpiece that pays tribute to the earlier Bond movies. The Bond series took unfortunate direction when Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond. Never had their been a bigger mismatch since Peter Sellers was cast as 007 in Casino Royale (1967), and at least Sellers could act. Each of his Brosnan era films became progressively antagonizing to watch, and many believed that Bond had \\"jumped the shark\\" as a result. Skyfall and Daniel Craig pretty much guarantees another 50 years of Bond and the best may yet to come. \\"Old dog, new tricks\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read so much sci if and fantasy books that seem to be retelling the same stories over and over again. This is a truly original book with a compelling story. Other reviewers have said it's hard to put down and I absolutely agree.<br /><br />This book alone is enough to make me believe in the future of self-publishing and I wish the author lots of success!
B005R32L66|5.0|i luv it lol helps me stay connected with my luved ones get it you wont regret it but make sure your tablet is compatible wit it some tablets it wont really work like its suppose to

0684824906|4.0|Doris Kerns Goodwin is an historian and excellent writer.  She covered many things about Lincoln's cabinet, why he chose them and how they functioned, that I had not read previously.  If you are interested in History and especially Lincoln's presidency, you will enjoy this book.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|While I am sure it works wonderfully for a text to speech for PDF files, a large icon option would benefit those of us who have fingers.<br /><br />However the specs published say it would be perfect for PDF TTS. Give me large icons and I will glaDLY TRY IT AGAIN.<br /><br />- Android
1452113432|5.0|I am very happy with this book.  It's written in a friendly, down-to-earth way and she presents French cooking &#34;as the Parisians do it&#34; at home.  these are her versions of many French classics with some very intriguing variations plus brief descriptions of her inspirations.  A very fun cookbook with lots of recipes I can't wait to try.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The story builds up steadily and you find your guessing the possible scenarios just ahead of the text.<br />I have my Kindle set for UK English but this book consistently used USA English?<br />David
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Totally addicting ... Could not put down so just read all five books in a couple days ... Just ordered the next three in the series,  do not want to risk going through withdrawals ...
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Being, admittedly, a bit past the age of nightclubs and late nights, it has long been this music lover's beef that<br />the current and recent crop of artists were not. So little good songwriting and even less great musicianship.<br />Having impatiently waited for this release for what seems like months, I can now say that great music, great songwriting and great musicianship<br />now have a new paradigm - Blue Sky Riders.<br />I wondered if this would be Kenny's band. Nope - these guys are a tight, cohesive, close to brilliant amalgam of pure harmonies and effervescent<br />tunes. Each member critical to the whole. The whole much better than any of the parts.<br />My faith is restored and I have ordered another copy. Pretty sure I will wear this one out.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I've been a fan of Johnny Lee Miller since Eli Stone.  He does a fairly good job bringing Sherlock Holmes into the modern world.  You have to remember that in this show, Sherlock Holmes has never existed before and no one has ever heard the name.  It has taken me several episodes to really warm up to Lucy Liu's Watson.  Its not Lucy Liu, its just the character as written for this show.  The episodes are interesting and intriquing - very entertaining.  Not too much gore, lots of puzzles.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The cast was outstanding and included the Indian star from Slumdog Millionaire.  He is an excellent actor.  The movie was a real treat for me as I'm going back to India this year, and I am about the age of most of the main characters.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Very good book felt like it was well paced and could not  put it down absolutely astonishing in every aspect
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Another amazing album from Black Veil Brides! Wretched and Divine is honestly the best one yet. The second I got it in the mail I ripped it out of the package and listened to the whole thing. The package came undamaged and unharmed. And the CD was perfect. I will continue to listen to this CD everyday. Oh and I noticed the CD was cheaper on Amazon than on any other place I looked.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Read reviews on AUX MP3 and thought I would give it a try. Loaded up 2200 songs on SD card and put it to work. Love the shuffle mode which shuffles through all folders. Sound is great and not one bit of static even driving through Denver. Highly recomend this product!! lccowboy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy playing this very much. Definitely something I'd recommend for some quick fun. Feels like you own a horse!!

B009NPA3MS|5.0|We were excited to see a new Phillip Phillips CD released.  He's fabulous.  The CD shows off his broad range of musical styles.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|It's so funny and cute. Kept the whole family entertained the entire film. We usually just rent movies but we actually bought this movie.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The title says it all. This game was just amazing. I loved it and can't believe I had never heard of it before I bought it. I would recommend this to everyone.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Waking to my favorite song...knowing the weather and cool words clock...what more do you need.....oh yeah you can fall asleep to white noise or music....the only clock I could want ...
B008E6I1K8|3.0|This book is great, but the kindle version is hard to read. A huge inconsistency with font size.<br /><br />if I could return it for the  paperback I would.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Continuation of an excellent series. This was my first HD download from Amazon and the picture/sound were much better than what I usually get from NetFlix.  We project onto a 110&#34; screen.
B008OOYALE|1.0|If you like this, you'll love dragonvale, this game is very boring. Just play dragonvale.<br />I love the way dragonvale has their graphics, and there dragons look really cool. If I were you I would try dragonvale!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show. The plot keeps you guessing from start to finish. Definitely start at the beginning of season one, you won't understand the story unless you do, and you definitely won't regret it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is really good and my best friend told me about and she put my it on  kindle fire
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is truly a great game. Your coins regenerate relatively quick. It is a wonderful challenge if you are up to it. Get it!!!!! Its FREEEEEEEEE!

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I thought Looper was a very entertaining movie, with a great surprise ending, but it could get a bit confusing at times. However, that is the nature of time travel stories! Imagine the brain twisters if we ever do figure out time travel... Worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a awesome app! I have a kindle fire and it is realy fun to play when you get bored! Buy IT! (For free, that is).
B00884GR0W|1.0|Its a good idea giving you quests to make exp and go through a story line but it wasn't working good at all on the kindle.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm so blown away by The Martian I hardly know what to write!  Astronaut stranded on Mars, my first thought was \\"OK, Martians reveal their existance and somehow save him.\\"  But it's not like that at all.  It's a hugely engrossing and highly detailed account of how the astronaut survives and gets back to earth.  Although I struggled a bit with all the detail, I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended!
B00AVILCGW|5.0|Action, Sci Fi, Zombies, self-willed computers,  Milla, and \\"brief nudity\\"... what more do you need? Great franchise opener... 'specially in HD.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Great app and didn't have any problems.  No missing pieces, only pieces hiding under the puzzle being built.... Just like real life.  Played many times and loved the HD images and enjoyed solving picture puzzles.  Thank you for creating this App!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app!  The function buttons are easily set up.  Best of all, those annoying ads that pop up on other free calculator apps is minimal at best!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I heard Thrift Shop on the radio and had to know more about this guy.  I had no intention of buying the album, but once I learned he is his own producer and record label, I picked it up.  It was nice knowing most of my money was actually going to the artist.  It was even better knowing that I got an amazing album for my money.<br /><br />Ten Thousand, Can't Hold Us, Thrift Shop, Thin Line, Same Love, White Walls, Jimmy Iovine, A Wake, Gold, and Starting Over are all ridiculously great songs and the rest are pretty good as well.<br /><br />Look forward to hear future songs that describe the wild ride he must be on right now.  Here is hoping he can stay grounded and sober through all this and find happiness doing what he loves!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another tear jerker by the master. Hopefully everyone will be an organ donor after reading this one if you hadn't decided to give life already.

B000003NA3|5.0|The one review stated that this music was dangerous they were correct. as I listened to the opening notes I got chills. the hair on my arms stood up my eyes almost teared up. Coltrane RAW is what you get. spiritual is so spell bindng it puts you in another dimension if you let it. Roy Haynes was absolutely correct in  what he said in an interview once. I Quote, COLTRANE had the amazing ability to take a tune and go down with it and take it  up to  another level so amazingly like no other JAZZ artist he has ever known his entire life . I have been playing these disks for 2.5 weeks now I have no idea when I will stop I get a different message from these tunes every time I play them all of the artist on this recording sound so mind blowing.And deserve all the praise in the world Eric Dolphy,Elvin Jones,Jimmy Garrison,Garvin Bushell(oboe,Contrabassoon). Ahmed Abdul -Malik(oud).McCoy Tyner,Reggie Workman,Roy Haynes. the vocals are a nice touch also. hopefully that 19yr old will here what I am hearing some day and when he does if he does he will be blown away also Thx John L.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm in love with this game but my started to glitche and made my whole kindle glitche so I deleted it but I wouldn't let me redownload it
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This is boring. Not even close to realistic .can't wait to remove this app.  Don't waste your time. There is bound to be numerous better apps available
B00AREIAI8|1.0|don't waste your time to download this I got it and it froze my kindle, my friends I - pad, my sister's I - pod, my aunt's I - phone and my brother's tablet.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|Doesn't follow the book at all and doesn't contain important information needed to understand the story. It was such a disappointment.
B00A7L00XE|4.0|On the blues-rock effort [[ASIN:B00A7L00XE Get Up!]], Ben Harper and guest harmonica player (colloquially referred to as 'harpist') Charlie Musselwhite 'outdo' themselves. In standard edition, the album sits at a svelte 10 songs with none of them missing the mark. The production work is often stripped, feeling very organic and true to the blues idiom of which Harper/Musselwhite aim for. Get Up! was released on the resurrected Stax label (Concord Music Group) - seems appropriate for such a soulful, bluesy effort, right?<br /><br />\\"Don't Look Twice\\" establishes the roots-driven blues sound, beginning in stripped, acoustic fashion. Initially, bass and drums are nowhere to be found, only guitar and Harper voice.  Harper's vocals are a match for the blues here, with the rocker taking a casual, sort of nonchalant approach.  On \\"I'm In I'm Out and I'm Gone,\\" There is more production work from the get-go, but the sound still pays deference to 'keeping the old times alive' without concession to anachronism. Musselwhite flavors the backdrop with excellent touches of harmonica.<br /><br />The gospel-blues infused \\"We Can't End This Way\\" is the first 'crown jewel' of Get Up! with Harper showing his most grit and soul. Lyrics are well though out, particularly lines like \\"...Who doesn't understand / how disappointment destroys the soul...\\" or \\"...Every look of shame / is a wound that will never heal...\\"  Musselwhite gets his say on this six-feel dandy, contributing with his harp and backing vocals.  The simple but irresistible chorus  \\"We can't end this way...\\" carries a loftier weight transcending its commonplace lyrics.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Believe A Word You Say\\" is a stark contrast to the folk-gospel \\"We Can't End This Way\\", aiming for classic-blues rock.  \\"You Found Another Lover (I Lost Another Friend)\\" eschews the bombastic rock stylings of its predecessor, slowing down the tempo and featuring and intimate singer/songwriter moment with guitar, harmonica and voice. Harper pulls this vibe off exceptionally, approaching lyrics \\"You found another love / and I lost another friend\\" in tortured, affected fashion.<br /><br />\\"I Ride At Dawn\\" proves to be another valedictory moment, dedicated to S02 (Navy Seal) Nicholas P. Spehar via the liner notes. The cut possesses a low-key rhythmic groove that carries as much weight as if it were full-fledged 'pedal to the medal'.  Harper, who co-writes with Jesse Ingalls, delivers memorable, thought-provoking lyrics, particularly \\"Give a man a hundred years / he'll want a hundred more / give him a hundred choices / and he still chooses war / from Salem poor to Genghis Khan/ Tomorrow I'll ride at dawn.\\"<br /><br />\\"Blood Side Out\\" sports a more overt turn than \\"I Ride At Dawn\\", highlighted by an exceptional guitar solo.  The six minute plus \\"Get Up!\\" is worth every last second, remaining poised and pacing itself well.  Musselwhite continues to captivate on the harp while Harper sings and plays exceptionally well. \\"She Got Kick\\" adheres to vintage R&B sound featuring gritty vocals from Harper. The lyrics are catchy and relatively straightforward, keeping alive the sensibilities of the past.  Closing cut \\"All That Matters\\" is a lazy, grinding blues cut that appropriately closes the effort.<br /><br />Overall, there is very little to criticize - [[ASIN:B00A7L00XE Get Up!]] is a fine album. Dedicated to Solomon Burke and John Lee Hooker, it is a superb dedication.  This is an album deserving wider recognition than it has received as of yet. HIGHLY and enthusiastically recommended.ulls this vibe off exceptionally, approaching lyrics \\"You found another love / and I lost another friend\\" in tortured, affected fashion.<br /><br />\\"I Ride At Dawn\\" proves to be another valedictory moment, dedicated to S02 (Navy Seal) Nicholas P.

0312600844|2.0|I enjoyed the very beginning--the tension in the description of the family and Patty's way of grating on people, even as she tried to be \\"nice\\" and accommodating of everyone around her. Her indulgence of her son Joey and undermining of her husband was also beliveable. But after that bit in the opening, it was all down hill. The characters are every bit as ponderous, pompous, insecure and insufferable as I find Franzen to be in his essays/interviews.<br />It was interesting to me to see in one section, when Walter and Richard are out at a club, Franzen describes the musician Oberst's \\"Tortured Soulful Artist Shtick, his self-indulgence in pushing his songs past their natural limits of endurance\\". Is it just me, or is Franzen doing a whole lot of projecting here? Talk about limits of endurance! Franzen, you've broken the \\"contract\\".<br /><br />It was also extremely annoying to listen to the rants about everything under the sun (especially the music industry--a rant nearly identical to one appearing in Jennifer Eagan's more recent book, A Visit from the Goon Squad, so maybe not so highly original in its thinking. What lover of music hasn't had these thoughts? Who wants to listen to someone rant about the obvious?); rants that never offered any actual ideas about a positive way forward, so rendered them just self-indulgent and intractably adolescent (especially in the mouths of what were supposed to be adults). I wouldn't want to indulge anyone resembling these characters in real life, so why would I want to spend my valuable reading time with them? There's no pay-off. It's just exhausting and irritating. I can handle difficult characters if it's in the service of a compelling story, but these characters weren't, and this story wasn't.<br /><br />Emotionally dysfunctional cynics and narcissists really aren't all that interesting after the first few minutes, so it's hard for me to understand why, in contemporary literature, they seem to be all the rage and authors and publishers seem to imagine that readers everywhere are simply clamoring for them. Newsflash: we're not. I can't wait for the backlash (hopefully) in a few years, when happiness is again OK, and the capacity for joy might be considered desirable, even \\"cool\\". One can dream, right?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly awesome there are people to buy plases to go and money to save!! It is the BEST game evr made
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|Watched this for a paper I had to do for an English class and it helped quite a bit. Easier than just reading alone. The acting was great but it has Kenneth Branagh so you can't expect less.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love how Connor finally realized he loved Megan. Sometimes men need a little pushing in the love department. Great book!!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I love this soundtrack!  It takes me back to the movie every time I listen to it in the car.  It's wonderful!  Wish there were more tracks :)
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|this is fun for you and old - you fly the copter and then try to land it - you control it by moving the device around - you get to compete on different levels
B009U9S6FI|5.0|My boss gave me this book in the 1960'5 and I remember loving it then. When I saw it for the Kindle I couldn't resist buying it to see if it survived a 50 year span between readings. It did! It is as fresh and relevant as it was then. Despite the fact that half the book is about the Nazi deathcamps, it is a most uplifting book and an enjoyable read.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was an easy read, and I did enjoy it.  It was a but reminiscent of 50 shades of Gray.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Just bought it, brings back memories. This was the first Disney cartoon I saw as a child. My older brother took me to the theater to see it, must have been about 7 or 8 (I'm 51 now). The character that still stands out is the snake, with those hypnotizing eyes. He wasn't scary, but made me a little nervous when he turned those eyes on, and my brother noticed it. So he told a friend of his about it. He had what some call \\"cat eyes\\", ( a Black person with light colored eyes like blue, green, hazel etc). Well his friend was dark skinned with light grey eyes, and after he heard how I reacted to the snake in the cartoon, he would tease me by glaring at me with his big grey eyes. But it was all in fun, I wasn't \\"traumatized\\" or anything. Back then that's how older brothers and sisters played with and taunted one another. The orangutang is another favorite character - great movie for the kids overall.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just can't quit once i get started playing - so much fun for young and old alike. Lots of fun and no need to buy any coins - you can play with what they give you
030758836X|5.0|THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN, VERY CLEVER BOOK. IT HAD ME FROM PAGE 1 ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Munro is one of the best short story writers alone  her stories are sad bleak and wonderful all at the same time. She understands women!

B003O86FMW|4.0|I needed to know more about how Hunger Games ended.  While good there were parts that were hard to follow.  The story line is very good and will get the final book.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|With these 2 stars I expected soul stirring dialogue. I found interesting dialogue I could identify with. It was a good movie to stream at home.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|perfect for a warm night or two in, the kids have been looking forward to spending a few nights watching the whole series
B00683JK9K|5.0|not a lot of challenge to this but it is still fun to put the peice together and make the puzzles the pictures are beautiful
0684857219|5.0|A lot of photos, exercices and routines.  When you use this book as a reference, you get visible results !!! It is a real Bodybuilding Bible!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I like the idea of engineers as creators, concept present in many religions under the name God/Gods?- who knows...<br />Even though Stephen Hawking warned against aliens,  I would rather expect aliens to be as those seen in &#34;District 9&#34;<br />Waiting for the next part. Must see movie.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie entertained me as much as it did my 8 and 5 year old kids. An all star cast!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book.  Cannot wait till the last of this triology is out.<br />I could not wait to read it every free minute I had.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best game sends tomple run yet.its new and improved!!!!!!!!!best of the best!!!not worst of the worst!!!its bubesty I say bubesty
B00371XIP8|5.0|Worst movie ever made......ever. How can you go from the ever so awesome first Boondock Saints to this? If you watch this it will ruin the greatness of the first one for you. I warned you! Do not rent or buy this movie, you will feel ripped off.
1419703692|5.0|Awesome insight to a great trilogy. One day I would love watching the movies with Goyer/Nolan commentary but this is great in the meantime
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Has some glishes, don't like how u die if u touch water, but game was. free so not bad!! Reminds me a lot of Mario!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I always wanted my own horse but I live like right next to my neighbors. plus I already own one dog and one hermit crab.( I used to have to crabs :( ) anyway the hires are so realistic and I love it. I would not suggest it for older people ( I'm 12) also I would not suggest it for little little kids because it requires some older people thinking.
145210655X|5.0|ITS GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT I really enjoyed it and so should anyone else that likes Starwars! You dont have to be a parent to enjoy it. I'm not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game us cool and keeps busy and you only have to check once a day thanks for creating it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game to add on to the first temple run. lots of new courses like the train tracks and zip line.I do recommend this if you like the first one.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|I collect all the American Pies and didn't want to spend the money to go see it in the theaters. I went and bought this instead of spending that money I now can watch it in my convinces when I want..
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I have never read the book until now, I had only seen different versions made into movies.  The books are generally better than the movies and I wanted to see for myself.  The movies are close to the book but cannot include every detail of the book.  This is a classic good read.
B000AL5OZK|4.0|If Agnetha wanted to sing older rock and roll songs, I believe she should have also considered songs that her singing voice could do justice to.  Example: Total Eclipse of the Heart. I would love to hear her rendition of that song and others that she could reach.  When the songs were being recorded more emphasis should have been on Agnetha rather than the instrumental.  I purchased the album to hear Agnetha sing, not be over whelmed by the instrumental.  Also I wish she done some of the songs in the ABBA mode.  Being as I am a sucker for her, I still believe Agnetha is and was one of the best female singers ever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I expected to get this game and uninstalln it after I got board but when I started playing it I realized that I would never get board. Its so much fun. I would have given it a 5 star reveiw but the only thing I don't like issue that if you run out of gems you have to buy them with really money and a lot of the stuff requiares gems but rather than that I love it. Best game ever
B000NA28HU|4.0|Eragon was a good movie as far as I'm concerned. It's story flowed well and was easy to follow. It is easily suited for all ages and would make a great family movie night.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written, totally believable account (contrary to some reviews). I enjoyed it very much. America owes these brave men a great debt.
0465092756|5.0|This book is one of two that quite properly take modern university and post-university physic study of String Theory to task.  Its thesis is that despite 30 years, and chewing up the effort of most of the world's best and brightest physics majors, String Theory isn't getting anywhere at all - and shows no signs of breaking free.  It's never (despite the name) gotten to be a theory - merely a conjecture.  The sooner it is abandoned (and there is much else in physics still to be investigated) the less shame it will bring on the current corpus of physicists worldwide.<br /><br />I needed Woit to explain what String Theorists claim String Theory to be, before I could understand why it's a loser.  Woit does that too.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This is the very first film I viewd on my new KINDLE FIRE. I really thought it was charming & will rent it again in the future
B008MG1E4A|5.0|i enjoyed reading the book.  it was very interesting in the details it gave of all the missions Mark went on.
1451696191|5.0|I watched movie first and then read the book. I loved both. I recommend the book to anyone over 16.
061891868X|5.0|Smolin fills the holes that Woit (in his book of similar content) leaves.  Together they compose what I consider to be a devastating attack on the self-described discipline of String Theory.  Smolin speaks as an insider - someone who honestly gave String Theory the old college try, and came away convinced that String Theory as it's been formulated over the last 30-or-so years is NOT a productive way of describing the universe.  The most devastating fault is that no-one has been able to propose an experiment that could (if it came out one way) falsify the theory.  If you can't do that - if your hypothesis can't be subjected to that harsh a test, you haven't any strong proof that you've got it right.  Smolin says much else without being snarky, that IMHO ought, taken together, to sink String Theory permanently.
B008PWUWLC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this case! It stands up perfectly with the grippers and it Velcros in so I don't have to worry about it falling out when using it like I did with my old one. The outside fabric is super durable and cute. I would definitely recommend this case and the Timbuk2 brand in general!
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a nice quality product that is going to save you time charging and is much more convenient that plugging in the original cord provided. Great deal with fast delivery.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story.  It's a page turner with tons of twists.  Loved every minute of it.  I would highly recommend it.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I have always loved this movie and being able to rent it on my Kindle was perfect for a long road trip
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The first song made me cry it is so beautiful. I am such a fan of his voice and this CD does not disappoint.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Easy to carry most the stuff that I have, safe to transport and big enough for trips. . . .
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I am extremely happy with my cover and looking forward to traveling with my kindle. I am so happy that you made one to fit my Kindle Fire.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It was good but it was boring.I learned a lots of cool words and definitions.I will use them too.thank you.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|If you put yourself in Alice's place, this is a tough story to read, but it gave me some insight into what is happening to someone I love.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|have I heard music like this. It isn't \\"dark\\" to me like suggested (this is the first album I bought from them). I've been steeped in classical music, listen to pop, alternative, and classic rock and roll and I think the genre of this music is absolutely amazing! Guitars, choirs, orchestras, drums, flutes, chanting, rhythms....angels singing too their lovers who almost gave up looking--poetry in the midst of hate and dark---soldiers who give their all and just when it wasn't enough, they broke free and destroyed the enemy, light overcoming darkness, good reining over evil! These songs, played over and over soothe my rough days and revitalize my own strength. The word to describe this is not dark--it is \\"strength\\". It is strength, confidence, assurance, victory over life's ungrateful diminuendos.<br /><br />I would buy this album for you all if I could afford it.<br /><br />Commercialized / Hollywoodish?<br /><br />My friend. Give me your address, I'll buy your album too.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The great game good example of a game should make a new games just like that and make great ones that that you have
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an amazing roller coaster of emotions. It made me laugh, cry, had my heart racing. The meaning begins the title is truly heart felt. I couldn't get enough. I love the trust and relationship between Sky and Holder!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game and play it everyday, but one thing bothered me the most. it cost 7 stinkin bucks! if amazon lowered the prices on most games like this, they'd have more buyers.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Loved the movie - music- the new Adele 'theme' plus integrating the traditional 'Bond' theme - seemless/'color' & atmosphere - experiencing the world in moody, vivid images. To me it's a  great escape;  even the sadistic betrayer is relatively tastefully done. Love the merging of older generation  and new (Que) finding they can work together, too.All casting done wonderfully, a truley international flavor.  HOWEVER,  I love the 'background' info as much as the movie and I was dissapointed  that this DVD doesn't include 'special features' - that's why  I BUY or GIFT DVD's -  and if I don't hear the commentary or 'outakes', bloopers, etc.  then I'd have to think twice about paying full price! So  even if it's more expensive to begin with, it would be worth it, in the annals ( I spell that right?!) of history. . Long live DVD's!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|oh my gosh just update the kindle version already! I'm tired of waiting! my iphone updated but this one wont come on update the sucker already!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Gained a new perspective on the relationships of past & present presidents. There are some real eye openers about how a sitting present have turned to past presidents for fellowship.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good love story.  I love this book and am excited for the movie which will be out on Valentines Day!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Ethereal, peaceful, beautific, and very typically Sara Mclachlan.  It is a lovely addition to a Christmas music collection and maybe an enjoyable listen anytime.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|My daughters love Taylor Swift.  The deal of the day was $1.99 for the entire RED album.  Can't beat that price anywhere!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Really enjoyed this series. Part of this is due to great acting from the principals and supporting cast. Looking forward to more!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the series and would read them again.  Looking forward to the movie when they come out with it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is a great album. The songs are fresh and modern. The concert was awesome! Go see them live if you can.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|I am so happy with this product,that i purchased one for mom too!  We both are big fans of the rolling stones!  I recommend this cd to anyone!  Greatest rock and roll cd of all times,in my opinion!  Very pleased with the purchase!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Does not have enough information.I like to have hour by hour and radar. What it does is just fine I guess.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I really like the Twilight series.  I saw the movie at the theater and was happy to by the Special Edition Blu-ray.
B005LCECU6|3.0|These songs are from the first album and early versions at that. Not my favorite recording, but it's still Rush.
B005OZ4EVW|5.0|I loved the cd,and the condition in which it came.  It was hand delivered by mailman,because i told him i didnt want him shoving stuff in my mailbox.  I recommended this purchase to friends and through amazon.  very happy with purchase!
B0091REZMW|3.0|its okay but not enough progress in the gameplay.  you run out of energy fairly quickly and the refill rate is slow.  so I can only play once a day.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have read widely since a child and there have been many books I have loved, books that I have read and reread, and that became part of who I am. Almost without exception they have been love stories and they have seldom been great works of literature, with some exceptions of course, like “The Great Gatsby”. The Angelique series, “The Clan of the Cave Bear” series, Helga Moray’s “Untamed” series, Ayn Rand’s books, some of Wilbur Smith’s and Bryce Courtenay’s novels, come to mind. Some have required a suspension of disbelief, like the Harry Potter books – I have never liked fantasy, and have no belief in magic and witchcraft, yet I loved the books and the films and Rowling created a world that has become almost real to so many people, and very much part of our collective consciousness.<br />50 Shades required a similar suspension of disbelief and even of dislike, initially, as I abhor violence of any kind and have no interest in BDSM and its manifestations, and was a little put off by the publicity I had read. Nonetheless, James created a trilogy that, true to the blurb on the back was “romantic, liberating, and totally addictive, …that will  obsess you, possessed you and which will stay with you forever”. She created in Christian a flawed, charismatic hero, redeemed by love, who I was fascinated by, intrigued with and fell in love with. The same holds for many of the other characters in the book. I liked the author’s sense of humour, I wept frequently in all the books, and that ability to move me deeply did not diminish with repeated re-readings – I still cry every time in some of the scenes in which Ana tries to banish his demons. They are so powerfully written, and the love story is so beautiful, so full of passion and emotion that I found myself totally swept away – something that happens only rarely. In that respect perhaps only “Wuthering Heights” comes close.<br />And then there is the sex. I think it is very difficult towrite a good love story that is not soppy. It is even harder to write about sex so that it is erotic, passionate, but not prurient or off-putting. To write about sex for page after page over 3 books is a gift, from which millions of women, and men, around the world, are happily reaping the benefit. Some of the other books that are currently trying to cash in on the trend, claiming to be better than “50 Shades”, like Sylvia Day’s “Bared To You” and various others, are totally derivative, humourless and very crude by comparison and none of them that I have read have the enormous pull of love that underlies every scene.<br />For me, reading the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy has been a joyous, profoundly moving and arousing experience. It has reminded us of emotions and feelings we experienced and things we did years ago and still feel and do, and taught us a few new ones. It is my belief that anyone in a loving relationship, both men and women, would benefit from reading it.
0765325950|5.0|All in all, a good end to amazing series. A pity there won't be more (stories of Tuon and Mat sounded awesome), but such is life.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved the Greek stuff used throughout the whole book, from the centaurs, to the gods,  and even people like Medusa. Sort of like Harry Potter, but made more for younger people like me. I highly recommend this book to all Greek geeks and people looking for a hearty laugh.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book should be made into a movie! It leaves you wanting to read more. Very tough to put down. Highly recommend this to anyone that likes a \\"court room\\" murder mystery! Well written!!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, one of her favorite gifts. She keeps running around and pointing it at things, making the noise. Teenagers!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Everyone enjoyed this movie - kids are 8, 10, and 12 - had them all laughing. The husband even said he liked it!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one, this book had me totally interested throughout the whole book. Amazing! 5 Stars is an understatement!
B001VLXNLU|4.0|Was breath taking. Thrilling. Keep me reading until it was completely done.  Took me 3 days to read it. Great!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Ridiculous mouse<br />A+ quality<br />Beast looks<br />Nar Nar grasp<br />Banger features<br />T h a n k s a m a z o n
0345529057|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing series that I suggest everyone read. If you like the show, you will like the books so much more! Really really great. And they shipped well too! They were all in perfect condition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not my normal fair.  When I started to read it I found myself getting more engrossed in the characters and I was hooked after the fourth chapter.  Easy to read and couldn't put it down.  Look forward to the other two books now
B00136JS12|5.0|Very good tracks, has my favorite ones on it. I love \\"More Then A Feeling\\"! All of the tracks are worth listening too.
B0087UN94E|4.0|DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BUT I ENJOYED THIS ALBUM.IT'S NOT 'ZUMA' BUT IT'S OK.HEY NEIL WHEN'S 'ARCHIVES 2' COMING OUT?????????A LOT OF US ARE STARTING TO SEE DEAD RELATIVES,COME ON ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie is great! The acting is wonderful (the cast is amazing!) and it actually has a really good storyline. I have watched it multiple times and I always recommend it to my friends!
0765325950|5.0|If this was the First Book in the series, I would have still bought them all.  You could probably even just read this one and be satisfied - but if you've got them, read the whole thing again first - extremely good reads all.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|i hate the product it broken so easy in in two weeks afert the purchaser, noises, no clear voice by phone.
B000SINT52|5.0|Michael Moore does it again.  He gets to the heart of the matter.  Afraid of no one, he tells it like it is.  I recommend anything done by Michael Moore.  Also purchased the Awful Truth.  Calling out the bad guys with guts and humor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Works really well sometimes it goes pretty slow but over all is great<br />G r e a t  a w e s o m e
0307476464|5.0|I've never read anything by Haruki Murakami before, so I didn't have any preconceived expectations. I bought it because at the bookstore, everywhere in the book I looked, the writing was excellent. The story was very unusual, but I've read a lot of science fiction and some fantasy in my 74 years (only the best), so I could handle the fantasy aspect of it. Haruki Murakami is one of the best writers I've ever read (and I only read the best of any genre (the rest I discard)). It's amazing how good he is. He must be brilliant to begin with. If you can say to yourself, \\"Sure, there could be Little People who secretly weave an Air Chrysalis and who can know and control more than we thought possible,\\" then you should be swept away by this wonderfully long novel.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|it works. I wish you would have put it in the box to begin with. What a hassle this was
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Mitch Rapp, a get it done guy.  I love seeing the bad guys get their just rewards. Vince Flynn did it again.
B003M7BLOW|4.0|Works great, stock cpu fan included keeps is cool at idle 23c, and hasn't went over 45c. This is well worth the money!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love it but I payed 5 bucks for money to get the monkey lair and it only upgraded 1 out of 4 upgrades so if you want to get the monkey lair you will have to pay 20 bucks to get the whole thing
B0054JZC6E|5.0|epic you have a lot of games to choose from and never get boring its a fact well that is just my opinion
0872860175|4.0|for daughter. I can only say that the service and price were good. I bought it as a gift for my daughter
B001NHNG64|4.0|Suspenseful. The book was my first read by Lee Child and inspired me to buy Tripwire (which was a disappointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game me and my friends love to play it together and beat each other's high scores!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Season 5 is just as interesting as the previous seasons!  I can't get enough 'Mad Men'.... Hope they do a Season 6!
0062124293|4.0|have not read yet- great price- great deal i am looking forward to reading this. i will review again later- good price and service
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is an absolutely love this game because if you dont have your own pets then this would be perfect because you are caring for an animal of your own x
B008CJ0KEM|3.0|I fell in love with this show once I discovered it, couldn't stop watching and bought both seasons before I finished the second season. I want more of this show, but the menu is poorly put together and the extras leave something to desire mostly a play all button.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Douglas Preston combines all the elements of a major writing and reading experience to his story. He, however, uses some unique blocks of writing that keep his readers in suspense and surprise. It is well worth picking up, though very hard to put down.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is one of Nicholas Sparks' best books.  Of course, I like all of his books and have only a few to<br />read to complete the whole collection!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I liked the first two movies which were excellent blu ray installments although a little to long. This movie was a watch checker...as in checking your watch every 10 minutes hoping that it would end. The action scenes and sound effects were great but longer is not always better. These type of movies would be better served to be around 100 minutes. Here is a music analogy for the metal heads out there. Remember the long songs on And Justice For All that dragged on and on for like 9 minutes. This was like that. I especially did not like the set up for the next movie which at this point I can say that I have very little confidence in. As far as the specs, excellent picture and sound with great low end rumbles. Unfortunately this movie is not up to par.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|The presentation is excellent, as expected, however I was most impressed with the credits/attendance at the end of the production. After the normal curtain calls by the members of this cast, Andrew Lloyd Webber was the acting MC, and he first lauded the members of the original production who were brought onstage.  Others who were instrumental in the productions also appeared on stage.  Then the men who had played the role of Phantom in earlier stagings were introduced, and with the backing of Sarah Brightwell, a former Christine and Webber's ex-wife, singing one of the melodies, each of the former Phantoms sang a few bars of the songs from the show.  They were joined by members of the original cast and it made for a delightful end of the show/DVD presentation.  The live audience as well as this reviewer found it much more interesting than the usual curtain calls.  When the music is as beautiful and elegant as that from Phantom, it appeared that it had not been forgotten by any of the former cast members.
B008P76UKE|5.0|At one time, I was a bit snobbish about this, e.g. then (and still) available on Telarc CD, preferring the &#34;real thing&#34;. However, the &#34;real thing&#34; is exceedingly long. In this piece on Blu-ray Disc, the sound is in excellent DTS HD Master audio 5.1 lossless audio. The video is well done for a classical concert video. Wagner's Ring has been reduced to a synopsis of the greater works, and is quite nice music as a distillation of the broad sweep of the original operas. The operas that make up Wagner's Ring are of course MUCH longer and have the complete musical themes and all the music, not to mention the words and story. Still, this is, especially in this fine lossless BD format and performance, an excellent listen and a fine concert video of classical music.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Such an amazing movie. The casting was fantastic, I was completely mesmerized by the performances, and it is just an overall masterpiece. I almost didn't watch it because it only has 3.4/5 stars, which is CRAZY, because this movie is amazing.<br />This movie is pretty weird though, and maybe that's why some people didn't like it too much. But I loved the strangeness of the movie.. so I guess it just depends on the person. Also, I think this is understood with it being rated R, but it is NOT a family/ okay for kids movie.
B0000029LG|4.0|Sound quality of Disc 2 makes me very disappointed and unhappy to hear like it`s been pirate copied in the amateur homestudio.Every song of Disc2 sounds so flat,seems not like Michael Jackson`s quality approval!!Disc 1 sounds perfectly deep and crystal clear as Michael had hands on while recording as he used to do.Disc 1 sound quality seems the original one to me.For Michael`s fans and admirers this HIStory book 1 is worth to have in MJJCollection because there was 1 and only song that Michael rapped under his lång carrier and it called `Money`He did the whole song very well and very different from the others and it became one of my favorites!
B001N26GFM|5.0|Yes a lot of movies are out there on the Holocaust. When I told some friends about this movie they just rolled their eyes and said &#34;oh another one.&#34; But truly this is a MUST watch movie. It's so humain, very well filmed and the message is so poignant. It can be related to any injustice and war. The end and the message is very strong.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham not only is an outstanding story maker and teller but is an acute analyst of human behavior.He is so true in his protagonist mental analysis that it makes the reader smile with contrite approbation.The style is fluid and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.I rank it among his best.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|This is a classic that we have got to have, and here it is for an affordable price. Good sound.
B009369Z8A|1.0|I'm laughing as I write this.  Sooooo Baaaad (*insert mile-long groan here)  I honestly can think of NO reason for my worst enemy to suffer this blight on cinema.  Gary Oldman is cool and all but he's in it so briefly that he becomes another symptom the empty promise that is LAWLESS.  It's movie seriously ridiculous.  Friends have called me from all corners of this great nation to confirm this theory.  Eeee gads!  LAWLESS is a horror show of stinky acting, painful premise and nausiating filmmaking - if you can call it that.  In fact, lets start with with the direction of this travesty.<br />The director - I have no interest in learning his name after LAWLESS - must have really thought of himself as a serious filmmaker because of the \\"symbolic\\" shots of roosters in the yard after the jacked-up macho brothers fight, or the shot of the horses running in the fields when the two lovers drive off on their date together...NEED I SAY MORE?<br /><br />Now lets talk acting.<br /><br />(I say what I say with love - because there are a lot of brilliant actors in this movie. They were just given a lame script and a fourteen year old director who apparently thought his mind was expanding.  I pity that situation - however endorsed by Hollywood it may be.  The victims are the actors every time.)<br />Yet Tom Hardy might be a little culpable.<br />Tom Hardy... What movie were you in?? You were off on your own planet!  Did you read in the script that your character was the hard-as-nails older brother and thought that you'd been given permission to be as superior and distant as you wanted? Seriously, man. Your grumbling voice was so much more believable when you had a mask covering your face in Batman.  There was no connection to your fellow actors which may have been an \\"artistic choice\\" but you need to at least know what the other actors are doing so you can look like you belong in the same movie!!  Eee gads!<br /><br />I don't even have the heart to continue with this review. For one reason, I saw it last spring and I've tried to shut it out completely.  Suffice to say it was hands down THE WORST FILM I HAVE SEEN IN THE THEATER IN A LONG TIME.  As for the plot: If you want to see a bunch of ignorant hillbilly bootleggers pretending to be gangsters but whose story goes NOWHERE by all means, fire away.  I would suggest assuming this movie is as bad as I say and spending your hard-earned money on something that isn't the artistic equivalent of an erupted cyst.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|If you like BBC documentaries, you'll love this one. A must see. The narration is as lovely as the footage and filming.
B007THA4FI|1.0|so boring tedious. If you love Downton Abby skip this. If these characters were in my life I would not want to wake up.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Not enough action....predictable and boring.  Not like his<br />other Bond movies.  He looked tired and exhausted.  Plus,<br />he is getting OLD, with gray hair.  Time to retire.  Still<br />has a tough looking body.  Not enough gadgets.  A<br />gun that will only shoot when he handles it and what<br />happens when the battery goes dead?  Ops!  That was<br />the only gadget, plus a transmitter, not a radio.  It<br />sends, not receive.  People like an older 'Q', not some<br />young kid.  I've seen this movie before, years ago.<br />THis is a re-release of some older Bond movie.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|My son said it was very good product and he was right i love it.!!!! and will let all my friends know
B000FC12SM|5.0|For years I avoided readying this book. When it was a big hit years ago, I felt it was for old bored women.<br />I picked it up when my mom told me to read it. She said it helped her understand her failed marriage with my dad.<br /><br />Many of the information mentioned in this book is known or common sense. But the way it is explained and organized makes so much sense. It's also funny especially when you identify with examples Gray uses. It's a fun, easy read that will get men and women thinking. It gets the reader a little closer in understanding the opposite sex.<br /><br />The only tip Gray doesn't give is how to get men to pick up this book!! Would love my husband to read it, but it doesn't seem that's going to happen.<br /><br />enjoy!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The whole family loved it. No one will be disappointed. Plus it's great having season 1 & 2 in the same set.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|My grandson introduced Diana Krall to me, knowing how much I love good jazz.  This cd is particularly wonderful for those of us who remember many  ofthe classics, done refreshingly well by  this excellent musician and her accompanists.
B000005J56|5.0|This CD is classic Cuban music. The instruments in this music are amazing. This is a classic big band CD with some great tunes.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|As a fan and player of hidden object games for many years,  I found this game almost perfect.  The four stars are for the great graphics, story line and well done hidden object scenes.  I like it when the objects are well incorporated in the scene and not just thrown in an obvious pile that takes a few seconds to finish. It adds to the entertainment value. The zoom could be a bit bigger. I haven't played very far, so I haven't seen any mini games yet. The quality could add another star or not. This game plays well on my Kindle Fire and the download was effortless.  Keep bringing us games of this quality.
142311339X|5.0|Definitely our most favorite book and author. All of Rick Riordan's books are good but this whole &#34;Heroes of olympus&#34; series is the best. Great for adults and kids.
B007V4530A|5.0|I found this book a week before giving a talk on &#34;The Hard Work of Managing Innovation.&#34; After reading several chapters, I totally restructured the speech. The book is written in lively prose and provides many examples of great TED talks to illustrate the main points. This book is a great value.
0525953728|5.0|Wow. I am not a person lead to reading this type of book, but I was impressed by the men in this action.<br />The length  and depth of training ,the dedication to what they do is captivating.<br /><br />I admire and appreciate what these individuals have gone through for the safety of our Country.<br /><br />This is a Very highly recommended read.
0399246665|5.0|absolutely love this. very interactive and simple enough for young infants starting at 3 months who are attracted to the bright colors.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I enjoyed this book, i read it because i enjoyed first book and thoroughly enjoyed it!!! It kept me wanting to read the whole time. It was hard to put the book down
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I did enjoy reading this book. The main character is fantastic and his friends are hilarious. The whole story was captivating and I liked how the author connected different times, places and people to design the story. I laughed a lot, and I was kind of sad when I finished the book (Allan is one of a kind!)
B0080K3G4O|5.0|Logical research, and hard not to wonder about you own behavior.<br />Great writing.<br />I  enjoyed his humor.<br />Worthy of a second read.
B000P7V45S|5.0|In 1975 Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford, and Phil Collins put together a Steve Hackett solo album called [[ASIN:B000TERIW0 Voyage Of The Acolyte]]Phil Collins sings Star of Sirius, plays drums, while Mike Rutherford writes and plays bass, including a lost Hackett/Rutherford classic Shadow of the Hierophant. It's basically the lost Genesis album, and A Trick of The Tail picks up where that left off.
1250006341|5.0|This book is a must-have for Downton Abbey fans! It has gorgeous pictures and also historical facts from the time period. And of course, interesting &#34;behind the scenes&#34; info from Julian Fellows, the creator of Downton Abbey!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game, but unfortunately about every couple of days it will stop working and refuse to even open. This has happen around 7 times and it really annoying because then I have to redownload it and start over. Don't freak out after reading this, this is an awesome game and who knows this problem could be limited to my kindle. I just figured I should but this out there so others know.
0345505387|1.0|I throughly enjoyed the Outlander series, but this is a disaster as far as I am concerned.  I would not even give this to someone I didn't like.
B0067TQQI8|2.0|The battery is well constructed and retains a charge well.  Unfortunately, the connectors are of exceedingly poor quality.  They soon become too loose to remain connected to my Droid Bionic smartphone.  I end up having to prop the phone in such a way so as to ensure that the connector does not slip out of the phone.  This makes it impossible to carry the battery, connected to my phone, in a briefcase or purse.<br /><br />Update:  The Anker company did contact me and offered to refund the approximately $3.50 I spent to buy a better micro-USB connector.  Although I advised them that that was not necessary, they went ahead and credited my Amazon account with $4.00.  That's fine and appreciated; their product will do well to improve their connectors.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I have never read Gillian Flynn before and really enjoyed this book, quite a page turner, written from both sides of the marriage. It will create doubt and keep you guessing.  Good enough for me to purchase another of her books, hope it's as good as this one
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Enjoy this game in my downtime however some things are too expensive or are too difficult to achieve for how little they are...
0385340540|4.0|John Grisham is a very good author, I need not tell you, I enjoy his booksvery much, but I think some of them are a shade better than this one.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|We saw this in theaters and loved it so much we decided to purchase it!  The writing is very good, and true to the characters, the acting is wonderful and the effects were truly spectacular.  If you need a good laugh I would recommend the movie.  If you like Robert Downey Jr. I would highly recommend it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It was easy to use and was great to have as I compared the different products as I went from store to store.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A real cliff hanger.  The story twists and turns just when you think you have the characters figured out.  Read this book if you like suspense and mind games.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|It has got soothing music and the graphics are nice.  It is a relaxing way to spend time while waiting for your food at a restaurant or the laundry to finish drying or.....
B005721Y7Y|4.0|This film makes me want to have my midlife crisis, and I'm only 31. Kevin Spacey makes it look like so much fun!
0307891402|5.0|i got this as a gift to a co-worker of mine that loves skyrim and he absolutely maxxed out the game because of this guide.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|One book I have read and re-read over and over again. It is one of the best Novels that inspires the Allusive King Arthur and shows how crazy his wife  was to change all that he believed in. It is sad too due to the use of the maidens on the Isle of Avalon, but it does give a good look at the celebration of the Old religions. I really loved this book and will probably read it again as each time you do you hear something that you missed.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|Item arrived expertly packaged and on time. Was exactly as described. If you loved the music in the movie, you will love this soundtrack!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I am deleting this from my kindle. I thought it would be fun, brcause I have enjoyed the movies so much, but it was boring.
B0076YULRU|5.0|the amplifier does that. it amplifies the music to where you can hear a significant boost. great product. i recommend it.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Very hard to follow, can only read for a short time and have to put it down. Just can't get into it
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Item arrived expertly packaged and on time. Was exactly as described. I have watched this so many times I am afraid I am going to wear out the Blu-ray...luckily it comes with a DVD also! The extras on this set are a great compliment and provide a bigger picture of what is actually going on in the movie.
B00005N5RM|5.0|Ok, so it's not the Steve McQueen version, but this is still a great movie! It does take gore to a new level, so I don't recommend watching it during dinner. For the most part, it followed the plot of the original, but then changes from an alien, to something more terrestrial and sinister. The plot then deteriorates to the ol' &#34;Government Cover-Up&#34;.... Oh well, you can't have everything. Still, the effects of this movie make it worth watching. The cover shows what Shawnee Smith (Meg) runs into when she attempts to assist her boyfriend. She saved at least a part of him, but the Blob got the rest. The scariest aspect of this movie is how it ends with the crazed minister, and his sermon about Judgement Day - very alarming....looks like he has a little pet....
B004OEIL54|4.0|Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox star in Wes Craven's<br />1996 horror film. A girl and her friends are stalked by a psychotic killer<br />obsessed with scary movies. Along with \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street,\\"<br />this is definitely one of Craven's best with a great cast that redefined<br />the horror genre. This blu-ray has good picture and sound plus some<br />neat extras. I recommend this.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Was an ok easy read.hard to believe it is a true story. Can't wait to see the movie. Happy reading
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition, and I really enjoyed watching it. My cat even enjoyed watching it with me, now how cute is that?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Only wish the DVDs came with a digital copy so I could take the stories with me on my iPad.
B004OEIL5O|3.0|Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox star in Wes Craven's<br />2000 horror sequel. A young woman is brought of hiding by a crazed<br />killer trying to make a real concluding trilogy chapter. This isn't bad,<br />but not as good as the first 2 films. This blu-ray has nice picture<br />and sound plus some neat extras. I still recommend this.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was so incredibly obsessed with finishing this book I kept forgetting to breathe while I read. It was incredibly vivid and intense. There were so many turn of events in my guessing what would happen next, it was a great book. Dark, graphic,sweet and yet provocative, I loved it.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I was never a real big pinball fan, but I decided to give this app a try.  I really enjoy playing this game.  I like all the sounds and action with it.  I would recommend it to anyone who has some time on their hands.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever this game is so addicting I am always playing this game  only thong about is those missions never can pass them sometimes I cheat and just pay
B004OEIL5E|4.0|Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox star in Wes<br />Craven's 1997 horror sequel. A girl is targeted by a copycat<br />killer trying to make a real-life horror sequel. This is a good<br />sequel that should've been the last. This blu-ray has nice<br />picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.
B0086221SS|5.0|Love this movie it is a real down to earth film.<br />All actors and actresses play there part very well.<br />I really enjoyed it and would defiantly recommend it.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|Do you like mindless button mashing mixed with awful controls? Do you like to fire arrows in every direction, except at your enemies? Then this shallow, poorly coded game is for you!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great mystery suspense novel; just when you thought you sort of had it figured out, we'll, you didn't. And then you didn't, again. Fast paced writing. Descriptive in a concise way, without all those tedious little details. I loved the fact that the author chose to tell the story from both the main character's perspectives. It kept you thinking. I immediately downloaded Dark Places when I was finished (can't put that one down either).
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the most terrifying app ever. It's so scary. I think I twinkled a few times. Vert scary app.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is really spectacular.  Easy to use and clearer than on the computer.  I love playing it on my Kindle
B000YMM3CC|5.0|The ending is sad.  However, it ends just the way it should end.  And in a weird way, you feel comfort in knowing that.<br /><br />I must say, Ryan Gosling is a superb actor.  You would think this would have been a difficult character for him to play as he was definately out of his element.  However, he played the character flawlessly.  In fact, the performances of all the actors were great.<br /><br />A beautiful love story, coupled with the most powerful music I have ever heard in a movie, and you have the makings of the best love story of all time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The turn of events were amazing. Secrets kept unraveling throughout the entire book. There was never a dull moment from start to finish. This book was mysterious!
B00992CF6W|3.0|For some reason I cannot join a game on my kindle fire for minecraft pocket edition v 0.6.1 I don't know why so maybe some one could inform me<br />On what I have to so to play multiplayer

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a very fun game but it takes a long time to get a lot of coins and it takes long to get new games.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|So I went to see this on opening night with friends and being one of maybe ten guys in the theater I had a blast.  If you are looking for a plot - STOP!  Grab your favorite adult beverage and kick back.  The bods are hot, the dancing is hotter, have plenty of ice in your beverage - you'll need it.  I promise your husband, boyfriend, piece on the side, butcher, baker and candlestick maker will be glad you watched it too!  That goes for you women too!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was a great read! It's hard for me to sit down and read for a few hours but this book was an exception. It had love, suspense, mystery, and comfort all in one! I would definitely recommend reading the book before the movie comes out on Valentines day!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|PLEASE  enable the ability to EXCLUDE individual  ppl from seeing statuses (ie, custom setting). The &quot;lists&quot; option really sucks  especially b/c you can only pick one group at a time

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartbreaking yet inspiring. The characters are well developed. I felt like I really knew these kids. Don't let the fact that it's a YA novel stop you from reading this book.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Decent story line but not very descriptive.  I've read better fiction than this.  Didn't read the first book, maybe it was better cause this one was mediocre at best...
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son so I can't say anything about the movie. I had it shipped to another address and there was no problem or mix up. It arrived quickly and was as advertised.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book catches the reader and doesn't let go. The ending did not disappoint. If you like smart suspense, this books for you.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a very good book. I definitely think the author should write more Percy Jackson books. After I read this book I started reading it to my little brother, and he seems to enjoy it too.

1616550414|5.0|Even tough the book seems to focus more in Skyward Sword, there are many other features that will satisfy any fan. Great price value by the way.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a quick read and never had a dull moment. You think you know who the hero is, but the book flips you around several times, in a good way. Didn't care for the ending but would still recommend for those who like a mystery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The is great for on the go building.I am a big fan of minecraft and when I first got my kindle fire HD ,it was the first game I got. It has some bad things like small maps but hey it's an app. About  two days ago an update came put when they added new features like clouds, nether bricks,stone cutters , ARMOR,quartz<br />And other features too that you might want to check out. Hopefully in the future it will be like real minecraft. The big thing they need to change is for you to be able to change from creative mode to survival instead of making the same worlds with different modes . So really this is the best game EVERRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :)
B00ARFEQ80|5.0|This product is great. I am over satisfied with the steel book's cover art. The movie was good, but personally it could have been a little less predictable of a film. The movie left you hanging (drop like a bomb) so I hope that they will continue the series or at least end this great saga. Great cast, A+ CGI effects, great acting, different from other resident evil films. All are good but each is a little different.

B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Thought it was very good although you definitely have to read the previous book first or this book would not make sense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game.I love it,but why Don't you match the music with the places in the world tour.Also,show other people or settings in the game.
0547572298|5.0|Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick has imagined a world of the future in which those who die, if they are frozen quickly after death, can be kept in \\"half-life\\" for a period of time and can communicate with loved ones through the use of a \\"protophason amplifier.\\" In this future, some people have developed strong psychic powers, many working for a company that specializes in sending psychics into businesses to be spies. To protect businesses by counteracting the psychics, \\"prudence organizations\\" employ people who can sense psychic activity and ferret out the snoopers.<br /><br />Thus enters Glen Runciter, owner of the foremost prudence organization; his wife Ella, who is in half-life; and Joe Chip, his second-in-command. The company receives a big job on Luna, taking 11 psychic-sensors along, only to be caught in an ambush staged by its psychic competitors. And Glen Runciter is killed, or is he? Everyone else lives and escape back to earth, but then time begins to shift for the 11 survivors, sometimes with disastrous results. And they keep receiving cryptic messages from their dead boss, sometimes written on bathroom walls. Just what is going on here?<br /><br />This is not your standard sci-fi novel, needless to say. \\"Ubik\\" is short for \\"ubiquitous\\"--existing or being everywhere at the same time. In the novel it is a product which can be used for almost anything, including an aerosol spray that can halt the killing effects of time-shift. Questions are raised here about the nature of reality and belief, and the reader thinks he has received the answer to the puzzle, until the last chapter. Then, oops, maybe all that was the wrong answer.<br /><br />Science fiction is often dismissed when critics are choosing \\"great\\" novels, probably because it tends to be formulaic. Even though his chosen genre was science fiction, Phillip K. Dick didn't always follow the rules. This novel is funny; it gives you some philosophical matters to think about; it keeps you riveted to find out what happens next; its main character is engaging. It is well worth your time even if you are not a sci-fi fan. Highly recommended.
B00280LYIM|1.0|I love the Percy Jackson books and this is by far the best one!!! Can't wait to start The Last Olympian!!!
B000003CUJ|5.0|If you love great music and Wagner but don't have time for the entire Ring - this is perfect!  Very well done, rich sound, just all around excellent !

B005GG0MIS|5.0|You learn something new on every page of this book.  It's always fun to get a peak behind the curtain.  Some of the presidents' relationships, or lack thereof, were very surprising.
B00979CS50|5.0|Great album. This is what we have needed from Neil Young for a long time.  Crazy Horse is outstanding in this work.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was very well written.  It discussed the German pilot's experiences and never really glorified his combat.  The best part was that he told a story of chafing under Nazi suspicion.  As they fought and died for Germany, Goering and Hitler constantly baited the fighter airman, accusing them of cowardice.  This was for several reasons, among which I believe was to provide a scapegoat to the people who were being bombed and for failures of the infantry as they were defeated in battle.  I know that in the years shortly after the war many people denied thier nazi beliefs and party membership.  However, the author states over and over that few pilots were in the nazi party and most viewed them as buffoons.  I believe this to be true.  A great read and very interesting!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire helps me at night when I cannot sleep.  After playing for a while I will get tired.<br />It is good for the brain
B001JIHGO0|5.0|If they cut corners making this movie you won't beable to tell it from the finished product. Special effects were fantastic, and gave me goose bumps. Vampire movie must see!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Christopher Nolan doesn't disappoint.  The only issue I have with his movies is that he is always trying to cover up who are the bad guys and the good guys.  I love a good surprise when a character turns, but when I watch Nolan's movies, I already know to expect it.  And what happens is that I don't form any bonds with any of the characters.  I don't want to get invested into liking or disliking a character when I know Nolan is probably going to do a 360 on my emotions.  Anyway, that's more of a review about Nolan's overused motives.  If you haven't seen much of his work, then this movie is a great, action-packed movie about a superhero.  Enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not sure? I spent the whole of a Saturday and Sunday watching season 3 of Downton Abbey.<br /><br />Do I really have to hang on until January 2014 for my next fix?
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Had to read this book for a workshop I was taking and was very skeptical.  But, it had changed the way I think and react to things.  I wish I'd had it back in grade school.  An amazing book.
B003RV43X4|4.0|Really fun special effects and follows the story line sort of of original movie. I did enjoy it and was tickeled they showed the golden owl from the first movie for a brief moment in this one even though it was a none working version in a box of junk.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very,very good tv great acting and writing is excellent!!! I'm so thankful that you offer this program and I &#34;found&#34; it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Downloaded this onto my kindle before vacation. Loved it!  John Grisham is such a great author.  Ending was awesome! Worth the read!
0316069434|3.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, but this wasn't one of his best efforts.  It kept me turning the pages, but I wasn't impressed with the storyline or the ending.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. makes for the perfect Sherlock homes in this movie. And the movie sets were so well done you just fell into the whole story from beginning to end.
B000NA22C6|5.0|Great price and quick ship!<br />Have seen the movie before, I just wanted to add it to my collection. blue ray was a bonus.
B007UZO3F6|5.0|I bought this for my plex media serving needs with an i7 and 16GB 2x8GB ram. No video card at the moment but should be ready for high-end gaming with its 500 watts psu. Hopefully the video card prices will drop when I need it. Will recommend!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a great story of an innocent man (Tim Robbins) that is sentenced to 2 life terms in prison and his struggle to keep his dignity.  The ending is what makes the movie.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|We watch everything about the golden years, Henry the 8th, absolutely anything from those times. This was a beautifully made movie of the time.Costumes were authentic looking, and the acting was Great. If you enjoy this genre it's a must see.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Can't stop watching this show. It completely drags our family in and we just can't stop watching. Of course, this show is not for young children.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very suspensful. sparks kept me ready for more throughout! I thoroughly enjoyed it, just like all of Sparks' previous novels.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is Diana's fourth book in this series of 8 books. Going from the past to present keeps the reader's on edge. Would recommend that the reader read the first three books before reading the Drums of Autumn.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Julian Lennon recommended this group sometime before or around the holidays. Luv everything about them. They have the home feel of galssgow in their sound. Voice, music sound and arrangement is my type of sound. Makes me miss some things I once knew! cheers, de lamb

B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love playing with this app. It's fun and works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I haven't noticed any problems with it, or anything obvious missing. =)
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It is unbelievable what this person went through to stay alive.  It shows that human beings have such a will to live, they can  survive the harshest of conditions.  It also shows how evil some can be to their fellow man.  It makes one wonder, what do the evil ones gain from this horror against mankind.  Camp 14 is well worth the read and makes one thank God that we live in the Great U. S. A. but  also makes one wonder why God allows this to happen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!!! I recommend to everyone who's looking for a book that makes you think about life, that makes you laugh and makes you cry, and that is going to change the way you think about society, about life and about what's important to you! It is a great story and I would like to congratulate Suzanne Collins and thank her for this amazing series!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Amazing book. Must read before seeing the movies. Heart warming and funny but also a real tear jerker. Highly recommend reading this book

0345525558|5.0|This book follows the story of a young girl who has been stumbling through life. I was not able to put this book down so it did not take me long. Even though the story is not always a happy one it satisfied the reader and was more dynamic filled with surprises and unexpected moments. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone!

030758660X|5.0|I loved the fun patterns in this book. The only one that didn't peak my interest was the corset which was a little too much work for something that really didn't have a lot of sex appeal.
B008MEM24S|1.0|even 99c is a waste of money it crashes a lot do not get this app. It does not work at all
B005OGS5BG|5.0|All jokes aside, this movie is truly inspirational. I know that is going to sound hard to believe if you haven't seen the movie before but it has an incredible story underneath the jokes and gags. I recently watched this movie with my younger siblings as they had never seen it before and my sister enjoyed it even though she considers herself more of \\"Tom boy\\". Even though it is becoming a bit dated it is still one of my favorite movies!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Yet again another tear jerker. First few chapters are hard to read,but I feel that way about most books. Great story of love and hope! Now I can't wait to see the movie!
1401322786|4.0|The novel (with 81 short chapters) was structured with three divergent storylines.  One back in Biblical times and two people (an old man and a teenaged girl) today.  I wondered how these three very different people could even meet, let alone be woven together.<br /><br />Dor is very unusual in his village. He doesn't want to farm or to fight; he would rather spend his days counting, be it the passage of the sun through a day or drops of water as they drip from one bowl to another.  He is a dreamer.  He is visionary.  The only person who can bring him out of his contemplative reverie is his love, Ali.  He promises to shower her with silver, but of course, he isn't able to.  But, silver is not important to Ali.  She just wants to spend her time with Dor.  After being exiled by his childhood friend and King, Nim (of the Tower of Babel fame) for not agreeing to work for him, Dor and Ali. relocate and create an isolated life for themselves while leaving their three children behind with relatives.<br /><br />Later Dor promises to stop time for a now dying Ali, he finds that one must be careful of what one's wishes for.  He is Father Time and lives many a millennium trapped in a cave that only allows him to hear the pleas of people who wish to control Time themselves.  He is taxed with helping two people; one who wishes for time to stop and one who wishes for it to go on forever.<br /><br />This is where Victor, one of the world's most wealthiest men and Sara, a very intelligent, yet alienated senior in high school come in.  We follow both of their story lines and are not sure which story is more compelling.  We feel for Sara as she falls in love with someone so out of her sphere that we can all foretell the massive crash her falling heart will suffer.  Victor, on his last lap, has one month left to live.  He is the person most used to being in control and wants to have dominion over death and time-no matter the cost. He has \\"a plan.\\" He has \\"paperwork.\\" He wants to engineer the best deal of his life or afterlife you might say.<br /><br />All three characters collide on a cold and snowy evening when Dor realizes that he must act and step out from just being an observer.  These two people need him, even if they don't know it yet.  Dor was such an interesting character since he learned as much (if not even more) as Victor and Sara did about Life, Death,  Time and Love.  It is all about perspective.  It is all about giving up control.<br /><br />I liked how Albom manipulated time in the novel and the symbol of the hourglass as representative of when the earth and the sky meet.  I'm glad that I won't have to be a recluse in a quiet hermitage to learn that \\"Time flies when I'm with you.\\"  Finally, excuse the cliche', but this novel is truly timeless in the life lessons it teaches and we need to sit up and pay attention.  Especially when we only have one chance (unlike these three characters) to get it right.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was a book well written by an author who must have lived or knew someone who had this life style.  I can't imagine how an author of McCourt's intelligence could have written such a book.  I'm anxious to read Tis now. I can't say enough about the intelligence it took to write such a book.

0446402389|4.0|The first 1/3rd of this book is positively gripping as Smith paints a terrifying and believable picture of life in Stalinist Russia where absolute devotion to the state, or at least the appearance of such, is essential for survival. If one questions the official party line on anything, or shows the slightest hint that they value something or someone more than Mother Russia, that person is labeled a dissident.  Once that happens it's only a matter of time until MGB security forces knock down that person's door, arrest them, and put them through a tortuous interrogation.  Some are shipped to Siberian gulags while the rest are summarily executed....and its unclear which of the two outcomes is less cruel.  The books protagonist, Leo, starts out as a valuable cog in the MGB security machine, ruthless and efficient in his duties.  A crisis of conscious, however, leads to the machine turning against Leo and his wife, Raisa.<br /><br />For some inexplicable reason Leo and Raisa avoid both execution and the gulags. Instead they are relocated to an industrial town far from their comfortable existence in Moscow where Leo must take a demeaning entry level position in the local militia.  It is here where he discovers evidence of a serial murderer on the loose and he becomes obsessed with finding the killer.  This is a direct affront to the state which has already convicted various individuals for many of the deaths.  The mere suggestion that the state had sentenced an innocent person is considered seditious.  Around this point the book becomes more formulaic.  The uncharacteristically generous decision to relocate Leo and Raisa instead of sentencing them to prison camp or death is but the first of numerous implausible breaks, escapes, and getaways which fill the second half. Leo and Raisa's previously loveless marriage goes from the brink of homicide to true devotion in a matter of weeks. Leo is transformed from one who slavishly serves the state to a man who wants to do what'sbest for the people; it's as if the Sheriff of Nottingham himself turns into Robyn Hood. The murderer's identity is revealed well before the end of the book and the final climactic confrontation is a bit of a dud. From there the numerous loose ends are hastily tidied up in a matter of a few pages.<br /><br />It's not that the second half of the book isn't entertaining because it is.  It just doesn't measure up to the foundation laid in the opening pages.  Almost everything that happens in the first 150 or so pages is completely believable.  Much of what happens later isn't.  This book could have been an all-time classic had the writer stuck with the subtle and engrossing realism of the beginning and had Leo been allowed to remain a complex and conflicted character.  As it is, the book has a 5 star beginning and a 3 star finish and thus earns a 4 star rating overall.
030758836X|1.0|I really do not understand the hype. This is a story full of unlikable (and one-dimensional) characters doing ridiculous things, and the ending was awful.<br /><br />The only \\"wrinkle\\" was the \\"unreliable narrator\\" aspect, which (for me at least) was obvious from the start.<br /><br />Thriller? Nope. Suspenseful? Not really.<br /><br />The only reason I kept reading was to see how Flynn was going to cleverly tie up the loose ends - and then she didn't.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The book is amazing and hard to put down.  Tom Clancy writng as I have always enjoyed him.  It is worth the time to read.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this to carry my new DSLR camera on a weeklong themepark vacation.  It was great because it kept my camera secure and allowed me to pack other needed items as well.  Very glad I purchased this.  I did also purchase a smaller bag for the same camera because it is a little bulky to take when I don't need to pack everything.  It holds a lot and is very padded inside.  You are able to change the storage sections to the size that you need as well.  Good sturdy bag.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Having lived in Ann Arbor during late 60's and early 70's in close proximity to Detroit and being fairly familiar with the local Detroit music scene at the time, the movie was an eye opener and a fascinating story.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I enjoyed learning about her experience and appreciated her whole-hearted attempts at explaining and describing what she came back with.  I felt her strong desire to give us as much as words could allow but I found myself feeling that she had not been one who previously was very open and descriptive with her feelings and that lack of background left her words a little emotionally flat for me.  So, it left me wanting to finish it because I wanted to learn from her, yet I had to take many breaks because I'm used to more emotional depth of words.  Her feelings were certainly there...I could feel them so I had to assume it was a cultural difference that got in the way for me.
0060392584|5.0|The product was great. It was in an awesome condition. One page was dog-eared but the rest was perfect! Some one obviously knew how to respectfully take care of a book!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Didn't think this would be a show I would like but my daughter talked me into it  and now I can't miss one episode!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Does Clint Eastwood ever make a bad movie...I think not!  It's a slow movie, but it's good.  Worth a watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The twist ending was great! I can't wait to read the next book! I absolutely love the hunger games trilogy
B006G2NVCA|5.0|Trent Reznor has done a great job with this 3 disc album. It is basically the score to &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.&#34; Edgy at times and also very mellow at others. I suggest listening to it while reading or even while trying to fall asleep, though you may get some interesting dreams. Over all, I really enjoy this album, and recomend it.
B0062HS03O|5.0|As a huge Lady Gaga fan, I saw this concert live (just days earlier in a different venue).  I also watched it three times on HBO.  I just knew I had to have it on video.  Splurge for the Blu-Ray!  I couldn't get over how crisp and clear the visuals were!  It was BETTER than seeing it live!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Even the cousins. And this one was now exception. It is nice to know that the cousin wasn't dumb just other-motivated.

B00B1OI3GM|5.0|Chris Potter rarely, if ever, disappoints. After seeing him live with the Underground band I didn't know what to think about him going back to an acoustic setting - hasn't he already done that before? My apprehension was unwarranted. This album is top-notch and on par with some of the best jazz albums ever made. Buy this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always want a horse.<br />This game is great!<br />Great graphics and animation.<br />Smart concept for a game.<br />I would diffently recommend this to someone.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The beginning of the movie was painfully slow for me, but once they got to the good stuff, it was really good.  By the end I was totally engaged, and liked it a lot.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|This is the first book I have read by agatha christie. It is amazing. Did not expect the outcome. Wow.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good game but the games that you buy with points are expensive. it takes a long time to save up enough points. but other than that its good.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game ,  running throw optical . Fun to play for a long time.temple runner. I am definitely a temple run player
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is Nicholas Sparks!  Of course, it's good.  Really kept me going with the husband part of it.  Very believable.
6304712936|5.0|Nominated for 11 academy awards, including the two lead actors. Own 8 awards. Very interesting plot. Excellent music by a musical genius. Kept me riveted the entire movie, and the actors kept you emotionally involved with them.
1616550414|5.0|This has been a long time coming. While it maybe could have contained even more lore, I am pleased with the amount of stuff the crammed in here. The manga at the end is a little lame, but everything else is really satisfying.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app it is asome I have  brave temple run  now I have temple run 2 it is asome I love it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My current favorite game. They took the best parts of the first game, and added even more fun features! Very addictive....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really good game and you should try it. Rio is the best one yet get it is sooooooooo good !!!!!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Ok, First off whoever writes a review and discourages this movie does not know a damn thing. There is probably some inaccuracies in this movie and some add ins on the true story, but the acting is absolutely phenomenol. For you critics out there what movie ever made doesn't have inaccuracies? Answer me that one, if you can't then stop bagging on a movie about one of the greatest men this country has ever seen. I always thought that Heath Ledger playing the Joker in The Dark Knight was the best acting i have ever seen, but this tops it. Daniel Day Lews is spectacular. For those who are not familiar with the 13th amendment or Abraham Lincoln or history in general might think this movie is boring. That is why it did not get a high box office, because the younger generation like more action movies. But I am part of that younger generation and i loved this movie and love Abraham Lincoln and what he did. I cannot wait to buy this on Blu Ray to see it again. Absolutely 5 stars! Best American Presidential movie ever made and by far best acting. Now they need to make a movie about George Washinton and call it \\"Washington\\" also who i think is the best president the United States has ever had, Abraham Lincoln is a close 2nd in my book. Of all the Presidents the United States has had These 2 had the most difficult hardships and managed to succeed in fighting those hardships, movies for both should be required to made for the people of this country. I really hope our leaders today watch this movie and see what kind of man he was.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great! When I heard about it, I had to get it. It is verry fun, I think it's addicting
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven<br />Really liked this book. Very good story well written.  Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors<br />his books never dissapoint.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It works well for me and looks sexy. It seems right with the battery life on my K Fire HD
030758836X|3.0|I put this book aside three times before finishing.  Not the worst  book I have read but close.  Guess I expected a happy ending...or justice?  But...duh!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was a good series of books. Wish there was more. I enjoyed the ending the most. I would definitely recommend these books to anyone.
B007TK77QE|4.0|J.K.Rowling describes the impact of a sudden death of a county member in a small community. This sudden death immedately sets off the fight for power and as always power corrupts. During this power struggle minor and major secrets are revealed among the adult population of this small town, but among the adolescents similar struggles for power and survival take place just as the beginning sexuality is rearing its ugly head.<br />It is an entertaining book which I enjoyed reading and would recommend to everybody who likes a good story. J.K.Rowling knows how to construct a good plot whereas I find that the deeper analysis of her characters and their behavioural pattern is of minor importance to her.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had my doubts because of all the hoopla about the author and the ratings but I took a chance and I am very glad that I did.  This was a very good read, much better than I expected.  Try the sample and I guarantee you will want to finish the book.  The author has a simple but captivating style.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B009MF56GC|5.0|One of our favorite movies! Watch it all the time....marathon movies, it's in there! Love that the old guys are working together!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this is the best it's worth the $1.29 really scary can't wait for chapter 2 i got to seven pages
B009UX2YAC|4.0|OMG!!!!!!!!!THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER BUT<br />IBWAS A LEVEL 30 AND THR NEXT DAY I COME ON IM A LEVEL 1 IM VERY ANNOYED I HAD SO MUCH NOW I HAVE TO DO IIT AGAIN
0590691708|5.0|WHo could not like this book.  THis book is a classic and makes the reader want to &#34;fall in love&#34; with ducklings.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|We do love our Christmas movies and this is now another fave! A must see for those who love Christmas!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If it weren't for the fact that thus book assumes the reader is female, I would have given it five stars. Tina is insightful and hilarious. I don't laugh out loud or chuckle when I read very often, but I did so many times while reading this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Title says it all you are abler to spend 100 dollars on just coins that's insane but the game its self is fun and addictive
B00785P2QC|3.0|Super jzux. Dommage que maintenant il vos jour et connecter sur le compte Facebook. Mais c'est un bon jeux quand même.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Another great Christmas movie, added to our collection. Don't care for Will Ferrell but he did a great job in here! Watching every year!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Although the special effects are good this is only a middling horror movie. Interesting premise but don't expect any brilliant film making here.
B005LAII80|5.0|An amazing fast paced action movie. True to the comic. They better make another! Karl ubran made this movie.<br /><br />P.s. the digital copy is awesome no cds required!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Truly a pleasure to watch, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel delievers a strong message to all age groups - your never to old (or young) to make changes in your life, fall in love or fulfill your dreams! The director has a achieved a very pleasing pace in rolling out this story.  The movie is quite relaxing to watch and ultimately very rewarding!
1609611543|5.0|Assembling concepts we already know and connecting the dots was an eye opener.  The research needs to continue and we need to be vocal to those that can change the paths we are blindly following. I've given copies to several friends.  By finally eliminating wheat from her diet, a friend realized her symptoms were from wheat.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|A very satisfying and historically believable mystery that showed me a culture and time I didn't know a lot about. I loved that. Politics get in the way of a true solve to a very unpopular case, but a pressured yet diligent detective risks literally everything to find a killer the police don't believe in. Looking forward to more by this author.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Great songs at the excellent price of $9. I got the audio CD, along with a free download of the album to create my Amazon Cloud music account, which is similar to an ITunes account, only easier to use. There are an amazing 16 songs on this album. Pink tells interesting and passionate personal stories on this album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun! Nice animation, gentle sounds, and loads of beautiful scenes. My favorite part is the fact that you can change the horse's mane and tail.
1608193381|5.0|A fresh look at the tenets of capitalism. I have loaned it out twice. And bought a copy for a friend
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I don't have too much to say about this little bag except that it shows very good quality, especially for the price.  I use it as an add-on to my main camera bag and carry lens hoods, filters, extension tubes, etc. in it and it works very well for that purpose.  The zippers operate smoothly and seal the openings well.  The sides, top, and bottom are well padded and the exterior is of tough and cleanable synthetic fabric.  A pleasant surprise, and one that won't empty your wallet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game. has a lots of fun games 101 I cant want to see what other games it has. you need to play this game
B00493E1GI|3.0|The movie felt very rushed, the transitions were not very smooth. I would seriously recommend just reading the book instead.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a very good writer, very good at developing her characters.  I had a hard time putting this book down. I didn't really LIKE any of her characters in this book - they all seem to be deeply flawed so there was no one to root for, really, but I still wanted to see what happened to all of them.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Just watched it again on Amazon Instant after watching the first. Ignore the critics. This is far far far better than the first Matrix. Although the first Matrix can be very inspirational to me at a personal level, it still must be recognized that much of what it does is pop-philosophy -- nothing more. The shining achievement of the Matrix is not any philosophical depth. No. The achievement was twofold: 1) Giving a \\"justification\\" for people flying through the air and dodging bullets in the same manner that, say, Spiderman's origin story makes his wall climbing \\"justifiable,\\" -- and in the process of giving a comic-book-like explanation for the action, it makes the action exciting and watchable and 2) setting up an awesome fantasy world beyond this one where this world is the fantasy -- that's just awesome in and of itself.<br /><br />And when you understand that those are the reasons why the Matrix is great, then Matrix Reloaded comes off as even better -- much better, in fact. Because, now that the first movie (which left off in a to-be-continued-style-ending, anyway) has set up the characters, you can have fun watching them go into the matrix and do crazy things -- all of which have implications for the real world (a world that is also simultaneously developed in this movie). This causes story and action to mix and excitement to increase. And then the ending leaves you with a sense of... well no, I won't give that a way -- but the ending gives me emotions that no other movie has.<br /><br />Setting aside the last couple of paragraphs entirely, all you really need to know is that the first Matrix is like A New Hope, the second like Empire Strikes Back, and the third like Return of the Jedi. And as Empire Strikes Back is the definitive Star Wars movie (a movie where the story is also told very visually with Han and Leia attempting to evade the Empire, etc), so Reloaded is the definitive Matrix movie. This movie has a feeling beyond the plot and characters and dialogue and action -- it conveys an overall emotion that is difficult to convey (similar also to Empire Strikes Back), but that is worth enjoying, if you're not too snobbish to get a kick out of the tremendous amounts of action packed into this movie. It's brilliant, and it does the comic book setup of the first movie justice by showing us more of the actions-in-the-matrix impacting the \\"real world,\\" theme that was just starting to be hinted at in the first movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and was so happy to see the whole 3rd season on sale at amazone,com! Its a great show and a great buy considering the prices i saw elsewhere. I continue to be such a huge fan of amazone products and serv ices, very happy here
B0063B2BNE|5.0|It filled the gap when this was not on Netflix or Hulu Plus.<br /><br />Very happy with the quality of the Amazon VOD Services.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book made me realize how my habits play a big role in how well my life goes.  It was also interesting to see how predictable we can be - how businesses can predict what we will want to buy by simply studying our habits.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Margaret Thatcher was always an important figure in modern British history and this film communicated that very well.  It was sad to see the deterioration of a great leader, but this is a fact that has to be known and carries no stigma or in any way detracts from the  significance of her contribution on the world scene.<br /><br />Meryl Streep's performance was remarkable!
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|I'm stunned that the DVD has omitted scenes from the broadcast version shown in the United States.  As several reviewers have noted, in Part 6 (which was episode 5 shown in the states, since the USA broadcast combined Parts 1 and 2 from the DVD into a single episode), the crucial scene where Mrs. O'Brien tells Thomas how much the new footman James has taken a liking to him is NOT on the DVD.  Another example is in Part 4 (episode 3 in the states)where Daisy tells Mr. Mason that she is interested in another footman (Alfred), but that scene is omitted in the DVD although it is shown in the TV episode.  I'm fairly certain other scenes have been omitted since each part on the DVD runs shorter than the episode that was shown on TV.  I was not a regular viewer of the series until I purchased the DVD of seasons 1 and 2, and I watched all the episodes over a month's time so I could be prepared for season 3.  I was completely enthralled by the series and I eagerly looked forward to the new season.  But now I am extremely disappointed by the DVDs, and I wonder how much I missed by not watching the series on TV.  The DVDs are promoted by PBS, and the network should be embarrassed that the DVDs show edited episodes.  Also shame should go to Amazon for promoting the DVD as the \\"uncut\\" UK version.  So I'll now only use my DVR to watch the remaining episodes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I do not have TV and this was the perfect solution to keeping up with The Walking Dead. Can't wait for Season 3 to resume in a couple of days.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Disclamer: This review will not identify any &#34;aha moments&#34; (Good or bad about this app)--it  is just a brief personal statement of why I gave this app 5 stars.<br /><br />I used to read a lot.  I do not know why I stopped.  I purchased my tablet for other functions (not for reading). It came with its own reading software but I was not thrilled about it.  Since I have an Amazon account, I just decided to install their app.  I did noting with it until two events occured.<br /><br />  1. The 2012 Ravens playoff run (remember this was the original Browns--Ouch!!!)<br />  2.  I received an e-mail from Amazon about specials they had on e-books.<br /><br />I took a flier on one of the e-books.  When I discovered that my tablet allowed me to read and listen to music at the same time, I never put the tablet down.  I have a MP3 player, cell phone and computer that I can listen to MP3 on. Listening to music on a tablet was not a deciding point for the tablet--it just happened to be unrealized feature that is now being fully  utilized.<br /><br />The Super Bowl is over.  But I am still reading.  I have since purchased other e-books and have my plans to purchased many more--I am just waiting to see if any of these will be included in a special from Amazon.<br /><br />In closing: My congrats to all you Ravens fans on a outstanding 2012 season--
B003UESJH4|4.0|King George VI was my king as a child growing up in Australia so the information in the film was of great interest to me.  The bad language was a problem, but I was ale to overlook it once I realized it was part of the &#34;therapy&#34;.<br /><br /> I thought it presented the King accurately and I gained valuable insights from watching the DVD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good app. Fun to play if you like Barbie horse adventures or any sort of horse game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have this app on my moms iPad and her phone and I love it. so glad it's finally on Kindle Fire.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I looked extensively for a stylus that would do the job and, that included trips to all the stores in town. I found a great many that would do the job but, they were all very pricy. I decided to find out why. This led me to Amazon and, many reviewed products. I tend to take reviews very lightly as, many people seem to have a problem with products that just don't make sense. However, a review by one gentleman in particular was very intelligently written and, very informative. The product was also reasonably priced. Much more so than any to that point.<br />I bought four of these for all the Kindle users in our family and, extended family. They are very well made and, very worth the price. There may be some that are less expensive but, I believe that you should consider this one first.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Just bought this app, there's a link to a mixed bag of material, but no apparent way to do a search for something specific. If that's so, it's not worth the money.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love Lee Child novels and Jack Reacher and have been hooked on them since the beginning..  While this was a great story, I did not feel that it met the usual expectations of a Lee Child book.  There was a lot of redundant information and I had figured out that the kidnapped lady & her daughter were safe & sound under the protection of the government long before they turned up again.  I love the way Reacher thinks and anticipates the unexpected.  I look forward to the next adventure.
B0027BVMSY|2.0|Bring back James Bond.  I miss the story.  I miss the humor.  I miss the intrigue.  I miss the visual bling.  If you see a building blow up in a desert then this is the movie for you.
006085880X|4.0|This is one of her better books.  It is a great read.  Really enjoyed it.  Give it a try! :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I didn't like horses until I played this game. It pretty cool and fun, and I love it. Love it
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Loved this movie.  I like stories with horses, anyway.  The graphics are great.  Need seven more words, what a pain.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|Purchased this app/couldn't figure it out and sent to cloud.  Tried again.....it is so much fun to play.  Now I have a good score and can not seem to beat it .  Give this one a try...it's a keeper....in my opinion
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game  and I have to have 16 more words to type.  This is rediculious having to write so many words when one would do
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I remember when me and my cousin went on the Disney cruise.we would aways play the first lep's world at dinner. I was so bad we couldn't stop laughing. when I saw this game it reminded me of that and I HAD to get it now I'm in world 4!<br />I absoluly love this game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Power or no power, I was finishing it today. And just now finished and was not disappointed.
B009CPIR9K|2.0|This movie had it's moments.  A unfortunately small number of them though.  Those moments were pretty hilarious, but a lot of the time it was just plain stupid.  This movie had been hyped up so much that I had pretty high expectations, and it didn't deliver.  The acting was ok out of most of the characters.  Sarah Palin was over the top, but that was completely on purpose.  The storyline wandered around from interesting, to confusing, to stupid over the course of 90 minutes.  Go get this at redbox, it won't cost you as much.
B0002I831S|4.0|Have really enjoyed watching these! A bit pricy, but worth it in the long run, they never show this kind of good stuff on tv anymore!
B000065KKE|3.0|I bought Bridget Jones's Diary mainly because of the actors and the actress carrying the major roles, and in that, I was not disappointed. Rene Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant all carry their roles wonderfully. However, the plot line, while realistic and possible to relate to at times,seems to lack a clearly defined point. From an earlier review, it was mentioned that this movie, and the novel it is based on, is loosely based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and that is inferred throughout the movie, with a modernized Wickham( Hugh Grant), Mr. Darcy(Colin Firth), and Elizabeth Bennet (Rene Zellweger). However, this movie lacks the beauty, the intrigue, and the suspense that only the original can afford. So, my recommendation is this....if you are looking for a ''no brain neccessary, just relax and zone out'' kind of movie with a great cast, this is perfect entertainment for you, but if you are looking for something a bit more timeless and a little less chick flick...I'd look somewhere else.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|it is a good game but it feels a little to much like a fb game. I thing it should be less social.
1452101248|5.0|After borrowing from the local library, I finally bit the bullet and ordered Plenty for myself. I am so happy that I did!<br /><br />Here are some pointers about Plenty,and hopefully that will address some concerns about the book:<br /><br />1) Yotam Ottlenghi and his partner, Sammi, are from the Middle East/Levant. So, while vegetables, legumes and grains are the center of the cuisines, they are not vegetarian, and state this very clearly in both The Guardian columns and in the opening of the book itself- he can only be true to himself and his own background. Many of the spices, herbs and ingredients have a Middle Eastern background- and part of the adventure of this book is seeking them out. Many major cities ( and hey! Amazon!) have Middle Eastern spice mixtures and ingredients for sale now! And because this book goes by the central ingredient, this book should be enjoyed with whatever is in season at the produce market ( although there are veggies that are frozen and will be wonderful with these recipes.)<br /><br />2) With that, these recipes will contain a fair amount of dairy and fat from cream, nut oil and olive oil. A more seasoned vegetarian will know how to cut fat and amount of dairy.<br /><br />3) If you are a committed vegan and/or looking to cut overall fat from your diet, and do not feel secure in your cooking abilities, this is not the book for you. It's unfortunate that Ottamlenghi is listed under health and fitness, because this is not a 'clean eating' or weight reduction style of cookbook. This is a celebration of veggies, using very rich ingredients, and yes, despite what so many have been told, the Meditterean diet does include dairy, eggs and fats from oils.<br /><br />4) For those of us undertaking Lent in a few days, this will be a great addition for Sunday dinners or for gatherings!<br /><br />Edited 2/22/2013: I have done about 9 recipes for Lent- including the shakshuka, the eggplant with buttermilk sauce and pomegranate seeds (pictured on the cover) and the brilliant hummus with ful. All wonderful, all delicious,- but take care with amount sizes! This is big food, and when you are eating mostly vegetarian, you are often eat two or more dishes. So beware- the portion sizes are generous per dish, so you may have to cut back OR add more people to the dinner table, which seems to be the deal with many Mediterrean dishes!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Best book I read in ages<br />The first time since I've seen a good book<br />Best book in life yup
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Sounds just like the movie.  I listen all the time to the songs.  This was a gift for my husband
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Start recording.<br /><br />Back on Earth I wasn't much of a reader. In the 75 years I spent there, before I joined the CDF, I probably didn't read more than a dozen books, and that's counting what was mandatory at school...<br /><br />Then came John Perry. He's something of a legend among us. As soon as I boarded my ship, the Detroit, I noticed how many of my fellow soldiers appeared to be lost in thought during our - rare - sparetime. They were &#34;reading&#34; John Perry's memoir, Old Man's War. I'm putting inverted commas here because for me, reading involves holding a book, or at least a tablet, in your hands. Not so here. Connect to your Brainpal, log on to the virtual library and access any book you like. Good to know this computer chip in our brains is not only meant to improve our combat missions.<br /><br />It's actually quite fitting that we don't need to hold anything anymore to read and communicate with others, since I lost both my hands out on my first mission. I guess I wasn't paying attention and believed our new and improved bodies made us virtually invulnerable. Not so, apparently. I learned it the hard way, and I've been sitting here in the ship hospital's bed for a week, waiting for the nanobots to rebuild newer, stronger hands so I can go back and fight. Amazing what they can do out there in space, while back on Earth you'd die from 99% of the injuries we suffer from on the battlefield.<br /><br />But anyway... As I was saying, or rather thinking for my Brainpal to record in my personal files, I've been &#34;reading&#34; Old Man's War, alone in this quiet hospital ward. And I must say this guy has given me the desire to read compulsively, like I'd never done it before, in my former, fully-human life. Maybe the changes they made to our bodies made us more intelligent and not just stronger. Or maybe Perry's book is simply too good for words. It's good to know there are others like me, who've gone from feeling like &#34;old farts&#34; when they docked their new ships / homes, before becoming young, good-looking killing machines packed with Brainpals in their heads and regrownable, Smartblood-fed muscled limbs. It's good to be able to laugh your head off, because the guy has some sense of humour, something that is painfully lacking out here in space, where we mostly think about our next fight with a new and strange alien race on a new planet to colonize. It's good to see that a meaningful love story is still possible, and not just mind-numbing, deeply satisfying sex between people looking more and more like robots.<br /><br />As I'm about to conclude this reading log and post it on the library's interface, I'd like to greet all my fellow soldiers who have been reading Perry's book and finding strength in it. My only fear is that I'll die before reading his other books. I'll be much more careful on my next mission and make sure not to lose any vital limb, because nanobots, Brainpals and Smartblood or not, you can still die out there. Keep strong, boys and girls.<br /><br />Stop recording. Send.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a very refreshing read and had a way of surprising me at every turn. It was not like most books in it's genre.<br />I would highly encourage everyone to read it, regardless of your age.
0446585041|2.0|Love Ellen but this book is what ADHD means. It was all over the place and not funny at all.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|James Bond's Skyfall HD did not disappoint me.  Highly recommended for people who are fans of 007.  Since I purchased it digitally, I am able to watch the movie again and again, via amazon cloud player (Kindle, PC and/or Smart TV).  Much better than having physical possession of the DVD!
B007O4XX9K|5.0|Love the new tunes. This is all I was expecting and more.<br />Heard a couple of the songs on Guitar Sessions and had<br />to have it. Good stuff Joe!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always fun, I like the one touch feature that sends the card to its spot automatically.  Enjoyable, fun and keeps your mind working.
B000002KAT|5.0|It takes me back and far away.  I listen to it over and over.  I was there.  So much fun.
B0021L9MJG|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD. It's right up my alley when it comes to having everything one would expect from a horror movie.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|Very well done. Very detailed. Our familly love Lego products and this is very nice one. Wish price can be cheaper but you pay little more for Denmark quality.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really great acting all around, the plots continue to circulate amongst the entire ensemble cast. Gorgeous backdrops and costuming, and quite a story line this time around.  Watched 2 times through!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|There are better episodes of this show.  Don't start with this one. a a a a a a a a
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Clever and creative! Our young grandson is &#34;wise beyond his years&#34; so a challenge to find books and movies that challenge him. This one was a joy to share.
B008LVCKH6|2.0|A fun idea, the story starts off as quirky and funny, but turns repetitive and uninteresting.  I wanted to finish it just so I could move on to another book.  I learned some tidbits of historical information which I thought was neat.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|dragonvale is a good game but crashes too much!!! Every time I breed a dragon it crashes!!! I hate it!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK WAS SO SLOW THAT I ALMOST GAVE UP ON IT.  THE END WAS BETTER BUT PREDICTABLE.  nOT FOR ANYONE OVER 20.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Amazing, not sure I want to fly again? Denzel Washington was wonderful! Love to see hIm act, he does it so well
B003Z0D4SM|5.0|Thrilling, biting, dark, mysterious, action-packed.  Awesome book.  Don't start reading if you have a project coming up or house cleaning to do...it will NOT get done as you will be stuck reading this incredible book for hours and hours.  Unexpected twists and turns, crime, brooding characters that you can't help rooting for, and a daring social commentary to boot.  The best part is that there are two more books to enjoy after this one!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Loved it .  A very good story . Could not put it down. Read it in two days. Waiting for the next one.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Awesome movie.  We have seen it before and it was even better in 3D.  Very nice scenery and fun to watch with the whole family.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A phenomenal book that I couldn't put down. Jodi Picoult does an amazing job with the characters and you really feel the raw emotion in the story.
0807014273|5.0|the friend for whom I bought the book is intrigued and will pass it on to me when he is through
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is perfect for someone who loves challenges I still play temple run but when I want a challenge this is what I play
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Love Phillips' voice - reminiscent of Dave Matthews sound, but a little more country in spots.  The soulful quality of his singing makes this an easy listen and surprisingly a great whole album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an excellent free game for adults and children, as there are several levels of difficulty.  My grandson is six years old, with great respect and awe for grandma's new Kindle Fire. My Kindle 2 was more of a curiosity than an interest for him.  We played this game together until he could grasp thinking moves through before connecting colors.  I started him on &#34;easy&#34;, once he felt comfortable playing by himself.  Now he plays most levels, rarely asking for help unless he is truly stuck and unable to see how to rearrange lines so they don't cross. He enjoys seeing grandma get stuck, rolls are reversed, then he gets to help me figure it out.  I play while watching classic movies, considering It brain exercise.  It teaches him focus, concentration and confidence in his ability to do &#34;grownup&#34; things with the Kindle Fire. We both recommend this game to everyone.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|While Rod Stewart is not my favorite singer ever, he's certainly an appreciated talent.<br />This is a great album. Done well. Not overdone in any way. Just right.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The app is great I really enjoy using it.  It is easy to use and I can see the numbers clearly
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great heavy synth music - amazing lyrics.  Recommend for anyone listening to lumineers or the killers.  Make this your go to for workouts.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great story in the continuing saga of Mitch Rapp.  His stories are a reflection of what is truly going on in the war on terrorism.  I hope Vince Flynn keeps them coming.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener. For anyone who had even one question remaining about the afterlife or whether we, who try our best each day, are good enough...the answer is Yes. What makes this book so valuable is the fact that this is a physician/surgeon who knows everything one needs to know about the brain, brain activity, etc. His experience (as close to death's door as you can get), with a brain that was scientifically and medically proven to not have anything working in it, continued to &#34;work,&#34; experience, see. This is a must-read for humanity at large.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game it soo cute you guys would try it out like a real horse good game for little kids love
B00006IRJU|5.0|I lost my copy of this amazing music when my cassette tape finally bit the dust - couldn't find it on any digital downloads, so  was very grateful for the chance to get this gem into my cd collection and now on my iPod.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I like this book because it isn't predictable.<br /><br />It isn't fluff, either. At times, I found it difficult to read because I SO wanted to reach inside the story and protect the protagonist from what no child should have to endure . But she DOES.<br /><br />This story is for anyone who appreciates characters who struggle with real-life, painful issues and make beautiful  what is ugly in their worlds. [[ASIN:B00AL1ZSVE Primary Possession]]
B009VYAVTG|4.0|For some reason it seemed that the episodes were out of sequence on my discs.  I never saw the wedding?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the first two books but felt the author was rushed to complete this by a deadline. Publisher probably wanted this done. Sorry..it is not as good.
159315724X|5.0|This is a great book highly recommended to get you in the habit of focusing and the importance of learning how to get tasks completed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am an English teacher, a writer, and a lover of reading, so I know what critics say makes for good literature. Having said that, I read the TWILIGHT series, and I loved it. Despite all the negativity on behalf of all the respectable members of the literary community, both those near and far, I easily became vested in the characters. I took a personal interest in their lives and genuinely cared about how their conflicts would be resolved, so, when I heard about this bit of &#34;fan fiction&#34; inspired by the YA fiction books, I had my doubts.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine that I would actually like Christian and Ana better than I did Edward and Bella, but I did. I didn't deem it possible that Kate could be more tenacious than Rosalie, but she is, that Ethan could be more adorable than Emmett, that...okay, you get it.<br /><br />Bottom line? I get it now, too! Yes, this is SO an adult read. It's touted &#34;Mommy porn,&#34; and it does NOT disappoint. Well, that is the point of a good read, isn't it? To be satisfying?<br /><br />It is, and if that's what you're looking for, it is precisely the read for you.
B001LF347E|5.0|I absolutely love the casting in this series.  Bradley James is perfect as Arthur Pendragon.  And I also love Merlin.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|The writing of this book is so smooth you just glide along on the words.  An incredible amount of information delivered in a charming, sometimes funny, always interesting style.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great app. I do love the ease of using it. It is very  quick and easy. Highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So amazing...finished in one day. I could not bare to put it down. It has a very dark plot but worth the tears.
B004LROMQG|5.0|Lady Morgana is quite a sorceress.  I enjoyed learning about Freya, LOVE Kilgharrah, Guinevere, Lancelot, I love Gwaine and Merlin
B008NMT684|5.0|My son loves putting the puzzles together. He's 2 1/2 yrs old and can do all of it by himself and always gets happy and cheers when the puzzle is completed because he then gets to pop all the celebration ballons.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is great for me to be able to write my notes. I transfer them from handwritten so I get the chance to review what I've written for greater reinforcement.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl captured my attention from the very start and held my interest to the very end. It also challenged my emotions as I attached myself to one of the main characters. I was very pleased with the ending!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son is 2 1/2 yrs old and can do all the puzzles by himself. He gets all excited when he completes a puzzle because he then gets to pop all the ballons.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This is a kids movie and just for fun but I liked many things about it besides the engaging story of the city girl who has a tropical adventure.  They get so many positive messages into this cute movie: animal rights, positive adoption messages and falling in love with someone with whom you share common goals.  It was fun watching it with my five-year-old daughter.
030758836X|5.0|Very good story!  Could not stop reading it throughout the night.  I think murder mystery fans will just love this book.
B004SBQAL0|5.0|cant find this movie anywhere in reg dvd only blu ray is by far one of the best flix iv seen yet
B00001W9G0|5.0|I bought this for a walk down memory lane and loved it as much as I did the first time. The theme music is one of my favorites. Streisand and Redford were outstanding. It is still a tear jerker!
B000MV9026|5.0|I saw this when it first came out and enjoyed it just as much when I watched it on video in Spanish with my young child.  There are a lot of good songs in it.  It only has one scary scene, the one in which the little penguin is chased by the leopard seal but you can check to see when the scene is coming with a dvd.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I like Eastwood since he has done some good movies with a moral outcome.  This is a kind of unknown movie about baseball.  I liked the Money Ball and the Natural so I had to see this.  It was good.  Good characters and a decent story with a good ending.  It is not an action movie but it has a certain appeal if you like a sports story and some interesting acting.  Not the best movie by Eastwood but good.  When there is nothing else you like check this one out.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|GOONIES GOONIES GOONIES GOONIES GOONIES IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY...... GOONIES GOONIES GOONIES... LOL GOONIES GOONIES GOONIES.... IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a compelling story that stays with one long after the last episode.  The story and the acting are very well done.  I'm looking forward to the next season, certainly.<br /><br />The only disappointment I could voice about the series is that it was clearly used as a platform for airing some modern moral views that were not, to my understanding, representative of that day.  These views came out, briefly in the first and third seasons, and while reprehensible to me, they did not spoil the story at large....for me as an adult.  However, I would not recommend those episodes, in particular, for young audiences because of them.  In truth, there are several more &#34;adult&#34; episodes I would not have my children watch, good and appropriate as the series, as a whole, is.
B004LROUW2|2.0|I couldn't finish the book. I was reading it for a book club but after the first meeting I couldn't read the book. I think it was really slow and didn't really interest me.
B001XVS232|5.0|I liked this western! It was realistic and gritty.  Good acting and and a good story with a good ending.  It is not your typical Hollywood shoot'em.  Dialog is simple and there is good character interaction and there is also some good action but it does not dominate the movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|wow o wow o wow o wow o wow o wow o wow o wow. cant wait to watch this trilogy
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very creepy story and scenes.  Lots of good mystery and good puzzles.  The game is fairly hard to solve.  Definitely. worth the price.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is smart and funny.  With witty dialogue and characters you care about, this show always entertains.  Will Harvey and Donna get together?  Will Rachel ever forgive Mike?  I can't wait until the next episode to find out.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|I thought this would be great considering the cast. But it was lame. No chemistry between Justin and Amy. Predictable and not believable.
0345529057|5.0|These four books bring us into a world of love, hate, treachery, schemes, and ultimately the game which is the game of thrones. The first three books are absolutely spectacular and are constant page turners. Feast slows down a little, but this world has me sucked in so much that all the goings leave me wanting to know whats next. An epic fantasy series like no other.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|A very good app to get in shape. I hope to use it even more from now on. Good app. Check it out for free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game it is very entertaining and almost kind of feels real.<br />I love how you get to save up for this and is kid appropriate.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|FINALLY Disney makes a movie where both parents are alive -- and STAY alive. And the heroine is a genuine, fully fleshed out character. I absolutely love this movie. Of course the animation is fantastic and spectacular. It's funny and charming and delightful. And I DETEST Disney anything. If they start making more movies like this, they may actually redeem themselves of the monsters they are.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game and its my fav game its the bes thing in my opinion its a little better than temple run 2
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a fun, free little game. It is kind of like Mario but with a Leprocon(not spelled right). lol. It can be challenging at times
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fantastic. The graphics are really cool. There are so many cool characters to choose from. You can have all sorts of powerups. This is so addicting. I love the World Tour.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|There are a few holes in the logic of this movie. But the concept is very cool and the story moves along pretty well. Worth seeing.
B000001GMX|4.0|Really Enjoyed the music but the liner and program is inaccurate. Worth the money. Great for stress management and relaxation.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I like the game even though it is kind of slow. It takes several seconds to load the game and then several more every time you want additional cards.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best game out of all the shark games I recommend you get this game right now it's so cool
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|One of the best stories I've ever heard. An amazing look at a true artist and the impact on so many lives. This story embodies the way human beings connect through music and just how much it means in our lives.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love the game its so much fun and addicting.  My only negative is twice it has wiped me out and have me start from the beginning instead of saving my score
0739384171|4.0|I have not finished this item but todate it has been as it was presented to be.  It was received on time and everything seems to be o.k.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|i liked this book it was a real classic and everyone should read this book i dont know why some places band this book  they have worse books then this one and they should be band not this book
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I got this app because I loved the first one and this looked really good from the pictures(I didnt bother to read the reveiws because I am a teen and I am lazy) So I got it and I love it! I play it all the time. During class, doing homework, going to the bathroom. Over all its a great app, except.... sometimes there are glitches, will this eventually be a problem well, I dont know so carpe diem! (Seize the day)
0446580848|5.0|I like this author and this character very much. I have read all the others in this series and have enjoyed them all.
B004LQI0HE|2.0|As always books are better than movies . Love most Keira Knightley movies- Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield  were a plus.Movie lagged at times but what helped it was the location (beautiful).<br />If you don't see it you wont be missing anything , read the book and play it out in your mind as you read it will be much better.
B0054K5CP4|5.0|I got a used copy of this movie and it was like brand new.  I<br />saved a few dollars and got a funny movie in just days.
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and the Harry Bosch novels were all WONDERFUL!!!!! This one included. I will read whatever books he writes as I have enjoyed them all!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great product.  I would buy it again!!!  I use it every day to keep my mind sharp.  I would recomend it to my friends.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|So disappointed in the chemistry of Katie and Alex. It felt very very plain or vanilla.. no flavor!!!!  I wish I would not have bought the book now.. booo!
1439102430|5.0|I am a big fan of Kathy Reichs' and this book did NOT disappoint. I have read all her other books too.I enjoyed it very much.
B000W1TJXQ|5.0|What a great bunch of songs by this group.  Blackmore does multiple long solos that are just brilliant.  Great listen
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app works and its pres download on kindle fire.  MUST HAVE.  YOU BEST IGNORE OTHER COMMENTS IF I WAS NOT OFFICAL I WOULDNT POST THIS REVIEW
B0073QYC2G|5.0|This is a great replica of a Gigantosaurus.  I love that the mouth opens on this one like the Papo dinosaurs.  You will not be disappointed.  Great size and Great Dino!!!!!!!!!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved the book it was the best book I ever read. I'm going to get the next book  the Son of Neptune. I wonder what will happen now that Jason is at Camp Half-blood. Will everything be the same. I hope Annabeth will find Percy Jackson and soon!
1607066017|5.0|I couldn't believe a comic book could be this beautiful. Fiona Staples makes me feel like I'm ripping her off by getting this at a paltry $10! Every page is a print for which I would pay very good money.<br /><br />The story isn't unique, but it's told in a unique universe. Two lovers on the run from a totalitarian government in the middle of a galaxy-wide war. Simple story perfected.<br /><br />If you're a fan of fantasty and magic being combined with futuristic technology then you will love this universe. Also, if you liked the Nausicaa: Valley of Wind series then this will be right up your ally.<br /><br />Definitely don't want to miss this!
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Full disclosure here, this is my third time attempting to read this book.  The other two times I had the paperback version, and it just required to much of a commitment to read.  I mean, it's a big book to carry around and to also carry a dictionary was just too much.<br /><br />This latest go, I downloaded the Kindle version to my phone.  Now, anytime I have a few minutes to spare I can read and now I'm making good progress.  Touch to define words and all of the footnotes are linked.<br /><br />Regarding the content, DFW creates an extraordinary world.  I recommend not reading any summaries and instead being slowly introduced to the characters/environment.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I always thought zombie stories were dumb until I watched this show. Now I am hooked! Watch and enjoy this entertaining series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I can think of in the world ever. And, it was filled with action, despair, drama and adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Facebook makes this much more competitive. My friend recently beat my other friends high score; he got 2m legit i saw it. I decided to give it a try, and im hooked. Thanks Kiloo!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A quick read. Really makes you think...what is....what could be...and what might have been. Another SK hard bound for my collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have thouroughly enjoyed watching Downton Abbey. The hour long show goes by so fast, because there is always something happening. The characters are great. Some you love and some you don't especially like. My favorite character is Anna.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|(\ /)<br />(^-^) I LOVE this game, All I have is one simple request to make this game perfect:<br /><br />  -Please make the horses you can buy with coins less expensive<br />  -Give the option of changing your horse's color, mane + tail, and PLEASE make diamonds so much easier to get!!!!!<br /><br />  Other than these things, the game is great I love it!!! :D
B00B2V66VS|1.0|What is the point of these stupid games? What's the point of any game if you can't beat it? There's no objective, just run until you die. The only reason I kept it is for my little sister, who has no taste in games as she loves it. Absolute 0/5. Boring.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|A little creepy a first, but that's because this series pushes and blurs the lines that supposedly define right & wrong.  Our family got hooked!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Received the Kindle Fire for retirement and was glad to choose my own case cover. Pleased with the product that I received.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun. I love playing with my beautiful horse Story. This game is perfect for long boring car rides.
B006L7RDOC|5.0|I rated it this because this book had lots of great detail. I would recommend this book to people who like Books .
B00992CF6W|3.0|it is slower to use than the xbox version and the controller does not allow as many movement options otherwise it's fun
0345529057|2.0|This box set is cheap for a reason.  They shrunk the font to save paper, and I simply cannot read it in comfort.  It's really, really not worth it.  It's sort of like a downloaded camcorder version of a hit film; you sort of get the experience, although the video and audio are exceptionally poor.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love the graphics and how easy is to play. I also like going to the zoo but don't get to go so this helps me with that.
B001LM1456|2.0|I have watched a lot of shows off amazon but the streaming on this was really choppy. Checked our internet and everything great on our end. But we only saw about half the show because it kept stopping.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was a fun tale that made me flashback to my high school days.  I enjoyed reading it :)
B005OP2928|5.0|My family and I love this show, seriously hilarious. With Amazon Video on my TV this is easier than DVDs!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to my friends I loved it.  I love the way the author makes you feel the characters emotions like they were your own
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My new high score is higher than the first game. My high score is over five million. It is higher than my brothers
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is pretty cool!!!!!!!! :-) lol I like it a lot cuz it is like taking care . Of a real horse
B000FBFN1U|5.0|the plot of the story were written very well. i can't wait to see it in television. well done. thanks.
1451683405|3.0|Harris starts out with some enthusiasm and rigorous scientific presentations for his case. The first chapter (\\"The Unconscious Origins of the Will\\") is the most convincing. The second and third chapters (\\"Changing the Subject\\" and \\"Cause and Effect\\") are generalizations about the first. But from there Harris gets much more pedestrian in his explanations and examples. By the time he gets to the last two chapters (\\"Politics\\" and \\"Conclusion\\") there are obvious questions raised by what has now become more doxastics than rigorous scientific inquiry. For example, this topic of free will needs a more disciplined and vigorous vocabulary suitable to the project--which becomes less scientific and more philosophical as the book progresses. Perhaps more explanation of, say, the internal instigation of external influences (to suggest a more vigorous vocabulary). This very thought is integral to his discussion of justice regarding persons as free agents (\\"Politics\\"). If his hypothesis is correct that free will is an illusion and behavior is determined by a collection of internal (genes, synaptic activity) and external (laws of Physics, habitat, upbringing) phenomena, then a system of justice that both punishes and rewards human behavior would seem even more important to our condition, i.e., lacking free will. Justice would be part of the external, behavioral world that would profoundly influence the internal instigation of external influence, and hence determinism. This would seem a critical and central part of the book's thesis, but Harris seemed to lose interest and ignored any such thoughts. Rent this one from a library. There are better sources in his footnotes than the book itself.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was incredible I can't. Words cannot describe how amazing this book is. I'm such a cry baby though, the end got me the worst. My feels we're everywhere :'(
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A very good action adventure - Jack Reacher is fleshed out in reading more of this series, which I really like.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting story... why the need for each silo NOT to know about each other??  I think that would have enhanced stability, and not be a destabalizer....
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast paced and twists and turns enough to keep you from being able to put down. Enjoy the storyline now
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a really intense, and heat pounding book. I am definitely anxious for the next book to come out.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I wanted to read this for awhile.  It was entertaining. It was worth reading but did not knock my socks off.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app I great!!! You will never get bored again! I personally think it is so much better than the first temple run.  A lot more action. It's very addictive! Get this app. It's worth it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love the USB Cable it's a little longer and seems to be a better quality cable. Only time will tell for sure.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Fit like a glove. The material is quite durable.  However, there is not enough support to use it as a stand.  I would recommend it you want an inexpensive cover for your Kindle Fire.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is really fun. Didn't think i would like it . Took me a little bit to figure out how to play it and move the cube, but all in all fun to play.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's basically Mario bros with a simpler format. Oh, and the pinecones are great, because it gives you a simpler way kill enemies. Especially 4 those who suck at Mario bros in the first place. Once again, fun ,simple game similar to Mario bros.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Reading the different plots and scenarios, and following each one as the author goes back and forth between them, is both challenging and captivating.  I would highly recommend The Secret Keeper to anyone who enjoys this kind of plot development. Morton does an excellent job in painting with words the pictures of the cast of characters.
B0011EU0NG|3.0|My 12 year old really enjoyed it, but it isn't my favorite story.  Too much slapstick by the time you get to the pirate story.  The car is cool, though!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really enjoyed the suspense and conflict in this book. One of those 'must keep reading need to know the ending now,' kind of books.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, the song the man whistles will be in my head forever, I wish I could have it as a ring tone.<br />Great price.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Loved this movie the first time we saw it and every Christmas enjoy knowing it is in our Christmas library
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it was sold at a good price.<br />I wish they would of made a sequel t
B009POCG0Y|2.0|This movie had a lot of interesting actors in it, which was why I purchased it.<br />I was not real impressed.<br />Not one of Matthew Mcconaughey's better roles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I started playing this game cause my friend recommended it to me I see why this games so fun and even better on my kindle
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Mad Men is at its best when its storylines function around the workplace. Season 5 is very centered around the agency and the writing is very focused this season. This show just gets better and better!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like this game. Hopefully the creators will make a version that changes scenery....how about rafting up/down river or scaling the side of a temple?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I was certain from the begininng that this was a good book for my son who has a paperwhite and he said he didnt want to miss out on the third wheel so I bought for him and it turns out he loved it so much he got the wimpy kid series and he loved diary of a wimpy kid and I tried to read it and it is a good book for kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is by far my favorite app. It is like having your own horse! You feed,groom,compete with it to! I love this app I would rate this app with Google stars if I could.You get to buy new things for your character and your horse.
0439023483|5.0|Guaranteed you will read 2 and 3 after this book. Great for all ages and worth reading before seeing the movie.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Teen based series much like twilight or hunger games. This was the second book in the series and I think it was much better than the first book. So keep reading because it gets better.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I bought the Kindle version even though I already own the paperback.  This is one of my favorite books.<br /><br />It's well written, has great characters, a wonderful plot, and a lot of humor.  There are great touches of both the &#34;real&#34; and &#34;fantasy&#34; worlds.<br /><br />The Kindle version also tipped me off that there is a third book by DWJ that has the Howl characters - I was only aware of two.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you're looking for a well-written light fantasy book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|guys updates take alt of time to make if they added the nether now, all the stuff that is in it would make the app crash. they are attempting to make this app awesome but not cause your divice crash. the makers need time to update this.  be patent and soon we can enjoy stuff like enderman and wolves and enchanting and the nether and maybe even being able to download mods!!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Wonderful!  Complex, story in story, character driven story - beautifully written and engaging.  The writing is beautiful, compelling, rather quickly moving.  Some readers have commented that the characters were not likable, but I found they were mulit faceted and.  The twist at the end was good....
B005IQZB14|5.0|Overcoming what difficulties life has given her, and in spite of bad decisions, I found myself cheering Cheryl on after laughing and crying with her through her challenges and triumphs.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was shocked to hear about Chris Kyle's unfortunate demise. That being said, this was an entertaining and quick read.  Whether you're military or civilian, this is a revealing and interesting look into a very specific field of warfighters who keep us all secure.  Worth a read if.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|This CD consist of 8 live tracks recorded at Legends Chicago Illinois on the 29th of January 2010 and three studio tracks recorded at the Blackbird Studio Nashville T N on the 9th of March 2010.<br /><br />Live at Legends : Intro 0:38 - Best Damn Fool 6:14 - Mannish Boy 4:06 - Medley : I Just Want To Make Love To You / Chicken Heads 9:22 - Skin Deep 5:17 - Damn Right I Got The Blues 6:25 - Medley : Boom Boom / Strange Brew 3:00 - Medley : Voodoo Chile / Sunshine Of Your Love / Keep On Truckin' 3:35 .<br /><br />The Studio Recordings  : Polka Dot Love 5:35 - Coming For You 4:23 and Country Boy 6:04 . 11 Songs approx 54 minutes .<br /><br />To get on stage and play a mean guitar at the age of 76 even if he does play around doing covers on some tracks deserves 5 stars : another Great Album by the legend Buddy Guy .
B00002N9ER|5.0|Very firm and solid pieces, holding the light securely without being overly difficult to remove the light when needed.  Currently mounted to the rear door of of my SUV and there is nary a rattle.  If you have a MAGLITE and need to mount it securely, look o further.

B0096PYUE2|1.0|I don't know if it works.  Nothing seems to function with it.<br /><br />What it does do is provide a ton of nuisance ads.  Deleted forever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't like to rate games at all but subway suffers only asks u once so they are really nice about it the game is also adickting and is really fun I got it and I was on my kindle all the time playing it loveit
B004GYY714|4.0|TuneIn Radio offers a large selection of radio stations from all over the world. Many are genre specific. It's easy to pick and choose a station for whatever you may be in the mood to listen to. Get clear reception on even obscure &#34;local&#34; stations in your area. I love it!
B0063GORYU|4.0|The app works fine on my Kindle Fire. The only thing I can find wrong with it is the ads. But there aren't many, and the app is free so can't complain. Recommended for those who are interested in the game.
1931559317|5.0|It seems a little daunting at first to try to read but after you get the hang of it it's got  lots of detail you may not find on a planisphere.
0525478817|5.0|I finished this book in one sitting. When a friend suggested I read it, it was purchased but I had not gotten to it yet. And now I wish I had sooner. The story quickly sucks you in. You are introduced to people who I honestly believe will forever been in your heart and mind. They feel more real than any others you may read about. The quoting of the last two lines of the Robert Frost poem brought a smile to my face and a tug at my heart.<br /><br />Nothing Gold Can Stay<br />by Robert Frost<br /><br />Nature's first green is gold,<br />Her hardest hue to hold.<br />Her early leaf's a flower;<br />But only so an hour.<br />Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br />So Eden sank to grief,<br />So dawn goes down to day.<br />Nothing gold can stay.
145470246X|5.0|The projects in this book are beautiful.  Can't wait to start making them.  The pictures are very well done.  Love the book,
B0000UJDLM|5.0|A Robot, the evil military and a scientist falling in love with a hippy chick. How could this movie get any better?
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I was really pleased with this CD.  Our daughter and son-in-law recently got married in Hawaii.  We had a reception here in the states for family after they returned and it was a special addition.  I am so glad we got it and would recommend it to anyone.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Splash. An 80's classic. Well written, well directed, wonderful cast (Tom Hanks, John Candy, Darryl Hannah for starters. c'mon! how can you go wrong?) A wonderfully absurd movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing. I love the point of view and writing style. So many twists and turns and comebacks. Crazy ending that was perfect.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|WHOLESOME  AND ENTERTAINING. IN A SOMEWHAT WORLD OF MAKE-BELIEVE, ONE NONETHELESS COMES AWAY INGRAINED WITH WHAT CARING, KINDNESS AND LOVE MEANS.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read these the week before my husband and I married. All THREE books in less than a week. Got pregnant on our honeymoon!
B001JU4S44|4.0|Not sure i would pay for this again. It was a good watch though. Lots of action like the other MI 's
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read these the week before my husband and I married. All THREE books in less than a week. Got pregnant on our honeymoon!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a bit of a shock to watch initially (with kids killing kids and all); but if you can deal with that, the underlying plot theme is very engaging. Some might argue that it takes on a Rich vs. Poor vibe, but I prefer to think it tackles the very real issues of class warfare, government manipulation, and societal contentment.  In any case, you will like this film.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is definitely not a super high quality movement - but for the price, how could you complain?<br />It's light, good looking, and breaks the mold of all the huge face watches out there.  I have a lot of bigger face watches - so it's nice to mix it up.
