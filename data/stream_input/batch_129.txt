B005H13LRG|5|This is the perfect replacement for my damaged 2009 Nissan Cube Mirror.
B00COOS5NY|1|This product is horrible and I will not make another purchase..tried to contact seller and would not return my message
B00D3N5Y5W|5|Fast delivery great item thank u
B000CPAGFW|4|bolts up, makes driving on the highway more pleasurable. Worth it for sure
B000WJH6SI|5|The PIAA replacement bulbs are a great item. Replacement was easy. The kit even came with replacement rubber vibration dampeners. The light output is hard to match. No regrets making this purchase.
B00H1IBKIK|5|Very pleased with these!!!
B001PNIJM2|5|nice switch just what I needed
B000H3WZJY|4|Very yellow and comparable to the color from HIDs but not bright enough to be used as a high beam. My alternative was to use one of these bulbs in my right high beam and a PIAA Night Tech in the left high beam. I get a great contrasting beam from that, better than using two white bulbs or two yellow bulbs.
B004F8AXDM|2|Was a little disappointed in the quality. They ran like champs for a few days and yet again the gave up like always.
B000CKVZQG|5|Part worked perfect! Know that you can borrow hub pullers from part stores like Auto Zone(with a deposit of course) that are crucial for changing this part out!
B003HB5VTO|5|I ordered this for my wife and she likes the look. They look good and have last for about a year now on the car.
B0075J9VBI|5|I have Jack and Sally now and I am going to put a heart in between them on my car love Nightmare Before Christmas  :)
B0010E00T6|5|fits very good and works fine for several weeks so far.<br /><br />cannot complain.
B003D6Y216|5|3M makes the best quality stuff. You pay a little more and it is harder to find, but you get pro-grade product. I've used this as the final step in restoring some headlights and it works great. If I was a little more picky, I might also get the Ultrafine #3 product also. However I'm not sure if it would make much difference on my headlights. Hard to tell if the plastic has internal micro fractures from years of heat and cold exposure or what. It is not until my HID headlights shine through the lens that I can see any minute haze within the lens.
B003CJAWOU|3|Picture doesn't match product.  These are frame sliders that you need to cut the fairing.  Still are nice but wanted the ones in the picture
B0010GG7YG|5|I installed this in the 2008 Silverado LT. The job took less than 10 minutes. The switch works perfectly! Good quality at a reasonable price. I highly recommend this product.
B00826PG3U|3|I chose this because it what I needed to fill my needs. Will order again,Thank you.This is what the world needs
B000VU4KDW|2|Pretty disappointing for several reasons.<br />First, the instructions are inexplicably poor. A couple of the drawings are upside down, but this is not conveyed in any way whatsoever. They work (minimally) but seem unnecessarily meager. There are no photographs, no suggestions for proper placement in relationship with the door, poorly drawn diagrams, blatantly incorrect information. Bad job somebody.<br />Second, to build as directed, pieces are either missing or mismatched. For instance, there are at least 40 bolts, but only 6 nuts!!! And this isn't a matter of someone leaving a few out...it says 6 right next to the &#34;picture&#34; of the nuts. I had to supplement with hardware from Home Depot. Forget about using the &#34;support brackets&#34;. You'll see what I mean.<br />Third, the washers provided aren't locking washers, which makes me nervous. With all the vibration and force on these connections, you'd think they'd give you locking washers. Nope.<br />Four, it's definitely a two-person job. And be careful drilling into the frame. There's lots of lines and other important stuff routed both inside and outside that would be unfortunate to hit.<br />Will be putting on the actual bars tomorrow. So will update if I run into any more snags.
B00NFA22XU|1|one of the bulb blew in the 2nd day
B00D6RXSLW|5|Love this sticker!
B000BZGGV6|5|I purchased this for my wife's 1999 Honda Accord LX with the 2.3L engine.  I wanted a high quality pump.  I didn't want to risk purchasing a inferior pump only the have it break later.  I purchased the recommended screen 68015 as well.  All of the stock clamps and holders work great with this pump.  I even reused the factory spring style hose clamps.      It's been working great now for 3 months.  Quieter than the stock pump which at 170,000 miles was whining.  I inspected the stock pump by cutting it apart on my lathe.  The only problem was the brushes had cut deep grooves in the commutator, otherwise it was in perfect condition.    Awesome pump at a good price.
B009PHU2VQ|1|Mounted the hitch and now the exhaust system has a leak and the hitch hits the muffler, causing noise in the car. Disappointing!!
B00EZ4BXH6|5|Just the right length
B000GANZ1A|5|These fit great / used them for my dump trailer / trailer tires are pricey enough, for me its worth protecting.
B00DR1AKTK|3|Good for the price, but you get what you pay for. Installation is simple and the installation manual was straightforward and clear. The brackets that mount it the frame are plenty strong. The part that I don't like is that the step bar itself is flimsy. A 180 lb person will cause it to flex when putting full weight on it. This is a consequence of the attachment method and the thin-walled step bar. I think this one will last at least a few years, but I will buy a better brand next time.
B000YCCORQ|5|Fits as described
B0024E6W02|5|Works great
B001THRG9Q|4|Worked great with just 3 coats and some wet sanding.  The clear is matte and not gloss, which I wasn't sure about doing, but I think it turned out okay with the matte clear.  The clear tended to overspray a bit, thus only giving 4 stars - but that could just be me - I was able to buff it off.  Had to mask off and spray on the car or remove the entire rear end to get the tails off.  Was easier to pull the bezels off and mask.
B00HXC4QPI|5|I'm happy with the purchase, I have a Honda Shadow 600 and they fit perfect and look cool. My bike stays all day out in my job's parking lot, so they protect the fork o-ring seals from dirt, sun and rain, and are easy to clean. It's no so easy to instal because you have to remove the front tire and disassemble the fork, but is much easy than change the fork o-rings.
B004MF9T2Y|5|excelente produccto
B005C9UA4K|5|Worked like the original !
B0030PWDQG|5|Very easy to use, wipe on wipe off leaves a great shine one of if not the best on the market.
B006OIWWZ8|5|Works as intended
B006571WV8|4|I gave a 4. Baseplate was is nice but luckily I kept parts list from the other kit I bought cause this comes with no mounting hardware (nuts & bolts & washers) which I didn't realize when I purchased it.
B000CQOIR8|5|This product arrived in a timely manner, the packaging was a lil rough but the install was simple enough, would recommend to anyone looking for a class III / Class IV hitch
B0041MGDDQ|5|great product fast service
B007CDYXZG|5|Just discovered this filter for my '08 Tundra.  Have been using the Fram ones.  This is one can be found for as low as $4 ea, plus shipping.  Comes with the plastic adapter for draining the oil from the filter housing, which has male threads to screw into the bottom of the housing.  This is a vast improvement over the &#34;push-in&#34; ones that were prone to popping out it you bumped the drain hose.  Always knew that K&N made quality air filters, this one should be no different.
B00651CLCS|4|Looks great on my Jeep! No loss of signal at all.
B000N2WB2U|1|The description said that fit's most original distribuitors. I have try to use it with my '66 vw bug ...but i've just waste money and time...
B00062YPGW|5|very good
B008VIBW64|5|Works perfectly, thank you!
B004TJFQIO|5|It's really good I liked
B00HCSA9DG|1|I bought these for my 2010 grand caravan which calls for 2504 bulbs and they did not fit.  The plug is close but it is reversed on the tabs that line up the plug.    They did however fit my 2010 avalanche perfectly.  They look cool, but that is it.  They shine no light on the actual road.  Normal bulbs send out all of the light from one exact spot.  These led lights sent out light from a large area,  therfore the light does not go where it is supposed to.      I rewired my fog lights for daytime running lights so I'm going to keep using them.  Again they do look cool!      UPDATE. ..    one bulb has already burnt-out.  They have been slowly going out for a while now and one bulb is completely out.  Not very impressed for only having these on my truck for only 12,000 miles.  The old bulbs last way longer than that.  Changing review down a few stars.
B0076HVHWK|1|Want even the right piece. When I wanted to return it the shipping was more then I paid for the whole product. Total waste of money.
B005CI8Y58|5|Very light weight compared to steel and beautifully finished.  Seems to resist wear well at the ball too.  Looks great
B00A1AX1VE|5|Added a nice look to my truck
B00823FSRC|5|Great option for the price.
B00FHN4FIS|3|Nice looking and well put together but it sits up really high on the shifter and there's not much you can do to lower it. The packaging was horrible! It came in a plastic container, which would normally have been fine, but the plastic was tore and they put packaging tape over it and called it good. Thankfully it wasn't damaged at all but still...
B00Q3UOGI8|3|Bought these for a 2015 Honda Grom. The packaging was beat to hell. And there was some cosmetic damage on the paint finish of the mirrors and hardware. But they do fit nice on the factory bar insert saving from needing to drill the insert out of the bars.
B003K20JXI|5|Like the good old days
B0042DROFK|5|I've had this solar panel for some time and it and the included 7 amp controller work great. It charges my RV battery much faster than the 15 watt single panel it replaced. I can run my stereo all day and the 30 watt solar panel keeps the battery fully charged. It's also very nice that it conveniently folds in half saving space when storing in the RV.<br />One note about the Amazon product video; the instructions that accompanied the controller clearly indicate that you should hook the controller to the battery FIRST before attaching the solar panel to the controller.<br />Instruction manual states;<br />\\"Always connect charge controller to battery first and remove last. Observe polarity - positive to positive and negative to negative\\".<br />The aforementioned Amazon product video has you WRONGLY connecting the solar panel to the controller before hooking the controller to the battery. I know from personal experience that hooking it up in this order does something to the controller and both the amber and green LEDs come on simultaneously and there is no charging occuring.
B00E0LI09S|5|Backup light for my RZR. Compact and lights up the local area fine.
B004NJ1KPS|5|Great gloves. Rode over 24k miles this year with these gloves in temps up to 110. They fit great too.
B00KWM6730|5|Our 2015 Hyandai Elantra came with factory floor mats that were so well made and quite honestly better material IMO than the actual carpet. I wanted to protect them from dirt and debris so I ordered these floor mats. They fit our car perfectly without having to be trimmed. At the time I ordered there was an option of color and I was able to match the gray interior of our car.
B000E2APP4|5|Took about 2 minutes to install. I definitely noticed an increase in horsepower. I recommend this to everyone looking. K&N makes a great product
B00PLBB8GI|5|In perfect condition and made replacement easy
B00IO9BLL6|5|They took away the shaking and has a lot better stopping like em
B008BC8A8I|5|I do a lot of towing these mirrors works great i just wish there was a power option to flip them up and down
B001TXWNLQ|5|good product
B000KZ23LY|1|I bought this as a last resort because I never minded just using my key. However, my key no longer works as the door lock is falling apart from the inside. I have to get into my car through the passenger door, which is especially a pain when it's raining outside (which is often, since it's summer in Florida.) I purchased this and received it within 4 business days. The instructions that came with it, though, aren't programming it. I have yet to go to Honda to see if they can take care of it.<br />**EDIT**<br />I went to Honda and asked them to program it.  I WAS SOLD THE WRONG KEY FOB and ended up buying one for $80 at the dealer to make sure I got the right one and it was programmed successfully.
B00B1G8GJO|3|The front seat covers were pretty simple and went on easily. The back bench seat was a different story. One of the fastener buckles ripped right off as I was trying to snug it up. It left a frayed seam in its place which will probably come apart in the future. There was no way to insert the seat belt buckles so the bench cover won't tuck in between the seats very well. I am not able to lift out the seat so there is no way to secure the bench seat cover at the front or the back. My dogs will surly keep pulling the sear cover to and fro.  Iam sure that the back bench seat cover will need to be replaced very soon. Will not but this product again.
B000GD5FMY|1|Very poor quality
B003SYE1CS|5|Fit my 1989 Nissan D21 Pickup perfectly, just what I needed, exactly what I got, easy to install, works great!
B00SLNEMJ8|5|Works like a champ!
B00AU85Y58|5|fits well and keeps cargo area free from debris. Perfect solution to problems with sugar sand and anything that retains water.
B002QSHIEU|3|The item I received doesn't look like the strap shown in the picture. It's yellow in color and may be just a generic, made in China, version of the same thing. I'll give it 3 stars as I haven't had a chance to use it yet. If it fails to do the job as I expect it to, I will update my review with fewer stars. Until then, I'm not spending any time and money on returning it. Just a heads up for buyers of this item from the same seller.
B00075OSC4|5|Just had to replace the set of two Optima Redtops in my Cummins Diesel pickup.<br />They were 12 years old!!! One is now powering an electric fence, the other a small Kubota tractor.<br />Who knows how long they might last doing those easy jobs.<br />Wasn't sure if I should buy Redtops for replacements, they might last longer than the rest of the truck but decided what the heck, I hate dealing with corrosion, these have absolutely none.
B004G08K9I|5|Excellent!
B000V9ATEW|4|I can only rate this like it, because I don't &#34;love&#34; it - it is just a trailer stabilizing jack!  It does work great, provides the stability we needed, and husband had no trouble attaching it.
B00E1J5Q00|5|Just amazing !
B001DCF81A|5|Easy to install! works great.<br /><br />These lift supports were easy to install. It took less than 5 minutes from start to finish, including the time to open the box they came in.<br /><br />Basic steps are to use a flat blade screwdriver to list the metal clip that is on the old ones while slightly pulling on them to have them release. Once they are removed, you can then simply snap the new ones into place.<br /><br />The initial push to lower my hood was a little stiff, however, after the first time, they work as I would expect. This behavior is expected by me since they have been in the out position since manufacturing and the internal seals needed to be moved/lubricated by simply moving the rods in/out
B00BQMJT7G|5|Fit 2002 magnum 325
B00HAG5RMS|4|I love the decals, I put them on my hard gun case and gun safe at my house
B002OMLEAC|5|Look nice
B00Q1EKHK2|5|loved it
B004PHDLQY|5|Had some issues on my '02 VW where the turn signal sound would continue intermittently after it should have turned off.  Sprayed some of this stuff into the base of the signal lever and haven't had the problem since!  On the other hand, I sprayed it on my MAF and now the MAF is fouled up... it was most likely fouled to begin with though, so no points deducted.
B007SB49RE|5|LOVE IT
B000GTXS2C|5|Best one on the market for the price.
B004ZF1YAQ|5|Good quality.  Perfect fit for my SV650S.
B0009IQZPW|5|Love it. easy to use and they make my tires shine bright like a diamond.
B006K8VHU8|5|Great value with excellent field of view.
B001KOBBAS|4|Bought this for my 2013 Rhino.  Clamped on to the roll cage just fine.  Going down the trail, the vibrations do make for a fuzzy image, but what do you expect?  UTV's vibrate! You can still see if the D.N.R., Bigfoot, or another ATV/UTV is running up quick on your rear deck, which is all I needed.  Decent for the money, shipped quick, and I recommended it to my riding buddies.
B0039Z2100|1|Don't order this stuff unless you don't care what color you get. I ordered expecting black, white showed up, and Amazon won't let you return hazmat materials. So now I'm stuck with a $10 can of white exhaust paint that won't be used! My one star rating is not based on the paint itself but on the ordering process and description of item. No color selection was available when I ordered and I was expecting black being that it is exhaust paint. Who paints exhaust white!?!
B009IK9RXO|2|It seams to make cars look farther away or it may be me. Does not work for me.
B007OY7FZS|5|These wheels look awesome on my trailer. It makes it shine.
B00464GNZW|5|These work very well. Squeak when accidentally turned on while windshield is dry, but so do all well fitting wipers.
B00171ZH2C|5|My brother had one on his dodge and I wanted one on my Ford. It arrived timely, in perfect shape, well packed, mounted without too much difficulty for me (had my mechanic do it!) and I put a couple of PIAA lights on it for good measure. Hides about half my front license plate (Ford Ecoboost plates mount off-center) so if a copper eventually complains I will have to mount the plate with the accessory mounting bracket Westin sells separately.
B0051ZHPRK|5|i didnt feel like spending extra to get the exact match for my car but i figured this one would work and it does. it will also work for all g bodys. ie: el camino, monte carlo, grand national, malibu, ect ect. in the 1978-1987 vintage.
B0001L0DFA|5|I don't know if I got one of these nozzles before they started manufacturing in China or if I am just lucky but I have had minimal problems with this nozzle.  This nozzle is well worth the $20+ I paid for it several years ago.  I have left it for long periods of time with pressure on the hose and it held like a drum.  I have done zero preventative maintenance on this nozze such as spraying with WD40 as suggested by another review.  I have had only two maintenance issues with the nozzle that required disassembly.  The first problem involved a very unlucky little lizard (Anole) that we have all over the place on the Texas Gulf Coast.  The hapless lizard though the nozzle would be a great new home.  That was until I picked up the nozzle and closed it.  After that I had to disassemble the nozzle to clean out the carnage.  The second incident involved some dirt that got into the nozzle and adversly affected the spray pattern.  Again, I disassembled the nozzle, cleaned out the thrash and things were as good as new.
B005ZFB7RU|5|This is my second one. Last time I broke the original mirror and this time it was someone in a parking lot.<br /><br />I install it differently than their instructions. Since the cracked mirror was still solidly in place with just about a dozen vertical cracks, I just glued the new mirror on top of the old one using fresh GE Premium Waterproof Silicone - clear. Do NOT use one of the instant glues as they get brittle and road vibrations will result in the mirror falling out.<br /><br />Last time I went through the trouble of removing the old mirror and it probably took me 3-4 hours in total. This time, including the cleaning time (thoroughly cleaned the old mirror and the back of the new one with denatured alcohol) it was about 5-10 minutes.
B0074S7F5O|5|I mean, it's a black Nike sticker, came fast, looks great on my longboard, what else would you want to know?
B000JFL8K2|5|I have used this set for the past three days working on a dodge caravan and have never been happier with a purchase than I am now. I am able to lift the rear and place the jacks in a quarter or less of the time it used to take me to get it off the ground. I used it to replace all my suspension and I believe I have saved myself in the vicinity of 2 hours by using this pack. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I do.
B003PVJWIW|5|yes it always is beer thirty! great for homes, man caves and gifts.
B000NWA8HU|5|Awesome product. Love it.
B00PSRORH2|5|The quality of the packing and product are top notch. This is the cutest sun shade out there. It does a fabulous job keeping the sun out and the car cool. I love the cute graphics. Really pleased with this purchase. Thank you a ton..
B005FUU7EY|5|Great light way better than blue LEDs
B003JIEWF4|3|when I touch the gas my tires spin but other than that not much difference.
B009D32AAI|5|works great fast shipping
B00K8VQEF6|5|Warning: THIS IS A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO GET ON! But once it's on and your fingers and arms are done tugging/adjusting you will love it. It looks fantastic with the rest of the punisher car set and its really detailed.
B000CF6SAO|4|Perfect fit for my 2011 gmc canyon. The in channel design gives them a nice sleek look. Would have been 5 stars but there were a few small scratches on one of the visors from the shipping.
B000IE0EZO|4|So, don't place your thumb over the pin hole and push down. Basic pilot error on my part, I visually misunderstood how the glass-breaker worked, so learn from my mistake. No blood, but, like, ow. I'm just sayin...   For the seat belt cutter, the best way to deploy it is to actually put the key ring onto the end piece. Then, when you want to uncover the blade, hook your finger through the key ring, hold the other end with your other hand, and pull. It pops right off with a moderate amount of force. It's never coming off accidentally, but it does come off when you want it to.   Like I said, I haven't needed it yet, but I can tell you that the pin went though about 7 sheets of thick notebook paper and left an indentation on the next 4, so I'm betting that much concentrated force against a window would do the job. Very light, too, and easy to carry.   If I do need this, and it fails, and I die as a result, I'll edit this review and take off a few stars.
B000MXYVEQ|5|very handy tool
B00MF7M6CQ|5|Very fast shipping and worked great
B0023VP0TA|5|Well you just can't drive around without a tail light ... so I have very pleased to have it in my car! Product looks good and works great!
B000CJ20T8|5|Great lightweight easy to get in and out when not in use.
B006LO6PRG|5|very good battery i use it for my boat lite and many other things while camping dont no how long the battery will hold up well see
B000CAVE5S|5|Perfect fit, excellent shipping and delivery
B004MBSEQA|5|they save my rim from scratches since i change my tires at home. Also very slippery which makes installation easier.
B003JHBM1M|3|Cut-Out pattern allows you to fit these just about anywhere. I cut them up for my 2013 Explorer and the front was a bit of a chore and I had to cut past the pre-cut allowances. The back ones I just put in - they cover 90% of the rear floor. It offers good floor protection from abrasives and dry debris, but it lacks the surrounding rubber that's included on the laser-cut models for obvious reasons. For this reason, they would offer poor protection against any drink spills etc, and I find their application a bit limited.
B009M7JRV0|5|The first thing I noticed was how rugged these mini led light bars are when I took them out of the box. A nice aluminum housing that feels very solid. Each led bar came with a nice mounting bracket that should fit a standard mounting tab. I wired a pair of these mini led light bars as side lights on my 1996 JEEP ZJ roof rack for the trail riding at night and wow they are very very bright. When you see 15 watts remember that is not how bright they are but how much power they require. At 1150 lumens these mini led bars really put out the light, far brighter than I would have thought for such a small package. So bright you can't look directly at them when turned on. These worked out great for what i wanted them for and In fact I just ordered another one of these and have plans to wire it into my reverse lights and mount it under my rear bumper onto the hitch mount of my daily driver to help light my way when going in reverse.
B007R9ST7I|1|This hitch hangs under the exhaust and looks foolish. See how it looks on YouTube, just type in the part number. You will be disappointed.
B00PUWVMBE|5|This stuff really works...try it on your shower door!
B00J1182Z4|5|excellent
B00DSJ9P56|5|Great for holding my ashtray!!!
B003YCGLJK|2|Window cleaners do not buy these!!!!! I have been a window cleaner for 14 years and always used huck towels because they are lint free and absorb water well, but these do not. They streak because of poor water absorption, almost like they have a waxy coating. They are good quality for odds and ends or shop towels only.
B001QWTT6C|5|A great addition to my auto.  I was certainly not disappointed in the sunscreen.  It does a nice job of keeping our 5 o'clock setting winter sun out of our eyes.  Nice work!!
B00FBKUF6I|5|So far so good for me. Put them in my 98 legacy outback and it gave me the bright lighting i was looking for
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great on all cars ive used it  on so far,no issues.I use  this with torque pro on android.
B0022YNBTE|5|Just used it this weekend.
B00I57YT2K|5|Nice custom feel for my 2015 Toyota Tacoma,color matches interior perfectly, and fitment was spot on.
B004UL5RUI|5|good ~:)
B00HCYTPEY|5|Got this for my wifes car for mothers day. Easy to install and looks GREAT. She loves it and it's pretty cool  :)
B00KAF2KQW|1|Cheap sticker. Doesn't seem like it will last long as an outside window.
B00GRZ69R0|4|Great product. Bright lights and very strong magnets make this perfect for plowing on windy, snowy, overcast days.<br /><br />Only downside is the length of the power cord; if it were just a couple of feet longer I'd be able to tuck it out if the way of my passengers.
B002WP362U|2|Unless your Dynamat is visible, save your money and buy regular old aluminum tape for 1/3 the cost. They are exactly the same, except you are paying more money to advertise for Dynamat. Like the $60 Tommy Hilfiger t-shirt that says &#34;Tommy Hilfiger&#34;. They got you to pay an outrageous amount for a $10 shirt, and then on top of that you walk around advertising for therm for free. Don't Be A Sucker like me!
B009DJPGQW|4|received this item on time and in good condition with no damage. have not installed yet due to weather. product seems of good quality.
B002OR4242|5|Nice unit, a little hard to replace since battery cables come in at a different location along with the damage the Paralax converter caused when it went up in smoke. Very well constructed and American made, five more stars for that!
B0016GRTVU|3|The length color ease of use were excellent but the width of the head could have been wider as I use that part to push snow off my car.
B002P8LWDO|5|I installed the mirror on a 2004 Toyota Corolla CE and had no problems (I am not mechanically inclined). The mirror is also very clear and the image is sharp, I would urge anyone contemplating this purchase and hesitating fearing a &#34;fun-house&#34; type mirror to order it anyway because it appears the mirror quality has improved.
B000HUN7YO|3|never installed. I do not know if these are good or not
B0073MFQZ2|5|I was very wary about ordering this radiator since some of the well known brands go for over $500. I got it, looked it over and set it right down into the rubber pads it sits on. Everything lined up including the trans cooler lines.I got it installed and filled with coolant and started the engine. It took it quite a while to come up to temp and when it reached 190 my fan came on and it started dropping immediately and quickly. If you have a C4 Corvette you can order this one with confidence.
B001L5BYV2|5|This is just the perfect accent for the doors on our car! It really dresses it up, and looks great! Easy to install, high quality --- looks so much nicer than the picture shown here. We're really happy with the results!
B000C8R904|5|Seems to be good quality, fits like the original, hardware was all there and I guess time will tell. Almost forgot, its more attractively priced than the GM dealer part although I did get six new exhaust manifold bolts from the dealer.
B002S14RNU|5|This item was exactly what was advertised by the seller. Great quality product, I am very happy and my car looks great!
B0000CBJE7|1|The item shown on the web page  I chose did NOT arrive as shown. I decided NOT to pursue this and tollerate the frustration involved. Next time... send the item AS SHOWN!!!
B006YW6OKI|5|We purchased these in preparation of the winter season and so far so good. The product fit perfectly in our MDX and we couldn't be happier.
B0001MQ7DG|4|I have a 2007 Volvo XC-90 and have been looking for a cooler that was small enough to fit in the corner of the truck yet big enough to cool a few bottles of water. I had looked at the OEM from volvo and after all said and done it would cost well over $400 for the entire solution. I ran across this guy whcih actually looked the same as the Volvo cooler and decided to try it out.<br /><br />PROS:<br /> - Very compact and fits nicely in the storage area in the truck<br />- Cools down very well as long as you have another item in the cooler that is cold. It makes the cooler chill down pretty fast and keeps the items chilled.<br />- Perfect for day getaways and returning to the truck to get some nice chilled water.<br />- Easy to use. If you want cold you flip the power cord one way and if you want hot you flip it the other way<br />- Saved a boat load of money for exactly what i needed to do, drink some cold water when i come back to my truck from a a few hours outside or at the beach/park.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Takes some time to cool the items inside if you dont have chilled already.<br />- I had to purchase the power saver cord which allows me to shut the truck off but still keep the unit running without having to worry about my truck battery being dead when i come back. AWESOME and a must have for this type of thing. WOuld have been nice feature to have built in.<br />- Cant tell when you have the heater on. You have to touch the coil to see if its hot.<br /><br />Overall the only reason i gave it a 4 star was because its missing some nice to have features.
B00651CLCS|5|I replaced my stock antenna with this little black one. It was simple to swap out, looks great and gets good reception.
B002E58QNM|5|fit perfectly and was very easy to swap out, fixed the error code I was getting on my 2012 Chevy Traverse for less than $20
B00DE9KY1O|5|Black magic protectant is the best in my book, great smelling too. I cant understand the negative reviews of this fine product.  I buy it by the case and use it on everything.
B005DJRHOA|5|Awesome product.  This is my 2nd  set from AVS. Lasted for 5 years before they started to degrade. Will buy again for my next car.
B000BYELQY|5|Work really well and would highly recommend. Replaced the original BMW blades with these and are just as good and might even be better then those.
B007RW3KJM|5|Far better than the $48 quoted at Jiffy Lube !!<br /> .. just takes seconds to put in, simple for even the most mechanically inclined.<br />Save yourself a bunch of bucks<br />YES recommended
B000BYB2K2|5|This is the perfect replacement for old wore out blades. The preform equally well in snowy weather. Better than snow blades.
B002MQDY4O|4|Second one I've bought through amazon. Does the trick, but these replacements do seem to wear out quicker than their original counterparts, hence the 4 stars. That being said the price is low and you can order as many as you need to keep the car opening/shutting normally.
B009NLMXNO|5|This is really a well made harness that fits the bill wiring my off road LED light bar. It comes with everything necessary to complete the installation of a light bar.  Very happy with the purchase.
B003BYICIY|4|I like the way they fit and look, haven't had them very long so not so sure of durablity, but I like them so far.
B0085FOWVK|1|Missing an extension pipe :(
B0045XO0LS|5|I used this light to replace my map lights on my RAV4, This will be my third set of LEDs in the map light socket, since the cost is kind of low I figured I try one more type.  My second set is the type with 4 side LEDs and one top LED.  The do work fine and produced a clean white ~6000K light, but I could see most of the light was focused to the sides.  The space is white plastic so you do get reflections but it would need to be mirrored of lined with foil to really help focus more light into the car.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought two of these LED down facing T10 SMD 5050 and hoped that having all the LEDs facing downwards would give me more light.  WOW, what a difference, it almost too bright when they turn on.  The light is not 6000K [blue white] but more like 5000K [full spectrum], at first I did not care for the light color but its output is so much better 10X brighter in the space it is NOT a deal breaker, the wife doesn't like the intense brightness so I know they must be ok ☺.  I am going see if this company has any other LEDs light to upgrade the back hatch
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Almost identical to hihger priced lights. Looks&works great on my brush guard, so bright it will fry your eyeballs to rasins! Tech tip.seal lens with rtv or silicone before installation, to guarantee water proof. Like it alot!
B000MZXRZ8|2|Added this to my CJ7.  I have no reason to believe it isn't accurate, but the needle is all over the place when driving down the road.  If you're installing in a car application it may be better since I am running on knobby 35's but I didn't expect it to bounce around so much.
B001MX315U|4|They are great. Looks good and easy to install.  The 1 thing that I did was clean the handles with alcohol first. Then the installation. Done easy..
B002PYBZJO|4|Does not do everything and is not the easiest to use but for the price its hard to beat. The OBD2 port is the most important part of this as you can use any program with it to diagnose a car.
B000VU56Z8|5|This mat fit perfectly in my 2010 F-150 supercrew with 6 1/2 foot bet. The price was unbeatable even compared to some used mats. The shipping was free and fast, it said it would take 8-10 days 3 days later it was at my door.
B000C427MI|5|These are great filters, never had a failure and engine problem with these in my car.  I use with Ford and GM vehicles, nut on filter makes installation and removal simple.
B001U04MHG|4|I like the product and the way it handles. It has an overall positive rating and just cannot believe the overall positive outcome
B00D9BFR8M|4|This fits over my Kawasaki Vulcan 1500 Classic with full bags. It is huge and will fit almost any bike from what I can see
B0007VM3D4|5|Great fit. Great quality.
B001FCPMF0|5|Much easier to keep clean than the original painted covers.  I had already broke one of the original covers and was easily able to attach the chrome cover to the morror chassis.
B000FOIJXQ|3|I purchased this product to darken some fading plastic on my Chrysler 300C.  As most people looking at this product probably know; black plastic molding fades and on a black car can stand out.  The strips of plastic on either side of my windshield were faded and the rough surface of these pieces held the color from this product very well.  The product worked exactly as described in this area and I was very pleased.  I decided to use the product on the plastic panels that fall between the front and rear windows (look up a picture of a Chrysler 300C to know what I am talking about).  The product claims it works great on all forms of plastic, however on this smooth plastic the results were terrible!  It took many careful applications to reduce the streaking caused by this product.  Also, it should be noted that the product works by putting pressure on an attached sponge to release it and this creates tons of tiny bubbles which show up and must be carefully smoothed out.  Although time consuming, I was able to eventually get it to look pretty good and was happy with the results.  Not one day later the product began to peel in this area and the result was worse than the faded plastic I began with by far.  Not wanting to mess anything up further, I contacted the company and was told that they are aware of the problem but continue to market the product as suitable for all types of plastic.  The representative's suggestion was to clean the area with Simple Green and reapply.  If the problem persisted, I could attempt to remove it with rubbing alcohol, but making sure not to get the rubbing alcohol on the car's paint as it could damage the paint.  My advice:  Be careful with this product as it only works well in certain situations...<br /><br />3/13/2012 Update:  I reapplied the product after writing the intitial review.  After several months, the second application has held up and I am satisfied with the results.
B00098PO3G|5|perfect
B00MQACSX4|5|Very pleased with product.
B006W3ZOXC|4|Love the graphic on this helmet.  The only thing is that it sticks out on the sides, similar to a motorcycle cop's helmet but I guess that's to be expected?  It is well made and looks like it would do it's job in a crunch.  It's just not quite as cool being that &#34;thick&#34;.  I still kept it though cuz I have a bike with the same color scheme and graphics so it is a must have for me.
B00CD7EN9M|1|First one did not work, replacement did not work either.
B00A6WQKNS|5|Needed antifreeze on hand for first Mercedes Benz automobile and was able to find it on line easier than contacting the dealership.
B005ESHUGK|5|My daughter uses these for her knee braces that she has to wear to play soccer. They help keep a cushion between the brace<br />and knee. Her skin does not break out anymore. Great purchase.
B00171VUYG|4|Valley Tow Reciever so far has been a good product. Installation took about 30-45min not too bad.  Purchased to allow the installation of a cargo carrier instead of using a roof mount cargo carrier. This gave me at least 5 more miles to the gallon compared to roof mount.
B0009N0W6U|3|Works as advertised.  Bright blue light.  Bought it for my 2010 tundra.  Make sure you do not have direct line of sight with the light, it is very distracting otherwise.  Quality if good for the price
B000B8N3MS|5|fit my 2002 dodge neon perfectly
B00EJFH6YA|5|great product very easy to install and mounting brackets make it to were you can place almost anywhere on your vehicle. do recommend taking sides off and putting clear silicone for extra sealant just to be on the safe side.
B001XV8P0C|1|We ordered three of these batteries. They came in three separate containers - two boxes and one envelope. Some type of packaging insert was only included in one box - there was nothing in the other box or the envelope. One of the boxes wasn't even completely sealed. All three packages had significant holes in them (could fit two to three fingers through each of the holes), you could see the batteries without even opening the packaging, etc. All three batteries were damaged beyond the point of being able to use them. Extremely disappointed in Amazon with this transaction. Thankfully, the lady in customer service was very nice and offered a reimbursement. It is a few dollars more, but I'd take your business to digikey and order them there. We've never had a problem with them. In trying to save money by using Amazon, we have ended up with a huge headache.
B005V67NC6|4|Simple yet perfect way to show school pride. Sturdy metal, bright color, not as bold and big to stand out around my license plate but still a Great buy. Love it.
B00IJQOJ7M|5|good product..
B00FITCHEA|5|I've used several different boot cleaners, this one is great and leaves my boots smelling amazing like fresh out of the box.
B003NX2F90|5|Can not go anywhere without getting compliments on the lights. I recommend these to anyone who asks about them, by far, it a far superior product for a much better price than say lizard lights or others. As long as you read the install in structions and have at least a decent mechanical aptitude, u can't go wrong.
B00I87EDXW|5|Perfect fit
B0084DNXWC|5|I used it to replace the original 3.3 L 1999 Dodge Caravan dipstick so it's all good.  Very cheap and good enough!!
B004X4BE2M|2|The item seemed brand new but had a chip in the paint/ polish which looked like if I didn't seal it, the rest would peel off.
B00KTE0P2A|5|Excellent. It works perfectly and could be coded once.
B001D8TGJE|5|Bought this for scrubbing the house while power washing, worked great. Fits in 5 gallon bucket too which is a plus.
B00GHR8TTE|4|You'd think for the price they could include new nuts for installation, but that's my only complaint.
B0015Y80U2|5|Fits Very Well.
B003O7EJ0I|4|First, the automated ship notices were misleading because item did NOT actually ship until much later than indicated; simply entering ship details does not equal shipment. Seller, don't lie about shipping date please! HOWEVER, the item is GREAT! Although onboard comp codes & VOM did Not indicate several bad coils, there were. A full set of coils immediately solved all rough running on '98 4.6L ford \\"W\\" motor. I have two cars w/ that V8 motor; got this set of ten coils & have two spare coils remaining. The coils are packed securely and fit perfectly. The coils themselves may be, but don't count on any ship date as reliable.
B00ACASQ0E|5|I've had this helmet now for quite awhile. I forgot to rate it earlier. For the money, it's fantastic. I own 5 helmets and each one has various uses. (Passengers, summer vs cold weather riding, etc.). Since I've had this helmet, I haven't needed any of the others I own for myself. My wife now has her own helmet, so the rest collect dust. Why? This helmet is great in all conditions. The built in sun visor removes the need for riding glasses. In the mornings, if it's a little chilly, I drop the face shield and turn it into a full face helmet. After work when it's warmer, I raise the face shield and enjoy the cooler helmet. It has drop in pockets for my Bluetooth speakers, so I can listen to music while I ride. Best part? The cost. I know you can spend hundreds on a helmet. Why? For protection, as long as it's DOT approved...helmets provide the same coverage. This helmet is comfortable, affordable, and durable.
B00HVNUUYA|5|These gloves kept my hands nice and warm through this past winter's freezing temps while riding on my motorcycle, all the way to the tips of my fingers!  Wind chill no longer kept me from riding on days when the roads were clear of ice and snow!
B00651CLCS|4|This was a quick replacement for the oversize OEM monster on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Sport.  FM and Satellite work great but the AM stations are not coming in well at all now.  I hardly ever listen to AM so no big loss for me, but others might want to keep looking if they want to be able to tune in AM.
B006VC8UI0|3|Works as it should and high quality with a NOT so subtle attempt at advertising on the product.  I think it is a solid product and I use it everytime I get under my BMW but it seems over priced for a metal puck.  Could probably create a very suitable replacement out of scrap wood that works just as well.
B000CNAO9W|4|Excellent product thank you for your work.
B000C9R1D8|4|fit perfect no issues
B002L15W6S|4|Very colorfully lots of complements on it sturdy no tearing like some
B00EAOIR8O|5|Great product and half the price of what the dealer charges you.  I change this out myself in my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Take only 5minutes.  View the how-to video online.  Very simple.
B000C71IQ6|5|Great quality bolt. I rounded off a badly rusted calilper bolt trying to remove it from my Nissan Rogue's caliper.  Bought an Irwin &#34;bolt-out&#34; kit (amzn.com/B0000CCXVZ) to get that little sucker out.  Then replaced it with this once and added lots of caliper grease to ensure it doesn't happen again.  Thanks.
B0083H4SMI|5|Easy fit for my 2000 suburban and mirrors move now!
B001D93D5Q|5|These bulbs are super bright.  I replaced the high and low beam bulbs in Jeep Grand Cherokee and noticed a big difference.  Much brighter light that seems to illuminate the road much farther ahead of the car than the originals.
B007TGDWDK|5|perfect stays on and looks great i wish it look a bit better as far as the regular symbol but over all pretty good and shipped super fast. easy epplication
B001H1P038|5|Matched the color matched year everything was as it was said to be and was shipped quickly
B001DMFPU4|5|I installed this on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler in about 1 hour.  Install went smooth, directions were great and matching this with my Acclaim tow bar makes for easy connect and disconnect. All positive and nothing negative.
B000E6KNCA|1|I was happy to find a Remy starter at a good price and free shipping with Amazon prime.  I installed it in my 63 Vette.  When I turned the key nothing.  No solenoid and of course no starter motor.  It pegged my amp gauge completely to the negative side.  A dead short across my battery.  I cleaned up the old one and reinstalled it for now.
B000KFQ4DC|5|Ordered for my 2005 Mercedes e500 to protect the beige interior mats. On my last car, I spent $100 for the similar custom cut clear mats for Acura 3.5RL. I normally don't mind spending extra money to get a quality product but Amazon normally comes thru with a good product.  This was no different, mats are high quality thick and fit perfect-these mats are wonderful! Perfect fit and they arrived in 2 business days without paying for upgraded shipping. I'm very happy and they look great. If you have an expensive car, you need to get these to protect your interior. In fact, at this price you should buy these if you drive a 1986 Toyota ;) People are always going to be dragging dirt into your car and these will protect your investment for short money.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I was only going to get the front two mats for this price ($45). I got all 4! Really great deal here folks, everywhere else these will cost you $70-$100 + shipping. I don't know how Amazon does it, these came in a huge box and must have cost $30 to ship. Thanks Amazon for a great deal and great service!
B00LU4U5QE|5|I have been using this product on my boat the last couple weeks after the river or lake and it has been working great! Cuts through the water spots and adds a good shine. Seems to make it even easier to clean next time… Last weekend a sand storm came through and left a mess throughout the boat… Only took a matter of minutes and I had it all wiped down and ready. I can say I will be buying this product again.!
B00LWKO7C4|2|The lights look great, but I had two of them loose a row or two of the nine led's per fixture go out. Amazon refunded me for the first one, which was great,  but the manufacturer would not sell me just one fixture. Since then, another fixture lost a row of led's. So I ordered another set of 5 light fixtures now and I am going to replace the two bad one's. The whole situation has been a pain, considering tbat I had to remove fragile trim pieces and pull the headliner down again. I want to warn you before you drill holes through your perfectly fine cab sheet metal.
B00BCRMAAS|1|The front seat was good but the back seat the cover did not fit
B00L4EJ36S|4|This key works great for my 2011 Fusion.  It looks and functions like my fiances VW Jetta key.  The flip is sturdy and strong and once programmed all the buttons work exactly like the OEM key.  The only negative was I had trouble finding a place to cut the key.  I had to go to 3 places before I found one willing and able to cut it.  Also the range seems less than the OEM fob, but that may just be due to a low battery.  All in all I am very happy with this item.
B004A2YEUQ|5|Great price good product
B000KPU8F2|3|Too Soon To Tell
B001TI3EEG|2|They advertise this stuff as a long lasting tire shiner and protector. However, it doesn't last and no matter how little I put on the tire, it slings off onto my freshly waxed and polished vehicle. I was hoping I had found the miracle tire shine that would not ruin my work done to clean my car but I guess I will keep looking.
B00FB3MT7S|5|Gotta let ppl know
B002SS5Z6G|4|This works but is not made of tough materials a professional would expect and so the life will be limited.
B002FKK41S|5|I have a 2007 Toyota Solara Convertible which had etching on the top part of the head light lens.  Using just a plastic spray polish did not make any improvement.  I used half the kit and my headlight look like new.  I would highly recommend this product.
B002XM5G70|4|extremely satisfied with the gpm and the quietness of this unit. I live off grid an it accommodated my 1000' ft cabin. kitchen,bath an outdoor shower. I would buy another.
B001OXZ1IS|2|This DID NOT fit my Sirius radio, like it says it would. But, I cut the end off and put another plug on that fit in my radio. Kind of b/s having to do that though, oh well, the rest of it worked anyway! Just not as advertised, and I needed it working. So I didn't have time to send it back and deal with something else.
B007HRT5JQ|4|IT IS GOOD FOR LITE DUTY.  DEFINITELY NOT A HEAVY DUTY, RUGGED FLOOR MAT, BUT IT WILL DEFINITELY HELP WITH DIRT, DEBRIS AND SMALL SPILLS.  LOOKS NICE AND GOOD FIT.
B0041LN1L4|5|I have these on all three of my cars. I get some looks but it helps when parking on the street or in a deck with a wall in front of your car.
B00VV7NJX6|5|Quality was better, than others, said, was there best !<br /> For the price, I could not ask for better !
B00068XCQU|4|It was fair
B003YI1784|5|Great mats! Fit my 2012 Altima SL perfectly. Durable, great fit, and better than OEM. I bought these as a replacement for my stock carpet mats and I am very happy with my purchase.
B00D509S8M|5|glued on new rims and they look great!!!
B00BNR84WA|1|The control module failed after 20 minutes. Left me stranded on the highway.
B000COB0T4|5|As Advertised. These ceramic pads provide excellent stopping power, yields low dust, and out lasts many other brands of ceramic pads that I have use in the past. I drive in NYC with plenty of stop & go traffic, and these pads definitely handle what I put them through. I will continue to purchase Hawk Performance Ceramic Brake Pads in the future.
B003S8CMYI|3|After I bought these transponder keys I learned that no one in Durango, Colorado wants the responsibility of cutting and programming after-market keys.  So I ended up buying keys from the Toyota dealer.
B00HW8XNKW|5|Very awesome rack for the money! Fits my 98 jeep grand cherokee.
B00O83MPTY|3|Fast shipment. Looks great. Only one (1) bulb very dim. Not sure why. Other then that great.
B00JZ597VO|4|I wish that I could have gotten it at a larger size but I was unable to find it larger.
B001AF0Z36|5|This is the best money I have ever spent. Works very well.
B007Y5CO4Y|1|I can't believe I spent over $30 for this thing!  Yes, it does fit my SAAB windshield, but there is too big of a cut-out for the rear-view mirror, and it doesn't stay in place very well.  The roll-up aspect, which I thought would be cool, is the WORST.  It's like alligator wrestling in your car.  I tried creasing the shade in pleats so I could fold it up like a conventional shade, but the creases didn't take.  Finally I started folding it in half before attempting to roll it, and that made it a little quicker to take down, but it's still this gigantic, inflexible roll filling up my backseat when not in use.  The insulation value is no better than a shade you'd buy at the local big-box for $9.95.  I feel really stupid for getting this.  Don't make the same mistake I made.
B0051D3MP6|1|Would not recommend. At first no lights would turn on at all. A different charger that I bought at a local retailer works on the same battery. After unplugging a few times the lights actually turn on but it indicates the battery is charged. A half dozen more unplug / plugs, it finally starts charging then after about five minutes the &#34;reversed polarity&#34; indicator turns on, despite the fact that the clamps are on the correct leads.<br /><br />I unfortunately bought this late last year and didn't test it since I borrowed one from a friend in the meantime so I wouldn't have to wait to cut my grass. Other reviews indicate a much more positive product experience but the best advice I can give is to test it as soon as the product is received so if you end up with a faulty unit it can still be returned or exchanged.
B000YPR4YG|5|Simple. Does what it says.  Holds three towels.  Just be sure to measure your door or cabinet so that it will fit in there.  I got a little lucky because I had enough space on my cabinet door for it to fit.....otherwise the door might not have shut.
B0041PWH88|5|Every bike should come with these, they look good, easy to install, great security item do not hesitate you wont regret.
B008RSD7Y8|5|These lights are great.  I like the glow in the dark ring around the LED.  Very easy to use.  Really great on the lowest light setting.
B001BNFY42|5|Quick delivery, great product
B00X0OXNOS|5|Installed on Ram Sport with the vented hood...it really makes it look bad-a
B000OKBCF8|3|This alarm system was installed on a 1999, 2000, and 2004 Honda Accord. This alarm is great for DIY installation. However, this alarm has been around since 2003, the first installation was completed on my 1999 accord. 8 years after, the alarm auto start continues to work great... The system comes with 3 programmable outputs (latched, pulse or momentary).  However, I just think this alarm is just old I would recommend researching before purchasing.   I'll give it three stars just because the product has been lasting a long time. But not 5 stars because this alarms been on the market for a long time while compared to others with newer technology.
B0085XV9JA|2|When i got this, I guess i didn't realize how small it was. I was disappointed with the size but that my fault because I did not pay attention to the sizing. However, I have tried to use it and it just falls off. It does not like to stay on the back of the seat. It would be perfect for looks, but not something you want if you want it to be functional.
B000BQQOAI|5|I NEED MAXIMUM PROTECTION against paint spills in my car because leather dyes which are kept in the cargo area of my sportwagon can spill but with the high edges of weather tech matts design any accidental spill is contained and easily picked up without a problem. The laser cut size specific is the key to a perfect fit utilizing all the provided space of storage in my vehicle, a new vw sportwagon TDI Diesel. I highly recommend  this cargo liner for any customer that wants protection,
B000BZEHZ8|5|the product was excellent and what i wanted it went right in the place of the old one with no problems.
B00EFFY46W|4|Good product looks good, but kind of flimsy Which is a downside.
B001PWA0IO|5|Product works great and was simple to install. Price was good and standard delivery was fast. Only minor issue (and this was not enough to even deduct a star) was that the package and instructions came for a Ford and I have a Chevy. It was easy to see that the product would not work if installed according to the instructions. Instead of mounting the top of the shock to the existing cable mount, it had to be moved up to the latch mount. But it fit perfectly there and works like a charm.
B005ETOM88|5|Vendor shipped on time . Product was complete and worked well material  being thick enough to hold in place while replacing cover{s} .<br />No oil leaks one month later .<br />Definitely recomend.
B009682KIW|4|I does look good and is pretty easy to install. However, it is a hair too big and overlaps a little. No biggie at this point, I just hope I was able to get the edges down it the crack.
B00B5NPL7I|5|Good
B001Q7WZY0|5|I love to work on my car. First, it was an upgrade from the factory-installed sound system to an aftermarket (Alpine) system. From there, I discovered the fun of aftermarket performance parts (cold-air intake, cat-back exhaust, etc.) and on, and on... However, while I don't mind spending a couple of intense hours detailing my engine compartment, for some reason, I do not, in any way, enjoy detailing the exterior. What can I say? It's my pathology; although, I've never allowed the dirt to build up between a quick wash and wax or a zip through the touchless car wash every month or so.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my car's previous owner wasn't too careful about mounting the bike-rack, so the trunk had some pretty deep score marks hastily covered over and I never noticed them until they started to bleed rust after it rained. It only required a light brushing with soap and water to flake off the disguise. This was when I began researching and purchasing tools and materials for repainting. NOT. FUN. Next time, I'll eat the $$$ for the Professionals to paint. My job was much better than ever anticipated and I am now wiser (now about the clay...)<br /><br />Of course, one time I neglected to mask off the car before I started spraying paint onto the trunk and some unknown law of physics caught that paint and deposited it all over the roof. Thus began the research into over-spray removal, which is where I happened upon Beyond Clay. I read that detailer's clay was the best and safest way to remove the over-spray without damaging the original finish. But remember, I do not like scrubbing back and forth, which I had been doing with one of those clay bars. I was leaving (Company Information Removed) and saw a display with a BOTTLE that read, \\"CLAY.\\" So, I bought it, tried it (with the Black and Decker $29.99 super-sale Buffer and a bunch of new foam bonnets) and it took the bad stuff off in a couple of minutes. I did my entire car in less than an hour, where it would have taken me hours (plural) with the bar. I then followed it with a micro-compound and two coats of Liquid Glass and I find the prospect of washing and waxing far less irksome.<br /><br />I have, since purchasing the first bottle, bought another which I plan to use on the rest of my family's cars/SUVs/ETC. I am not disparaging the Clay Bar; I used one and it did an excellent job, I cannot deny that. However, using a bar requires one to spray lubricant with one hand, while rubbing with the other and you have to regularly examine the bar for any large particles which will cause worse scratching than one may already have. I am not so patient when it comes to that kind of thing. I found Beyond Clay to be much faster and much easier. It made me very happy and the cost is comparable.<br /><br />And, honestly, spot-treat the scratch; set aside whatever it requires to pay the professional's price.<br /><br />Seriously.with the bar.

B001CF1A6U|5|I spent a lot of time looking for just the right 3/4\\" D-rings after buying a WARN winch, and these were it. I also have to say how much I like that they are painted a gloss black. It makes them smooth so that they don't rub on my tree strap. I would buy these again.
B001H27OPO|3|I need to know about this parr, i can use for sportrac ford 2008 xlt.
B000VEHNVE|5|These lights look great, fit perfectly and work great they fit in the bed perfectly but do require a little trimming to get the one factory plug socket in.
B00GGQMI5M|4|Arrived on time, easy to install
B006WB8ELI|4|just as described and fit perfect
B0036QZ8VQ|5|These are my first pair of motorcycle stands, for my first motorcycle. Some people say they are not very sturdy, but I have had zero issues with mine. I originally bought them so I could put new tires on my 2009 ZX6R, and they worked great for that. They are even sturdy enough for me to climb on my bike(195 pound guy) and practice my body positioning without feeling even a little unstable. So for me they were a great buy for the price.
B00DVRVX0A|5|This is a great HID kit. I've installed a total of 4 HID kits in my life on various vehicles. This one was just like the rest as far as installation goes. However, I did like that the ballast were extremely small which makes hiding them very easy.<br /><br />I will note that the 5000K color does come off a lot more like 6000K or 8000K. If I had to buy again, I'd get a 3000K. I prefer the more white or yellow look, not the popular blue tint.
B004EZN2RK|5|The purchase came on time and was just what we had expected it would be thanx. I would order it again
B002XIILBM|5|Lowewered my car and lerarn the hard way how to replace the current broken one. Fit as described for th 1994 Integra LS
B000C08IRA|5|This kit had everything I needed to do the timing chain in my saturn vue. It also comes with the cam shaft bolts which are not pictured above. So don't buy the 2 bolts separately like I did. Unfortunately the guide bolts are not included. You will most likely have to go to a Chevy dealership to get those if any have broken.
B00AJ0X82I|1|Said it would fit 2005 kx 125. Sprockets fit perfect but the chain was 6 links too long .....
B003NI1H6W|5|Perfect fit 2005 Grand Cherokee! You'll need a T40 torx bit to take the old ones off and put these on. I did it myself in 10 minutes. My advice is to put the bottom bolt in first then attach to top. I fixed a vice grip to opposite shock to help keep the trunk lid up in place and allow me both hands. You can put the vice on these new shocks as well just keep it tight enough the shock won't collapse because one shock isn't enough to hold the trunk. You'll still need to push up on the lid a little bit because the top bolt needs to be at the right angle for the threads to start, you'll figure it out easy.
B00BJPBX8I|5|Unpacked and installed in less than 30 minutes.
B001CEG90I|5|I have prepaid scheduled maintenance with Toyota. To them this means, oil change and tire rotation. Then every time you go in they want to sell you a cabin air filter and engine air filter. I bought both for the price of what they were quoting for one and they install very easily. The only thing is for my Camry I needed a 10mm socket. The Tacoma uses latches.
B009L3C1Q8|5|i like the decal cause it says what i am and says the truth and is so cool and i love it and highly recomend it
B000BZGLES|5|Superior quality, and fits perfectly. It was what I expected from Bosch. They truly make<br />world class quality stuff and I am satisfied
B0010L1YZS|5|It was the first time I put a decal on a car and I was a little bit worried about setting it wrong. I have lot's of experience in setting decals in scale models and there is always a trade off between alignment and potential bubbles but with this car decal there is no problem. After reading the instructions I realized they made a great job of making it easy:  - You don't have to worry about bubbles between the letters because the letters are individual decals.  - You don't have to align each letter because there is a tape in top of them that holds them together and after setting the decal in the car you take it off and discard it.   The color is opaque and after 4+ months they still look terrific.    PS: I find it funny how, after all the support GM offered for the movie, the car I fell in love with was the Mustang.
B0051N58T4|5|Bright and easy to install.  Had a set of these on another trailer and forgot to remove them before I sold it.  First thing I put on my new toy.
B005H1UYK8|4|I've been using this shade for two years.  The width fits well in my Ford Escape.  If it were about 4 inches taller, the sun visors could keep it in place instead of using the suction cups.
B008G23AUQ|4|Nice
B009MADRI6|5|I love the message.  The Chrome looks even better with my car that I thought.<br />I ordered just one, but now I want another one (for the front).  Sooner or later.
B001447VB2|5|This stuff is amazing.  I first came across it when a sportsman friend gave me a small sample of it.  He uses it for everything from cleaning his wedding ring to cleaning guns.  When I saw that I could get it on Amazon, I was delighted.  It is nothing short of magic the way it can clean things.  My jewelry just sparkles.  I use it on all my metal products that need cleaning.  I highly recommend this polish to anyone who wants something that works quickly and easily but is still gentle and won't harm their items.
B00029J4FQ|5|i would have liked faster shipping. It was a great deal for the price. Thank you!
B002E1YOQ4|5|Performs as advertised.  Short enough to be easy to store when not needed.  Heavy duty construction. Bright yellow color makes it easy to locate.
B006ONRO06|5|Works great.  Easy to put on and take off.
B000C6MLIQ|5|I had put off replacing my cabin filter because I thought it would be a pain to get behind the glove compartment. But I'm glad I did it because not only was it way easier than I thought (search for a video online that shows you exactly how to do it), but my old filter was pretty dirty. I popped this one in, and the air in the car does seem much cleaner now. It definitely smells better!
B0049YBKSY|5|This product arrived a few days early and it is very nice, looks good with the key on it and people have commented on how nice the keychain looked.
B0042B4B3U|5|This is awesome tool to remove dog hairs upho upholstery
B004GDWA1Y|5|Great parts
B00NK5GZFG|1|Was told it would fit my d21, but didn't let me know it won't fit 2WD.
B0054SLVC4|4|These are molded to fit like a glove, and take minutes to install.  Just use some better double-sided tape to hold them on.  Get some outdoor 3M tape.
B00469JC8W|1|Just like they say, the velcro backing pulls off after first use.
B0042VVJGW|3|The alarm is easy to install and is very loud! I only gave it 3 stars because the tilt sensor came apart right after taking it out of the box. It still works, but at $80-something I expect the pieces to stay together.
B0006N5RW2|5|Not much you can say about this item except it works good, just like the original.  Would buy it again.
B000CF5ZDU|5|These fit my '99 E39 perfectly even after some small shipping damage (slight bend at mid point). I simply bent them back and but them on with no problem. Perfect! This Bosch part number 3397001539 Wiper Blades - Set of 2 (better then the refills some folks would sell). The price was the best you could find. Under 15 smack-a-roos.
B003YHFI5S|5|These headlights look great and throw a lot of light. Much better than stock on my 01 Excursion. Installation took more cutting than I expected. Once enough material is removed the fit is perfect.
B002VVIC06|3|I returned this product before even opening it so I have no idea how good it works or doesn't work.  I have it 3 stars anyway because a buddy has one and likes it.
B004EBQPLO|4|Great for winter riding. Order them a little bigger than what you need so you have a little room in them for layers if needed. I ride year round in ga
B001C6JCM8|2|Too small and does not fit. Very unhappy with purchase.  Will never buy again.
B0017HB3SS|5|Like others have said, the box is different than the picture(s) shown. I went by the model number. 'A' is for angled and 'LP' is for low profile. One picture shown was angled but not low profile and in another picture it shows low profile but not angled.  Shipping box it arrived in had crush marks but the tool box for the most part was fine, slight buckle on the bottom, maybe dropped on its bottom corner, could not be seen unless upside down, upper area was perfect. Others mentioned getting hardware, I only had 2 washers and 2 nuts included, no bolts. That was okay as I purchased a mounting kit. Had to drill 2 holes in the box and used only the 2 'U' clamps that I had ordered , box is secure with just those. No regrets.
B006CPDTPU|5|nice race wear, easy to hand wash or machine wash cold. Looks rad, keeps fastened on the belt line. Somewhat cooler than 80's Jerseys and pants. Ready to try an Answer helmet now.
B002ENX8MI|5|it was exactly what I wanted.
B0041Q2BM4|5|This oil filter is very easy to install, it looks great, has a very quality feel and look to it.
B007ZQS67G|5|Works best on plastic clear or painted.  Is ideal for clear windshields on motorcycles. Removes smashed bugs easily.  Also works on clear headlights for cars.  Leaves a shiny protective finish. Like a good wax only better because it cleans too.
B00KH704NO|4|Looks great. Easily installed. Noticed a little ding but overall good shinny chrome. Another thing is the two secure screws protrudes a little long below, I painted the ends black so not to see which blended in with background.
B001FC79EW|5|Should have came with the Flo-rite rv2020 kit to that's double dipping cost me extra for shipping.
B003EOHUQQ|5|Excellent product!! It's very refreshing to know that there is still some quality products out there!!
B001E7DXZC|5|Easy to install, look great.  I have replaced the grips on every bike I've owned with the ISO Grips.  Love them.
B000FW7V50|5|I use this in my 06 Coloroado 4X4 with the 3.5L I-5 engine. It makes it pull like a big V-6 at low RPM. Alot more low end torque. I see this as a side benefit as the reason I run it is to lubricate my fuel pump, upper cylinder, valves, and keep things clean. If I run a tankful of gas without it, I feel the difference in day to day driving. I advise to buy a small bottle of this, and a gallon. Use the small bottle then refill it with the gallon jug, then keep the bottle in your car for fill ups.
B0064BAIRY|5|LOVE THE HELMET~  VERY NICE HELMET, LIGHT WEIGHT.  I LOVE DARK SHIELD LENSE BUT ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN CHANGE IT OUT FOR THE CLEAR ONE IF NEEDED.
B001Q4UC52|2|It did not reduce the noise very much at all. After about 20 hours of of operation on my Rhino, the inside &#34;spot welds&#34; holding the &#34;v&#34; shaped noise deflector broke loose creating its own huge rattle, much worse than no muffler at all. When I cut it open I realized just how poorly the inside of the muffler was designed. I do like the outside design and how easy it was to mount.
B00B2A2G0Y|5|These headlights work perfect! They look much better than the ones I previously had installed. If you buy these you won't be disappointed.
B004EHJ98O|1|Thanks guys for the reviews. Just bought a 2012 Harley Road Glide Ultra and was shopping for pipes. Was going to go with the Rinehart pipes but won't buy from a company that won't stand behind their products. I guess I will keep shopping and buy from a company that knows what customer service is. Really disappointing reviews Rinehart - I will warn all my riding friends as well.
B00CO8UFHO|5|This bundle has proved invaluable!<br />I highly recommend it for indoor use particular to plan upcoming trips.
B000NCOKV0|5|perfect
B001CS8G3C|5|Woks well. Softens leather. Has a light vinegar type odor.
B000C2AM2W|5|Fits great installed super. Will use them in the future!
B00QTGGZUI|5|Product was great.
B000C9TVCC|5|AcDelco oil Filter is good to me. It fits in my Dodge Ram 1500 and the truck performs very well. I already talkek to my friend to used the same type of oil filter. Again it's good.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Aarao Lelo
B000E2ARGG|4|Fast shipping. Should have ordered more.
B00AKRNQEU|5|Works like it supposed to. Got it for my sleeper TRX250r, 4th clip
B00HXC6IW2|5|Fit and perform just like the Ha/Da original that disappeared somewhere in my shop.  If you need them, these work the same a OEM... excellent.
B008GIAWFQ|4|It's plastic and I'm not sure about the durability, but my daughter loved it so I'm satisfied.
B0082365AQ|5|This cart worked extremely well.  It is easy to use and makes moving my kayak a breeze and the price can not be beat.<br />It was simple and easy to assemble and it rolls so easily even in soft grass. I would highly recommend it.  I wish I had bought one sooner.
B004HCU77S|5|I bought this product a few weeks ago & I really like the way it gets in to tight places. The finish results are terrific with Mequiars liquid chrome polish. I put ankle socks over the cone for easy use both applying & polishing.      Kermer
B005H12QXG|4|Good price and pretty easy to install.  Wasn't thinking I had to remove the door panels but after the first one the second was easy.  The mirrors do angle up a bit but not too bad.  Will recommend to friends with 2500's.
B000HBID8S|5|This product has some pros and cons...Pro: it not only works with the anaerobic sealer it was designed for, it also increases Permatex's Threadlocker compounds by up to 50%! Con: the price; with shipping, this stuff is over $22 for a 4 oz. can. It is also a hard item to find in auto parts stores. But after using the compound with the anaerobic sealer to fix a stripped water pump bolt (which I can say it's STILL holding), I can confidently say it's BETTER than advertised! Would I buy it again? Most definitely!
B00171UG4G|5|Exact replacement for my 2001 Silverado!
B004A2YSA2|5|WFCO 75 amp converter plugged in and works like a champ. Corrected my power surge and my generator RPM increase. Amazons price was the best deal I found.
B001AWDMQG|5|I first heard about this product on a motorcycle forum. I thought it would be a nice add-on to my new motorcycle so I ordered it through Amazon. It arrived ahead of schedule (a few days). And after messing around with it for awhile and it didn't work I called customer service. Marie was very helpful and advised me to use a 9v power adapter because my older garage door opener may only be 6v. Still didn't work. Called Marie, she mailed me a whole new unit, and their power adapter and a return mailing label. Gave me the simplest of instructions to follow and that one worked slick. I returned the first unit, included a check for $9.95 (cheap money) for their 9v adapted and dropped it off at FedEx. Flash 2 Pass works - get one. I still gave this a 5 star because of Marie. As I told her with my follow-up call \\"I have not recieved customer service on this level in years\\". I've been in the customer services busness for 30 years so I know good people when I do business with them. This company will not disappoint you.  Jim G.   Gorham, Maine
B00JSZOLPI|5|very nice quality / good color quality
B0009IQXTK|5|Title says it all!  I feel this leather protector is the BEST on the market.  I have tried nearly a dozen (mothers, turtle, armor all, lexol, zemol, weiman, etc....) of cleaners and protectors.  NOTHING has come close to the quality in longevity, smell(great aroma, semi new car scent), and lasting shine as to the Meguiars Rich Leather Foam!  Also, being that it lasts longer than others between uses, you do not have to use as much.  Also being a foam, it lasts longer than sprays/liquids.<br /><br />I have been using this product since I found it back in 2004.  I have nearly a half dozen cans sitting back here since it is getting harder to find I feel.  I could find this stuff everywhere back in the early to mid 00's.  Now it is becoming more scarce.  So, stock up if you like this stuff.  It's worth having!!!
B001YIYG8Y|5|Brilliant
B00FGXEARU|4|Not as well made as the OEM switches, and has no &#34;running lights&#34; for night-time... I did add an led for that myself, but it's pretty brittle and flimsy inside, not sure how long these will last.
B0085YBIXQ|5|Threw these on my 01 ram 1500. Didn't wanna go to big so got 33s with no rubbing ever. Perfect. Maybe could of went bigger but didn't wanna.  Perfect buy
B000KQ4K3W|1|I can't really rate something I never got to use only for the reason I believe they didn't send the whole product, hard to say as the describtion of the product is very very vaque! I only received the rear deflectors and was made to believe this included both front and back so sent the thing back, hard to say, they really need in include whats in the price, very deceiving. This has happened several times already from big purchases from Amazon, will never shop for items like this from them again.
B005KVLX50|4|Well made and strong. I will see how it stands up to the weather. How fast it begins to rust.
B00ELHT5OU|5|Have been using the straight 30 weight Royal Purple oil in my small engines for sixteen plus years.  It was very difficult to find back then (J.C. Whitney had it).  The six pack of quarts from Amazon is a great deal.  Anyway the oil has worked very well in my various chippers, shredders, rototillers, sickle bar mowers and lawn mowers that all call for 30W oil.  Most are troy bilt machines but also two honda powered mowers.  Rain water got into the crankcase  of a pro chipper with 12 hp ohv tecumseh engine due to valve cover design and not being covered and i ran it a bit before discovering the problem (steam coming out of breather hose).  Couple of flushes with conventional (cheaper) oil and the motor was fine- don't think i did any damage and oil consumption is still minimal w/ 30W R.P.  Next- a 1953 John Deere 40C crawler??
B000CQVLBE|5|Perfect Fit.
B002DPQKS6|5|Good
B006E4SLQG|4|looks kind of cheesy but hides my sons puppy's teeth marks!  Keeps the heat from the sun off my console as well.
B00JGP8I1S|4|I use the &#34;HD Vision Visor&#34; in my SUV, and I like it for daytime driving. I personally do not feel the need for the nighttime visor, as it seems to do little in terms of improving nighttime driving vision, but the daytime visor works well in extending my vehicle's sun visor's effective range. If I clip it to the front of the sun visor, I can extend the sun reducing range of my sun visor by folding down bot the sun visor and the HD Vision Visor. If I clip it to the back of the sun visor, I can use the HD Vision Visor as an alternative to the vehicle's sun visor. Does it give you &#34;HD Vision&#34;? Of course not. The HD Vision Visor is simply 2 pieces of amber shaded plastic. The darker one is for daytime, and the lighter one is for night. It works on the same principle as &#34;Blu-Blocker Sunglasses&#34;. The amber shaded plastic blocks out the blue spectrum of light, which reduces glare. The HD Vision Visor is also not polarized, but it's not surprising since it only costs $8.99.<br /><br />I find the HD Vision Visor a useful addition to my vehicle on sunny days, especially when I forget my sunglasses. The night visor I could do without, but it's there for those that want it. The price is cheap, and it serves a purpose. There's no magic &#34;HD Vision&#34;, but I give it 4 Stars.<br /><br />*Vendor supplied product for evaluation and review.
B00EPRBOYA|5|perfect fit. very easy to install
B007B86Z94|1|The switches I received did not use leds even though the description states led. The switches get hot because of the incandescent light and look yellow instead of blue. Be wary it is a bait and switch.
B004X2WMMA|3|I purchased the lime green version of this product. The detail of the graphic was great, but the color wasn't very deep in hue.
B00HE0OSRK|4|Had to alter product to fit.
B00JIAY98W|2|Lighting is not quite bright
B003W5NWKA|5|Works and fits great
B00802FYTC|5|Ok Recibido a tiempo y satisfactorio volveria a comprar con el mismo vendedor  pruebaloes una buena opcion de compra gracias
B00445L290|5|Vacuum really works well.  I love it.  It's a little loud, but that's what ear plugs are for.  There was no issue of any smell, as others have reported.  Great purchase at great price.
B0041EBB3G|5|As expected.
B001KSEIJ0|5|Heavy construction and well made. AC Delco has always been good for me.
B000CAINPM|2|Very light and flimsy. Difficult to fit properly.
B000Q0M19W|5|Great replacement product so far, easy to install. Works like all other original windows.  Saved me lots of money.
B004LDT76K|5|This grill fits perfect and looks just like it should on my 300.... AWESOME!!! I really appreciate the good peoples that made this grill and sold it so cheap that I enhanced my 300's looks for less than $100!!! Buy it... It's worth it!!!
B00B9W4HDO|5|Great product, highly recommend. I use it on my leather Jeep seats that get a lot of abuse and this product really helps to keep the seats in perfect shape.
B006G5AY3G|5|It is just the right size.  Love that I could just attach it to the headrest in my vehicle.  That way it goes everywhere with me.
B006GJKFHW|5|These are like 5.5&#34; of lift, but they are nice.
B001UROUJO|5|I live in Washington State, near Seattle, and ride a motorcycle year-round!  I got these gloves fairly recently, and have loved having them!  Even in September rain, my four-five minute commute is warm and dry!  I get to work with my hands still dry, and unless it is super cold (like snowy cold), they are still warm!
B003UVCY00|5|THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!! I live on an 18 acre horse farm and I can throw a tight beam of light from one end to the other. It is VERY bright, VERY white light, and charges quickly. It's light, fits in your hand easily, and you will not be disappointed. I plan on buying 3 more.
B000P4H9W8|4|I have a 1988 Cadillac which I have restored. I am retired and only drive about once a month, so the car sits a lot. I started having a problem with the battery going dead. Turned out something in the car was draining the battery down. The garage could not find the problem, so each time I would get home I would have to disconnect the battery,and reconnect it when I needed to drive the car. My problem is I am very mobility challenged.  It is very hard for me to walk at all, and having to do this was a real pain. By friend had an extra battery brain and he gave it to me, IT WORKS GREAT. I just push the button and it cuts off the battery when I get home, and hit the button again when I need to drive the car. No longer have to fight to open the hood and walk around the car. Thank god for this device. It has really made my life easier.
B000CO7VDI|3|I have looked all over for the tool pictured and was very disappointed when I opened the package and saw this KD Tools 2071.  I need the tool pictured to repair the flare where the pipe attaches to the manifold.  I do not see this one being capable of that job.<br />This tool is the same expander you see everywhere else to make slip fit joints and the directions say turn one cone around to make it flare.  The bars that contact the pipe are straight and flat unlike the one pictured.  Buyer beware.<br />All that said it looks to be well made for an ordinary expander fitting 1 1/2 - 2 1/2\\" pipes but pricey for what you get.<br /><br />Update - ToolTopia has been great to deal with I would definitely recommend them based on their excellent customer service.
B001KQLO9E|5|This parts kit was a genuine Gates item and at a very competitive price. It may have been a returned item as the box had greasy fingerprints on it. The interior package was intact and had never been opened. That worked for me.
B001V8U12M|5|The perfect addition to every camper, 5th wheel and anything else with scissor jacks.
B006BZ9LW6|3|It does not fit the AEM Brute Force intake.
B001B0Z3GE|5|love it ! I use it every day after my surgery I sit around a lot this massager really help me
B000FW61EM|4|The 3&#34; ones are better but for the price these are quite good. I would buy them again when needed.
B005ESLN72|5|This is a pretty awesome little key chain and it is real carbon fiber. It's not too large but perfect for my husbands keys. Thanks!
B00DMID220|5|Huge Wonder Woman fan.  The keychain is really nice! My three year old loves it too!! Thought it was an ornament and put it on the tree;)!!
B002XM34C4|4|This is my 2nd step rug, they don't last forever but they're very functional and keep inside the trailer little bit cleaner.
B00FXK446S|4|Thay look good on my car's,  could not give 5 star's , had one not working properly,  all said and don I do recommend this product
B004SS0ZV4|5|Not only does it look great it responds well too! I combined it with a K&N intake I couldn't be any happier.
B00AC5VPPC|5|they are so adorable I love it thank you
B0050LU2GQ|5|Works great. No searching to hook card
B0041U6MYI|5|fit perfect
B0009Y2CFS|4|A little small but does the job
B00AUDUENU|5|High quality and on time.  I would definitely recommend.  It was a perfect fit for my bike as well.  Thanks.
B002X6VXL4|5|I bought this originally to start a Buick with a bad battery. Bailed me out often. Now I use it for many camping purposes - charge cell phones overnight - boost my camper batteries if I've used most of the charge - provide AC for TV/DVD player on camper when dry camping (with inverter) - top off low car tires or bicycle tires with compressor. It is slow on the truck tires but get the job done. Quite happy with my purchase! This is electrical insurance in many ways.
B0044XHW6O|5|good quality
B0041CBUYS|1|Don't waste your time. . .
B000IXTGHW|1|item blew a 20amp fuse twice. the port used was a 15 amp outlet but the item still blew the fuse without running any other functions(radio,defrost etc) i would not recomend this product.
B000CN5AFA|5|I ordered the energy suspension kit for my 67 Camaro after finding these guys had the best price, in spite of another reviewers mixup, and they did get me the correct part number as expected and timely.
B002L7C2JC|3|Item is of excellent quality.<br /><br />However, Amazons fitment guide says that this fits my 2008 Chevy Avalanche, when in fact, it does not.<br /><br />After looking at the packaging, and looking online using the part number it is apparent this item fits a Chevy HHR.
B001GLSL0S|5|I didn't use this product personally, my husband did. But it definitely did what it needed to do - and it's durable, much like the rest of the Dewalt line.
B007TY0MBC|4|reasonable quality,  good for the price
B00FWND5KM|5|These worked great as part of an aviator costume.
B004X2W8L0|5|Great product. Top quality. Completes my zombie mobile. Nine inch decal is just right for the doors. Red stands out great on white truck.
B002M4E8TG|5|Our headlights needed replacing on our 2001 Nissan and I had looked around a lot. This was a great deal, half the price of other places!  The car was scheduled for the mechanics the day after they came so I asked if they would install them.  They did, the fit was perfect, and now we can actually see at night!!!  I would recommend these to anyone else looking to replace old cloudy headlights!
B002O95M3K|5|Very clean & easy install to the HID system.  I have not had any issues with the HID's flickering or going out!!!
B001B5EMS4|5|Quality product and fit with no issues.
B00H4JCYF4|4|Good quality mount. Position interferes with parking sensors, which can be shut off, but a little bother.
B00G4CN3F2|5|Worked like a champ!
B005ORBRNS|2|Bad foam, became separated from the goggle itself on the second day of skiing for my little girl and then broke her cheeks and forehead out in little pock rash (not hypoallergenic apparently).  I would not buy this product again, no matter how inexpensive- will never buy my family another Scott product for skiing either.
B00J2CI5EU|5|Great product, adds an extra touch of style for a great price!
B000S2QVYE|5|i will defiantly recommend this product to any one who owns a chevy truck.  cheaper than the dealer's prize and it is the original part i needed.
B000GU3KHE|5|I was pleased with the quality and fit of the cover. I now feel comfortable with my bike outside even when it is raining. Straps on the bottom prevent it from blowing off even when it is very windy. I am glad I went with this one.
B0049OSH7G|5|Works great!
B00K6Q2JTI|5|Nice white light - not yellow.  I replaced the factory fog light bulbs on my BRZ, it now matches the color of the xenon headlights.  It is not less powerful than the stock ones.
B000CSNK98|4|Auto ventshade is good quality, easy to open the package and easy to install.<br />I like having my window open even if it's raining out and this makes that possible.
B000BZHXOK|5|a
B001N2O3PM|5|I found this item to be a very understated compliment ro my front license plate.  No message appears on the bottom as I intended.  Well made and better than your cheap auto store fair.
B00355GPQA|5|This is definitely my favorite boat wash.  I have tried the regular Meguiar's soap, mothers, and sea brite.  Meguiar's flagship line is the best, hands down.  This cuts through everything, and leaves a nice vibrant finish.  Wish they made a bigger size!
B002INP6QU|2|What a rip off. This product was not worth the price. The instructions in the package are very lousy. Not recommended.
B00LXHHYBW|5|I did a lot of looking before I found these seat covers and I am so glad I did! I bought them to protect my car from my 16 month old. I have a 2011 Hyundai sonata and they fit perfectly! The installation took a little more time than I expected but I also installed everything alone. I love that they give my car the look of leather now and it makes cleaning up after my son a breeze. I did use a lot of zip ties to keep everything in place correctly. And the only thing I couldn't figure out was how to get the bottom part of my backseat to come out so I ended up connecting the strap to the back of the back rest on the car and tucked the rest into the lower portion of the seat. For me that works perfectly fine because no one ever really sits in the back to allow it to loosen.
B0090YKAHU|5|Love them!
B000E2CVT2|5|good
B009WQ3K7I|3|these are very rigid. was looking for the more pliable  ones I bought before.  These are good quality, just not the ones I wanted
B00G6HP8HQ|5|Speedy delivery, great product, worked well, easy install! Wife s Mazda 3 horn working again!
B00192JGN0|5|Working awesome
B000CJ42LC|4|The only thing I wish was that you didnt have to drill thru the &#34;step&#34; part of the board. It makes a &#34;clean&#34; look before to a &#34;unclean&#34; look after, especially if your unlucky and drill thru a high spot.  The high spot plus a bolt head leaves a really high spot.  Its very functionable but why dont you folks do the under channel app like others I've installed?  Thanks!  ~G
B000XQ9MGE|5|Good
B000Y9V8U8|5|I got this for my son who injured his back. He loves it and uses it in his car or the movies. It relieves his lower back pain and makes it more comfortable to sit. Plus it's affordable. I've seen this exact same product listed other places online for $20 more.
B00GBVHPNW|5|Nice
B003BW6IVO|4|This really fit my Triumph Thunderbird 1600 front tire very well.  It was very easy to put together and install on my trailer.  I would have given it 5 starts IF it had some eyelets to attach cords to in order to more secure the tire.  I had to put other eyelets on the trailer floor to accommodate the tie-downs I needed.
B000765MHI|4|Nice when you are sitting in the car and don't want to keep the motor running.
B003EROKH0|5|This product was recommended by Permatex to remove their headliner spray adhesive and it worked great removing the overspray.
B00CYP6LSY|5|he lovessss it ha its perfect size and easy to work with and it is a bunos pack why not get it ?!
B00KV8U20O|5|I installed these on my 2001 toyota MR2 Spyder and they are deffinetely brighter and whiter than the original ones. Now I light up the road better and the color of the light is better. I like them, I'll just wait and see how long they will last.
B00CF280LM|5|I put these in a 1999 Tahoe and they worked GREAT!  They were easy to install and had all the hardware I needed for installation.  I'm very happy with the product.
B00PGEZPMS|5|It's very nice , good weight and perfect fit . We are very happy with it
B007TXY7QY|5|Exact fit no trouble with installation and the light bulb is included. Only required minor adjustment to set the lights.
B002UPKEQ8|3|The product worked well but for the money it's better to buy from pinnacle. Their product can be diluted about 1 to 30 and does a great job.  This product can only be diluted 1 to 8.
B000C30J1U|3|Squeaks when wet.
B00LBL2LFE|5|works grate.
B007GR5DXE|5|its just the best and light battery you can buy for your bike!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00JJZGD4O|5|Delivered quickly and received exactly what was expected
B0016HWNWE|5|easy to install so comfortable to be on and durable!
B008UD9OE2|5|Excellent High Claas Items
B004I9XYIE|4|functions as advertised.  Not the best, but good for the price.  If you are pulling a heavy trailer you may want to invest in a unit more versatile. But it's good for what it costs.
B002303JG2|5|They fit my 80 gs 250tt great. They are just as adivertised. Instilation was simple and easy took about 5 min. and I was ready to ride.
B000AMLWH8|3|Okay product for some uses. I prefer Meguiar's Water Based Dressing for the leather-look vinyl interior of my truck. Quik Detailer left some streaks, especially on the dash. However, I used this product on another vehicle that had mat-finish black leather w/ sealed wood on the dash and it worked great. Also works great for quick cleanup on leather furniture. This is just a cleaner though, nothing to dress or protect.
B002OPBMQA|5|on time  and right part
B00C7Z4LY2|5|Very Reliable and strong cover. Material is great, and is impossible to tear! Comes with cover and tie downs so if if gets windy it is sure not to blow away!  Buy one!
B000ALG8E6|5|Good product... Didn't clog, sprayed an even coat unlike the less expensive brands... Will purchase again next time I need to touch up a vehicle's paint
B007PPG02A|1|These are not H4H bulbs. Do not purchase these if you're looking for JDM type bulbs. They are just regular H4 bulbs.
B0002SQYSM|4|The device arrives well packaged. Although it looks cheap it feels well made for its use. The first time I used it on a Lincoln navigator's fuel injectors it proved it's worth. The set has a very long probe with a clear sound and came in handy for the long reach needed to detect problems. Overall a good product.
B0067PUMXW|5|Disturbing to my family, I love them! Even came with an un expected surprise
B000JQQQKS|2|This is a nice collection of miscellaneous sizes, but the elastic in the bungees is VERY weak. Way to easy to stretch out, so unless they are wrapped securelly around something at full extension, they &#34;give&#34; too much when tension is put on them.
B007AOSHZO|5|Absolute fit on a Dodge 2014 Caravan<br />you gotta have it<br />First place it on a flat surface outside when the sun is out<br />it will help flattening it out
B001CO2JMA|1|Doesn't even fit on the filter...
B00F5MUB66|5|what a great up grade to our travel trailer shower.  works great.  much better pressure.  very easy to install.  if in doubt buy it you wont be disappointed.
B001GKVZAM|5|Replacement took less than five minutes. Fit great, I didn't bother painting and still looked good. Would recommend to anybody regardless of skill level.
B0000UUX34|5|Best filter going.
B00HTOB0NG|4|Gave it 5 stars cause there was no literature included
B00J2EXFRK|5|Awesome product!  The kit was easy to install and fits perfect.
B00551VM2O|5|Works good
B000OV4LZ0|5|got them quick and they work
B00HKPXCVM|5|Quickly, installed by a trade school and has been functioning as a expected.
B009DJU4WI|5|Working great so far. Had them in for about 2 months now, and the miss I had is gone. Installed easily. Great fit.
B002IXEB1G|5|These are awesome
B001KQF6OI|5|So far so good.
B002GG3C1A|1|Got mats alittle over a year ago now need new . I am disabled only put a few miles a year on and my driver side is coming apart. 3 mouths ago i saw it comming apart with low use.Was very happy with mats at first but time proved me wrong.  DO NOT BUT MATS IF U WANT NORMAL USE OUT OFF THEM, THEY WILL NOT HOLD UP FOR PRICE.
B004XG2FBE|5|30 minutes by myself. Super easy. Wiring took twice as long :)
B001ACLQ3C|4|[[VIDEOID:moNQCWJQV9KU80]]
B00065L2D8|2|You get what you pay for.  I bought this one and used it for a few weeks.  It is pretty flimsy so I bought a really flash one from West Marine recently to replace this one.  The wires pulled out of the alligator clamps after a while so I had to replace it.  I will keep the wires and such in a box in case another emergency happens.
B00641MN0Y|4|Great kit. Mounted to an RV. No directions (we are an automotive restyler anyway so didn't need them). However if you are a novice, plan on having them installed professionally. Wired remote drawback is that it has two red LEDS that stay on all the time. WAY to bright!!  Display is a little &#34;tuner&#34; cheesy but large and easy to read and understand.  Great quality product.  Easier than building them from rolls. Cheaper to buy this kit!
B00KTIHKW4|5|My old shell was breaking, and I had to press way too hard on the button to make contact.  My old shell also had a Start Engine button that wasn't even in the circuit board, but my thumb would often push it by mistake.  Now I'm getting nice clean contact, with no unnecessary buttons to avoid.  Good price and it got here quick.
B007G67JCS|5|Only one direction led be aware but nice and bright
B0041WFH1U|5|They work good,  but keep in mind two things: they are tinted so it will cut down on the typically &#34;brighter than standard bulb&#34; brightness of LED.  Also,  tinted taillights may not be legal everywhere.<br />These taillights use your factory bulb sockets, even on the LEDs, so make sure they are good and not burnt. They also use the standard bulbs from your factory lights for reverse bulbs and those bulbs are very visible. I bought some LED conversion bulbs to match the LED tail lights.<br />These taillights have places for your factory sockets to twist into that are covered by green stickers, peel off the stickers completely. If you don't, the seals on your sockets will not seal. You will get water in your new taillights and they will fail quickly.<br />Update: after a year and a half, I have had no problems with these tail lights. If I were to have problems, I would buy these again. They still look good, lenses are still shiny.
B00N43I2TG|1|Adhesive was very poor and did not want to stick to paint. Claims they have installation directions on website but they aren't there.  Would not buy these.
B009SCXCJW|5|I give 5 stars to this product because it is a good product. The plastic is of good quality.<br />I put on my 2008 Accord and it goes perfectly. It is easy to install as well. The only negative point. is that I have one side of my Rain Guard tries to take off. But perhaps I poorly cleaned.<br />I am very satisfied with my purchase for the price.<br />I recommend all who have a 2008 Honda Accord.
B006RY60GQ|1|These do not even come close to fitting a 2008 Civic SI 4 door sedan. Extremely disappointed.
B00D3298A0|5|Way better than expected
B001Q8DMA0|3|This did indeed dry my car, but after one use it's got multiple snags where it caught on car edges.
B000IHX23M|5|I was very pleased with the door skins I purchased in December.  They were excellent!  They shipped very quickly!  Thank You!!!
B009DJUG3U|5|Fits perfect had to paint 3 times
B000C7WWC0|3|This switch fits the 1998-2001 Nissan Altimas and apparently other vehicles, but it will not fit on the 2002 Altimas.  The 2002-2005 Altima switch has 2 sets of plug in wires (this one has 1), has 3 screws bolts mounting it (this one has 4 ), even the length is different.  The picture only shows the bottom 2 bolt holes so you cannot see the difference until you receive the product.  Amazon needs to change their compatibility chart to not show the 2002 Altima for this product.  I requested a full refund and it looks like they will do that but it means shipping the item back to them and waiting 10 days for a refund.  Hope this helps.  NOTE:  This item arrived quickly and was new in the box.  No problem there. I gave it 3 stars but I was unable to test it.
B005SFXPKO|1|The car key blank was functionally useless.  It was just a blank key which would require a locksmith to machine into a useful key for my car.
B00AM3HZQW|5|Arrived on time in perfect condition. Doesn't look after market! Looks like original equipment.
B00BKWTGHK|4|came when and as expected. Bright!
B000FQ0E9G|5|Excellent fit and form. This unit is exactly like OEM and includes the mounting screws. Takes about 10 minutes and proper screwdriver to mount.
B0002SRF4O|5|Excellent Product see you tube for proper instructional VIDEO, for people with no or little mechanical knowledge for you have one shut only.
B000182DYC|5|I installed these on a 5 bolt auto hub for a 1989 full size bronco they do fit a ford bronco and if u have a three bolt a conversion kit is needed 5 bolt these drop in with minamal effort took me only a half hour and then used them pulling out a friend probably the best hub I've used so far
B00144BIC0|5|this light bar looks great, bright, super simple to install, and price is great! this thing basically kicks ass, had it on for over a week now and i live in northern wisconsin ( wet, snowy, freezing, and lots of salt and slop) and i havent had one problem yet. its a must buy!
B003LDSI70|5|This is a great chain!!!  If I had one negative thing to say about it, it would be that I wish it were a little longer, but that's it!!!  After getting my front bike tire stolen, I decided to try this chain, and I am not disappointed!!!  It is thick, heavy and very sturdy!!!  The alarm goes off at a tug, and I am very pleased!!!
B003UTH088|5|Great price same product you would purchase at GMC
B00ANWH5NK|1|VERY CHEAP MADE !
B003FG4M28|5|Good price and works as described.
B007NKPYII|5|Excellent product and excellent quality, you should buy this
B00DFEWHQS|5|Not exactly sure what they're made of, but they appear to be very durable and have served their purpose thus far.  I would recommend.
B004KURF86|5|The Fox Racing Honda Sasquatch Men's Hoody is great! It fits good and the price was reasonable. I enjoy wearing it and I would recommend to my friends.
B002GUYW7O|5|When my brake light went out on my 2005 Prius, I found out that I needed to replace the whole tail light assembly.  This product was a perfect match.  It arrived sooner than expected and was packaged with great care. I couldn't be happier.
B009M3PQFA|5|This is the single most valuable tool in the truck. My camper has 3 batteries, several electric lanterns. This unit has never failed me in keeping all of them in top charge condition.
B00CISUSUY|5|Great product ... works just as described. Would highly recommend this item to others.  I most likely will purchase additional detectors.
B005RNEH5O|5|hey  has anyone thought that the brush is bent for a reason maybe to get around the back of the part that you're working on, where there's not enough room to get your hand in there has anyone asked (3m)?.
B000ECGZ5I|5|Great
B00AQI5NOE|1|Product is not matching descriptions and do not fits.
B001PYU7EO|5|excellent price, easy to install.
B00COOTF1A|5|Best hands down
B003E1Q952|2|I bought two of these.  The reviews seemed positive and I figured even though I am just using hoses to water my yard why not get drinking-water caliber hose so long as the price isn't much more.<br /><br />The picture shows what looks like a brass fitting but the ones I got have a plastic fitting.  They leak badly where it's hooked onto the faucet.  As bad or worse than the el cheapo hose I bought at Wal Mart for 20 bucks.<br /><br />This hose may be viable for some purposes but not as a lawn hose.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Update:  Got two Gilmour Zinc Female Hose Coupling 01FZ to replace the cheapo plastic fitting on these with.<br /><br />The Gilmour is supposed to handle 5/8 and 3/4 hoses but it is a very tight fit to use those fittings on this hose.  However, I think I got it working.<br /><br />First of all, cut the cheapo fitting off so that the faucet side of the hose is just raw hose.  Now insert the fitting inside the hose.  It is a really tight fit.  I found that I was able to get it in by putting the coupling against the hose at an angle so that the fitting is inside on one end and outside on the other.  Then take a small regular screwdriver to pry the hose out where the fitting is not inside the hose.  After a few tries I found I got the fitting inside the hose.<br /><br />At this point, however, the fitting only very slightly overlaps the hose.  Now grab the hose about a half foot from the fitting with your left hand and bang on the end of the fitting with a hammer in your right hand. (reverse if you are left handed)  After a few minutes you should be able to get the coupling inside the hose close to the last protruding ring on the fitting.  You will find that at this point the inside (the part you bang on) and threaded outside of the fitting are about flush, so any more banging will tend to bang on the threaded piece as well as the inside piece and so it is difficult to get the fitting into the hose any further than this.  But at this point you have about a good 1/2 inch or so of the fitting inside the hose.  Now take the clamp and screw it down on the hose end that has the fitting inside.  It will screw almost all the way to where the clamp pieces hit each other, but not quite.  Reef on the screws good so that it is tight as you can get it.<br /><br />With this clamp on I can now turn on water pressure to the hose with a shut off nozzle on the end of the hose, and no leak at the faucet.  How long it will work I do not know, but at least initially it is doing the job.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether it is still \\"drinking water caliber\\" with this fitting on but it ought to be OK, the Gilmour is a brass fitting.about a good 1/2 inch or so of the fitting inside the hose.  Now take the clamp and screw it down on the hose end that has the fitting inside.  It will screw almost all the way to where the clamp pieces hit each other, but not quite.  Reef on the screws good so that it is tight as you can get it.<br /><br />With this clamp on I can now turn on water pressure to the hose with a shut off nozzle on the end of the hose, and no leak at the faucet.

B00COYNTNK|5|I love this sun protector for my car! It's easy to put up & takes to time at all! All my co-workers know it's my car because of this product! The best thing is it matches the theme of my car! #DisneyThemed
B00JD94262|4|Bought as emergency radio.  Small size packs easily.
B000C11JJ8|5|20 Minute regulator repair
B0006IX87S|4|I was surprised that I got quite a bit of black powder out of the end of this the first few times I put water through it. I ran water for about 30 seconds until the stream was clear. The next time I turned that water on I got more black powder out of the end... and yes I has it on the correct way. Only used it once... put it away for another season.
B00029KA8G|4|I took me 6 hours to get it done. I did cross stitch lacing maybe that's why it take 6 hours. Anyway, I'm not happy with the outcome. I need to fix it or redo it. It actually requires some skill or maybe 2nd try to get it nice. Tip: use a plier to pull the needle through otherwise you're gonna hurt your fingers so bad.
B00144AMP4|5|perfect
B00198GFAG|3|Updated from 5 to 3 stars.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />The flashlight is small enough to fit in your pocket.<br /><br />The flashlight charges very quickly and is able to maintain light as long as you keep turning the handle. Even if you don't keep turning the crank, it still shines for a long time.<br /><br />The flashlight is surprisingly bright given its size and the fact that it doesn't run on normal batteries.<br /><br />Turning a crank is more pleasant way to recharge a flashlight compared to shaking it like other flashlight models.<br /><br />It's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />The crank: While the crank makes recharging the flashlight nice, it's also more prone to breaking compared to similar flashlights without a crank (the ones you have to shake to recharge), so far my flashlight still feels durable though I keep this in mind whenever I use it to keep from breaking it.<br /><br />(Update) Durability: It is not very durable. I dropped it on tile and it shattered into a million pieces. I was able to piece it together again with duct tape and it kind of works again, but this was a little ridiculous.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />You get what you pay for.
B001FHXFTA|5|working great.  installed these without any problems.  No noise, strong breaking.  no complaints.  Do your brakes yourself, it saves hundreds
B0031BT0H4|5|I was so easy to put this on my 2009 Ninja 250R, Unscrewared the the 4 bolts slited it out, and put the old rubber garments on the top two hole and slited it back in to place. bolt it back up. done. that easy. 4 min tops, look great. i ask myself if it would, slow down my bike.. not that i notice so far, much better then stock. ill let you know how it get on the MPG go's. but i don't think it will change eather.  does cut down the wind bast, and make tucking in alot nicer, no wind hitting my helmet :)  by the way im 5&#34;11&#34; wind hitting the top of my shoulder. nice...
B005T85LKC|4|These seat covers fit perfectly, though it did take a bit of trial and error to get them on correctly. (No instructions) They don't move when you slide in or out of the truck and almost look as though they are the actual seat. We do not currently have the center console covers on because thier fit is not nearly as nice.
B000JZUR86|5|Perfect replacement.
B0009RUXPG|5|Great buy!
B00480FIMI|3|I can see some improvement in the amount of light.  The beams don't light up farther down the road than my OEM ones but the area they do light up is more bright and visible.
B000CHHS7Y|4|So far so good.  Installed it on my 2003 Honda S2000, can't say it is quieter than the factory belt I took off as it really wasn't noisy.  We'll see how it works, the last one lasted nearly 12 yrs and 113k.  My only regret is not going ahead and buying a new idler pulley.
B0081S9RB6|5|Quality excellent. Only time will tell if design and workmanship will stand up. Certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend DB Electrical. Very helpful techs to make sure one orders right product.
B001G9ANJ2|4|I gave this a 4 and probably should have a 5. I have a 2008 Ford E-350 Super Duty 15 passenger extended Van that I pull a 35 ft Flagstaff Camper with. After installing I could feel the difference, I also added Bilstein heavy duty shocks and the two together really makes it stable and solid. The Bilsteins over a bumpy road are a bit hard but on the road feels great. The Helwig was worth every penny and cant wait to pull my camper with it all on.
B009T2Y2TK|5|I have a 1981 Yamaha xs650 that I put LED turn signal lights on and I was having a tough time getting the lights to blink. The stock blinker would just turn the lights on but they wouldn't blink. I tried another LED flasher from Amazon but it did the same thing, lights on, no blinking.<br /><br />This one did the trick and it was a simple plug and play.<br /><br />So anyone out there having problems with their xs650 signals not blinking after changing over to LEDs, buy this one. It plugs right into your stock harness connector and it works.<br /><br />The only problem I had with it is that the built in slot isn't oriented to work with the tab that holds the flasher to the frame as it hits the coil. Not a biggie though if you just zip tie it on.
B004SL84Z0|4|Seems to work fine.  Was delivered on-time.<br />But, it is high-priced.<br />This is not pre-diluted, so this is enough for an 8-Qt fill at 50% (Toyota recommends 50-70%).
B00AYKJ87C|5|Bought a 2013 Explorer Limited and saw the Explorer hopd logo on sport model.  This went on smoothly and really looks great!
B00F8V6SZM|5|This is a great product.  It is solidly constructed and seems hefty.  The graphics on it seem to be high quality, also.I love the Low Country area of South Carolina, and we go there as often as possible.  However, after having recently purchased a new car,  I wanted a tag frame like this, and they aren't readily available in the state in which I live.  I found this product on Amazon, and couldn't be happier with it.
B00FSG8224|4|These are good.  They are more yellow than I light.  I have them in lights over the mirror in my travel trailer.  Cosmetics color are better than higher output White LED bulbs,
B004BCDO0G|5|these are probably the easiest thing you can do to make you truck look new, came with headlight bulbs but no turn signal bulbs, not a big deal but buy two and replace the turn signal bulbs while your at it.  came with all hardware connected and easy to adjust because you adjust these new headlights with a screwdriver not some special tool from ford.  love em!
B001P6GONU|5|This briefcase is exactly what I was looking for.  It  can handle a lot of items, while not being too big to handle easily on planes.
B005HNZOE2|5|nice product very satisfied
B00HTOB0NG|3|yep
B003M7JUYA|4|old Camry handle snapped off, this makes a good replacement but since they seem to be made of similar material don't expect it to be a permanent replacement
B007PIQGXA|1|This sealant did not set up properly.  Bubbles formed during the drying process which marred the surface.  Have not had this happen with other polyurethane sealants.
B00062ZIOU|1|My wife's 2006 Toyota Sienna is red and if you don't have a perfect match in color then you get what I did, a red van with reddish pink scratches covered and standing out all over the place.  The colored wax stains your hands, rags used to buff and it shows up for weeks down the road in every little crevice you missed removing it from, since it is a glowing pinkish red.  I tossed it in the garbage right after finishing waxing the car the first time.  I was wondering why you don't see this product made by a well known company like Turtle Wax anymore.  It was actually a good idea if the auto manufacturers made it themselves to match each specific paint color.  But just one red color to cover all the reds out there won't work.  Save your money.
B002YKRI54|2|Wasn't what I was expecting... I got a different hammer then what the picture shown.
B00804F080|5|Very fast, exactly as described
B00KTIYXLU|4|works well
B002BVAOA2|5|Purchasing air filters and then throwing them out when it's time to replace it is a waste.  You can clean this filter and get a little horse power boost.  How can you go wrong?
B000CITKCE|5|I bought the battery tender (waterproof) 800 to charge the starting battery on my boat.  I have a dual bank Minkotta charger for my trolling motors and those batteries always seem to our last my starting battery by at least a year.  After much research (and not wanting to invest alot of money), I decided to buy this unit.  I mounted the unit to my boat (by the batteries) with the supplied screws and ring terminals.  The supplied cables were plenty long enough and everything went smooth.    Without a constant charger on my boat I would have to charge my starting battery if I did not run it for longer than 2-3 months (especially durring the winter months) before I would take it out.  Everything appears to be working well and only time will tell if it will hold up.  If everything is fine in the spring time.  This small investment will be well worth it.  Will post back then.
B003CKJZCY|5|Product was ordered, shipped quick, put on the motorcycle. It's an air filter so who knows of it's importance or if it works. Either way, I have a new one and saved money with Amazon.
B005FKMQDO|1|In the posting it wasn't to clear what they fit and these didn't my car.  I didn't know this until I had the car apart so I had to buy new ones locally for a lot more money.  I still am not sure what vehicles these will fit so I can't even sell them to get part of my money back.
B005HAYDR4|5|Velcros perfectly and is super durable. I will be buying my second pair for the back seats.
B00JBIRBK4|5|These LED's were very easy to install.  They seemed very well made and were really bright.  They color-matched the HID lights on my vehicle just about perfectly.
B0042PS5N8|5|My Broncos decal arrived right on time, great quality. Used wet nstallation with the help of a youtube video. Took about 15 minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  I'm going to post a user photo.
B003LSNEXI|5|I gave this filter 5 stars because K&N is always great, that said it did not fit my Car, a 2013 Chevy Captiva 2.4, although Amazon's guide said it would, I did some trimming and modifications and it works fine but a part that costs $54.99 should not have to be fitted to your vehicle. This particular model Car is build all over the world and they are not all exactly the same so some parts need to be seen before purchase to insure that they fit.
B00EARBZFS|4|It works, the foul odor although still present, is not as bad now.
B0079MKKZC|5|This cover works on my Vision real good giving the the clutch cable a finished look, easy install, price, and shipping time was  good also.
B001C6N6FM|5|Fixed a loud creaking sound on my 2006 Mazda 6.<br /><br />Going over bumps was an embarassing event with my Mazda 6. The loud creaking sound would make heads turn.<br />Finally decided to diagnose and fix. This Control arm did the trick as you are getting new bushings and getting rid of the old creaky bushings.<br /><br />Had to buy a Ujoint Puller tool also and was not super simple but got it done and works great.<br /><br />Only issue is I need an alignment now.
B000FSQ7UO|1|dont trust me trust popular mechanics:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />oh and you are welcome.<br /><br />PS the otherguy is only getting better fuel mileage because of his cold air intake. you want better gas milage get one of those.
B000JZURAE|5|After I put them on, which took about 5 minutes, they worked great. Hood goes up and stays up. The price was much cheaper than the auto parts store.
B005K97RRA|5|Very nice durable batterie
B00KMR3GT8|4|Seems to be holding up fine. LEDs are nice and bright. Mounts with double sided tape and has 2 mounting brackets that get screwed in over both sides--I guess in case the tape fails. The brackets are cheap plastic and it's easy to over torque your screws and crack the bracket. I wish the plug in had an option to come in a 7 blade hookup instead of the 4 flat. That would have been much more convenient for my Silverado.
B00JENQCX8|5|Perfect fit on my 2001 lexus is300. Hi-quality part that looks durable.
B0040TE486|5|My child loves it! It's affordable sturdy and he likes to wear it.! It makes me feel better knowing he is protected!
B00M1OUBES|5|Great Size and fits perfectly in my glove box.  Way better than carrying jumper cables and having to ask for help.  Smaller too.  Nice touch with the charging USB port.
B00U1365QE|4|Perfect...
B004NBO81O|5|Got this item on time! A perfect fit for my 1993 f150!! It's been installed for a few weeks and no problems!!
B00FNU5PMA|5|Great stickers, we even got some freebees in the pack.
B000JFJLP6|5|This is awesome, not only jumps all types of 12v batteries, but you can plug your 12v adaptor in it to charge cell phones, run stuff. This saved me when my computer was dying when we were camping and i had to do a work project. i have a 12v to 120v small inverter that i plugged into this to charge my laptop. Seems to be good quality.
B00KHUIHLW|5|Love it.
B007Y5GQBQ|5|Fits perfectly and does the job. I was hoping for a secret message on the back side but I haven't found one yet.
B00AN8NF6A|5|Everything was as advertise. No complaints.
B005SB0JJS|5|Easy to put on, do not fall off, looks good.<br />I put them on my 2013 JKUR in November, and they are still there 5 months later, no scratches, not faded.
B000AA4RWM|5|works well
B005XFDD4W|5|good
B0002MABGE|3|Not the best quality, wish I would have bought a better one. But I guess it is ok for the price.
B000GS6HTE|5|This was the perfect fit to my husband's motorcycle jacket.  His old Joe Rocket liner zipper broke off.  This was actually better quality than the one that came with the original jacket.  Worth the money.  We love our joe rocket jackets.
B009MADYRK|5|Great product.
B003V5LVWW|5|Works great!!
B000VTULPY|3|Looked great initially, then the next day I noticed a haze/film that I have been unable to completely remove. Directions say to use LIBERALLY, but others say different. Next time I'll use less and see if that helps.
B0018EUDHW|5|The tool wirks great.  I was abe to repair a tire that no one would touch.  It was on the radiused edge.  Three weeks and going strong.
B000CMCQI0|5|It is work perfectly on my car, now I need only one clic to stop the car. very very good. Thanks a lot.
B000BSWEHS|4|Seemd to work fine with no real issues. Only used once so far though so I cannot attest to the long term viability of this device.
B0009KNP58|3|But didn't miraculously make all my stainless stell scratches dispappear. I think it would work better on some situations than others.
B00KH84KFQ|5|Absolutely perfect, fast delivery, just as requested and advertised!!! AAA+++
B00EA2DMJK|5|Item arrived quickly and as advertised. The antenna looks great and performs just as good if not better than the factory original.
B000EDQR50|5|It's funny becuase when I first was introduced to the RV world and we were looking for our perfect camper it took me awhile to realize what the purpose of these things were on the camper. Then I finally had a duh moment and then went and broke one. I like that it is a two pack so I have another one in case another one breaks. They are a little fatter than my original clips and the mounting holes did not exactly line up with my old mounting holes so I had to drill new ones. Wish they had more of a universal slot for each mounting hole to give you a little wiggle room for that. Not a big deal and a great product!
B0026ORS8A|5|We just purchased a motorhome.  We were towing our van behind and my husband asked me to order the towing lights for him.  He was very pleased with the product.  He said they workly perfectly.
B000M5WTSY|3|Very good fuel pressure kit. All the components are well made and don't leak. Much better quality than the lower priced kits and especially the kits from Harbor Freight. Only downside is that is comes in a plastic pouch instead of a hard plastic case.
B001O2T43M|3|Just OK
B0000AZ69N|5|I had been looking for a replacement for a cracked lens on my Shorelandr PWC trailer. From looking at their online parts fiches none of the lights they showed looked like what I had on my trailer.<br /><br />I found this on Amazon and it was a perfect fit. Two screws was all it took to swap it out.
B005WZSF1E|5|Great Bulb! 75% cheaper than the parts stores!
B001GC2LVM|5|This thing is awesome and saves a ton of time when setting up.  Just put it front or behind the tire and pull/back onto it until you are level.  Gives about 5 inches of correction.
B007T7TPE4|5|These lifts are a perfect fit for my 2004 Mazda 6 trunk.  They were so easy to install it took less than 5 minutes.  Now I can access my trunk without the worry of having the trunk lid falling down on my head!  The price was about $10 less than I could find locally for a pair of lifts.  I'll be buying another set for my 2003 Mazda 6.
B0011V4V6Q|5|I have always liked the Hawk brand with all the racing heritage so I thought I would give them a shot. I have to say as OE replacements they are excellent. I coupled these with some power slot rotors to complete the look. They are very low dust which I didn't really care about in the previous reviews but after having these low dust pads I don't think I could go back. They are so low dust in fact that my OE rear pads put off more dust than these do on the front. I can't wait to upgrade the rears.
B00CQA7LMM|5|This kit is perfect , everything fit perfect,good lift kit.
B0002RNS8C|4|Hopkins 40955 Ford/GM OE Replacement Harness 7 RV Blade     I picked this up from Amazon a few weeks ago.  A little pricey but cheaper then the local stores.    The unit is nicely made, and was a plug in replacement for my OEM connector on my Chevy 2500.  I replaced the stock hitch and connector with a much higher rated aftermarket class V hitch.    The unit worked first try with my 7 plug trailer harness.    The only downside was the included bolts were too short too mount in a thicker backing (bumper in my case) so I had to source new allen head bolts.  These bolts will rust when exposed to water so a light layer of paint is requried.    Overall, nice product, would be nice if it combined a cigar lighter outlet as well.
B00BR4BZ8Y|4|These are not a name brand but are of decent quality. They fit perfect and were a quick install. I have had them on now for about a month or so and so far so good. You can't beat them for the price.
B00CTLGSZO|4|Worked for my 2005 ES330. But the price may be too high for such a small screen.
B001HKZHIW|1|Dont buy that crap. It wont last long. If you just use it ocasionly it might do the job , but if you use it frequenjtly it burns the motor. Good idea, but motor way too weak.  Its a waste of money, I wrecked 3 pumps within less than 2 years. Buy the 110 Volt Marine pump and run it with shore power or your generator.
B00MXBIIOE|5|I bought this for my 2015 Focus, there very sporty, fit great and I love them.
B000GU7I72|5|I purchased this for my Goldwing. It fits snuggly and covers the entire bike. I use it daily when parking the bike at work and on a recent road trip that included dust, wind, rain, and a lot of ultraviolet rays. It handled all these elements well. Highly recommend.
B00BXLSO1W|5|Very nice.
B004O5B6XM|5|I wasent expecting something to clear my driveway,but this shovel is well built rugid and comec apart for storage under my rear seat in my pick-up.<br />I do hope to never use it as I have 4x4 for when it snows in NJ.
B00407TVZ4|4|Good!
B004AQDJLM|5|Installed the Camera on the back of a 28 foot Keystone Bullet Premier Travel Trailer. I mounted it under the rear window and above the spare tire. I ran the cable in a 3/4&#34; x 10' PVC conduit along the I-Beam running front to back to the &#34;V&#34; Hitch. I drilled a 3/4&#34; hole in the &#34;V&#34; Hitch Channel and then mounted a stainless angle to mount the connector for the coiled 'Trailer to Truck' cable.<br />I connected the rear truck cable along the existing wiring harness on the bottom of my Ford F150 to the Fuse Block on the front of the engine. I coiled the camera wire along and above the Accelerator Pedal and stored behind plastic cover above transmission. I fabricated two light metal angles and attached to the 7&#34; Color Monitor and hang over the Rear View Mirror when pulling my Trailer.<br />It provides a great view of the traffic behind you when going down the highway. You have more of a view of the rear if you are changing lanes or cars are passing you. When you get to the camp site this certainly helps in backing into your Slot.<br />So far very worth the price of this unit.
B002EOVDII|1|Not apple and not 3gs.When I plugged it in the screen on my phone read\\"not for charging\\"
B008W1KG7Q|2|Not thrilled at all.
B00JN0U4SQ|2|Faded from black to a red copper color after only a month of use. Only faded on one side, so not sure if it was from sun or simply from the wind while driving. Either way it is completely unacceptable that the paint they use fades in a month. So if you want a poorly made 2 tone reddish blackish thing on your car or truck then go for it, otherwise don't waste the money.
B00A2VC9YC|5|I'm glad I got this.<br /><br />Programming was easy using the radio menu.<br /><br />Works like a brand new one because it is.
B0044EMSEE|5|This is an awesome jacket and I wear it often.  Love the removable liner.  It breathes really good so you can even wear it on a sunny, hot day (without the liner of course).  I do wish it was an inch or two longer in the body area but other than that it is great!
B0002LBKD8|4|This is good stuff.  I use it weekly which I find yields the best results.  Any less often and it requires just as much work as any other product I've tried.  No other concerns here.  I have used several other wheel cleaning and found this one pleasant to use due to the smell.  No noxious odors or fumes.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because I find I still have to wipe the wheels by hand to remove tuff stains.
B000OKTC4Q|5|Good products and exceptional service
B00069CN2I|4|Works as advertized. Don't worry about being to gentle with mirrors start at bottom and slide onto your mirror then snap over top. They will go on without breaking then tighten screw. Vibration is min. Just hard to get use to. Only used for a few short trips 50 miles. Will upgrade to factory tow mirrors later but for now they serve the purpose. Can't beat the price.
B000VBEF0Y|4|I have a Jeep Patriot and these fit perfectly. They don't smell as strong as I thought they would. I love that they have a lip so spilled drinks, rain from shoes, and even vomit stay put and won't ruin the carpet. Definitely worth the money. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that right where my left heel sits on the driver's side is a raised part with the company logo. I'm not quite sure why this bugs me, I guess I would just prefer that my foot rest on an even surface. But that's nitpicky stuff.
B000BXOGNI|5|This stuff unclogged my Grandfather Clock and it runs again.  I just sprayed the clock's innards for a second or two and that melted away all of the goo that WD-40 over several years had caused my clock to stop.
B000KZ1XF6|2|Key shop could not make it work on this jeep.  This jeep does have remote option according to the build certification.
B00G8UI238|5|This is a great sticker!!! It's one of my favorite sayings from the Beatles song &#34;The End&#34;<br />Fantastic customer service!!!
B00JBIC6TA|5|Great look over the old ones. The black housing looks great against my red IS300 and they are a great improvement at night over my old hazy lights. Install took longer than I expected, but if you have any trouble Spyder has an install video for their lights on YouTube that is applicable to these ;)
B000IUPYUI|5|Excellent quality!! Whats great about these spark plugs, is that you don't have to preset the spark plugs, which is also really nice! Cant go wrong with Bosch!
B0050IJKAS|5|very pleased with trail box<br />mounted easily<br />lid seals well<br />well constructed and sturdy<br />latches hold well<br />mounting clamps have sealing washers<br />lots of room
B005P6OYH4|5|Nice, heavy duty boot ring for my Lokar floor shifter. All expectations met. Fast shipping, reasonable price.
B000C9WJ3A|1|It produces some sort of an odor that feels like unclean dusty air. I was starting to get sick a bit from it. Not entirely sure if it was the filter or something from the system itself, but after I replaced it with an OEM part, I don't have an issue anymore.
B003SZYCOY|5|This was an exact replacement and was easy to do ourselves.  The light is clear and crisp and the price was 350.00 cheaper than a popular parts store.
B001TZ4I76|5|The seat cover met everyone of my expectations. It was exactly what I needed a cheep but very durable seat cover.
B00VGL64G6|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!
B004I0VCAK|5|greeat item.. great price
B007OW6MD6|5|Works on my 07 Camry, 95 SC and 2000 GS. Toyota manual says to use a new one every time, but I've reused these for a few oil changes and they work fine.
B003Y5UAIA|5|Before receiving this key chain, I anticipated a much lower quality product because of the low price.  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with how heavy it was, along with the overall finish.  This is a must for anyone that is a fan of Chevy's SS line.  It sure makes my custom Equinox SS happy!
B001RPV1BY|5|I had a bad COP connector on my Explorer. I thought my only option was to replace the entire wiring harness until I found this. I spliced this in, soldered and used Shrink Tubing! PERFECT!!!!
B00H5A4F22|5|Great~
B006URX6K8|4|worked fine
B009AVZHP8|5|This snowmobile jacket is perfect for riding on my sled.  I like the black color which doesn't show the dirt as easily.  It has lower side zippers for sitting on the sled, because it is a longer jacket.  The bright pink zippers gives it a feminine touch and goes well with my pink/black/white helmet.
B000AM8B68|5|This is a nice product that fits well and looks good.  The tight fit should prevent folks with sticky fingers from \\"borrowing\\" it.
B001PNO3P4|5|Switch looks good, and works well. I'd recommend this manufacturer to another. Also, their Applications Engineer was a great help.
B00CC304QS|5|These lights are great! Very bright for the price (paid $66 with shipping)... Much brighter than my old HIDs. The wiring harness wasn't an exact fit for my car, and I had to do some slight modification, but that's to be expected since it's a universal harness.
B005QIG8U2|4|So far I have put a few hundred miles on my cruiser with this helmet. I normally ride around town at the speed limit of 45 miles per hour. Is comfortable, fits well. I have used it with the face up most of time but it does come in handy whenever the weather is bad, there is debris on the road from construction or an over abundance of bugs to just be able to easily lower it into a full face helmet. Is not a 5 star helmet because the interior plastic pieces are pretty flimsy. So far I am happy with it. I don't normally go on the highway so I can't tell you about wind sound issues like most of the folks out here have.
B002R1T66E|5|This assembly was very easy to install and adjust; it works great in my '02 Explorer. As others have mentioned, it does come with bulbs already installed. No tools are necessary for installation; you can fine tune the positioning by screwing the plastic retainer clips in or out. The height adjustment screw takes a 4mm socket.
B00271ETX4|5|Awesome torque wrench. Very useful for mounting a scope, as well as in the studio on guitars, on your mountain bike. This is one of those \\"must have\\" tools.
B002ANXRTG|4|My niece loves them
B0065UN0K6|5|Excellent, on time. everything as i expected. completely satisfied
B000JQF77G|5|Product was what I expected and received it sooner than I thought!
B000CB3WWK|4|I replaced my old non-working, battery acid drenched washer pump with this one in approximately 30 mins. 3 months later and its still working well.
B000COVX82|4|The Price was great,  The fit was perfect.  One thing I liked and at the same time worried about is the tabs. for the defrost. On one hand you can move them to fit better,  but on the other hand I can't seem to get them to lock in well, one of them have turned and shorted out. I corrected it. I will see how long this will last.
B000ALJ4MY|5|Got a star chip while on the freeway, just less than an inch wide or high. Checked reviews on various brands, watched YouTube vids, chose Permatex in the end. I'll agree, tube of resin should be see through to know how much your using before the last step. Anyhoo, followed directions to the T and have to say, all that's left of the chip is a small blemish. Exactly what Permatex warns you about on the package. Now I don't have to worry about it spreading and having to replace my windshield for $200 or paying a repair guy to come out for $100. Tip: Unfortunately I used most of the resin before the last step, so a lot was waiting for me when I removed the pedestal and adhesive. Take the adhesive and use it to spread remaining resin over the \\"almost repaired chip\\", then place yellow film over it taped on both sides. Move car if need be to direct sunlight, use razor blade to clear out air bubbles, have a beer and wait 15 minutes!
B00ESMSOOU|5|This is just what my family needed for our car.  The Quick Flow Compact Sir Compressor fits under the seat without taking up foot space.  It is truly compact and light weight. When called into duty, it worked well on filling our low car tire in a few minutes.  We will be adding another for our other car.
B00P036JBG|1|Didn't fit nicely to my truck, also unless my head is on the roof I can't clearly see top gauge. Seems all the gauges are angled up.
B001A2TISM|4|Description was accurate.  Lenses are ACTUALLY blue, not tinted blue but really smoke colored when you look through them. Pretty durable as well, dropped several times & they survived.
B00AR355W8|4|Perfect fit.  It was missing hose clamp but it was easy to install and fired right up!  The kids have been running with the new carb all summer.  I recv'd it quickly without problems.  It was cheaper than buying the individuals parts to repair the old one.<br /><br />I used this in a old Yurf Dog.
B00KX35HTS|5|We hooked up four of these light bars (bow, stern, port and starboard) on the tuna tower of our boat and it is really awesome!  Happy fishing!
B002SIR91A|4|I live in northern US and we have crazy snow. This shovel has helped up get our SUV out of deep snow drifts on our driveway. I also use it to break hard snow and shovel right in front of my garage. It is not strong enough to break ice, of course, however, it does scrape snow very well when you want to get the top level of snow off.<br /><br />The shovel arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. It is a very strong shovel and does not bend or anything. Even after scraping snow and the top of ice, the shovel is still in great condition.
B00029JXNO|5|I put this on my 2003 Suzuki Marauder VZ800. It supports at minimum 4 cylinders. I'm not a mechanic or nothing, have intermediate I would say skills when it comes to electrical work, etc. Nonetheless, my bike is a VTwin with a singlefire distributorless ignition system. This means that the tach shows only 1/2 the rpm, meaning that you have to multiply it by 2 to know what your actual RPMs are. Which is okay for me. The needle does not jump either, connected this directly to my ignition coil's negative wire and just taped it up with electrical tape, no soldering etc. I did however had to extend the positive and negative wires to the battery on my bike another couple inches using 18 AWG wire. everything works as great. Do buy this instead of those $300+ tachs for bikes and figure out a fancy way to mount it - I just bought a chrome 1 inch clamp from my local hardware store and everything looks good to go.
B000C9JX34|5|ACDelco is the best you can get when it comes to GM parts, so its no supise this was a low cost, high quality, OEM replacement on my Blazer. I got code P0155 on my scanner  - Oxygen O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction (Bank2, Sensor1) and this fixed it right up. First O2 sensor replacement in the vehicle, at 130k miles i'm sure it is about time to replace all 3, but i'll wait on those codes before I bother just yet, having one go bad doesn't mean the others will.<br /><br />In-case you don't have a 22mm wrench to use on this replacement, a 7/8 wrench works just fine too, spray some (PB Penetrating Catalyst) on it and wait 15 minutes before you try to unscrew the old one, makes the job 10x easier.
B0009RUXMO|5|good product
B000RGXLG2|3|Work great but somewhat disappointed in the appearance.  Unfinished looking, not sure how they will do in winter with snow buildup.
B009PAK75E|5|Bought these for my daughter truck. She is very happy with them.  I was worried about the fit but no problem
B0002NIKJS|5|Nice looking floor mats and they fit like they should, lay flat and don't move around. Need to find some for the rear.
B00FRLHFSW|1|Seriously?, I buy local for 85.00 per case which is about 7.00 per qt. Amazon I tried but this is in no way competitive.
B004U00SZS|4|These are still the best floor mat for the Touareg, but these don't offer the same level of coverage as the weather tech floor liners for my Tacoma.  Very well made (as all weather tech products seem to be) and good fit, but could provide slightly better coverage.
B00LYMQDV8|3|Came in white, bah!
B001O7SVHC|5|yep
B004A344SM|5|great wholesale pricing ,quality and shipping home run
B005NLQAHS|4|Works great with the &#34;Torque&#34; app on my Mercedes C Class. Great little device that worked for me. Cleared some of the more simple codes. But dont expect it to clear some of the harder ones, or be as specific as something like a Star Diagnosis. But really nothing is. Still a great lil device, that wont break your wallet.
B00006JBL4|5|rack is definitely heavy duty and when installed correctly can hold heavy bikes. install is very easy. looks great in my garage
B00BHY5OZY|5|I never leave home without it. Also, it makes me feel safe from the reflective material on the bag! Great product!!!
B000COB69S|5|It didn't solve my particular problem, but it is a quality product and works perfectly.
B003888GB6|5|Works as advertised. Would buy again, but I don't expect them to wear out. Use the grease or they will squeek.
B00IMUC9YA|5|Look so pretty
B000CO7Y2Q|5|Great snatch strap for the price.
B00JVUDAZC|3|Tear Drop was a lot smaller than expected.
B00192JH4S|2|The gloves are way too thin to be used around unsanitary conditions encountered with RV dumping chores. Regular cotton gloves that can be washed are better.
B000XBBISO|5|Worked like a champ, installed easy...
B004B61B34|4|I read several of the reviews and was hesitant to buy this product.  The alternatives were much more expensive, so I went ahead and ordered it.  The shipment came quickly and when I went to install it, I was unsure if I really needed to remove the rear bumper or not.<br /><br />When I got underneath to locate the position of the mounting holes, it was clear I needed to remove the bumper.  I have a 2012 Wrangler Sport, and you can't insert the bolts from inside out because the exhaust system is in the way.  I had to take off the bumper and put the bolts in opposite of how the instructions stated.  But the bumper is just six easy access bolts, and I got it off, the hitch installed and the bumper back on in less than 40 minutes.<br /><br />Wiring through the tail light was a breeze as well, nothing more than taking off the covers, disconnecting the existing wiring and making the new connections, then fish the wires through the body and out the bottom.<br /><br />Great product, easy installation.
B00BIVDGQU|5|I made this little sticker in to a magnet and it looks so great!
B001RITO1A|4|They work!
B000CB42I8|5|Great product for my Yukon XL with oversized tires.  Packaging suitable for the heavy product.....arrived in very good condition and completely in tack.
B000K004LU|5|My neighbor is a mechanic, and looked this part up for me after the fan in my 2005 Chevy Silverado 2500HD stopped working.  I called the dealer to get a price on this item and it was $132.00 just for the part.  That's not including the diagnosis fee or labor of $100.00 per hour.  The part literally took 5 minutes to replace and fit and worked perfectly.  Apparently, this is a common problem in the Chevy and happens often.
B009DJX46G|4|The motor is good!! My window works fine, haven't had any issues yet. The only con is shipping took a while.
B000KL1JU4|1|Wings came off in wind first drive with it on antena
B006K8V5M8|2|I bought these to replace my old corroded terminals. They're kinda a different design, I was willing to give them a shot. But they're too big. Tightened as far as they'd go, they came no where close to a good snug fit. I see others left good reviews, maybe mine was just the oddball defect that slipped by q.c. .  Just putting it out there incase anyone else is considering these and wondering how they worked for others.
B000IY4A0Y|5|I have installed 2 sets of these- one on my own car and an additional set on my brother's vehicle.  In both cases the fit was perfect with no issues at all.  The coating on the rotor face burned off as it should and the painted coating that is there for beauty has held up after several months of use.  It seems like a little thing to not have all that rust, but if you pay good money for nice wheels, having rusty rotor hats looks pretty silly.  After installing these I had to finally get off of my butt and paint my calipers to make everything match, but that was personal preference.<br /><br />With the slight cost differential between these and un-coated rotors, these were a great value for the money.
B000NPIYDC|5|this unit is insanely sensitive and thats great<br />built to last and  does it's job and does it well<br />for home inspections its a must
B00FW1JXGO|5|True white and gives the truck a great appearance. They gave me 2 extras which I didn't use, not sure why
B002EOVDII|5|I don't know why it's gotten so many bad reviews, but I have never had a problem with this car charger. I've had it for more than two years and it always charges well. Easy to plug in and the cord is long enough for its purpose. For this price, I would definitely purchase it again.
B00ASY2966|1|was a plug in installation, when I attached a brand new trailer the brakes almost caught on fire as the connector is wired incorrectly.  Drove from Dallas to San San Antonio with no trailer brakes. Have now seen this problem by other on internet
B00CXYVKKA|4|I get a lot of people laughing at this sticker - it would get 5 stars but I was an idiot when I put it on the car and it is crooked. Ooops.
B001D9FQT2|3|great for camping, well-made.
B005SSIVKA|1|after installation 98 accord still makes thumpimg noise when hit bumps and holes.
B00R3LYF7S|5|love this trunk organizer fits nice in the back of my van and still leaves room for a full size stroller. the sturdy handles make it convenient for unloading the trunk. made from sturdy cloth material and removable drop in bottoms makes this trunk organizer foldable for storage
B000C95AH2|5|Well made! Excellent company ato order from and shipping is excellent! Works awesome! Will order more in the future!!
B00FXLDHJW|5|Perfect fit, easy install.
B00753S8CC|5|little smaller than I thought it would be but it's great quality.
B001DX7F10|5|Came as promised and quickly. Got it as a replacement filter. Have always liked the performance and quality of AEM filters in my truck.
B001LHVOVK|2|It probably works but it did not work on my nissan vehicle. Have to check it on another vehicle
B0009SQQ1A|5|A necessity for connecting our RV to electricity. It will protect our RV's electrical components from damage of potential surges.
B00A80EVXO|5|This works great.  My son is learning to drive and this really helps both him and me feel more comfortable.  For example, sometimes he's a little too hesitant when changing lanes and I think this helps the drivers behind us cut him a little more slack for being a new driver.<br /><br />Attaches securely.  We take it off when he's not driving so it doesn't get stolen.
B005N74434|5|Ordered this for a friend and he was very pleased!  I absolutely loved it and was everything add stated!
B000F5DQWY|1|Sounds like crap. Put it on my truck and my wife laughed at me. Even my 10yr old daughter said it was embarrassing and not to use it with her in the truck. I put it on my four wheeler as a novelty gag accessory and as soon as it got wet it stopped working right. Now it sounds like a pig farting on a snare drum.
B0002NIJ8K|5|These came on time, look great! They are the exact size of the oem emblems on our Focus. However, I used them on my riding mower.
B004A3404U|4|Perfect!
B00ELBCSZY|5|Sturdy and durable seat protection for the Polaris.  Great protection from muddy and sharp puppy paws!
B001EP28DW|4|Went in real easy like they said,look's nice, it will take about an half hour to do dont like the way it was sent very bad packing on there part ended up with scratches,most of them up top where it get's mounted to the frame thank guard over all real nice !  Joe
B002T4HC38|5|very good
B000ED7YB6|4|Used very successfully on my 84 300zx turbo. Got another (7) hp outa engine . Fit without major mods. Good deal
B00F3J2FW4|5|Great product. Great price and shipping speed. Perfect fit.
B007T4JTHU|5|Very little is as good as original, this is. Look no further, this is what you need. Has same serial numbers on it and everything.
B000GZCUAC|5|Installed on my 2002 Honda S2000. Comes pre-gapped and ready for install. Theses plugs work great, had them in my last car with FI figured it would work just as good on NA.
B005UB6CB0|4|So far so good.  Will be trailer cross country soon...will try to update after.
B002Y1M4CU|5|A very attractive addition to my Lincoln Navigator.  I was glad when it arrived so that I could take off the dealer's tag holder.
B000XQ8OP4|3|Product does the job. Seems total advantage taken of the trade off cost of scratching the actual bumper. That said, very expensive (especially when compared with the excellent style and quality of Pacer Performance 25-531 Silver/Chrome Deluxe Bumper Guard Kit - 2 Piece at $20).
B00BJ2I9VK|5|I had to take up two layers of subfloor and three tile layers scraper did very good. two points first you have to have a very large compressor with 10 cfm or larger and let the scraper do the work do not push to hard let hammering work. I would advise this tool for anyone
B005NLQAHS|5|Plugged in and paired easily. Great way to monitor my car health (2014 Chrysler 200). Using it with the Torque app on my Android phone with no problems.
B004QHID1Q|5|this item is the exact match as original and the pricing was far below any other source I researched<br />bearing is in use and doing great. would recomend this supplier and will use them again
B004KEKYWQ|5|Excellent for my automotive application.  Worked like a charm!
B006XXPSMS|5|awesome for my 2003 330 xi.👌
B000C9RN2C|5|I always replace important maintenance parts with genuine ACDelco, and this belt didn't disappoint. Can't beat the price from Amazon, and install is a breeze on these trucks. Don't let the dealer or local auto shop bend you over, buy this belt and do it yourself.
B00B05QIPU|5|Pairs with my android phone. Able to pull diagnostics from the Nissan Leaf.
B00PE534UY|2|Decent plate holder,looks good but letters are just vinyl stickers... spend the extra money for better quality. Oh and be prepared to pay return shipping if you dont like it.
B00065JTD8|3|I purchased this unit to use in a small pickup truck.  I found it was very difficult to calibrate no matter where I placed it in the vehicle.  It took most of a morning to finally get it to calibrate, and the only place it would do so was on the top middle of the dashboard.  This of course, makes the indoor temp useless.  I like the display,and the features of this product, but cannot use it in my vehicle.  It is now being used as a toy on my pontoon boat.  Unfortunately, this exposes it to the weather so I dont expect it to last too long.  Disappointing.
B000AP57OO|5|It is a K&N, it does what it says. It fits my 2003 corolla S perfectly and may add a bit to the acceleration. Not much though. It is worth it to me.
B005HU5SKK|1|Came out of the box completely DOA. Not even a flicker, measures open circuit in both directions. Construction is from cheap, fragile plastic that I am sure would have no UV resistance whatsoever. Adhesive strength on the double-sided tape mounting pads is laughable. Fortunately for the price, it's more of a waste of time than money.
B000OWBWMY|4|Not a perfect fit for my truck but it is better than the cloths mats
B00N3VYMJ8|2|It has a great turning knob grip but it does not stay tight on my MTD Yardmachines riding mower. It progressively gets loose within a couple of minutes. I even used both of the rubber spacers to tighten it down more, but doesn't make a difference.
B001HWBT3C|5|exactly as described - worked perfectly.<br />We had purchased a few other filter wrenches before this one that claimed to be same &#34;sizing&#34; and they just did not fit properly.<br />Would definitley recommend.
B004NKZIMS|3|I don't know if I got what I ordered or not as there is no packaging and no numbers to identify the brand or the model.  This matters as there are vast quality differences between different manufacturers and model numbers.  I guess if it works it will work.
B000GU0F72|5|Great service, much quieter and better feedback than the stockers. .
B00C4YL27A|5|Very Sturdy for smaller bikes.  Has a 350 pound limit and my DR650 is at that limit so I use it for my smaller 250.  The top rubber mat holds the bike very well.
B000CPAU5S|4|Product came quickly.  Not sure if it was new..had tape on the packaging.  I thought it was going to be thicker,but it's made thin..Installation was a beast, but it looks damn good.
B00FCDZORO|5|Easy to install.  Shipped promptly, arrived as expected and easy to install.  I was nervous that it might not be what I needed.... but upon arrival was exactly the part...  Thanks!
B0061J64KE|5|fit great and look awesome
B005ZWCK42|5|We have not had enough snow to try out the chains but they were reasonable in price and the delivery was unbelievably fast! We ordered late on a Tuesday and received on Thursday. Very impressed! Will add more information once we have tried them out. Happy so far.
B0013FT0Q6|5|This product was exactly what I needed. It cost far less than the dealship would have charged.  Actually this was a recall item that was tauted 50/50 on cost to replacd.  it was mch cheaper to buy and install although the installation was a hard job
B0058J4K22|5|No problems here.  Just be aware that you have to splice into your break light wires to hook this up since its LED and doesn't run off your factory bulbs.
B00R8EW50E|1|the screws are to thin to fit the back license plate and too thick to fit job the front one (bought it for the back license plate). They are also too short for the back plate when adding the o-rings to avoid bending the frame.
B00IEEWL38|5|perfect for my craft design
B00J7H6L5U|5|Good protection for key, received quickly, reasonable price
B0012ETJ1O|5|I did a &#34;H4&#34; headlight conversion on my 1987 BMW many years ago. The H4 bulbs were loosing lumens, so I replaced them with SilverStars. Night and day difference! I have used 9006 and 9004 in other cars, too.
B006G2MJZU|5|I needed to replace a broke one.  This is a direct replacement and works great.  I bought two so both sides would match.
B000JFJM14|5|Perfect, quiçk shipping.
B007TG7I0I|4|Worth the money for sure!
B00RGKW66I|1|Very bright but it is starting to hold moisture
B002X1PNRY|4|So...<br /><br />After replacing the handle on my Sequoia twice (and following the directions to make sure that everything was greased properly to avoid the handle breaking - didn't help) I found this on line.  I found it here for a better price (and free shipping).<br /><br />The original equipment handle assembly uses a cast plastic handle with a \\"finger\\" that actuated the lever to release the door latch (the rest of the assembly is all metal, go figure).  This piece is not reinforced in any manner and is notorious for snapping off of the handle, rendering the rear door useless at the most inappropriate moment (and there is no interior release for the door).  I'm not an engineer, but looking at this assembly even when it is new you can tell that it is going to be a chronic failure point.<br /><br />Due to the fact that:<br />1. The interior panel on the door is not designed to be removed while the door is closed (rather convenient)<br />2. The door panel must be removed to to gain access to the cable/lever to release door latch (also, rather convenient)<br />3. There is no exterior access to the interior components<br /><br />I started looking into a solid metal handle for replacement.  This assembly has a cast metal handle which is much more robust than the original.<br /><br />I purchased my Sequoia used from a dealer.  The first replacement handle that I installed came from Toyota (and was overpriced).  When I removed the interior panel I found the remnants of the first handle (so the handle had already failed and been replaced before I purchased the vehicle).  The second replacement handle I installed was an aftermarket (and was identical to the original from Toyota, but much less expensive).<br /><br />This handle was no more expensive than the aftermarket unit that I installed previously, but is much more sturdy.  Since installing I have had no problems with the door.<br /><br />I have also become very adept at opening the door with the handle broken off (Ihave a Snap-on tool that works perfectly and doesn't scratch the door).
B000BNXRVK|5|Heavy duty bracket. I used it on another brand of brush bar. Used one of the mounting holes for the driving lights. Flipping the bracket upside down. My plate number is now visible however camouflaged. The only reason why I needed the bracket was because I had installed a front mounted CLASS III on my truck along with a brush bar.
B0006MTRJ2|1|This was hooked to a standard pressure bib.  It burst within two months.  Not strong or trustworthy.  Very poor quality.
B005ON2ODY|5|I purchased this item a while ago and it did take a while to recieve it but that was more in part to dthedelivery process and not the company, however when it arrived I noticed it was damaged, so I emailed the company and I got an immediate response that they would replace it for me. I have applied some of it to my car and it works very well.
B003RCBMZA|4|Seems sturdy; although I wish it came with screws.
B004HCS4NW|4|I use this to keep our recently replaced vinyl top clean. Works as well as the RaggTopp product I've used in the past; this product seems to be formulated to be less harsh, so tougher dirt (or bird poop) needs a spot soak for a few minutes before hitting it with a brush. No complaints though, Meguiar's is quality stuff.
B001JQAGHG|5|I am happy with my purchase. I highly recommend it. Stinger custom Pro 200 Amp Fuse.I go to car shows and it has to look good .
B002UC4XQS|5|Perfect replacement for my RV under bed unit.
B0032YD87S|5|Best odor eliminator ever! I use this product every day and I couldn't be happier. I heard rumors that this product has been discontinued from plasticolor. If it's true it's a shame.
B002NZUNZ2|5|Works great and took about 30 mins to install.
B009D77U7C|5|Perfect clips to replace broken or lost clips.
B000EQET6G|4|was delivered and worked as expected
B000VAKXVA|5|I live in DFW but am from Cali. You wouldn't believe how inept these Texans become with only a light dusting of snow on the ground. If and when it does actually snow, EVERYTHING comes to a halt.
B00CEX5B1Y|5|I needed this adapter to hook to my Pittsburg compression tester. It worked fine and did the job.
B006P88TJ0|5|Arrived quickly, was well packaged (not bent or folded), and looks great.  Very crisp, clean lines.  It hasn't been applied yet, but we're going to mount on Velcro and use as a morale patch.
B00826OVWW|5|I bought this creeper for my Fiance and he loves it! He wanted a plain creeper from Walmart but I seen this on Amazon and really liked how it transforms from a &#34;bed&#34; to a seat! It works very well and seems to be of high quality! Great purchase!!
B000E21CU6|5|These really bring a cleaner look to my 2012 Ram crew cab. The package arrived in well prepped packaging and they were easy to put on and they match my factory chrome of my wheels perfectly. This a great product.
B005R4L170|5|Didn't really like them at first, but they grew on me. Now that I have them and can see how sharp they make the back end look, I'm not sorry I got them.
B00J11HVN8|5|Fit just right. It don't even look like seat covers. My seats look original . Also looks sporty
B0011DVP6S|5|perfect item at a great price.
B0051RIT28|2|looks good for the first 3 days,after that the right ballast started making noise and stopped working. i wouldn't recommend it.
B00418VYDY|5|My product arrived early and I love it!!! I looked all over the valley this is the best product for the price. High quality, very shiny and it looks great on my new car. I would advise anyone to buy this on line so easy and worth the time.
B002MQCY7C|5|Easy installation and is  secure and feels safe. Buying two more for my older helmets. Instructions are easy to understand but you don't need them. Lay out the pieces and take your time. Don't snap in fittings till you're sure.
B001B73WCO|5|This is a great primer, the white base is bright and perfect for model painting, mask making, or anything else you need a base coat on beforehand. The grey color is perfect for painting darker colors on top of to make sure you know what you've covered - I used it on a miniature display cabinet to re-paint it from dark brown to pure black; the grey primer let me see exactly what I needed to spray paint.
B000NM6UZE|5|Exactly how it was stock. Couldnt be happier with them. Easy to install.
B005RN0S3Y|5|Great product. Even though my bike has the skinny front tire it still held my bike so I could strap it down  Would work better with bike that have the bigger tires
B005SVVBRC|3|Works fine...kinda pricey
B0087XOTWW|5|Great replacement for my RV`s interior incandescent bulbs. Same amount of light with very little heat and power draw compared to the old bulbs.
B00HNW8MJ4|5|If you been looking for a small and good steering wheel, this is it!!!<br />Looks awesome on my 2010 Honda Civic.
B006XYB1VE|5|This Seatbelt extender is very helpful. I always tended to wait to attach my seatbelt until I got on the road because it was difficult to reach.<br /> Now the attachment is much more accessible and may save me a ticket! I recommend this extender and this seller. Good deal!
B000276D0W|4|Once the system was up it worked great.  The directions were a little confusing and I had to read it several times before I felt comfortable in moving forward.  The bolts and screws seem to be a little long - the screws to go into the 2X6 were 2 inches or longer whereas a 2X4 is only 1.5 inches wide.  The recommend bolts into the ceiling beams seem to also be too long (1/2 to 1 inch too long) unless you have thick ceiling.  Once up - it works great.
B00B1L2X7U|4|The picture shows in-groove deflectors, these are not. But they work fine. Just be careful of how you mount them, or they will be crooked.
B0052SF0LO|1|THE ADJUSTMENT SETTING WORK GOOD FOR 5 DAYS.OFF DAYLIGHTS ON AT NIGHT MOTION;<br />THAN THE SENSOR FAIL .LIGHT CAME ON DAYLIGHTS AND AT NIGHT STOP WORKING .<br />RETURN UNIT .
B000OCFCI4|1|I thought this would be great for small jobs but the brush is very soft and too wimpy. Might work for kids playing &#34;house&#34;.
B007EW35PO|5|Great deal!!! I've done some shopping around on these and this is the best deal I found. Well made! Happy with this purchase!
B001DDO8CE|2|k.. the only thing wrong , you do NOT explain ,  how long is the V-split.  i bought it can't reach the passanger is about the size of my hand doesn't work for me. i did more search and found extended V-split for more money
B00GEIIPY0|5|Was exactly as described, very neat and tidy wiring harness. Good quality materials and connectors. Works great with my Inovited 55w HID kit.
B00NAV1Y3I|3|It works, but nowhere near as bright as my previous light. I intend on finding another LED to compare and hopefully it's better/brighter... SAFER!
B000LNN11G|5|got this for my husband and he loves it! cheaper on this site than the store too!
B00JGG60WQ|5|I just bought the 50 year Anniversary Mustang and this License Frame fit it perfectly!  It looks sleek and it was great quality.  The only thing I changed was the bolts to hold it, I bought the &#34;anti-theft&#34; bolts separately.
B00HAQBEH0|4|Very bright light and very light weight, I use it all the times . I repair appliace for a living and this little packet light is my frist tool I use to inspect the appliances . It's one of the best pocket light in the marketplace and I highly recommend it.
B000CAM1QY|4|This was easy to install but it had a distinct smell to it of exhaust and I would have given it five stars if not for it filling my car with the same diesel smell. Great colors and material though.
B007RZ39KY|5|I purchased two, one to accompany my Porche turbo and icon stickers then one for the glove box of my 97 Suzuki wagonR wide Okinawa whip.  Great conversation starter!  Wish I had one when I was 6 and had a go cart!
B000NVW1LM|5|My automatic 2003 Mazda6 had been suffering from \\"morning sickness\\" for about a year. This is when the transmission will not engage into gear when it is cold, however when it warms up it works fine. So after being sick and tired of having to idle the car every morning while getting ready for work, I decided to do a little research.  I had two options; one was to take it to a transmission shop to have the seals replaced for almost a thousand dollars, or give this bottle of liquid a shot. Poured the entire bottle in and drove around for a bit to let it circulate. The next day I started it up not getting my hopes up since it said it could take up to five hours of driving time for it to kick in. Lo and behold, my car did something it had not done in many months, it actually moved forward! It completely caught me off guard that I almost ran into my garage door. I don't normally believe in these fix-in-a-bottle things, but I would absolutely recommend this product.
B000BYD68S|5|After installing these, our car runs much better and we are saving on gas. It was hard changing them due to type car, had nothing to do with wires.
B000H6P55W|5|Survived a 2000 mile journey!!  Rain and wind and sun!  Great value for the money
B0017M6F2W|4|I used these on a 97 Ford Explorer AWD 5.0 V8.  Raised the rear about an inch and a half.  I docked a star because the included instruction sheet was for a steering part, not a shackle and I couldn't find the instructions online either.  The welded bar is offset, so which side is up?  So, one star off for that.  But it's the only one available for the Mid-90 Explorers, Rangers, and such.
B000HX1MA2|3|works ok puts out a little heat, the power cord and plug gets HOT
B0009OR906|5|Bought it to use on Weatherpack terminal connectors.  Worked like a charm!  Pops right in, give it a little wiggle and then you are good to go.  Great purchase.
B003G1HSLE|4|Just purchased these for my 97 civic... When i opened the box, they looked exactly like the picture, hella clean. I havent put them on my car yet, but will be doing so tomorrow. So far i have no bad comments, i'll find out tomorrow if they were worth the buy or not.
B0028ZKMM6|5|Buying an aftermarket horn? Buy this, as well. Motorcycle, auto or truck the application is the same. Built well and with an easy to understand wiring diagram, you'll have your horn installed quickly and the quality will shrug off the perils of driving conditions.
B0019COQ6C|5|GRATE TOOL
B00651CLCS|3|The antenna seems sturdy enough and the reception has been excellent.  There seems to be a design flaw in the lower collar that led to it cracking when I mounted the antenna.  The collar is a plastic ring that covers the stainless steel (I think) screw threads that fit into the antenna receptacle on the Jeep.  I screwed down the threaded bar, set the collar on and then screwed in the antenna to mount it.  However getting the antenna screwed in tightly lead to too much pressure on the collar and it developed multiple cracks.  I pulled it off and fashioned my own collar.  I could have possibly installed it incorrectly, but I saw no other way of getting the antenna on firmly enough that I could trust it at speed.
B000BPTVTK|5|Wow I was blown away on how good this product is. Definitely a rain-x fan now. Works as advertised and a good value.
B0002JM69W|2|Please look at the picture.  What color do you see?  It is advertised as Gray.  It came Black with white, red, yellow stripes.  The coils are very cheap and thin.  Overall product is not good.  I would not recommend.
B005PW6EQ2|5|Great product.  Stretched a little to fit absolutely perfectly.
B00062YEPY|5|These work great and inexpensive compared to the alternative!
B000C01IUE|5|i love this product... quiet, nice braking power, I could say better than oem. I would buy this brand next time i need a pads...
B0019II9H8|5|Purchased these for my 2005 BMW M3.  No problem, fit in just like OEM and cheaper then purchasing from a dealership.
B000CB07CS|5|gooooooooood for mitsubishi
B00OFRLYJA|5|Another quality switch for much lower price then the local off road stores.
B006DA8P44|3|I thought I give them a try because of the price... But they took forever to get to the USA...<br />They where easy to install, and look great at night,but do not expect for them to glow bright durning the day time.
B006HFV2XQ|5|Just what I needed to keep my wench working, Works great, Highly recommend!!!!!!!
B000W0KTKY|5|This is very nice product. And great seller. Unfortunately I ordered wrong pin size but seller was very prompt in refund. I will recommend this product to every one. I bought another 5.5 mm product. Loved it.
B00IZAGPJC|5|great fit, easy installation
B00OC2R8HU|5|Great product
B0081ZYS4K|5|Very satisfied. Thanks JEGS.
B000ZAQY00|4|So far I am impressed with these seat covers. The fit very well and snug. It helps if you are a contortionist to accomplish the installation, but I managed by myself. I would give 5 stars but I want to wait and see how well they hold up. The upholstery under them was torn exposing the metal seat frame, I covered the sharp edges with some duct tape, then taped the old upholstery closed over that before installing the seat covers. Hopefully the metal won't wear through, but I will see how things are in six months or so and update.
B00192JF9U|4|This product was exactly as described & worked great.  Fit my camper perfectly and easy to install on to my camper
B00J7MXG3U|4|These are really cool little lights.<br /><br /> My only 2 concerns are that they use aluminum wire not copper, its very fine and I suggest soldering your connection and using some marine grade heat shrink and make sure that your wires aren't bouncing around , secure them with zip tie at the least.<br /><br />Number 2 is that every single Allen head screw on these were loose. I get it. Steel screws + aluminum housing... but still... far from water proof. A little loc tite handsome gasket maker would go a long on these guys...<br /><br />Otherwise. They light up the road well and are a nice addition to my HID head lights... hahaha
B0018F1NBG|5|After ordering this battery I was a bit concerned after reading the other reviews on this product.One review stated that the terminals were on oposite sides of where the original battery posts were located.THIS IS NOT TRUE this battery is in fact an exact replacement for the Yuasa YB14L-A2 and the posts are exactly correct.The item is shipped without acid but that can be purchased at any Auto zone for $3.99.After charging this battery, it cranks very nice and with proper maintainance im certain it will last at least 3-5 years.
B00RF0JXD8|1|very low quality and description is wrong. This is NOT aluminum.
B000HT4KRI|2|The ratchet mechanism that holds the pliers (once you pinch a hose) won't hold  them shut. The pliers pop open with minimal pressures/movement.    Could be fixed by filing the notches in the ratchet, but I haven't tried that yet.    Disappointed-- I expected better quality out of OTC.
B00009PGNS|5|I have taken one trip using the Koolatron Compact Kooler and planned to take another trip this year.  It fit perfectly on the floor behind the drivers side seat.  It was quiet and kept the food and drink cold during the day. I also loved that the cooler was taller than my old one so I could put more inside.  I did follow the directions and made sure the food and drink were cold before I put them into the cooler.  I did purchase the adapter.  It was a big help in keeping my fruit fresh.
B009XMQ244|1|I have used this charger for about a year with no problems until tonight when it caught on fire. The bottom of the charger melted, the case started to split open. My dresser was burned and my house stinks like electrical fire. Lucky I was home. I will never again leave one charging while I'm gone or asleep.
B000IXFRVQ|3|I have an average size head, and this thing is huge on me.  One size does not fit most.  The product itself is great and has a great feel, bought it to wear under my motorcycle helmet.  I am sure I'll wear it and just sew the elastic band up to fit my head.  For the money it's a good product, just wish they didn't make it so big.
B00GYUQ6XU|5|Worked great no problem with this unit.
B004137VKO|5|Great product
B004HX1DZM|5|Good stuff and priced right
B003YYMM1E|5|Loveee
B007P748Y0|5|Very good.
B00K2G5I40|5|Looks great!  :)
B0002SQYT6|5|This is fitted to the air hose we keep in our motorhome to tap air pressure from the vehicle for a number of tasks, like inflating a low bus tire, bike tires, inflatable prehistoric beasts and the like. If it's anything like the one I have in my garage, it should last a very long time.
B0013VT5N8|5|Cheap and completely serviceable. Not much to say about it, just crystal clear and sturdy!
B000630AQA|1|The \\"Black\\" is the brake dust that will still be stuck to your wheels after you use this product.  The \\"Magic\\" must be the money that disappears from your wallet and goes to the dishonest corporation that markets this junk.  The \\"no scrub\\" claim is a bold-face lie.  This stuff doesn't even wash away the regular dust on a relatively clean wheel, much less put a dent in actual brake dust build-up.  Shame-shame to whoever is peddling this garbage; it's pure snake-oil!
B006N95P7U|5|Perfect! Quality exceeded expectations. All necessary hardware was included
B00O1QUUKY|5|I was given the recommendation to use one of these for drying off my dog. My Dog is a dock diver.  Works great. So much lighter than regular towels and more compact for traveling than regular chamois that I have had in past. Ordering another one.
B000CM0WCC|5|ok
B005HFYE1O|3|I rated this 3 stars because of the lack of color coding in the relay harnesses. It looks as if whoever assembled them just threw the wires in the connectors; nothing matches. This can be a pain if the ass for quick diagnostics, and especially if you're neat like me and like everything to be proper and not look like amateur. These do not help the case. These do function as they're supposed to and I like the metal hangers that come on the relays. Very handy for hanging in tight areas.
B00CHFN0Q2|5|Very high quality as is expected from Moog.  I could've gotten an off- brand cheaper but for $20 more I think the quality of Moog is worth it.<br />Easy to install. It's more difficult getting the old strut out than putting the new one in.  Using new hardware was worth the extra money.
B0002MA8TE|5|I am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000+ mile tour from Nebraska to Florida with this on the top of my Subaru and I must say it was great thing to have- everything stayed bone-dry and secure but I would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure- plenty of room and solid construction- for the price it can't be beat!
B000GTUZLO|5|This is the most fantastic product I have ever seen. To heck with mototcycles.  Use it on your car!  Try it on the black mirrors, black trim (or any trim), interior, etc. etc. usually takes several coats, but does it ever last and gives it a great shine!  I even used it on my mail box and it gave it a lasting shine that paint could not!  And then I tried it on my SHOES!  Gads what a shine that lasts.  This stuff seems to work on anything and lasts and lasts.  BUY IT AND TRY IT.  YOU  CANNOT GO WRONG!
B009EQDRN8|1|custion ripped off after using it once.. used 5 to 10lb pressure. wouldnt recommand at this price.
B000KVDVSC|5|This is an excellent product for a great price. It arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised. Thanks.
B008BLKI2U|5|GREAT PRODUCT!<br />AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING.<br />2 PLY IS WHERE ITS AT.
B00NZ1MINI|5|Great product for hockey goalies because you get the support when in the butterfly but you don't have to worry about the support hinge in most knee supports hitting your knee causing impact injuries to the MCL or the interior area of the knee. I started to use it after a MCL injury.  I wish I had it before the injury.  It lasts for about 7 months using it in games 4 times per week then the bar starts to pop thru the top or bottom.
B0083J7K6M|2|The mirrors move when at high speeds.  Rubber boot is not secure.  Cheap product. I am going back to my other mirrors.
B007HRTFT6|1|By far one of the worst products I've purchased on amazon, perhaps even ever.<br /><br />This is essentially a makeshift paper door that fails to close properly and is a complete mess to open.<br /><br />The fact that the title includes &#34;door&#34; is a joke, it's more or less folded paper that immediately crumples and deteriorates upon first try. I cannot BELIEVE that it's listed at $60+ Had I have known the quality (or lack there of), I wouldn't have wasted my time unpacking albeit assembling.<br /><br />STAY AWAY.
B004I0NP3M|5|great
B000TYODAK|5|Worked great on my 2003 f150
B0027QR59E|5|Just what I needed for my car.
B008Y9CK84|5|just the right one for me
B00B9EWHGQ|5|Fit and looks like it should. Purchased for my niece and she is happy so that is all that matters.
B000E471YA|4|The item arrived promptly and fit the car exactly.  The mirror is a great improvement on the old broken one.  The price was much lower than the price quoted by my local dealer.  The mirror has quite a glare from headlights in the dark is the only draw back.
B00E5PK8TE|4|Bike started fine after installation. But it was tough getting the spacers to stay in place when screwing the bolts into the posts.
B000F1932K|3|It fits quite nicely, but the color is ALL-WRONG.  This grey is much lighter (whiter) than the rest of my vehicle's grey interior (and it'll fade in the sun so it will only get worse over time).  Worse still, it has a bluish tint to it as well that just doesn't look right.  If you care how your vehicle interior looks, you'll probably return this (at least if you get grey, like I did).  I'm somewhere in-between, and since this is a functional dash cover, I'll just live with it not blending in at all and looking a bit weird.
B0010DLIKW|5|I had these installed on my 2009 Mazda5 - the tire-eater - so I could reverse the zoom-zoom negative factory camber that is otherwise unadjustable in the rear. Hopefully, this will make my tires last a little longer.
B006OKXKA2|4|Put it in before making a 5000 mile trip. The truck is new so we are not sure if we got any better performance or increased mileage.
B00JJBWMDO|5|Speedy delivery. Small and lightweight. Thankfully have yet to use it so cannot rate on performance. Perfect size to put in a small compartment.
B00DNIHMKW|5|i love all doctor who stuff
B000EVYGZA|1|Poor Quality.Just received it and  I can't event trust the continuity test function  because I have to move the probes contentiously to get it to work. I don't know if the problem is in the jacks or in the probes. I can  touch copper filaments on probe cables (Safety issue if testing AC Voltage)  Waste of time and money.
B00CH6T18C|5|Have a new 2015 just wanted to soften and protect the leather. Seems to do the trick, Florida weather play hell on leather
B00006XMTJ|4|I'm very pleased with the portable XPowerpack 300 Plus. I do a low key lawn service which includes a couple of hedges and assorted bushes. I've used gas powered hedge shears over the years but the cut was cleaner with an electric hedge trimmer. I've run a hedge trimmer (TR1400 Black & Decker) for an hour and a half. I've inflated bicycle tires and we have a VW van that occassionally won't start. The unit has performed better than I expected. Now, if it lasts a few years, I'll give it that 5th star.
B00D42AFS8|1|When I first received the product I made sure that I charged it fully before testing the product on my vehicles. After it got fully charged, which took a day, I tried to start a 2001 Malibu with the 3.1L V6 motor as well as a 2004 Silverado with the 5.3 V8 and it never even attempted to start either vehicle, very disappointed! The only good thing I have to say is it did charge up my sell phones rather quickly.
B001O0BJUK|5|I've had several people in the automotive field tell me the transmission was the problem with my F150 pickup,<br />it was jumping and jerking when going up inclines in OD, I worked as an automobile mechanic for thirty three<br />years before all these electronic's and computer controls, and I knew it felt more like a misfire than trans,<br />problems, the accel  super coil kit fixed my problem, thank you very much.<br />  Lonnie Wood
B007WR25ES|5|Worked well on the trip to San Diego that my daughter her husband and the kids took over the 4th.
B0002SRL20|4|Good quality, i like it and would buy it again. It does read the psi inaccurately by 2-4 psi but that doesnt affect much for what Im using it for.
B006LVXRPM|5|A perfect in my Kia Soul. Great price!
B00G7RP280|5|Sticks good and funny as hell
B000C9Q2VA|5|For Dad's pickup truck.  Perfect fit & good quality.  Arrived 2 days early
B000BREO2M|3|item is made well and lives up to the standards one would expect from WESTIN.<br /><br />HOWEVER... if you have a gmc envoy of any year and style DON'T LISTEN TO THE WEBSITE and buy them.  they will not fit.<br /><br />I had to return mine. No compatibility whatsoever.
B000BUU5UO|5|Best price I could find on this stuff.  Heavier duty when compared to Coleman brand.  Good purchase for sure.
B003NIH4XW|5|great replacement part, had no issues installing it, good quality for aftermarket product.  imo I think its much better than the original oem door handle
B0006NE3KE|5|Always a must to carry on my motorcycles<br />easy to store under the seat and can replace anything I use while on the road<br />life saver!
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Huge piece of crap, was falling apart as I was putting it in my car. What a great waste of money
B001OCZBWU|5|These NGK Iridium spark plugs are a replacement for the standard type of NGK or Kawasaki spark plugs.<br />They fit exactly the same, and connect to the standard spark wires. They will also connect to a NGK Performance wire set.<br />These plugs have two main enhancements over the standard style of spark plug.<br />Firstly, they have a much longer service interval, which means economy of purchase. These plugs will last for 80,000km in your engine.<br />Secondly, they burn the fuel mixture much more completely. This liberates more power from combustion, and therefore more power from your engine.<br />I gained a 0.6 second faster quarter-mile (400m) time simply by changing to these plugs.<br />That's a power increase that you can't just ignore.<br />Much smoother acceleration throughout the engine rev range. It just feels noticeabley better.<br />I have NGK Iridium spark plugs in all my bikes.<br />Thanks.
B00MQ5Z5F2|1|After I charged it the first time it split wide open.
B001E1TTCE|5|Great item.  Exactly what i was looking for.  Charged my car battery in very good amount of time.  Also provides the options of both Jump Starting a car as well as an Alternator Check, which I have not used yet, but it comes in handy.
B005DLQWEE|5|I was at first very hesitate to purchase these liners because I've never paid anywhere near that for previous mats. Yes, I used to purchase mats and not liners like this product. These liners fit perfectly and extremely easy to clean with a powerwasher. What a difference they make in keeping the carpet clean/dry and not damaged by the salts used to melt the snow and ice in our area. Never going back to mats again. Friends purchased some knockoff liners and they hate them because the liners don't stay in place and don't completely cover.
B0015Y9358|5|Fits like a glove and looks really nice on the back of our trailer.  Should last a very long time too!  Very Well Made!
B009SX2L16|5|Good quality, thanks!
B001EOV46K|5|It was cheap, looks nice, and it serves its purpose. I don't know anything else you can say about a hitch cover.
B004J85A5Y|2|I have these on another vehicle with akebono pads and it's the best combination that vehicle has ever had. I purchased the same items for our tundra and have had a heck of a time getting it right. I noticed immediate harsh shuddering and took apart one side, to find that the silver paint had been hiding a hairline crack across one entire side of the rotor along the braking surface, and another spot where it looks like a scrap shaving had been pressed and machined into the braking surface. Amazon provided a refund for this unit, but I had to order a replacement elsewhere since amazon was temporarily out of stock. Now with the replacement on, that side seems to be driving/braking fine, but there is a softer shudder from the other side. All the nuts are hand-tightened, the mating surfaces were all quite clean, so maybe there was a bad run of these things. I'll give it a couple more days and send the other side back if this doesn't clear up. I've been doing my own brakes for 25 years and have never run into this.<br /><br />Our other vehicle with these has shown them to be excellent and flawless in use over 20k miles.
B003TKI4VU|5|They are a little expensive but I'm certain that cost will come down as we switch to low energy bulbs. When we are camping we need to conserve where ever we can. I would rather pay a couple of bucks now knowing that our battery will last through the night until the solar panel can charge us up again.
B00BTSFN54|5|Had the product for a few months now.  Istall was very simple for any one with any mechanical ability.  The speakers do lack in bass but that is expected with such small speakers.  microphone has good quality clear sound( if your faceshield is down).  Learning the controls takes a little time, but the setup is totally worth it.  having my phone on my tankbag and being able to hear the GPS commands saves time and dont have to look down all the time for the directions.  I havent used the peer to peer yet but i imagine it will sound just a good a my phone calls do.  Over all I think it is worth the money.
B0002SR0V2|5|He loves it
B0015U6VLQ|5|Just bought my 5th one of these.<br /><br />They will back down when you are asking too much of them and you will soon learn that you have to back pedal for 1/10 second while pulling the knob to get to free spool direction depending on last direction chosen.  I highly recommend you purchase a matching snatch block and leave it on the cable so you are not tempted to pull more than the unit can hold without backing down against the gears and rotor.<br />There is as always more cable on this drum than is practical but if you need the length it is there.  For one fixed application where the pull is repeated without making any changes I removed all but the needed length in 0rder to get the maximum pull as the load was evident in the sound of the motor and gears.  This change made a huge difference.  Could have done the same thing with one snatch blocks and even better with two snatch blocks giving 4 times the strength.  Snatch blocks are not cheap and quality ones cost as much as this winch but they last until they are stolen or the owners survivors sell them at a garage sale.<br /><br />Having them mounted on the cable makes it harder for them to disappear into the night.  Mounting two snatch blocks on the cable might max out the cable rating. but if this is required in an emergency you have little to loose possibly.
B004AQU7YY|5|Fit my '89 omc cobra drive just like the old one.
B00GBW0BLO|4|OEM parts for the low, low gotta love it.
B00GO5GWNY|5|Shipped fairly slowly but I love it.  It was very easy to apply and looks nice.
B003CMIH2Q|4|Well made decal.
B000VU7NL8|5|Great Mat, heavy Duty. Fits 2013 GMC perfect. I high recommend this product. You can not beat the matt for the price.
B000CAZ2S8|5|Worked very well on my 1991 Miata
B007EQ4BR6|1|So disappointed with this pouch, the pouch itself is good, but it does not fit well with a bat wing fairing. It sits super high on the fairing blocking vision. I had to return it. DO NOT use with a bat wing fairing.
B001LHVOVK|5|I was hesitant to buy this but after reading all the great reviews decided I had nothing to lose and if if didn't work I could send ti back to Amazon.  Needless to say it read my  Devilles output code without a problem and worked terrific.  Can't go wrong for the price and I can use it on my other vehicles if the need arises.
B00SO30ROO|1|Never worked once returned same day received
B001JT0MJA|1|Was not happy with the antenna.  I bought 2 and 1 broke in 2 weeks.
B0036E9VB6|5|[[ASIN:B0036E9VB6 VIAIR 85P Portable Air Compressor]]  First impressions are good, based on working on four passenger-sized tires.  This one replaced a cheaper brand that'd withstood close to a decade of occasional use before the plug-in got smashed. The box clearly states you need a 15 amp 12-V outlet and the vehicle needs to be running before plugging in. (15 Amp power outlets seem pretty standard on later model vehicles.)  It's not quite as noisy as my old inflater, tho this one still manages a slow, wiggle-walk around the garage floor for your visual entertainment. :) I'd judge inflation times to be decent for a home device, bringing my four tires up from around the mid-20's to 35psi in reasonable time. With digital pressure gages under $10 bucks and accurate to a half pound, I simply use the built-in gage to over-shoot by a few pounds, then bleed the tire back down with the hand-held.  Doesn't take up much shelf room, tho the compressor cylinder was hot to the touch when finished, so I'd be carefull where you set it down. With no complaints so far, I've got to give it 5 stars.
B000COTXIO|5|This gauge is very stout and should last forever.<br /><br />Good price, fast shipping.
B001L56FS4|2|The yellow clamp couplings that hold the boxes together already broke and had to be repaired. They should have been metal instead. That is the only problem I encountered
B00BFU85RO|5|Really worked as I had hoped!
B001QT49H4|5|Works great
B00J6ZI4JE|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 RAV4.  Instructions were illustrated and clear.  Also, it was priced less than the similar Curt brand and looks  just as nice if not nicer. I took out the stickers and the included Reese plug and replaced it with a Toyota plug for a cleaner and OEM look.  I'm planning to use it for my bike rack just in time for summer.  Very happy and will definitely recommend this 2&#34; hitch from Reese.
B002WC137I|5|I bought this for my 2005 Corvette.  If you have access to a car lift it is very easy to install.  We did have to cut the old muffler and exhaust pipe apart to get it out of the car, but that was easily accomplished with a reciprocating saw.<br /><br />The rumble at idle and with acceleration are great.  The exhaust is easy to hear in the car during normal driving with the windows up and the stereo down low, but gets rather loud during acceleration, drowning out the stereo.  If you like that sort of thing, you will enjoy this exhaust system very much.
B003HEZHM2|5|I have used this for two cars and am very happy with the results.  It makes seats, door panels and trim look new.
B001OMVCIC|4|I just installed these yesterday and am very happy with them so far.  The instructions were very easy to follow and it went as planned.  It is a bit difficult yo get the air bags into the springs, so I lined them up with dish soap and it made it much easier.  The air lines were easy to install as well.  I hooked up my travel trailer after and the truck did not sag at all, I have not towed other than down the street for a test run.
B00C3VRYG2|5|Very nice tail lights easy installation, and work great. Thanks for fast delivery.
B0065J3368|5|S***, i'd hate to have to go back to the time where I would guess the tire pressure by feeling my tires, or trying to get the tire pressure from the machine at the gas station.    This thing works friggin great, is all I need to say.
B004HCU77I|5|This kit has been awesome. I've already washed and waxed my car two times. The only extra item I personally chose to order was an additional Meguiar's application pad pack of two, however you could easily use everything provided and be satisfied.<br /><br />The ultimate wax included is a small container, but I think it would last at least a few waxes on a midsized car.<br />I'm very satisfied with the soap wash mix and included mitt. They do an incredible job cleaning the vehicle and preparing it for waxing. There is enough of the soap mix to last a long time, probably about 15 washes for me.<br /><br />The tire gel makes the tires look great, is easy to apply, and lasts a week or more depending on what your driving through.<br /><br />I recommend this kit to anyone who wants to make their car look fantastic, either to sell, or keep it looking new!<br />Just add a bucket and some water, and you're off to clean, shiny, and new!
B0086I9KMW|5|Perfect
B0041M9CMU|5|Correct part, easy bolt on replacement. Replaced both sides on our '02 Altima. Works with the anti-lock brakes, and reduced road noise substantially as with 140,000 miles on them, the original bearings were rough and noisy.
B006VFN9F6|5|great product
B0081HPGBW|5|Everything as advertised.
B004T3BI1O|4|Good value, the marine store had similar models at much higher price,  Easy to assemble and install on my pontoon boat. Boaters that want to swim can now easily get back on board.
B0059V1AYA|5|The jacket itself is great!! There's no earthly way to tell what size you got picked out is going to fit though/seems like every company<br />Makes they're own rules about sizes.....mine was a real tight fit but I'm losing weight slowly so the jackets a good investment probably easily worth 3 times the price on amazon/aim about 3 sizes from what you think you are up...that's my experience!! Thanks amazon!!
B000IY4AL8|5|Parts arrived as described.
B0051VQWVY|4|these shipped fast and are nice and bright on the bike.. worked perfect for the new trip whammy brake lights
B000IY614M|5|This fits perfectly on a D16Y8. Replaced a failed OEM hose after 188k miles. Hose is just a tad bit thicker than the OEM but is the same exactly bend and length.
B009DJYK2I|4|Almost a perfect fit. But not quite.
B0050OUWOU|2|I bought this vest a size larger than my normal size, as with most vests. It fit well & is made of good quality materials, but it is very square and makes me look &#34;manly&#34;, which is not what I was going for. It does not curve in as showed in the picture, it is purely straight up and down. It fit really good in the chest (I have a larger chest and a waist that curves in like most women), but went straight down, and is rather short, making me look like Aladdin. I even tried cinching it as tight as possible (the strings are made of junky material, so I have to be very careful as I did not want to break them), but I was still left looking like a square man.<br /><br />I took a chance ordering online (and not from my usual motorcycle accessory shop, which is online, but has much better products) but I am going to be returning this purchase. I want to look like a biker, not Aladdin.
B002H9DDY2|4|This piece was a great replacement for the original one that broke. Will find out it's durability as the time passes
B0067UDHUC|5|This is a direct oem replacement part.And even better,it includes the new plug assembly,not to many others offer this plug.Once again THANK YOU AMAZON.......
B00KY57XWO|5|Fit perfectly on my GMC Sierra truck.  My favorite colors are Red and Black so it was a win/win purchase.
B005SSVUVW|4|I loved this pair of seat covers specially the detailing on the owls! It makes the front seat of my expedition stand out!
B00603DSI2|5|Rugged Ridge offers a lot of accessories for your Jeep. I have taken my back seat out of my Wrangler and put this liner over the carpet. It will work if the seat is in also. Just have to cut a small area out for the seat attachments. Haven't done that yet, but will probably in the future. It really protects the cargo area from dirt and debris. Just a good preventative maintenance item.
B00K53KSTK|5|Great, fit perfectly!
B004IYZMUW|5|nice unit, fits and functions well.....recommend.
B008MCVA3E|5|best mats i could find anywhere. they fit my 2000 honda civic si perfectly.they look amazing i see no flaws.<br />i am 100% happy with my purchase
B008CFB3IS|2|I have a 2006 Dodge Durango and I ordered this rebar bumper reinforcement. One drawback to it is that there are four mounting studs on each bracket. My original equipment only has 3 mounting studs per bracket (and the frame only has 3 mounting holes per bracket). So I had to cut off one mounting stud from each bracket.
B0006IX7Y2|5|it does exactly as it is supposed to... great product, great price. We are full-time RVers... so we break down and set up every week and have moved at least 10 times since we bought this product, and it has held up great!
B0008F671S|5|Great buy very heavy duty and easy to mount&#62;
B000X25TTC|5|Fits very well.
B00GZC8AEA|5|good
B00F7BJL0C|5|I ordered this the other day because I just watched You Can (Not) Redo and really loved this scene, and realising there were figures for it I couldn't just let it be, I was excited when it came in and upon opening the box I found something I did not expect. A thank you note. Maybe I am just not accustomed to buying things online yet, or maybe I'm really silly, but the line on the bottom telling me to have a wonderful day was more than enough to make it happen. After putting it together and taking everything else out of the box, there was a good amount of bubble wrap left in there, I noticed something else, a paper crane. I'm too nervous to try origami myself, what if I ruin the paper? But I've always wanted a paper crane so I am very happy it was added to my box.<br /><br />The product is very nice, Kaworu and Shinji's figures can stand alone, or side by side very easily and I am very happy with my purchase. I hope to find more things in this shop that I like, because it's a happy surprise to me.
B001C5MEZ6|3|It will keep you warmer than you are without it, especially when it's windy. But, it has no way to create a seal with your skin. Hence, the cold gets in quickly, especially the lower part. It should have some type of elastic seal. There are better neck gaiters out there, and I would try a different one. This one will do for a short walk, or when driving.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I wasn't sure if this would work for my car, considering that I have a GPS mount on my windshield, but the sun shade is very flexible, and I would expect it to fit in most situations.  It's been in the upper 90s this week, and the sun shade has definitely made a difference.  No more burning hot steering wheel!
B0052FRPCO|2|Lasted 2.5 years and broke.  Now I need to replace it all over again.  Unfortunately, the only two options are this cheap replacement or a $150 OEM part.
B005NLQAHS|5|Finally one that's works with j1850 VPW protocol. The super mini elm327 and the vgate i bought did not read the most common gm vehicles. This one does.
B00ANZHG7C|5|When it comes to cleaning these things are very very good no more paper towels. I use them microfiber mop on my floor and it is fantastic but these things are even better. FANTASTIC!!!!!
B005CLQ3RQ|5|Worked perfect!!
B000W3ZEYW|5|Great exhaust!It has a beautiful deep tone (Does not sound ricey in any way!) It fits great on my 95 civic,I could feel the power increase,Its pretty loud,Skunk2 is a great company after buying this i will have a skunk2 exhaust on every project i get HIGHLY recommended this product.
B000IYPNC8|1|I have always heard good things about koyo radiators. I put one in a car in February of this year. The radiator is leaking coolant all the way across the top where the plastic meets medal.
B000EQU16I|5|Worked as intended
B000ZAN3EU|4|I am not wild about neoprene seat covers but my wife loves these. They seem a bit large but they do fit.
B0041CDPQO|5|The plug in I purchased works great I just wish there was some way to mount the end to my bars.
B00RSOLXFM|5|I used it first in the bedroom and found the air to fresh after about 8 hours. Not that the room smelled bad before but it did have a new fresh air smell.( A little humor) Then i put it in the truck and noticed a difference within a half an hour with the windows rolled up as it is still winter here.I don't know what the longevity is on this product but so far has proven itself very useful
B000E322WC|5|Works great
B006FR27P8|2|The quality isn't terrible but it didn't come with instructions and I couldn't find anything online. I ended up using my own mounting setup which wasn't great but works. They were cheap so I am using them till I can find something better. You will also need very wide bars if you want these to work on a sport bike.
B006A0OIE8|1|totally the wrong product for what I wanted and was described in print-does not fit any attmos pieces A waste of money- I feel it was a con
B00W2XFUZI|2|Rear visors does not fully fit. Also glues are not strong enough to hold them. One of them just flew away when I was driving in highway.
B002LRQDEW|5|Had tighter tolerances than my previous mirror. the mirror is more protected by the plastic also. The hardwear was better and it stays tighter. if I break this one, ill buy it again.
B0053HA8K2|1|The first time that I used this device, it dumped my bike when going around a curve. I dragged my bike 100 yards before I could stop. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
B000MWIHTC|1|Easy installation
B00T7GYDTC|5|Great light bar so far.  Mounted on the front bumper of my Jeep Wrangler and it really puts out the light.  However, you have to be realistic as it is only a 12&#34; light.  Would highly recommend this light and this brand.
B003V9UU66|4|met all my needs and expectations
B00BSF0DSK|4|just installed in trailer reading lamps, have not traveled with them yet.  no idea as to what the vibration of the moving trailer will do to the leds.  they seem solid when installed, also were brighter then original filament bulb
B00ACDP6YU|4|Works as described. Pretty accurate and very straighfoward. Downside is that you cannot turn it off and you cannot change the battery. It works flawlessly on my 4 stroke outboard. Giving it 4 stars as I was already aware of the downside but given the price vs other brand, it was worth it for me.
B001UCBUB0|5|Crazy good quality. Crazy cheap price. Crazy not to buy them.
B007LQPBX2|5|Fast shipping, worked great fit the car perfectly with no problems at all and they look great in the car. By the way these went into a 2012 Fit Sport.
B000C9R1D8|5|I needed a replacement so I bought the aftermarket from a local parts store.  What a mistake.  I went through 2 of them before deciding to go to this one.  They kept getting stuck.  This cap is just like the original and after all this time I have not had any problems at all.  Purchase with confidence.
B001KS25VS|5|perfect for my mini
B000BLMJMA|4|It woukd good and the install is easy... I just wish it was brighter!
B00LLJXK06|5|The colors and print look perfect. Great message! Sturdy, slightly flexible plastic. The top center covers some of my state's name, not a big deal.
B00629W08I|5|I use a bike for my main form of transportation. I have found eyeglass or helmet mirrors are the most effective. These mirrors are the best I have found so far.
B002JH3TP0|5|everything worked fine  no problems
B007X4TXAY|5|Great sticker and great company. On time and great quality. I highly suggest them.
B001LVVVAU|5|Love it
B004XNQLB2|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B000LNBLTK|4|The assortment of tools in this kit should help you get any job done. They just give off the sensation that they could snap easily under too much pressure.
B000BOKO4W|3|it doesn't do what it said it will do. lots of work to use this and still doesn't come out like it said it would do.
B00IU34TRY|5|Fits perfect . No problems. Love it
B000C5FQY8|5|Great price, identical to original, fit perfectly, came quickly, can't go wrong with genuine Motorcraft parts from Amazon.com.  If I have time, I always check Amazon.com for my car parts needs first.
B009FRG5XK|5|2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara is what I use this on. I read the reviews and am keeping an eye on the light. None so far but I will report back if I have a problem. Lots of money for a cap that might break in the near future.
B000G1567U|5|Works as expected.  Perfect fit, easy to install.  I really hope I don't have to replace it as often as the disposable ones.
B000UVQ60W|5|This is a beginner level install with results you notice immediately. The whistle resembles something like a supercharger and I'm thrilled with it. Power gains are minimal at best, mid range is where it seemed to gain but the real upgrade is fuel mileage, its no joke. This will definitely gain you 1.5 over your current mpg and even more if you've got a green toe which adds huge savings in the long run if your a daily driver like myself.
B000HRX1JS|1|I purchased this product on September 28, 2013 and the left access pocket has already torn away from the bag all across the top.  I only use this for a gym bag and already it is torn not even a month later?  Absolutely ridiculous.
B006P89JYO|5|Came quick. Although the amount of freedom felt when package was opened was almost overwhelming.
B000C1OWN8|5|Fits my honda prelude sh like a charm, no sound when braking and they have great stopping power when I tested. You can not go wrong with this brand.
B000G6NU96|3|Nice small air gauge easy to carry and easy to use. A little problem holding gauge waiting for gauge to read but at least it seems to be accurate !!
B001LHVOVK|4|Meet expectations of what I wanted and is working great no problems so far. Would recommend if looking for one at good price.
B0071TQ77S|4|I put these in my tail lights as running lights.  Just as bright as regular bulbs, I like them.  I hope they last a long time.
B000WO8GQE|5|The product was great, dumb ole me ordered the wrong part, but Amazon made the return quick, easy and painless!  However, I can say the part was well made and I replaced them with the same brand and they are excellent!  My old tailgate works as good as new if not better!
B0007ZDRVC|5|Yep, Dr Tranny's Instant Shudder Fix did the trick for my 2004 Grand Marquis. If you experience a feeling like you are going over rumble strips when the transmssion is changing gears, that is Shudder. I got it after a hard driving high speed weekend trip through the mountains. Nothing ever fails on these 2003-2011 Crown Victoria / Grand Marquis cars and I was surprised by the problem. I did some research. Don't change the transmission fluid, don't change the transmission filter. Just get a tube of this stuff. Cut the tip off this little tube, let the liquid flow into the transmission at the transmission filler tube under the hood and drive it around for a day to let it get through the transmission system. All the other positive reviews are right, this goo works great.
B000H90XDS|5|I hook it up to my antique car and the battery is charged all the time.  Thought it didn't work when I first bought it because it didn't charge the battery overnight.  Takes a while the first time but will keep it charged after that.  It was a bargain.
B000FQ1OUO|4|I had to go buy bolts to install them properly. The diameter was way too small. Also, on one of them I had to bend one of the guard ribs, it was way off compared to the other one and looked foolish. However they are made very well, with heavy gauge metal and look great ad well.
B003C1D0L0|1|Horrible. Looked great coming out of package. Used for two months before it was impossible to see through. Before giving up on it I washed it with paper towel and water and was able to easily remove all the chrome and was left with a clear shield.
B00192NCSU|2|Bought replacement power window for my 2003 trailblazer.  Installation was a breeze, parted worked great when i put it in.  Next day, started my car attempted to roll down the window and window did not respond.  No noise, no movement no signs of life at all.
B000EQTX5I|5|What can you say the car started and the last set I took out had over 100,000 miles on them.
B004HEE0VA|5|excellent  quality and design, performance, ready to install, no special tools required<br />i love it , its very easy to install
B000IY8OLU|5|NGK made the OEM spark plug wires on my 1991 Mazda miata, and since this isn't just a commuter car to me, NGK will be the only ignition equipment I install under the hood. Sure, you could go with whatever the parts store guys insist is &#34;OEM Equivalent&#34; but why bother, when it costs basically the same to get THE REAL THING from amazon?
B003YDY84Y|5|Needed a longer cable for a specific location where we camp often. Product was as described. By the way some reviews have talked about the locking ring not working. The ring worked as it came but I changed the ring out to another style I use with no problems at all.<br />if you need a longer cord, this is a good buy.
B007NPGR0C|5|Great for the price its a steal goes well with Willy G Them skulls look great comes with all hardward easy install in minutes quality product
B007JMTSTQ|4|Waterproof winch cover arrived in a timely manner and is as expected.  I put it on my 12,000 lb. Harbor Freight wi winch and it fits perfect. The quality is good for what I payed for the cover and I have had no issues with it staying on while I drive down the highway.<br /><br />I would recommend to family and friends.
B001HMJT8O|5|wanted to upgrade the exhaust in my jetta so i went with the brand i've used in the past and am still satisfied today. also used a magnaflow muffler with the 2\\"1/4 pipe from cat to muffler. good to go. if you know what you're doing then you already know its a quality cat, if you're looking for advice than take it from me that this is what your looking for.
B002N5W8Q4|1|This is the smallest piece of junk ever purchased. Batteries don't fit my husband took it apart and got the fan to work out of the case but couldn't get the batteries it fit.  Got one star because amazon didn't want it back when I requested a return. Kids can now use it as a science project. Not recommended.
B001QT9KO6|5|The dreaded leak seen on the driveway surely pissed me off. Looked forever to find the leak, used a flash light, put the guy up on some lifts and I still couldn't find it. It wasn't a huge leak but was losing quite a bit of fluid after the car sat for more than a day (leaked more as it sat). Popped this big guy into the coolant reservoir, drove it around for an hour and the leak disappeared! How wonderful it was to no longer see those puddles building up underneath the engine. It has been leak free for about a month and hope it continues to be. It was well worth the $13 I paid for it.<br /><br />Update: It is now June 26, 2012 and there is still no leak! What a great product.<br /><br />Update: It is now the first week of December, 2012. The leak came back. Found out it was just the water pump so changed it and everything is back to normal.
B000C2WEY6|5|Exactly what i was looking for. I have been trying to find one of these for a while. Just like the one that came on my truck.
B0009RUXMO|5|Works like a geninue product and way cheaper than anyone else
B0012ZITJQ|5|i gave this product 5 stars because it was a great gift. i don't know if the products themselves are good, but the person i bought it for loved it! the bottles are a good size so i feel it was a good value for the price.
B001O0AMNK|3|These legs nuts came packaged in a generic plastic bag. Each lug was separately packaged to prevent paint stripping. However when installing them the paint has already been stripped. Overall for the price $37 i can't complain but hoped for better.
B00ANQ5IJO|5|Great fit and great shipping
B005SUU2HS|5|Great tool, I gave  this tool to a friend and he is super happy, he used at his bike to sych carb.
B0028SGK2O|3|Works, a bit cheap, but they get the job done
B0009IK5VW|1|I over paid and took a month to arrive
B002MQCY7C|5|Install was a breeze on my HJC Symax 3 modular helmet.  With bigger arms, I've always had a hard time keep both arms bent up to my chin with my riding jackets on.  I usually have to take my jacket off, fiddle with the D-Rings, then put my jacket back on.  This kit is great, just set it and forget it.  When I want to ride, it clicks into place in a couple seconds, and i'm ready to go.  It also makes quick stops less of a hassle.  Even though, I like being able to flip the front of my helmet up when i want into a gas station, have to talk to somebody real quick, etc.
B0007O8S4O|4|OK to be honest it has been a WHILE since I bought a ( dare I say )  \\"quality\\" light, I have been running a set of 6\\" round 100 watt lights I got off the bay and was VERY happy with the output from them on my Jeep, just not happy with the RUSTING ALL THE TIME. Same thing goes for the \\"cheapo lights\\" I bought at local auto parts - good 100 & 130 watt outputs but the casings are rusting every week - mine get painted black usually after the second time they rust up.<br /><br />I bought these PRIMARILY because they are stainless, and 130 watt KC's. the last Daylighter I had ( wow that was back in the 80's )  I remember Daylighters being like an aircraft landing light 4 miles of light lol.<br /><br />These are bright (see pics) but definitely don't seem as bright as the old school KC's. I remember hooking that old light up on the roll bar in the center with four outer lights and the KC just blew them away -  one light literally turned night to day.<br /><br />These are bright but compared to the \\"bay\\" generic light not by much more ( see pic ), considering they cost $120 MORE I am still debating if they are worth it lol - I also purchased  the  KC light locks as anything with a KC name is a prime target for the crooks.
B000CQOIR8|3|fit so good . i thought i did something wrong so i took off and on three times . this was one of the best investments ever thanks.
B000AYVJCY|5|Love this helmet!  I wear it all the time and it is very comfortable and looks great. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B009IF1EIA|5|it fit my 2001 regal, bolted right to the window motor bracket and half the price at auto zone, first I looked the part up on auto zones web page to get the part number so I wouldn't order the wrong part number.
B004A34G94|5|A great Bargain and the same as the original . It was so easy to install and a much better deal than the local RV place wanted for the same thing.
B00PUY6FOQ|1|Had to remove it because reception was horrible.
B005FK7IZ0|4|They work perfectly.They fit properly on my Mitsubishi Galant 1999,but there is a problem with it.Basically what it is.Is that when I've installed it.Brakes were overheating.I was like ok thats ok for break in.Now it's 6 month later and nothing has changed they still overheat.I have no idea what to do...Calipers are in a perfect shape not seazed or anything.So basically the extra material which they have on the brake pads is too much.
B006WU4756|5|All sweet! Thank's
B00150T140|4|The real thing, not a knockoff.
B003NI8MS8|5|Great fit for my 2001 Acura CL,I will buy again
B00CIKH13O|5|My Son in law love it as a gift.
B00LW66IIE|5|These covers fit PERFECT.....Love them....
B000P0U04G|4|wish I had them when I started would have saved cleaning up a mess
B0068ODC66|5|After the 4th time through the washer my key-less entry bit the dust. Bought this and it works perfect just like the original remote. Very easy to program.
B0031BJMXQ|5|Great 4 wheeler accessory! Easy on and off. Holds lots of  valuables!! My husband and I have one!
B0012PL20E|5|Black, long, smooth. Pull your head out of the gutter, I'm describing a shock absorber!
B003G0KCCM|5|If you can buy the vehicle you should afford to buy this product. Can't say enough good things about these floor mats. No trimming and went in quickly. They will help with resale and keep the carpets looking brand new after  months of use so far. No fadding yet and very few noticable scratches and they are used rather hard. I think the black shows less signs of wear than the tan or gray. The tan ones came with our first vehicle (used suv) and they are 5 years old. Still work great but showing wear. Do not get armorall (slick) cleaner on these or you will be slipping and slideing for a while.
B000NJ1LY2|5|I'm 6'5&#34; and weigh 270 lbs.  I ordered the 3xl and it fits perfectly.  Very high quality construction, snaps, and leather.  Nicely priced, similar quality vests usually run well over a hundred dollars.  Order without reservation provided you get the size you need.  The leather cords on the side will allow you to let the vest out quite a bit if you need to.
B0055B3FXS|1|This is the worst! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!  Mine fell off Yes fell off!  Waste of $$$  You have been warned !
B000GZJ140|5|This is why I buy Yoshimura every time. There always the best performing pipe and sound amazing!!! I bought a 2005 gsxr 1000. Had a hotbodies pipe on it. The same week I knew that pipe had to go. This Yoshimura TRC pipe has this bike running like you would expect a gsxr 1000 to run. I couldn't be happier with this buy.
B00684TAYY|4|Omg I can't believe that this really worked and was easy to set up I went in YouTube and got it to work with no problem n it shipped real fast
B00KKCORPM|5|We have 2 white haired dogs who travel in the trunk all the time. I was sick of vacuuming every week. The weather tech cover keeps their hair contained. Only issue if you want to put the 3rd row seats you have to cut along the inserts with box cutter or scissors. Little tedious...
B00JYIT6WC|3|Cheap but functional
B000GKTYNI|5|It's cheaper then the racing coolants and does the job.  Don't be fooled by the expensive stuff.
B00120KDGI|5|My dealer generously threw on \\"free\\" mud flaps to go with my brand new 2012 Silverado. Fine for a work truck I guess but my $42,000 XLT deserved better.<br />I ordered these and quickly replaces the free advertisement mud flaps with these.<br />Oh, are they nice. The molded wrap around is a heck of a lot better then the flat old ones. Installation was a breeze and the look is phenomenal. Anybody want a set of \\"Berlin city\\" mud flaps. You can have them.
B00CNDZ1I8|5|Yep!
B005M2UVGE|5|Lover it!! Great shipping!!
B000NSC1AG|5|Well made right here in the USA, Oregon...
B0068C2P48|5|Won't help if a crash involves anything coming on top of the unit but protects it on all other surfaces and has rubber mounts.
B000F19X0W|5|exactly as I anticipated it would look and fit the dash like a glove.
B0076PKWXC|5|Great lights easy install wish it would have came with brackets but for the price it's a excellent buy !!
B0043OV0IA|4|good power, handy.
B001GH1PDW|5|this is wonderful fit very perfectly and very comfort in ride i have installed them on my Toyota Prado and i can say there is a big diffidence
B00B2ZCMAS|5|Excellet
B000CJOGX6|5|These made in the USA u-joints are the perfect fit for my 1988 Suzuki Samurai.  I'll bet they just forgot to put it on the vehicle list.  I bought one to try it out on the front drive shaft, fit perfect.  Bought another one for the rear drive shaft and will let ya know, but I'm sure it will fit.<br /><br />A word of warning:  Be sure and align the alignment marks on the spline after you clean it and put it back together.  A dot on the end of the spline and a deep spot on the outside of the u-joint housing just pass the boot.<br /><br />Thats why I need a new u-joint on the front of my rear drive shaft as the last person had the spline out of phase and it wiped out the front u-joint<br /><br />The shipper is awesome!!
B001LHVOVK|5|Works perfectly great item
B00JNEAQO4|1|not good did not fit
B00BITIV8U|5|Arrived within a week, and ended up being a better quality than the handle the car came with! My husband did have to remove the entire door to install the handle in our car, but he said it wasn't difficult. Just tedious. All around I am extremely satisfied.
B00480J4UK|5|After upgrading the headlights in my 2010 Prius to xenon HIDs, I felt that the actual high beams were no longer bright enough. What's worse is that the colors no longer matched. It was painfully clear that the OEM high beams were yellowish. These are a bright white color (no blue at all) that not only add a lot of visibility to night driving, but also make the car look a bit nicer.
B00C5SXSYA|5|Got this for a 2008 Jeep Commander Unlimited 5.7L Hemi.  Over-sized filter means more filter area and longer service life.  Running in conjunction with Royal Purple 5w-20 makes a smooth driving Jeep.,
B00480KPH6|5|After growing tired of replacing expensive Sylvanias over and over, I tried these headlights as an alternative.  I haven't done any side-by-side comparisons between the Philips and other brands, but I can say I'm very satisfied with the light output of the Philips.  It's been over 13 months since I've put these bulbs in my car, and they're still working great.<br /><br />Update December 2011: One of the bulbs finally burned out, but only after 21 months of daily driving.  I'd say that's a very acceptable lifespan.  When I noticed the burned out bulb, I did a quick field replacement with a Sylvania bulb.  Only then did I see a side-by-side comparison between the two.  The Sylvania is noticeably a little brighter against a garage door, but on the road, the difference is negligible.  Therefore these Phillips bulbs are, by far, the better buy.
B0009IK5PI|5|Works as promised -- no issue with slush/snow/ice yet.
B0085XNY0M|5|perfect product. exactly 2&#34; lift
B001AT1F6S|5|Extremely strong beam. High quality finish, love that it takes AAA batteries which you can get easily anywhere compared to the CR123A types, nice case and operation of the torch is really simple.
B0041CE1S0|5|Very roomy and able to carry a lot. Durable and the great design helps with finding the bag easily. Would definitely recommend.
B000C7TVPQ|2|The radiator over all was not bad but it wasn't a simple matter of slipping it in and it fit. We had to bend back the fan shroud to slid the radiator in and prevent scraping, which was quite a difficult task. Not only that but now that we've had to perform maintenance which required the radiator to be removed the fittings for the transmission cooling lines broke. They were made of cheap aluminum and were so flexible just trying to disconnect the tube to the transmission caused it to flex and snap off.
B001OMPJGS|5|2004 Wrangler, they look so much better than stock lights, much brighter, did not realize what I was missing in the PM<br />Easy upgrade, it is vented, so if you off road, you need to seal the vent to keep the water out, only problem is they do run pretty hot.
B000PL5VUS|5|Bought these for a 2002 Grand Caravan and found them far superior to OEM blades.  They conform to the windshield and work extremely well in snow and ice.  VERY easy to install and well designed.  I will buy these for my other car as well.
B006OSOJ5E|4|Part was well packed, and replacement went very well.  Do expect to remove some parts from the old one (I think the wire harness adn 1 light).
